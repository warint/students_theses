BIS Review 25/20011Laurence Meyer: Does money matter?Remarks by Mr Laurence H Meyer, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem, on the occasion of the 2001 Homer Jones Memorial Lecture, Washington University,St. Louis, Missouri, 28 March 2001.*   *   *It is always a pleasure to return to St. Louis and to Washington University and to see so many friendsand former colleagues. But it is a special pleasure to be here for this occasion, the Homer JonesLecture. Homer Jones was still active at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis when I arrived atWashington University in 1969, and his wife, Alice, was a faculty member in the economicsdepartment. I had the pleasure of getting to know both. Homer was special in many ways. He was, ofcourse, a leader in building the research department of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and inorienting it toward a monetarist perspective. But there was also the remarkable contrast of his strongconvictions and his gentle manner. It was a combination to both admire and emulate. I admit I mayhave been more successful in emulating the strong convictions than the gentle manner. But that onlymakes me admire Homer even more.I can remember vividly my first visit to St. Louis and Washington University in early 1969. I was agraduate student at MIT visiting the university in search of an appointment as an assistant professor ofeconomics. I was picked up at the airport and delivered to my hotel, in advance of my seminar at theuniversity the following day. When I walked into my hotel room, a small sign on a desk immediatelycaught my attention. It read: "Money matters." My first reaction was awe at the reach of the St. LouisFed. They take this monetarism bit pretty seriously, I thought. It turned out in fact to be an ad for alocal commercial bank, not for the St. Louis Fed. But the story about this incident provided a humorousopening to my seminar the next day. I was nervous, so getting the seminar off to a good start with anamusing story helped. It gave me momentum. And look where I ended up.So when I considered topics for the Homer Jones Lecture, I thought of monetarism and the role ofmoney. My mind quickly took me back to that incident and I took as my title, "Does Money Matter?"What I had in mind was an assessment of monetarism's role in shaping current thinking aboutmacroeconomic modeling and the conduct of monetary policy.I often start my papers working back from my conclusion. Monetarism is about money, but moneyplays no explicit role in today's consensus macro model, and it plays virtually no role in the conduct ofmonetary policy, at least in the United States. The conclusion appeared to be, therefore, thatmonetarism has had no influence on either macroeconomics or monetary policy. That conclusion wasa problem: I did not want to write that paper for the Homer Jones Lecture.I decided, therefore, to take a completely novel approach to this paper. I would postpone writing theconclusion until I had written the paper. So I invite you to share my journey in search of a conclusion. Iwill start by outlining the essential features of monetarism, set out my interpretation of today'sconsensus macro model, and interpret the role of monetarism in shaping this consensus. Whateverthe lasting influence of monetarism, this journey will still find no explicit role for money in theconsensus model and little or no explicit role in the current practice of monetary policy, at least in theUnited States. This leads me to explore whether current models and current practice undervalue therole of money.I.Money and monetarismIn my view, monetarism has several essential features. First and foremost, monetarism is thereincarnation of classical macroeconomics, with its focus on the long-run properties of the economy asopposed to short-run dynamics.Classical macroeconomics emphasized several key long-run properties of the economy, including theneutrality of money and the quantity theory of money. Neutrality holds if the equilibrium values of realvariables – including the level of output – are independent of the level of the money supply in the longrun. Superneutrality holds when real variables – including the rate of growth of output – areindependent of the rate of growth in the money supply in the long run. The quantity theory of moneyholds that prices move proportionately to changes in the money supply so that inflation is linked to
2BIS Review 25/2001money growth. Together, these propositions identify both what monetary policy can achieve and whatit cannot and therefore delineate the responsibilities of central banks. They mean that central bankshave no effect on the level or growth rate of output in the long run but do determine the rate of inflationin the long run.1Second, monetarism focuses less on the structure of the economy and short-run dynamics and moreon longer-run conclusions, such as the long-run relationship between money and output and moneyand inflation. This focus reflects, in part, a skepticism about our ability to understand or to adequatelyquantify the structural linkages and dynamics. For this reason, monetarists tend to prefer reduced-formequations or VARs to structural equations or structural econometric models and focus more on long-run results than short-run dynamics.Third, monetarists are skeptical of the ability to use monetary policy for short-run stabilization, despitethe fact that they believe short-run variations in money growth do affect aggregate demand and henceoutput. As a result, they favor rules, often passive rules, that focus on achieving a rate of moneygrowth consistent with price stability in the long run, with no adjustment to cushion short-runfluctuations in aggregate demand.2 This preference reflects again the uncertainty about the structureof the economy and about short-run dynamics and the long and variable lags in the response ofaggregate demand to changes in the money supply.There is an over-riding theme across these features of monetarism: They focus on the role of moneyand the conclusion that "money matters." Money matters – indeed it is just about all that matters – forinflation in the long run. Given the widespread commitment to price stability, monetarists believe thatcentral banks should therefore give appropriate attention to money growth in the conduct of monetarypolicy.II.The consensus macro model: monetarism without money?One way to judge the influence of monetarism is by the conformity of today's consensus macro modelwith monetarism's central features, as set out above.One of my favorite sayings about economists is, "Two economists, three opinions." That saying ismore true of macroeconomists than of microeconomists. For that reason defining a consensus macromodel has always been a challenge. But I believe there has been some convergence toward aconsensus in recent years. This consensus is typically expressed in terms of a simple three-equationdynamic model:3(1) Ygt = a Ygt-1 + b Et(Ygt+1) - c [Rt -Et(pt+1)] + xt(2) pt = d (Ygt) + w1 pt-1 + w2 Et(pt+1) + zt, w1 + w2 = 1(3) Rt = r* + Et(pt+1) + f Yg t-1 + g (pt-1 - pT),where Yg equals the output gap (the percentage point difference between actual and potential output),R equals nominal interest rate, r* equals equilibrium real interest rate, p equals inflation, and pT equalsinflation target, x and z are stochastic shocks, and all the coefficients are positive.The model includes an aggregate demand equation, a Phillips curve, and a monetary policy rule. Theaggregate demand equation, given by equation 1, is essentially a dynamic version of the old IS curve,in which the level of output (in this case the output gap) depends on the real interest rate. Thisspecification allows for effects of both lagged output and expectations about future output. The Phillipscurve, given by equation 2, relates the inflation rate to the output gap (measuring the balance betweensupply and demand in the output market) and to both past inflation and inflation expectations. Theeffect of past inflation captures the role of sticky prices, while inflation expectations are assumed to be                                                     1Superneutrality is more controversial than neutrality. Indeed, the fundamental justification for a price stability objective is thatinflation undermines the efficiency of the economy and perhaps distorts saving and investment choices. What is essential isthat monetary policy cannot raise the level or growth rate of output by increasing the rate of money growth.2Many monetarists came to believe that short-run variations in money growth had significant effects on real variables in theshort run. The important effects of variations in money growth for short-run economic activity were demonstrated inempirical research conducted at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, notably by Andersen and Jordan (1968) and byAndersen and Carlson (1970). But skepticism about the ability to harness this effect for use in stabilization policy remained.Still, as Hafer and Wheelock (2001) have noted, there was a temptation, not always resisted, to use the short-runrelationship to prescribe a monetarist strategy for stabilization policy.3See, for example, Fuhrer and Moore (1995), Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (1999), and McCallum (2000).
BIS Review 25/20013set, as in equation 1, according to rational expectations. The policy rule, equation 3, relates theinterest rate, viewed as the instrument of monetary policy, to the output gap and the differencebetween inflation and the central bank's inflation target. That is, policy is adjusted in response to thedeviations of output and inflation from their respective objectives – full employment and price stability.4There are at least three innovations in the consensus model compared with the IS-LM framework,perhaps yesterday's consensus model. First, the IS-LM model had two equations and three unknownsand therefore could be solved only by assuming that either the price level or the output level was fixed.Today's consensus model allows for both sticky prices in the short run and full price flexibility in thelong run by introducing the Phillips curve. In effect, the Phillips curve pins down the degree to whichprices are sticky in the short run, allowing scope for both short-run movements in actual output relativeto potential and for stabilization policy while providing a mechanism that ensures a transition to thelong-run classical equilibrium.Second, today's consensus model replaces the LM equation with a policy rule. The LM curveexpresses the equilibrium condition in the money market, the balance between the supply of and thedemand for money. Implicitly, the money supply is treated as the instrument of monetary policy. Thepolicy rule in today's consensus model specifies the way policymakers adjust the interest rate toeconomic developments. This specification has the advantage of more accurately capturing theprevailing operating procedure at central banks around the world, given that they, almost withoutexception, implement monetary policy by setting a target for some key interest rate. It also reflects amore modern view of "policy" as a systematic adjustment of the policy instrument or instruments toongoing economic developments rather than simply as an exogenous process, outside the model.Third, the model explicitly incorporates forward-looking elements in economic behavior and accountsfor the importance of expectations. In the eclectic form presented here, the model allows for bothforward-looking elements and lagged adjustment due, for example, to adjustment costs.The consensus model is widely used in teaching macroeconomics and in policy analysis, specificallyin evaluating the properties of alternative policy rules. Larger-scale macro models used for policyanalysis and forecasting typically have richer structures, including a more richly defined set ofmonetary policy channels. This set generally includes a range of interest rates and asset prices andthe exchange rate, but almost never a direct or independent role for money. This is true of the FRB-USmodel used by the staff at the Board of Governors for policy analysis and forecasting. That model hasa structure very much consistent with this simple consensus model in that its aggregate demand andinflation equations, for example, have the same mix of lagged adjustment and forward-lookingexpectations and its interest rate determination is anchored by a policy rule.So what is the influence of monetarism on today's consensus model? On the one hand, the model hasno apparent role for money. On the surface, therefore, today's consensus model appears to be a clearand definitive rejection of the "money matters" focus of monetarism. On the other hand, the classicalproperties I outlined hold in this model (at least if we redefine them in terms of "monetary policy" ratherthan the "money supply"). Monetary policy does not affect the level or growth rate of potential output,and inflation is determined by monetary policy in that it converges to a target set by the central bank inthe policy rule.My conclusion, therefore, is that we can still clearly see the influence of monetarism in the consensusmodel. Monetarism focused attention on the role of the central bank in determining inflation byemphasizing the relation between money and inflation. The consensus model may bypass money, butit has retained the key conclusion that central banks ultimately determine the inflation rate.The relation between money, output, and inflation is obviously beneath the surface of this model. Wecould bring it to the surface by simply appending yesterday's LM curve to today's consensus model.This provides a fourth equation and a fourth variable, the money supply. The LM curve, however, isnot part of the simultaneous structure of the expanded model. The first three equations determineoutput, interest rate, and inflation without calling upon the LM curve. All the LM curve does isdetermine the level of the nominal money supply consistent with solutions for output, prices, and the                                                     4The effect of supply and demand shocks on the evolution of real economic activity is not clear in this specification. In thesimple specification I have used, the effect of supply shocks is hidden in the measure of potential output, part of the outputgap variable, and in the shock term in the Phillips curve. The last several years have heightened appreciation that shocks tothe level of potential output (arising, for example, from changes in the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment) or tothe growth rate of potential output (arising from shocks to structural productivity growth) play an important role in shapingshort-run as well as long-run movements in real economic activity.
4BIS Review 25/2001interest rate. In effect, the LM curve identifies the amount of money that the central bank will find that ithas to supply when it follows the policy rule, given the shocks to the economy. So the money supplyhas become a less interesting, minor endogenous variable in the story.This approach is not, however, inconsistent with a stable empirical relation between money growthand other economic variables, specifically between money growth and inflation. In fact, if the moneydemand equation (underlying the LM curve) is stable, there will be a stable relationship betweenmoney and inflation in the long run.The expanded model also makes clear that there is nothing inconsistent with a stable long-runrelationship between money and inflation, as emphasized by monetarists, and the expectations-augmented Phillips curve, a mainstay in Keynesian-type structural models as well as a part of today'sconsensus macro model. The monetarist proposition is about an outcome, a result. This conclusionabout the long-run relationship between money and prices is implicit in the consensus model, providedthe money demand equation is stable. The consensus structural model is also about structure orprocess. It explains how monetary stimulus raises inflation.The consensus model remains consistent with a relationship between money growth and inflation, butit appears to downgrade the role of money. But does it shortchange the role of money? In a search foranswers, I will focus on monetary policy in Japan and on the differing role of money in the conduct ofmonetary policy by the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve.III.The monetization debate: Does the consensus model shortchange the role of money?In Japan, the policy interest rate was taken to zero and remains close to zero. Zero is the logical lowerbound for the nominal rate because, if the interest rate were negative, everyone would prefer to holdcash and there would be no demand for bonds. But even with a short-term policy rate nearly at zero,the Japanese economy remains weak, and a case can be made for additional monetary stimulus.However, according to the consensus model, once the policy rate is taken to zero, the central bankhas exhausted its ability to stimulate the economy.Monetarists, among others, reject this conclusion. They argue that Japan should embark on a strategyof monetization, or quantitative easing, and judge the stimulus of its policies in terms of the rate ofgrowth in the money supply, not by the level of its policy rate. The Bank of Japan has recently taken astep in the direction of such a monetization strategy.There are two paths to the conclusion that such a strategy will allow monetary policy to provideadditional stimulus, even once the policy rate is driven to zero. First, some monetarists argue thatmoney directly affects aggregate demand. That is, the IS curve in the consensus model is mispecifiedbecause it allows only for an interest-rate channel of influence and not for a direct effect of money onspending. Plug in the money supply as an additional determinant of aggregate demand and, presto,monetization works! Second, even if money does not directly affect aggregate demand, thetransmission mechanism is certainly more complicated than the simple IS curve specificationsuggests. Money could play a role in structural equations for aggregate demand, or in VARs, as aproxy for channels that may be difficult to quantify or were simply left out.Personally, I do not believe that there is a direct effect of money on aggregate demand. But I may bebiased. My view is based in part on my own research. I tested and rejected the hypothesis of such adirect effect in my dissertation. In my dissertation I also tested the proxy role hypothesis and rejectedit, too. But, the proxy role for money deserves further attention.5When leading monetarists, such as Milton Friedman, have discussed the transmission mechanism,they have described monetary policy as operating through a broad range of interest rates and assetprices.6 As I noted earlier, large-scale structural models also incorporate a much more detailedtreatment of monetary policy channels of monetary policy – including not only a range of after-tax real                                                     5Large-scale models allow for the well-known real balance effect. Increases in real money balances that raise the real valueof net worth operate through the wealth effect in such models. However, open market operations involve an exchange ofmoney for bonds and therefore do not directly alter household wealth. McCallum (2000) and Svensson (2001) discussconditions under which money could directly affect aggregate demand. Svensson summarizes the conditions as follows: "[A]direct money effect would arise if real balances entered the representative agent's utility function and this utility function wasnot additively separable in consumption and real balances but had a positive cross derivative." Svensson and McCallumagree that, for reasonable parameter values, this effect is likely to be so small that it can be disregarded.6Friedman and Meiselman (1963).
BIS Review 25/20015interest rates but also equity prices and the real exchange rate – compared with the single policy ratein the consensus model. The consensus model adequately summarizes this transmission mechanismwith a single policy rate under two assumptions: First, monetary policy operates by changing someshort-term interest rate; second, all other interest rates and asset prices are linked, directly orindirectly, to the policy rate through stable and predictable arbitrage relationships.Monetary policy might still have life left in it, even after the policy rate has been driven to zero, ifmonetary policy operations could somehow affect the spreads between the policy rate and otherinterest rates – longer-term rates and private rates – and its relationship to other asset prices, such asequity prices or exchange rates.In simple theoretical models, such an effect is possible as long as short-term government bonds arenot perfect substitutes for longer-term bonds, private bonds, equities, and foreign financial assets. Inthis case, open market operations in long-term government bonds could in principle lower the long-term government bond rate relative to the policy rate, with spillover effects on longer-term privaterates. Monetary policy in short-term private assets, such as commercial paper could not only lowerprivate rates relative to government rates but also allow the central bank to work around an ailingbanking system. Finally, open market operations involving foreign financial assets – effectivelyunsterilized intervention in the foreign exchange markets – could, in principle, affect exchange rates.However, there is really no substantive difference between sterilized and unsterilized operations whenthe short-term interest rate is already zero.One way in which open market operations in other assets might affect other rates or other asset priceswould be if there were relative asset-supply effects determining longer-term private rates andexchange rates. For example, if the relative supplies of short- and longer-term government bondsaffected their relative yields, open market purchases of long-term bonds could lower long-term ratesrelative to the already near-zero short-term rate. Whether or not the relative supply effects aresignificant is then an empirical question. The traditional answer has been that such effects, thoughpossible, are negligible and, effectively, not a useful part of monetary policy. And even if monetizationcould push long-term rates to zero, there is no guarantee that will provide enough stimulus, given theprevailing deflation. The real bond rate could still be too high.This proxy role for money could, in principle, cover other channels besides long-term government andprivate interest rates and asset prices – such as liquidity and credit effects – that might be activated byincreases in the money supply. In this case, even additional conventional operations – open marketoperations in Treasury bills – might stimulate aggregate demand, even if they could not further lowerthe short-term nominal interest rate. However, that affect does not seem very plausible. For example,would the increased liquidity of holding money versus short-term bills stimulate aggregate demand? Ifeconomic agents wanted the additional liquidity they could have acquired it with no holding cost byselling zero-interest-rate bills and acquiring cash. Why, when the central bank initiates this change,would it affect spending, if no interest rates or asset prices were affected?Bernanke and Gertler have emphasized a credit channel as part of the transmission mechanism.7 Butthis channel – though amplifying the effect of monetary policy – seems itself to require a change ininterest rates. For example, a decline in interest rates would, according to Bernanke and Gertler,reduce existing committed cash flows of borrowers and therefore make the borrower morecreditworthy. This, in turn, could result in lenders offering additional credit. However, if interest rates donot decline this channel is not activated.8Finally, the proxy role for money could include the effect of monetization on expectations. This channeldepends on the ability of policymakers to alter expectations about the course and effects of futurepolicy. That is, the policy effect does not derive from a higher money supply today but from aperceived commitment to a higher money stock in the future.Expectation effects could alter current long-term real interest rates in two ways. First, convincing thepublic that monetary policy will remain stimulative longer will lower expected future nominal short-terminterest rates and therefore longer-term nominal interest rates.9 Second, convincing the public thatmonetary policy will achieve a higher inflation rate in the future, at least on average, could lower                                                     7Bernanke and Gertler (1995).8Clouse et al. (2000).9I am assuming a standard expectations theory of the term structure of interest rates and constant risk premiums. Long-terminterest rates are, in this case, an average of current and expected future short-term interest rates.
6BIS Review 25/2001expected current longer-term real interest rates, reinforcing the effect on expected long-term interestrates of a perceived commitment to a given path for the nominal policy rate.These effects can be illustrated in terms of a simple model with two-period (non-overlapping) pricecontracts. The current and expected future one-period nominal interest rates determine the currentnominal interest rate on the two-period bond. Assume that the current one-period interest rate (thepolicy rate) has been driven to zero but the public expects a positive rate on the one-period bond nextperiod. If policymakers can convince the public that policymakers will drive the one-period rate to zeroin period two, the interest rate on the two-period bond will fall in the first period, stimulating aggregatedemand.The first channel thus operates by lowering the expected future nominal policy rate, thereby loweringcurrent longer-term nominal interest rates. Essentially, it tries to lower nominal rates further along theterm structure, once the short-term policy rate has been driven to zero. It depends on the credibility ofthe policy authorities to pre-commit to a more stimulative policy in the future – for example, to maintainthe zero rate policy for a longer period than is now anticipated.The second way in which expectations can affect current real long-term interest rates involves theeffect of policy on inflation expectations. In order for this effect to work, policymakers must firstconvince the public that policymakers will maintain a given path for the short-term nominal policy rate;thus the second effect builds upon and reinforces the first effect. The second effect, by convincing thepublic that inflation will be higher in the future, converts the perceived commitment to a given path forthe short-term nominal policy rate to a decline in future expected short-term real interest rates andhence in current expected longer-term real interest rates.Note that it is sufficient for policymakers to convince the public that inflation will be higher thanotherwise only for a while, not indefinitely. This is important, given that a promise to maintain inflationhigher indefinitely might be neither necessary nor credible. One way to activate the inflation-expectations effect to stimulate aggregate demand in the short run, without compromising the longer-run inflation objective, would be to implement a target price level. The central bank would promise, forexample, to target prices at a predetermined constant level, and would indicate in advance the periodover which it would attempt to return to the price-level target. If deflation follows, a price-level targetimplies that the central bank will target rising prices – or inflation – for a while in order to return theprice level to its target level. The longer deflation lasts, the higher or longer lasting the expected futureinflation. Once higher inflation restored the initial price level, the objective would again be price stabilityand, hence, zero inflation. A similar motivation underlies calls for the Bank of Japan to adopt aninflation-targeting strategy.10 That is, by announcing an explicit inflation target, the Bank of Japanmight raise expectations of future inflation and therefore lower real long-term interest rates today.On the one hand, simply undertaking monetization operations without effectively communicating theintention with respect to future policy might not be effective. On the other hand, simply announcing aninflation target without carrying out operations today that might support the objective also might not beeffective. However, doing both – carrying out monetization operations in support of an inflation target –could possibly activate the expectations effect.The relative supply effect is likely to be so small that it is not relevant to the conduct of monetary policyin normal periods. This channel, therefore, is perhaps only of interest when the nominal interest ratehas been driven to zero, when further policy stimulus is desired, and when the size of policyoperations could be much larger than in normal times. However, the expectations channel – the effectof expectations about future monetary policy on long-term real interest rates and hence on aggregatedemand today – is, I believe, an important part of the transmission mechanism both in normal periodsand in the more extreme circumstances.Despite uncertainties about the effectiveness of monetization operations, we may have to think moreseriously about them when the policy rate has been taken to zero and there is still a case for furthermonetary stimulus. The problem is that, if there is a possibility of providing stimulus throughmonetization, we are not likely to find it by experimenting with such operations at the margin,especially if the stimulus arises through relative supply effects. To have any promise of significantresults, such unconventional policy operations more likely would need to be implemented on a boldscale. Moving in this direction is understandably difficult when there is uncertainty about theeffectiveness of the approach.                                                     10See, for example, Krugman (1998).
BIS Review 25/20017A fuller consideration of this topic would require us to assess the costs of such operations and theways these costs balance against the cost of not pursuing this direction in a period of persistentdeflation.11 If the costs are low, there is little damage if the operations are ineffective. But I will not tryhere to reach a conclusion on the overall merits of monetization. My objective was to use the currentdebate about monetary policy in Japan to highlight channels of monetary policy and a possible role formonetary policy at the zero bound which are left out of the consensus model.Let me now sum up conclusions about the absence of any role for money in the consensus model.First, the consensus model incorporates a caricature of the consensus view of the determination ofoutput and inflation, including the transmission mechanism. In effect, it treats "the" interest rate as anindex of overall financial conditions, assuming that long-term interest rates, equity prices, and theexchange rate all move in a stable and predictable way with changes in the policy rate. To be sure,this is a considerable simplification, and some of the shortcomings become apparent when the policyrate is driven to the zero nominal bound.Second, though the consensus model has its shortcomings, the absence of money is not one of them– except perhaps for the zero nominal bound case. As just noted, the consensus model significantlyoversimplifies the transmission mechanism. It also oversimplifies the supply side of the economy –failing, in particular, to model the complex dynamics of the economy's response to an unexpectedacceleration in structural productivity growth.Third, in situations where the policy rate has been driven to the zero nominal bound – as is the case inJapan today – what the consensus model is missing – the proxy role for money – becomes the onlyremaining leverage for monetary policy. Interestingly, larger macro models do not do much bettereither, as they typically do not allow for relative asset-supply effects and often do not provideopportunity for the inflation-expectations effects that might be so important. In this case, money growthcould be a valuable indicator of the degree of current and intended future stimulus to be provided bymonetary policy.Fourth, understanding the ways in which monetary policy might still provide additional stimulus – oncethe nominal policy rate had been driven to zero – may also provide us with a richer understanding ofhow monetary policy works in normal times. In particular, the monetization debate highlights the rolethat expectations play – in both normal and more extreme circumstances – in the effect of monetarypolicy on aggregate demand. Indeed, it has become increasingly clear that monetary policy works notonly through decisions about the policy rate taken at each meeting but also by the expectations thatpolicymakers encourage – intentionally or otherwise – about expected future policy. The language inthe statement issued at the end of FOMC meetings and the statement about the balance of risks aswell as comments from FOMC members between meetings can affect those expectations. Thoseexpectations, in turn, have immediate effects on longer-term interest rates, on asset prices, and onreal exchange rates – channels of monetary policy that are not directly incorporated in the consensusmodel.IV.Money and monetary policy at the ECB and the Federal ReserveThe consensus model implies that monetary policy is conducted by setting a target for a policy interestrate, without any consideration given to the prevailing rate of money growth. Does such an operatingstrategy undervalue the usefulness of money in the conduct of monetary policy?This question takes on added interest because of two recent and seemingly contradictorydevelopments. The ECB, a new central bank, has a two-pillar strategy, one pillar being a referencevalue for money growth. The Federal Reserve, in sharp contrast, asked to be and was relieved of therequirement to report semiannually on its target ranges for the growth of monetary and creditaggregates. In this section, I discuss the evolution of money growth targets at the Federal Reserveand the role of the reference value for money growth at the ECB. In the following section, I discusshow a reference value for money growth might be set for the United States and whether or not such anapproach might be constructive.                                                     11See Fujiki et al. (2001) for an assessment of the potential benefits and risks associated with a monetization strategy inJapan.
8BIS Review 25/2001Money growth and the Federal ReserveUntil the late 1960s, money did not play a meaningful role in the formulation of monetary policy in theUnited States.12 By the end of that decade, however, intellectual inroads by proponents of monetarism– including important work at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis – and dissatisfaction with theinflationary outcomes of the policy procedures in place, led to consideration of greater emphasis onmoney in the conduct of monetary policy.The first conference of the well-known series by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, held in June1969, titled "Controlling Monetary Aggregates," was indicative of this trend. At the time, an FOMCsubcommittee was already investigating how the Committee could improve its control of the moneystock. The FOMC took a small step in January 1970, when the policy directive for the first time noted"the Committee's desire to see a modest growth in money and bank credit" as one of the factors to betaken into account in implementing monetary policy.The Fed was operating then, as now, essentially by setting a target for the federal funds rate. Butduring this period it began to set short-run targets for money growth – two-month targets set for eachintermeeting period calibrated to be consistent with its policy objectives. The federal funds rate wasthen set at a level that was estimated to be consistent with achieving the money-growth target. I wason leave from Washington University at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 1975-76 and wrotefrom time to time the periodic staff memo that set out the funds rate target estimated to be consistentwith the money-growth range. However, when money growth deviated from this short-run target, it wasmore likely that the money-growth target was reset than that the interest rate was adjusted. In addition,the target was rebased for each meeting, so that past errors were typically ignored.In 1975, reflecting in part the monetarist critique of monetary policymaking and in part disappointmentwith recent macroeconomic performance, the Congress passed a concurrent resolution encouragingthe Federal Reserve to set targets for the money supply. Following the passage of this resolution, theFOMC adopted for the first time annual target ranges for money growth and announced them publicly.The Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978 required the Fed to set, semiannually,monetary targets for calendar years and to explain any deviations from the targets.From 1979 to 1982, money-growth targets took on an even more central role in the conduct of policy.Policy was implemented during this period by estimating the total reserve growth necessary to meetthe money-growth target and by holding to the associated path for nonborrowed reserves. In theprocess, the federal funds rate was free to move to whatever level would be consistent with themoney-growth objective over time. Monetary policy was focused on steadily reducing inflation, andpolicymakers were less certain about what increase in nominal and real interest rates would berequired to achieve the objective of reducing inflation than they were about the money-inflationrelationship. Moreover, it served the interests of policymakers to emphasize that the markets, notpolicymakers, were controlling interest rates along the way.At the outset, the money-growth ranges were interpreted as intermediate objectives, with the ultimateobjective being to reduce inflation. The 1979 monetary policy report described the policy as "thegradual reduction of rates of increase of the monetary aggregates in order to curb inflation." The initialranges for money growth were high to reflect the prevailing inflation rate but were to be graduallylowered over time.Initially, growth targets were set for M1, M2, and bank credit, although the emphasis was on the M1measure. But after the downward shift in velocity for M1, associated with the introduction of nationwideNOW accounts and other innovations, the FOMC downplayed its M1 target in late 1982 and shiftedemphasis to M2 and M3.With deregulation and innovation making velocity less predictable, in late 1982 the FOMC also begana gradual return toward an interest-rate operating strategy. The monetary aggregate targets weredescribed as being "set with the aim of slowing the expansion of money over time to rates consistentwith the economy's productive potential at reasonably stable prices." Money-growth targets wereevolving toward a point when they would be consistent with the FOMC's price-stability objective.In 1995, the language describing the money-growth ranges changed in an important way. Up to thatpoint, the money-growth target ranges appeared to apply to the period immediately ahead and werebeing gradually adjusted to be consistent with a transition toward lower inflation. The money-growth                                                     12For a good discussion of the evolution of the role of money in monetary policy, see Meulendyke (1968).
BIS Review 25/20019ranges were re-interpreted at this time to apply not to the period immediately ahead but rather to someintermediate and hypothetical period when price stability would be achieved and the pattern of velocitywould be "normal." The purpose of the M2 growth rate range was "to serve as a benchmark for a rateof growth of M2 that would be expected under conditions of reasonable price stability and historicalvelocity behavior." The same language was used thereafter, until the Congress last year removed therequirement that money-growth ranges be reported to the Congress.There are two explanations for this change in 1995 in the interpretation of the money-growth ranges.First, the new approach reflected a reduced willingness of policymakers to adjust monetary policy inresponse to deviations of money growth relative to the target range. This reluctance reflected thediminished confidence of policymakers in the signal from such deviations as a result of the unexpectedjump in and continued volatility of velocity. Second, the new approach was better tuned to the lowerand more stable inflation rate by the mid-1990s. Previously, money-growth ranges had been graduallylowered to signal the intent to lower inflation and to be consistent with gradual decline in inflation. Thefixed range set in the mid-1990s was consistent with price stability, an objective now in reach.Money and the ECB two-pillar strategyThe Maastrich treaty identifies price stability as the overriding objective for the ECB. Like the Fed andother central banks, the ECB chooses to implement its policy by setting a target for a short-terminterest rate. But the ECB also gives a more prominent role to the money supply than the Fed doestoday.13The ECB has set out a two-pillar strategy for guiding its adjustment of interest rates in pursuit of pricestability.14 The first pillar is a reference value for money growth. The ECB sets a reference value for asingle monetary aggregate, the M3 definition that is essentially the same as the M2 definition for theUnited States. The ECB reference value is the rate of M3 growth consistent with achieving its inflationtarget over an intermediate term, based on estimates of trend growth in potential output and velocity.The second pillar considers the appropriate setting for the policy rate in terms of the wide range ofinformation available and the prospect for inflation over the medium term.The ECB rationale for the reference value for M3 is the long-run stable relationship between its rate ofgrowth and inflation. The reference value provides a second check for policymakers to ensure thatmonetary policy, set in terms of the ECB's policy rate and in consideration of pillar 2, is consistent withprice stability. The ECB is very explicit about the fact that, in light of the short-term volatility of velocity,short-run deviations of money growth from the reference value might provide little useful informationthat would help policymakers adjust the stance of monetary policy. But in light of the more stablelonger-term relationship, continued deviations would raise significant questions and should, at theleast, require a careful reassessment of whether the prevailing monetary policy is consistent with theinflation objective.The ECB uses the term "reference value" rather than a target to make clear that deviations from thereference value will not necessarily result in policy adjustments to encourage a return of money growthto the reference value. Each year the ECB updates its estimate for potential output growth and, ifnecessary, updates the reference value to ensure that it is lined up on the inflation target.V.A reference value for M2 for the United States?The ECB approach to the reference value for M3 is very close to the way in which the Fed was settingits benchmark range for M2 until the recent revision to the Federal Reserve Act. The major differencesare that the Fed was perhaps somewhat less transparent about how it derived the range for M2 anddid not update it regularly to maintain an estimated consistency with an unchanged trend inflation rateobjective. At any rate, the recent change in the Federal Reserve Act removed the requirement that theFederal Reserve report to the Congress on growth ranges for M2 and other money and creditaggregates. My final topic is whether setting a reference value for money growth would be constructivefor the FOMC and, if so, how to implement such an approach.                                                     13The Bank of Canada also assigns the monetary aggregates a more prominent role in the conduct of monetary policy.Freedman (2000) provides a summary of the role of the monetary aggregates at the Bank of Canada.14See Angeloni et al. (2000) for a thorough discussion of the role of the money-growth reference value in the overall policystrategy of the ECB.
10BIS Review 25/2001To move in this direction would have the advantage of allowing money growth once again to play arole as a failsafe, or second check, on the consistency of monetary policy with FOMC's medium-terminflation objective. On the other hand, moving in this direction would require other significant changesin the conduct of policy. The FOMC – presumably in consultation with the Congress – would have toestablish an explicit inflation target and would have to reveal its estimate of the rate of growth inpotential output. This direction would itself be even a more significant step than setting a referencevalue for money growth. An intermediate approach might be to set a reference value based on implicitassumptions about both the target inflation rate and the rate of growth of potential output – withoutexplicitly identifying either. This would be similar to how the benchmark range was set for M2 in thelast few years before the benchmark ranges for the monetary aggregates were abandoned.A money growth reference value and the consensus modelBut why would monitoring money growth be useful, as long as policymakers followed a disciplinedpolicy of adjusting their policy rate to ongoing economic developments, as reflected in the policy rule inthe consensus model? It is well known that holding nominal interest rates fixed in the face ofaggregate demand shocks can lead to monetary policy, in effect, reinforcing rather than damping suchshocks. The FOMC instructs the manager of the System Open Market Account to hit a given interestrate target. If upward pressure on rates arises, for example, from higher nominal income growth orhigher inflation expectations, the manager will automatically add reserves with open market operationsto prevent a rise in the funds rate above its target. Hence, absent a change in the stance of policy, apositive demand shock automatically leads to higher reserve growth and hence higher money growth,in effect reinforcing the demand shock. The faster money supply growth relative to some referencevalue, in this case, would alert policymakers to the possibility that the policy stance was no longerconsistent with its objectives. Policymakers would still have to evaluate whether the more-rapid moneygrowth reflected a shift in money demand or a shock to aggregate demand.However, the policy rule in the consensus model is designed to prevent precisely this type ofpersistent error in the response to shocks. If there is an aggregate demand shock, its effect onutilization rates and inflation will result in an adjustment of the policy rate over time that is consistentwith policymakers' objectives for output and inflation. In effect, the policy rule substitutes for thediscipline of a money growth target in the face of aggregate demand shocks.So what value would a reference value for money growth have if policy were in fact conducted in amanner consistent with the policy rule? First, the policy rule is an attempt to summarize the systematicresponses of policymakers. Policymakers do not, of course, commit to follow such a rule. So, havingan additional check on the consistency of policy with medium-term objectives could be useful whenpolicymakers choose not to adjust policy in line with the policy rule. Second, even if the rule wereadhered to, another check might be useful. In particular, the difficulty in implementing the policy rule inpractice makes a reference value for money growth valuable.If the policy rule were lined up precisely on the equilibrium real interest rate and if the output gap werecalibrated correctly relative to potential output, the benefits from monitoring money growth might belimited to its early signal of changes in output and inflation. But recent experience, along with theearlier experience of the 1970s, suggests that uncertainty about the real equilibrium interest rate andabout the level of potential output makes implementing the policy rule challenging. Just as model-based forecasters often look at forecasts from VARs, so policymakers under a policy rule might benefitfrom a second check provided by a money-growth reference value. This justification for a money-growth reference value seems consistent with monetarists' skepticism about structural models.An operational reference value for M2 growthLet me set out a possible approach to implementing a reference value for money growth at the FederalReserve. A simple point of departure is the famous quantity theory equation, M V = P Y, where M isthe money supply, V is velocity, P is the price level, and Y is the level of output. This can be rewritten,in terms of growth rates, as m + v = p + y, where lowercase letters are the growth rates of M, V, P, andY respectively. Rewriting the growth relationship as an equation for money growth,(4) m = p + y - v.To solve for the reference value for money growth, we need a definition of the money supply, a targetfor inflation, and estimates of the trend rate of growth in potential output and the trend in the growth ofvelocity.
BIS Review 25/2001 11I have implemented such a framework as part of a memo prepared by the staff for me in advance ofFOMC meetings. After discussion with the staff, it was agreed that M2 was a sensible choice, though acase could have been made for other aggregates. M2 has the virtue of being broad enough tointernalize many technological changes that would affect its composition, such as sweeps fromdemand deposit accounts to interest-bearing saving accounts, but also narrow enough to representassets principally used for transactions. In the past, there has been a preference for setting ranges formultiple aggregates, increasing the potential for both information and noise, but I have been focusingon M2.If this were being developed for the FOMC, the calibration of the reference value for M2 growth wouldneed to incorporate either the staff estimate of trend growth or, still more likely, an estimate derivedfrom a survey of FOMC members. For my calculation, I use my own estimate of the trend rate ofgrowth in potential output, with input from the staff. It is important that this estimate be updated at leastannually to incorporate the best judgment about the underlying trend. I am currently using3-1/2 percent to 4 percent.The next step is to specify the inflation target. This is a potential problem, because the FOMC has notset an explicit numerical inflation target. It might be more appropriate for the Congress, presumablywith input from the Fed, to set such a target given that the Congress is responsible for setting thebroad objectives for monetary policy. At any rate, the upside or downside of publicly reporting areference value is that the FOMC would have to be more explicit about its objectives.To calibrate my reference value, I provide the staff with my personal inflation target. For the chainGDP price measure, the appropriate choice in the equation of exchange, my inflation target is1-1/2 percent. I allow 1/2 percent for measurement error and add an additional 1 percentage point asa "cushion," in light of the potential deterioration of cyclical performance in economies operating atvery low inflation rates. This would be consistent with a 1-1/2 percent target for the personalconsumption expenditure measure of consumer prices and about a 2 percent target for the ConsumerPrice Index, based on recent experience with the differentials among these alternative measures ofinflation.Finally, we consider whether adjusting the M2 reference value for a systematic trend in V2 velocity isappropriate. Before the velocity shifts of the early 1990s, there seemed to be a long-standing, small,but positive, trend in V2. The pattern is no longer clear. Of course, the velocity shift in the early 1990swas, at least at the beginning, unexpected and unexplainable. For the reference value to beinformative, adjustments for shifts of velocity would be necessary, and the ability to detect such shiftsin "real time" is a potential problem. At this point, we assume that trend growth in V2 is zero.Bringing all the steps together, my resulting reference value for M2 growth is 5 percent to5-1/2 percent, the sum of my inflation target and my estimate for trend growth. Given the uncertaintyabout some of the inputs to the calculation, we might end up with a narrow range, as opposed to apoint.The next issue is how to effectively make use of the reference value. The purpose of the referencevalue, in my view, is not to read short-run deviations from it as signals of the need for adjustments inpolicy. The short-term variability in velocity makes the extraction of such a signal too difficult. Instead,the purpose of the reference value is to provide a check that might help avoid significant andpersistent errors that undermine the Fed's medium-term inflation objective.The traditional way the Federal Reserve presented its benchmarks for money growth in the past wasthe "cone" chart. Chart 1 shows the very last such chart for M2 published by the Federal Reserve inFebruary 2000.15 The base of the cone is the fourth quarter of the previous year – in this case, thefourth quarter of 1998. The cone shows the range of M2 paths that would be consistent with thechosen range over the coming year. The flatter dashed line from the base shows the path for M2 thatwould be consistent with growth at the lower end of the benchmark range; the steeper dashed lineshows the path of M2 that would be consistent with growth at the upper end of the range. The actualpath of M2 is shown by the solid line. This approach, in my view, focuses too much attention on short-run deviations in money from its target path and fails to take into account the pattern of money growthbefore the previous fourth quarter.Perhaps a better way of using the reference value – focusing on its implications for medium-terminflation – would be to compare it with a longer-run average growth rate for M2. Chart 2, for example,                                                     15This chart was published in the Federal Reserve Board's February 2000 Monetary Policy Report to the Congress.
12 BIS Review 25/2001compares excess money growth relative to the reference value – using CBO's estimates for potentialGDP growth – with the deviation of inflation from its target. To focus on more persistent deviations inmoney growth and in consideration of the lags in the effect of money growth on inflation, the chartuses a two-year growth rate for M2, lagged two years, to compute the excess of money growth relativeto its reference value. This is plotted against the excess of the rate of inflation over the previous fourquarters relative to the inflation target.Chart 3 plots the two-year and the three-month money growth rates. This combination offers theopportunity to review shorter-term movements in money supply in the context of early warnings ofmore persistent deviations.A cost-benefit analysis of an M2 reference value for the United StatesShould the FOMC reinstate benchmark growth ranges for one or more monetary aggregates? First,this would be most useful if the committee were prepared to align such a reference value with anintermediate-term inflation target and a consensus on the growth of potential output and if it wereprepared to update the reference value or range as its estimate of potential growth changed tomaintain consistency with the inflation target. This takes us potentially to the broader question ofwhether the Fed should have an explicit inflation target. That will have to be the subject of anotherpaper.The second pre-condition for reinstating a money-growth reference value or range would be anevaluation of whether such a reference value would have improved or undermined the conduct ofmonetary policy over history. Are there, for example, historical episodes where it appears thatresponding to deviations of money growth from its reference value would have improved the conductof monetary policy? Are there also episodes where such a response encouraged or would haveencouraged inappropriate adjustments in policy?Chart 2 points to some episodes that might be useful in assessing the costs and benefits ofimplementing a reference value for M2 growth in the United States. It suggests that M2 growth relativeto its reference value seems to have been a good leading indicator of inflation in the 1960s and 1970s.Perhaps the best example of an episode in which money growth provided information that might havehelped to avoid a policy mistake was the late 1960s through the early 1970s. During the late 1960s,utilization rates were increasing to historically high levels, and inflation was trending upward. Therewas political resistance to using fiscal restraint to slow the economy. Monetary policy ended upaccommodating, and indeed reinforcing, the high level of aggregate demand, setting the stage for asignificant rise in inflation in advance of the sharp rise in oil prices in late 1973 and 1974. And chart 2shows that money growth, though quite volatile, generally remained above its reference value duringthis period, signaling the inflation risks in the prevailing stance of monetary policy.16But chart 3 also flashes some caution about the usefulness of a reference value, at least after theearly 1980s and especially after the early 1990s. The chart allows us to identify several episodes inwhich money growth gave potentially misleading signals about inflation risks. The question in thesecases is whether policymakers had enough specialized knowledge about financial innovations ordisturbances to make a timely judgment that the information about money growth should bediscounted.17The surge in M2 growth in 1983, for example, was associated largely with regulatory changes allowingfor the introduction of money market deposit accounts. At the time, policymakers were well aware ofthe potential for such effects of deregulation and hence were not "misled" by the money growthdevelopments.Another example is the fall in excess M2 growth in the early 1990s, which did not portend as steep afall in inflation. Instead, it was the result of the well-known rise in V2 at the time. Reviewing the                                                     16Interestingly, if we had constructed chart 2 based on M1 rather than M2, it would have been less clear that money growthwas inconsistent with maintaining low inflation. In the early 1970s, however, the Federal Reserve had a single money supplymeasure, corresponding most closely to M1 today. The Federal Reserve discussions of the monetary aggregates at thattime sometimes referred to "adjusted" measures of the money supply that included, for example, time deposits andtherefore corresponded to what we now call M2. Milton Friedman at this time was focusing on this broader M2-typemeasure. At any rate, the different signals from narrower and broader measures in the early 1970s highlight the value ofmonitoring growth rates for a number of different definitions of the money supply, as the FOMC routinely did during theperiod it was setting benchmarks for the growth of the monetary aggregates.17Orphanides and Porter (2001) address precisely this issue.
BIS Review 25/200113discussions in the Bluebook – now part of the public record – policymakers apparently caught on tothis shift within a year or two.More recently, the uptick in M2 growth in 1998 seems to have been associated, in part, with the runupin equity prices, which raised household wealth relative to income and, as consequence, inducedhouseholds to rebalance their portfolios. Here again, policymakers seem to have caught on quickly.Money growth accelerated to a rate above 10 percent in the first quarter of this year. The recent jumpin money growth is evident in chart 3 where I have plotted the three-month and two-year growth ratesfor M2 along with the reference value. There is, in general, too much noise, in my view, in the three-month rate to make it useful for monitoring the monetary aggregates. But this episode does provide anopportunity to take note of a variety of financial developments and special factors that affect moneygrowth in the short run.Six factors appear to have contributed to the upsurge in M2 growth in the first quarter. First, the policyeasings narrowed the opportunity cost of holding M2 and thereby raised the demand for M2. Second,the yield curve, while no longer inverted, is still relatively flat, giving investors little incentive to holdlonger maturity assets. Third, stock market volatility is elevated, making the liquidity and safety ofmoney more attractive. Fourth, individuals apparently built up M2 balances to a greater extent than inearlier years to make January tax payments. Fifth, though these balances typically run off in February,higher refunds than allowed for by seasonal factors apparently offset the drag from tax payments.Sixth, mortgage refinancings have boosted M2 growth, as funds accumulate in transactions balancesbefore being remitted to investors. Some or all of these effects can be quantified, though withconsiderable margin of error. At any rate, this is the type of analysis that needs to be undertaken tointerpret very short-run deviations of money growth from the reference value.This discussion perhaps only scratches the surface of the more thorough analysis that would berequired to reach a definitive conclusion about the costs and benefits of a reference value. Still, itleaves me with both a recognition of the potential value of such a reference value and an appreciationof the challenge associated with wisely using the information about deviations of money growth fromthe reference value.Let me now sum up my conclusions about the usefulness of a reference value for money growth forthe United States. First, I would not elevate the reference value to a second pillar, on a par with theeclectic approach of adjusting interest rates to changing economic conditions, as captured in eitherpillar two for the ECB or the policy rule in the consensus model. This would overemphasize theimportance of the reference value in the conduct of monetary policy and thereby ultimately confuse themarkets as they assess the role of money growth in the conduct of monetary policy.Second, the purpose of a reference value for money growth is not to identify money growth as thepolicy instrument. It is not. Nor is it to identify money growth as an intermediate target for monetarypolicy. It is not. The purpose of the reference value is to allow money growth to serve as a potentiallyuseful information variable – a potential signal of inconsistency between prevailing policy and themedium-term inflation objective. That is, persistent deviations of money growth from the referencevalue might influence monetary policy by raising questions about the consistency of policy with itsobjectives and thereby encouraging a reassessment of that policy.Third, money growth is an imperfect information variable, and as a result, deviations of money growthfrom its reference value have to be carefully evaluated before a judgment is made that policy isinconsistent with the medium-term inflation objective.Finally, given the ability of central banks to identify and understand financial market innovations anddisturbances, they are in a good position to extract the benefits of the reference value without beingmisled by the short-run variability and occasional structural breaks in velocity.VI.ConclusionMonetarism has had a profound influence on prevailing views about what monetary policy is capableof achieving and what monetary policy cannot do. It has helped to forge a consensus that centralbanks are responsible for preventing sustained inflation, and central banks have generally acceptedthat responsibility. Monetarism has not, however, had as great an influence in terms of elevating oreven maintaining the role accorded to money in either macroeconomic modeling or monetary policy.Nevertheless, sometimes the pendulum swings too far in one direction or another, only to be corrected
14BIS Review 25/2001later. It may be that we have discounted the role of money in macro modeling and monetary policymore than is justified.I reach three other conclusions from my journey. First, I believe we have more to learn about the rolethat monetary policy can play once the policy rate is driven to zero. This issue is important today inJapan. But given the relatively low inflation rates around the world, especially among industrialeconomies and therefore, on average, relatively low nominal interest rates, it is a subject of interest toa wider audience. Second, some of what we can learn from the debate about monetization in Japanmay also enrich our understanding of how monetary policy works in normal times. Third, I believemonitoring money growth has value, even for central banks that follow a disciplined strategy ofadjusting their policy rate to ongoing economic developments. The value may be particularly importantat the extremes – during periods of very high inflation, as in the late 1970s and early 1980s in theUnited States, and when the policy rate is driven to zero in deflationary episodes, as is the case inJapan today.*      *      *ReferencesAndersen, L.C., and K.M.

BIS Review 24/20011YV Reddy: Financial sector reforms: an updateSpeech by Dr YV Reddy, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the Annual GeneralMeeting of the Indian Banks’ Association and the Banks’ Sports Board held in Mumbai, 15 March2001.*      *      *Mr. Kohli, Mr. Krishnamurthy and friends,I am happy to be here again in this gathering of friends in the banking community on the occasion ofthe annual general meeting of the Indian Banks’ Association and Bankers’ Sports Board. I feel that it ismore an occasion to conduct focussed business and celebrate rather than one to deliberate on policyissues. Yet as per tradition, I believe that there has to be an address by the chief guest. As a centralbanker, one always has to seriously consider market expectations and sometimes respond positively,even if somewhat unpredictably!The vision of the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) is stated to be "to work proactively for the growth of ahealthy, professional and forward looking banking and financial services industry, in a mannerconsistent with public good". The critical words are: ‘proactively’ and ‘public good’ and it is in this lightthat Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has consistently interacted with IBA. I would like to place on record,on behalf of RBI, and on my own behalf, the impressive achievements of IBA during the past one yearand also the spirit of active cooperation extended by IBA in the whole process of reform of the financialsector. In particular, RBI had the benefit of IBA’s advice on several regulatory reforms and also in thework of the Regulations Review Authority. The RBI is always with you, "proactively" in the cause of"public good". While talking of serving "public", I am reminded of what our Professor in the thenNational Academy of Administration told us, the civil service probationers on training, 37 years ago. Hesaid that civil servants are public servants and that they should serve the public, and added that civilservants should remember that public are those who are not in civil service! Often, in many of ourpublic systems, and perhaps in all large organisations, lot of attention is given to house keeping andstaff welfare often overlooking the broader purpose for which the organisation itself exists.Of course, in a competitive environment that is evolving in the financial sector, banks and otherfinancial intermediaries are compelled to place the cost and quality of delivery of services at theforefront. This is a healthy development, in which the RBI, Government of India and members of IBAhave a stake. In this spirit, I will recall and share with you important issues that have been addressedby each of the three stakeholders in the recent past. Of course, the narration is illustrative and notexhaustive and covers the last couple of years.Reserve Bank of IndiaFirst, the status of pursuit of medium term objective of reducing preemptions through both CRR andSLR. SLR has been brought down to the statutory minimum. Progress in reduction in CRR continuesto be closely related to the pace of reduction in fiscal deficit, monetary developments vis-à-vis growthin real output, and uncertainties in forex markets. On all these fronts, greater comfort in the past couldhave helped more rapid reduction in CRR, to achieve the medium term objective. In a structural sense,RBI has since progressed in the pursuit of the objective viz. proposal to amend the law relating topreemptions to give flexibility to RBI to bring the CRR and SLR even below 3 per cent and 25 per cent,as and when rendered possible.In a procedural sense, significant progress has been made in the prescribed manner of calculatingand maintaining the reserve requirements.The medium term objective of reducing pre-emptions and imparting a greater flexibility andsimplification of procedures continues to be at the top of the RBI’s agenda for reform. In pursuing thisobjective, the RBI keeps in view not only the balance sheets of the banks but also the need to movetowards universal banking, and diversifying financial intermediation which is heavily concentrated nowin banks rather than non-banks. Reduction in refinance window and introduction of LiquidityAdjustment Facility have provided greater flexibility in this regard, and further progress in these twoareas is bound to ensure lesser recourse to preemptions in the conduct of monetary policy.
2BIS Review 24/2001Second, on interest rates, the reform objectives in terms of greater deregulation and rationalisation ofsmall savings rates etc. have been achieved to a significant degree. Further progress in deregulationcontinues to depend on some stability in inflationary expectations, which in turn is dependent oncredibility of price-stability. The emphasis in future has to be to impart greater flexibility to interest rateregimes, in an environment of reasonable price-stability and a rational tax-regime. A rational tax-regime in the context of an appropriate interest regime should factor in several elements viz. treatmentof interest-income vis-à-vis dividend income and of contractual savings vis-à-vis marketable debt-instruments. The statement of Finance Minister in the latest budget speech that an Expert Committeewill be appointed to provide recommendations on the issue of better system for determination of theinterest rates governing Provident Funds and Small Savings is welcome. It is hoped that the ExpertCommittee would address broader issues such as tax-regimes affecting all forms of savings,especially the possible distortions between debt and equity instruments. However, interest rateflexibility should not be taken to mean a continuous downward movement in interest rates. In fact, thereference in the Economic Advisory Council Report to stable real rates of interest does imply thatdepending on the inflation rates, the nominal interest rates would move up and down. Furthermore, itis necessary for banks to appreciate the need for reduction in their interest-spreads. Cost of debt-funds to investors can come down, without hurting the saver, the goose that lays golden eggs, onlyand only as the interest-spreads of banking sector comes down further.Third, the issues of prudential requirements including those relating to weak banks, capital adequacyetc. Here, the public sector banks continue to be on a different footing from private sector banks andapproaches for reform do vary. In any case, impressive progress has been made in imparting asupervisory environment conducive to enhancing efficiency while maintaining stability of the system.The banking system of India has shown remarkable resilience in the face of several challenges andchanges in external environment. In the medium term perspective, the main challenge will be tosubscribe to the proposed New Basel Capital Accord meant to replace the existing 1988 CapitalAccord. The new Accord is likely to be finalised by the end of 2001 and mandated for adoption by2004. It should be clear to all concerned that the new Accord is likely to be more complex and morebinding, warranting early and vigorous preparatory work by both banks and RBI.Fourth, the issue of competition between banks and between banks and non-banks, and the relatedissue of a level playing field. The RBI’s policy framework in regard to approach to universal bankinghas already been spelt out. An approach to reform of urban cooperative banks and rural cooperativeshas been drawn up with the recommendations of the Madhava Rao Committee and the JagdishCapoor Committee. There are significant legal and institutional changes that need to be addressed toensure further progress in imparting competition without serious systemic implications, includingensuring availability of adequate credit to rural areas and agriculture. In fact, in the recent past, therehas been a fast growth in urban banks and perhaps we should focus on the cooperative banksegment, which should get activated to serve the rural areas.Fifth, improvements in transparency, disclosure standards as also accounting standards to attain thebest international practices. Since 1998, there have been dramatic developments in this sphere,especially in codifying the international practices and assessing the domestic standards. RBI has putout for discussion, several reports of Advisory Groups on a variety of Standards and Codes, and aroad map for bringing about changes is bound to evolve out of these reports. Of particular interest toIBA are the reports on (1) Transparency in Monetary and Financial Policies, (2) Payments andSettlement System, (3) Banking Supervision, and (4) Bankruptcy Laws. These are already in thepublic domain through RBI’s website.Sixth, on credit delivery systems several procedural initiatives have been taken. The two major areasthat need immediate attention to ensure credit delivery are : the fast growing services sector and thecritical ‘peoples sector’ viz. agriculture on which a large part of our population depends.Seventh, improvements in financial markets. Over the last three years, impressive growth can beobserved in all the three segments of financial markets that are of direct concern to the RBI viz.money, government securities and forex. The markets have grown in size, depth, instruments andparticipants while imparting both efficiency and stability to the system. The next landmark developmentwould be the operation of Clearing Corporation, an organisation being promoted by several banks. Asuccessful operation of the Clearing Corporation would inter alia help quicker forex settlement,enlargement of repo market and retailing of government securities market. The Finance Minister in hisbudget speech has set a clear timetable in this regard.
BIS Review 24/20013There are some developments in the financial sector, which had not been flagged a few years ago buthave received attention recently. First, changes in Deposit Insurance that have been proposed by RBIto government. Second, establishment of a Regulations Review Authority to review proceduralrequirements. As IBA is aware, Master Circulars have replaced hundreds of earlier circulars and thesewill be updated annually. Third, setting up of Credit Information Bureau in which some members of IBAhad taken initiative. Fourth, banks’ foray into insurance business, which has been carefully crafted.Fifth, the extremely complex task of bringing an almost totally unregulated non-banking financialcompanies sector into a system of focussed regulation of those which accept public deposits. Sixth,technological upgradation, which has several dimensions. These include computerisation in RBI andprojects for use of banks and financial institutions mainly in the areas of payment and settlement aswell as public debt office. RBI also closely monitors upgradation of technology in banks. Eighth, and arelated measure under implementation is RBI’s Central Database Management System, which willbecome a pioneering project among emerging countries. Ninth, there has been an increasing recourseto auditors as a supervisory resource from RBI. Finally, to monitor developments in financial marketsand take prompt actions a Financial Markets Committee (FMC) has been constituted within the RBIwhich meets at least once a day and often several times during periods of excess activity in thefinancial markets. The FMC provides crucial inputs in assessment of short-term liquidity and operationof Liquidity Adjustment Facility. FMC also helps in designing of development of financial markets.Thus, RBI has not only focussed on a medium term agenda for financial sector reform outlined earlierbut has refined and reoriented the agenda from time to time, as warranted by developments.Government of IndiaThree broad areas were identified as critical for reform viz. fiscal deficit, legislative changes andstructural issues affecting public sector banks. Undoubtedly, Government has devoted some attentionin regard to all the three areas, and the measures taken are well known. Yet, it will be interesting torecall the relevant budget pronouncements.The Budget for 1999-2000 concentrated on reform of the banking sector i.e. Debt Recovery Tribunals,restructuring of weak banks, Settlement Advisory Committees, and tax deductibility for provisionsmade by banks. The reform of capital markets focussed on UTI and mutual funds but of interest tofinancial markets was abolition of Stamp Duty on transfer of debt instruments within the depositorymode.The budget for 2000-2001 carried forward reform on public sector banking by announcing intention fora more diversified ownership of public sector banks, establishment of Financial RestructuringAuthority, debt recovery, etc. Of particular interest are announcements relating to establishment of aCredit Information Bureau and possible legislative amendments to accord greater operational flexibilityto the RBI. Most important of all was the intention to bring about a Fiscal Responsibility Act.The canvass gets further enlarged beyond public sector banks and fiscal management to developmentof debt markets and interest rate flexibility in the budget for 2001-02. No doubt, in all the budgets thereis progressive liberalisation of capital account.In brief, the budgets over the last three years have contained larger and wider reference to reforms inthe financial sector. The canvass is spreading from banks to financial markets. During the period, theregulatory jurisdiction of RBI was fine tuned and clarified through amendments to Securities ContractRegulations Act, and enactment of Foreign Exchange Management Act. While these are some of theseveral governmental initiatives, significant changes in legal and institutional framework are necessaryfor further progress in reform of financial sector.BanksElaborating on issues related to banks, in this gathering would certainly be superfluous. Suffice it tosay that there has been noticeable progress in respect of all the four issues flagged before viz. internalcontrol systems, placement and work practices, flexibility in hiring people and use of technology inbanks. However, there is a long way for public sector banks to traverse from current industry-wiseapproaches to bank-wise autonomy to enhance efficiency and profitability. It may be worthwhile tochart a roadmap for genuine autonomy for public sector banks consistent with principles of goodcorporate governance.
4BIS Review 24/2001ConclusionIn brief, a notable part of agenda for reform has been completed and in the process, some items not inthe original medium-term agenda became necessary for reform.Currently, the focus is rightly shifting to legislation, markets, technology and beyond banks to non-banks.It is also evident that reforms can succeed only and only if coordinated efforts are made by RBI,Government of India and banks, themselves.It must, however, be recognized that key to financial sector reform is banking reform; key to bankingreform is public sector banking reform; and key to public sector banking sector reform is Government’sinitiative.Finally, you would appreciate that, by and large, we in RBI try to be aware of what is desirable and weare implementing whatever is feasible.Before concluding, I must mention that the tasks ahead of you listed by the IBA are appropriate,complex, and urgent. These are broadly divided into four areas viz. human resources management,technology, structure of banking, and sound banking. The Banks’ Sports Board, a relatively recentinstitution has already impressive achievements to its credit and is bound to advance the course ofnational sports in the coming year also.I have great pleasure in wishing you all the best on this happy occasion.Thanking you all again!
BIS Review 23/20011Alan Greenspan: The challenge of measuring and modeling a dynamiceconomyRemarks by Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem, delivered at the Washington Economic Policy Conference of the National Association forBusiness Economics, in Washington DC on 27 March 2001. *   *   *I am pleased to have this opportunity to address an issue of considerable importance to both businesseconomists and policymakers--that is, the challenge of measuring and modeling our dynamiceconomy. Moreover, I would like to raise the issue of how much of our finite resources should bedirected to measuring and how much to modeling.Business economics endeavors to understand the structure of an economy - how it works and, aboveall, how to forecast it. It is a bedeviling job because the future, at root, cannot be foretold. The best wecan do is to construct probabilistic models that can inform the decisions of business executives and, ofcourse, economic policymakers who - of necessity - will be making their decisions armed withincomplete information.For a while in the 1960s, we were increasingly mesmerized by the possibilities of econometric modelsas a crystal ball. However, history was not entirely kind to this endeavor. For one thing, especiallyagainst the backdrop of the inflation of the following decade, it soon became apparent that ourtheories of the macroeconomy were woefully inadequate. For another, even leaving aside theshortcomings of our theory, we soon learned that the economic structure did not hold still long enoughto capture its key relationships. Its changing structure frustrated efforts to isolate a reasonably fixedset of coefficients. In turn, the absence of fixed coefficients undermined the usefulness of the model asa basis for projecting the future.Econometricians recognized many of these difficulties, and so developed a vast and elegant literaturein support of this research program, covering a spectrum of topics ranging from maximum-likelihood-estimation techniques to tests for coefficient stability to diagnostics for detecting undesirable propertiesof the errors of these equations. The creativity that was applied to this effort is all the more impressivebecause it took place in the context of a computing environment that was, by modern standards, trulyprimitive.But in time it became increasingly clear that, for all their theoretical advantages, these sophisticatedmodels did not reliably outperform a number of simple and far less costly reduced-form models, fromthe money supply models that appeared to work well for a while during the 1970s, to astructural vectorautoregression models based on a handful of lagged variables that are still employed today.To be sure, the large econometric models have been refined, incorporating the fruits of latertheoretical developments, including perhaps most importantly the insight that monetary policy couldnot permanently influence the level of the unemployment rate. Moreover, a larger role was given to arange of financial and expectational variables that earlier practitioners steeped in orthodox Keynesianincome determination tended to downgrade. Liquidity preference functions, to be sure, were includedeven in the early versions of these large-scale models as necessary building blocks for determiningthe equilibrium level of interest rates and income. But, overall, financial sector modeling was primitive.Indeed, only modest progress has been made in this area since the Federal Reserve began toproduce our own flow of funds accounts in 1955.A further, and perhaps more profound, challenge to the underlying validity of this style of modeling isthe possibility that, whereas standard models of the real economy determine a unique level of income,the financial system appears to be capable of reaching myriad equilibria. In addition, the fundamentalforces that determine which of these equilibria will be selected may themselves be inherentlyunpredictable.We have built large-scale models of the United States and global economies at the Federal Reserve.While recognizing their limitations, we do find them useful in research and analysis. But the experienceof the last 40 years underscores a fundamental dilemma of business economics. Should we endeavorto continue to refine our techniques of deriving maximum information from an existing body of data?Or should we find ways to augment our data library to gain better insight into how our economy is
2BIS Review 23/2001functioning? Obviously, we should do both, but I suspect greater payoffs will come from more datathan from more technique.Certainly, statistical systems in the United States, both public and private, are world class and, indeed,in many respects set the world standard. But given the rapidly changing economic structure, one couldreadily argue that more statistical resources need to be applied to understanding the complexities ofthe newer technologies that confront analysts.These newer technologies and the structure of output they have created have surfaced a set ofdefinitional problems that - although evident in a world of steel, fabrics, and grains - were never on thecutting edge of analysis. I refer, of course, to the age-old problem of defining what we mean by a unitof output and, by extension, what we mean by price. The dollar value of sales or GDP depends, ofcourse, on the specific accounting rules chosen. And while value in that context is uniquely defined,the split between volume change and price change is always approximate.In decades past, we struggled about what we meant by output - and hence price - nonetheless anaverage price of hot rolled steel sheet and a corresponding total tonnage was precise enough for mostanalytic needs. By the same token, tons of steel per work hour in a rolling mill yielded roughapproximations of underlying productivity for most purposes.Output per hour in an economy dominated by such goods, or even services, for which the definition ofa typical unit of output was reasonably unambiguous, was a meaningful and relatively robust statistic.Our data systems in the early post-World War II years were by and large adequate to the task.But over time, and particularly during the last decade or two, an ever-increasing share of GDP hasreflected the value of ideas more than material substance or manual labor input. This ongoingdevelopment is imposing significant stress on our statistical systems. We know, presumably uniquely,the dollar value of a software application. But when comparing software-application values over time,how much of the change is volume and how much is price? The answer, in principle, requiresjudgments about very fundamental issues in measurement: What are the underlying determinants ofconsumer value preference, and how does this good or service contribute to that preference, takingaccount of all the other goods and services being consumed? Problems that were always latent indefining steel prices and quantities but rarely rose to this level of significance are threatening toseriously challenge our measurement systems in an age of the microprocessor, fiber optics, and thelaser.These latent problems have emerged in full view in the pricing of medical services. Perhaps theinherent complexity of this undertaking is most clearly revealed by posing the question, what do wemean by a standardized unit of medical output? Is it the procedure, the treatment, or the outcome?What does the fee charged for the bundle of services associated with cataract or arthroscopic surgeryrepresent? How does one value the benefits to the patient of shorter hospital stays, more comfortablerecoveries, and better physical outcomes? Clearly, the unadjusted fee for a single medical proceduredoes not adequately represent its "price."The price indexes for medical services used to be constructed by pricing a variety of inputs - forexample, a night in the hospital, or an hour of a physician's time. A few years ago, the Bureau of LaborStatistics began moving toward pricing the treatment paths of particular diagnoses, the better tocapture changes in the mix of inputs used to treat a given disease. For example, many surgicalprocedures that used to require an overnight stay in a hospital now can be performed on an outpatientbasis, and the producer price index and consumer price index are now better able to measure theprice decline associated with that change. Interestingly, when such techniques are applied toindividual medical procedures they appear almost without exception to indicate falling prices at leastsince the mid-1980s. This has raised significant questions as to whether our current measures ofoverall medical service price inflation are capturing the appropriate degree of productivity advanceevident in medicine.Indeed, the level of real gross product per hour for medical services embodied in our overallproductivity measures declined between 1990 and 1999 (the last year for which data are available).This is implausible and raises obvious questions of the validity of the price deflators currentlyemployed. Thus, while progress is visible, enormous measurement challenges remain in measuringprices of medical services.But there are deeper issues as well, associated with the valuation of a consumer's time. Clearly theshorter stay of a cataract patient is of value to that patient. In other words, today's techniques allow thesurgeon to deliver more consumer value per hour of operating time, other things being equal. A full
BIS Review 23/20013measure of the output of the medical sector would take account of this reduction in recovery time andattribute it to the medical sector.While many issues of measurement arise in the context of services, even the measurement of somegoods prices presents considerable challenges. High-technology goods are a case in point. Academicresearch in this area dates to the mid-1960s, but its application in the measurement of real outputgained prominence with the introduction of hedonic price indexes for computers and peripherals by theBureau of Economic Analysis in 1985. More recently, the efforts undertaken by statistical agencieshave intensified, spurred by the accelerated pace of technological innovation, which has yielded anever-expanding range of new products and product variants, as well as by the rising share of thesegoods in our economic value added.Thus, much progress has been made by the BEA, Census, and the BLS, with which I am sure you arefamiliar. This morning, I should like to alert you to some of the research in these areas coming fromthe Federal Reserve. Much of our work in this regard has been focused on improving our publishedstatistics on industrial production.Our staff's multiyear work in this area began in 1998 with the development of new measures of thedomestic output of semiconductors. Next, we revised our procedures for estimating the production ofcomputers, and more recently we have introduced new series for an important component of theoutput of the communications equipment industry - local area networking (LAN) equipment, whichprovides the infrastructure critical to expanding the productive uses of information technology.In total, these high-tech goods--semiconductors, computers, and LAN equipment - currently representless than 8 percent of total manufacturing output. However, their production, as we measure it, rose atan average annual rate of around 50 percent in the second half of the 1990s, and, taken together, theycontributed two-thirds of the increase in manufacturing output between 1995 and 2000. Indeed, U.S.production of semiconductors in 1996 eclipsed motor vehicle assemblies as the largest four-digitmanufacturing industry in nominal value-added terms.The characteristics of these goods present the range of complexities that one faces in measuringquality-adjusted prices. First, many are wholly new products: For example, switches--the largest singlesegment of LAN hardware--did not enter the market until 1993. And even "older" high-tech products,such as computers, are now bundled together in ways that offer an enormous variety of combinationsof characteristics related to speed, memory, networking capability, and graphics capability, to mentionjust a few. For all of these goods, product cycles are truncated by rapid innovation. For instance, in1995, 10 megabit-per-second Ethernet switches dominated that market; last year, the two mostpopular switches operated at rates of 100 and 1,000 megabits per second. Product lives forsemiconductors and computers can be even shorter; some computer models have remained on themarket for only a couple of months.In such an environment, the availability of detailed micro-level data describing the attributes of thesegoods is crucial. One means of defining the unit of output is to unbundle the characteristics of ahigh-tech product and to price each of them separately. This so-called "hedonic" technique - nowapplied by the BEA to items that account for 18 percent of GDP--is one approach.1 In our work at theFederal Reserve, we have developed hedonic price indexes for network routers and switches using, inthe case of the former, data from product catalogs and, in the case of the latter, privately producedreports evaluating the performance of the products.However, hedonics are by no means a panacea. Most important, the measured characteristics may beacting only as proxies for the qualities of the services that buyers ultimately value. This, again, raisesthe difficult issue of the appropriate scope for value measurement and poses the question of whetherthe correct approach may be to move toward directly pricing the services we obtain from ourinformation processing systems rather than pricing separately the individual hardware componentsand the software.The Federal Reserve staff has found that, when detailed data are available on prices and onquantities, we can produce results that are comparable to those based on hedonics, using theconceptually simpler "matched model" approach.2 Indeed, we have taken this approach in constructing                                                     1 J. Steven Landefeld and Bruce T. Grimm, "A Note on the Impact of Hedonics and Computers on Real GDP," Survey ofCurrent Business (December 2000).2 Ana Aizcorbe, Carol Corrado, and Mark Doms, "Constructing Price and Quantity Indexes for High Technology Goods,"Industrial Output Section, Division of Research and Statistics, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, July26, 2000.
4BIS Review 23/2001quantity and price indexes for several high-tech items. In the case of semiconductors, we relied ondata from three private vendors for information on nearly 100 unique microprocessors, more than 200types of memory chips, and more than 80 other chips. We also acquired nominal sales and unit valuedata for about 1,100 distinct computer models.Neither hedonic nor matched-model techniques are sufficient to deal with the introduction of whollynew products that differ fundamentally in their characteristics from their predecessors. This willcontinue to be one of our major ongoing challenges.I am encouraged by the progress that economists and economic statisticians have been making todate in tackling the daunting task of measuring real output and prices in a rapidly changing economy.The challenge that lies ahead is, indeed, large, and to meet it will require the support of the businessand academic communities to supply the information and to help develop the tools that our statisticalagencies require.The information revolution, itself, will also surely play an important role. For example, high-techinformation systems might some day allow statistical agencies to tap into a great many economictransactions on a basis close to real time. More generally, I am certain that the possibilities forcreatively harnessing technology for the improvement of economic measurement are much broader inscope - although, as in many other areas of endeavor, the precise directions those advances will takeare difficult to predict. If we had the appropriate database, of course, who knows?
2BIS Review 23/2001Stephen Grenville: The Australian economyNotes for a talk by Stephen Grenville, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to ABNAMRO Australia Day Conference, held in Tokyo on 23 March 2001.*   *   *After nine years of excellent growth, the Australian national accounts recorded a fall in the Decemberquarter. I want to put this in context, saying something about what happened and what it might meanfor the future. Australia's record of growth in the 1990s was not a fluke or coincidence - it was a resultof good fundamentals: that has not changed, and so our prospects are still good.What happened?With the benefit of hindsight, the fall in the December quarter might be seen this way:• in the first half of the year, there was an upsurge in residential construction, with a very substantial"pull forward" of work to avoid the GST. This "pull forward", mechanically, left a big hole in thesecond half of the year;• in a low inflation world - where producers pass on price increases only with some trepidation - thethreefold sources of pressure on prices (GST, exchange rate and oil) squeezed cash-flows andprofits. When this is combined with the disruption and general choler associated with theintroduction of the new tax regime, small and medium business confidence took a hit,• policy settings operated in an environment where cost-push price pressures were very strong.Let me say a bit more about each of these aspects - the cause of the GDP fall; the short-termtemporary shocks which the economy experienced in the second half of 2000; and the stance ofpolicy.(a) The construction sectorIt may seem improbable that a sector accounting for only 5 per cent of the economy should bulk solarge in this story. So I will have to ask your patience while I give the detail.Residential construction was, even without the GST, reaching the mature phase of its usual cycle asthe economy entered 2000. Such was the frenzy to get construction done before the GST, thatavoiding the tax became an end in itself: people were paying more than 10 per cent extra in order toattempt to complete work ahead of a 10 per cent tax. We heard few complaints from the constructionsector, but many stories of seven-day working weeks and very significant pressures on constructioncontract prices, as builders attempted to ration the demands on their capacity. It was to be expected -indeed it was inevitable - that this frenzy had to end in the second half of the year, with the reversalcoinciding with what was probably the natural inflection-point of the building cycle. This conjuncturegave rise to the sharpest quarterly fall in housing activity ever recorded in the Australian statistics (and
BIS Review 23/20013the largest half-yearly fall too - by a large margin). Overall, the September quarter was hard toevaluate, because of the effect of the Olympics - where sports-crazed fans added to demand byspending their money on getting to the Games, and subtracted from it by staying at home to watch onTV. If we take out dwellings and a crude adjustment for the Olympics, we note that the remaining 95per cent of the economy was growing at a rate of a little under 4 per cent through 2000 (in fact, a littlefaster in the second half than in the first).You might say that the profile of residential construction should have been predicted (and in its broadoutline was certainly foreseen). What was not foreseen was, first, the size of this fall and, second, thedegree of confidence-sapping annoyance with the administration of the GST. The basic point here isclear: without the "tail" of the construction sector wagging the dog of GDP, any slowdown would havebeen moderate, thus continuing the economic performance of the 1990s. (b) Cost pressuresBusiness confidence, particularly that of small businesses, was falling well before the GDP figureswere made public. Part of this was clearly related to the decline in the housing sector and part todifficulties which small business was having in adapting to the administration of the GST. But, byJanuary 2001, there was another piece of data pointing to an additional factor. Paradoxically, it wasthe unexpectedly good performance of the CPI in the December quarter. The second half of the yearhad seen three strong cost-push inflationary pressures - the GST adding 10 per cent to many prices;an exchange rate which had fallen 15 per cent over the first ten months of 2000; and a worldpetroleum price which was 87 per cent higher (in terms of Australian dollars) than eighteen monthsearlier. The cost-push pressures from oil and the exchange rate were showing quite clearly inproducer prices, with input prices for manufacturing rising by almost 20 per cent during the calendaryear. Faced with these cost pressures, it looks as though many producers (particularly inmanufacturing) found it difficult or impossible to pass on these price increases quickly, particularly inan environment where low inflation was well established, competition was vigorous and there was afair bit of "moral suasion". Quantifying this price squeeze is quite difficult, and assessing its role in theslowdown more difficult still, because the starting point of profits was so strong. And, of course, therewere some sectors (notably exports) where profits were substantially boosted by the lower exchangerate. But there is little doubt that some businesses felt squeezed, and this had a general dampeningeffect on their animal spirits.(c) Policy settingIt is hard to argue that the downturn was caused by tight macro-policy settings. The GST wasaccompanied by a reduction in income tax which was designed to be larger than the GST effect - i.e.there was over-compensation for the GST. While the budget continued to show a surplus, it was asurplus smaller than the previous year, which in macro-policy terms is expansionary. Official interestrates were raised by 150 basis points between November 1999 and August 2000, starting from a lowpoint established during the Asian economic crisis. Not only is it hard to believe that monetary policy isanything like that powerful (particularly as the last of the increases - in August - had so little time to
4BIS Review 23/2001have effect), but the proximate cause of the sharp slowing is clearly found elsewhere. This is not toclaim that monetary policy has no effect on the economy - I am hardly going to do that. But it is toassert that - with lending rates lower (in nominal and real terms) at their recent peak than at the lowpoint of the mid 1990s and with demand for credit still strong at these interest rates - the setting ofmonetary policy cannot be seen as a principal actor.Could the economy have successfully negotiated the period of robust growth, and rising inflation, inthe first half of 2000, in the face of strong downward pressure on the exchange rate, with interest ratesmaintained at 43/4 per cent? That setting would, of course, have been well below the United Statesand we would have been the only country in the developed world not to raise interest rates. The policyenvironment in the second half of 2000 was no easier. Among the three price shocks (GST, exchangerate and oil prices), only the last was a pure textbook "supply-side" shock. But, together, they hadmany of the same characteristics - cost-push pressures on prices. As it became clear, with the CPIresult in January, that these cost pressures were well contained, policy responded quickly and half theincrease has been reversed.Why was it unexpected?One answer would be to acknowledge the imprecision of forecasts - one of the few certainties offorecasting is that outcomes will differ from forecasts. After a lifetime of observing the economy, asage concluded that "nothing is certain; anything is possible; and everything depends on everythingelse". And of course this is part of the story. But a powerful element in this story is simply that theeconomic fundamentals were (and are) so good, that it is still, even now, hard to accept that aneconomy without imbalances, which has capacity to grow further, and with accommodative policysettings should change direction so suddenly.Contrast the state of the economy in 2000 with the history of post-WWII cycles. The grand, ifdepressing, tradition was that Australian expansions came to a halt either because they ran into anexternal constraint (in the pre-1984 world, a current account crisis), or because there was awages/inflation break-out. Policy could not offset these imbalances in a subtle or gentle way, so stronguse of the policy levers was often also "present at the scene of the crime". Hence the characterisationof policy as "stop/go". How different was the world of 2000: an improving external position (improving,uncharacteristically, despite good growth); inflation well contained both currently and in prospect(reflected in bond yields, where the $A bond yield has remained just a few tenths of a per cent higherthan the US$ bond); wages growing at a moderate pace; a budget continuing in surplus butnevertheless able to provide offset to the GST and overall macro stimulus. Moreover, the economyitself was in good shape. Fifteen years of reform (on tariffs, privatisation, labour market, competitionand policy framework) had produced productivity growth during the nine-year expansion of the 1990sbetter, even, than the much-vaunted US performance. Productivity brought with it the virtuous circle ofstrong profits and non-inflationary real wage increases: there were none of the factor-shareimbalances that hobbled growth in the 1970s.One further point is worth making.
BIS Review 23/20015The main criticism of the Australian economy during 2000 was that we were an "Old" economy,unfavourably contrasting with the "New" economy populated by companies which worked Click toexclusively in the ethereal world of cyberspace. A view larger procession of foreign businessluminaries visited Australia last year (curiously, those who came extolling the virtues of the virtualeconomy still found old-fashioned enjoyment in watching the Olympics in the flesh) to promote theircompanies, advising us to ignore ourcomparative advantage by following theirexample. We argued that the application ofthe new technology was where theproductivity benefits would lie, and thatAustralia was on the forefront in exploitingthese - and we had the runs on the boardto prove it.But this was lost in the paeans of praiseand thunderous applause for the stars ofthe cyberworld. How a year of collapsingNASDAQ can change perceptions! AsWarren Buffett has observed: "nothingsedates rationality like large doses ofeffortless money", but eventually realityreturns.The productivity-enhanced OldEconomy is looking rather better (would wewant to be competing with Korea and Taiwan to produce computer chips, whose price is falling evenfaster than the NASDAQ?). It was Buffett who reminded us all, several years ago, that being "firstmover" in a vast and exciting new industry was not a guarantee of success or profits: history recordsthe low survivorship among the pioneer firms in automobiles and aircraft. This is not to deny theenormous benefits of the new technology - just to observe that in history it has been the users of thetechnology, rather than the producers, who have benefited most. Just as Buffett's Berkshire Hathawayhas returned to favour following several years in the wilderness (having recently bought into suchunfashionable industries as boots, brick-making, carpet-manufacture and insulation), so too the tide ofopinion may turn on Australia's product mix.Despite the longevity of the expansion, the imbalances which normally characterise the mature phaseof the cycle are not present in Australia. I can make this point more vividly by contrasting theAustralian position with that of the United States, where there is a renewed interest in the "trade cycle"analysis which, in the immediate post-WWII decades, dominated short-term economic commentary. Itscharacteristics were:• an inventory cycle, where there was over-production during the upswing to meet growing inventoryneeds, followed by an exacerbation of the downturn as inventories adjusted in the oppositedirection;• an investment boom which uses up all the best investment opportunities and whose euphoriadrives investment into marginally profitable projects;• related to this, funding (particularly equity finance) which had been liberally given in the earlyphase of the cycle dries up as the financial sector comes to recognise the degree of over-commitment and attempts to compensate (or over-compensate) for this;• asset prices, driven up by over-optimism about profit potential, spill over into investment decisions;• households, buoyed by rising asset prices and the general euphoria, run down their savings,leaving them vulnerable to a sudden change in confidence.All this jerky dynamic seems very relevant to America, and inapplicable to Australia. Let's contrast thecyclical position in the two countries.First and foremost is the contrast between the share markets. With no NASDAQ bubble, the Australianequity market has continued to increase steadily throughout the period, and is currently still close to itspeak, contrasting to, say, the Wilshire which is nearly 30 per cent below. Australia has no stories of14-year-old boy-millionaires who ramped their chosen shares via a chat-room canard: nor, moresubstantively, of entrepreneurs with backwards-facing baseball caps attracting serious funding on thepromise of a rapid "cash-burn". So we didn't get the same degree of distorted investment decisionsand ephemeral wealth-driven consumption.
6BIS Review 23/2001Business fixed investment expanded rapidly inAmerica during the 1990s, to well above itshistorical average. Investment in informationtechnology and communications equipmentsurged, with capacity to produce this equipmentexpanding by 50 per cent in the past year alone.In contrast, in Australia business investment hastrended upwards during much of the 1990s, butin recent years has fallen back a little, to remainaround its long-term average. There is in nosense a problem of over-investment. Slow butsteady wins the race. Similarly, Australianhousehold saving has not followed the Americanexample into negative territory.The US financial sector is showing all the signsof concern about rising risks and lowering profitexpectations in the business sector.Spreads between yields on US Treasury securities and corporate bonds have widened noticeably. Thedata on IPOs shows that it became increasingly difficult during the year to get these away.Commercial banks became more cautious in their lending, particularly after the large amounts theyhad directed to Telecom companies. By contrast, in Australia there has been no noticeable wideningof risk spreads in the corporate bond market over the past year, and credit has been easily availablefrom intermediaries, with no reports of significant changes in banks' lending attitudes. The financialsector itself is in good shape.One of the more interesting contrasts is withthe exchange rate. The normal cyclicalresponse of exchange rates is to strengthen inthe face of economic expansion. So it was notsurprising to see the strength of the US dollarover recent years - only that it has continuedto strengthen in the face of a growingperception of a likely slowing. Given that theevidence of the early 1980s pointed to a two-year lag between exchange rates and theireffect on activity in the United States, anexchange rate well above its average of thepast decade would not seem to provide muchprotection in the face of a slowing. TheAustralian dollar, in contrast, has been low inreal effective terms, providing a usefulbuffering in the face of a slower worldeconomy, as was demonstrated during the 1998 Asian economic crisis.Looking aheadJust as the events of the second half of last year look clearer in hindsight, we doubtless have more tolearn about this period, and may well need to add to our current interpretation. But if this analysis iscorrect, then the events so far would point to a relatively short-lived slowing. As the temporary once-offeffects of GST, construction "pull forward", the Olympics and the threefold price pressures passthrough the system, the fundamental health of the economy can reassert itself. This is all the more sobecause the economy has two significant forces of stimulus working on it - the Budget and a verycompetitive exchange rate. Let me say more about these two issues.I can recall, some years ago, Larry Summers talking very positively about America having "reloadedthe fiscal cannon" - with the clear implication that it was ready, primed and could be used if necessaryfor fiscal policy to take its role in supporting activity. The same is clearly the case in Australia, whereseveral years of good surpluses have created the opportunity to provide macro stimulus whilemaintaining the longer-term credentials of fiscal responsibility.
BIS Review 23/20017The second clear form of macro stimulus comesfrom the super-competitive exchange rate.Central banks are always uncomfortable with aweakening exchange rate, and there havecertainly been moments of great discomfort overthe past year. But, as usual in economics, it's anill wind that blows nobody any good - the super-competitive exchange rate is a sure form ofstimulus for the economy, and while there are(as usual) lags in its operation - particularly onthe export side - there is little doubt that it is apowerful effect. This is already showing onimports and exports (where non-rural exportsare up 12 per cent in volume terms over 2000),and in a current account deficit which is runningat a little over 3 per cent of GDP, and closingrapidly.To make such positive assessments risks beingdeclared to be another Pollyanna. To provide some balance, let me recall a couple of possibilities thatmight make such a satisfactory outcome harder to achieve.The first caveat that should be registered is the state of the world. The extraordinary period of growthexperienced by America has been a powerful force for good in the world at large, and if America slowssharply and stays slow (which the earlier discussion of the imbalances there would suggest has to bemore than a mere possibility), then, as one of my colleagues said recently, it would be hard forAustralia to remain unaffected by this. What should be said, at the same time, is that the goodfundamentals and super-competitive exchange rate give us the best immunisation available: no-onecan do more.I spent some time saying why Australia is not subject to the old-fashioned form of cyclical over-expansion, as is characterised by America. But there is one element of the old textbook cycle which isboth unpredictable and pervasive in its effects - animal spirits. It is a truism that the path of theeconomy depends to a large degree on the maintenance of confidence and business optimism.ConclusionIt is possible, of course, for an economy to "talk itself" into a period of slow growth, and to some extentwe are in danger of doing this. The schadenfreude that comes with being the stoic bearer of gloomytidings - the delicious adrenalin-pumping frisson that accompanies the breathless reporting of anypiece of weak data - is an understandable characteristic of human nature. Bad news is always moreinteresting than good. Plane crashes are more noteworthy than safe arrivals. But some clear-airturbulence shouldn't be a cause for panic. With the fundamentals of the economy in such good shape,no imbalances, capacity for the expansion to run further and policy settings designed to help growth,the prospects must be for a relatively quick rebound of activity.
BIS Review 22/20011Laurence H Meyer: Capital standards and community banksRemarks by Laurence H Meyer, member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem, at the Ohio Bankers’ Day Conference, Columbus, Ohio on 15 March 2001. *      *      *I am pleased to be here today to discuss capital standards at community banks. This topic does notreflect any apparent problem with the current capital standard for such organizations. The system hasworked well for both supervisors and community banks. With some minor exceptions, it continues towork well. Nonetheless, the issue calls out for discussion because of the new Basel Capital Accordproposed in mid-January as well as the banking agencies' advance notice of proposed rule-makinglast October on possible revisions to community bank capital rules.By way of background, you may recall that the original Basel Accord, reached in 1988, was designedfor large, internationally active banks. Nonetheless, regulators in the United States applied ituniversally to all domestic commercial banks and bank holding companies. Other countries took asimilar approach.Technology and banking practices have advanced since 1988, and especially for the large, complexbanking organizations, the rule has developed serious shortcomings. Risk-measurement techniqueshave improved; the costs of generating, maintaining, and analyzing data have declined; and capitalmarkets have become more tightly intertwined. As a result, the current accord that worked well beforethese developments has proven to be far too crude for practices today, particularly practices at large,complex banking organizations.Supervisors in industrial nations have concluded that they need a capital measure for these largebanks that is both more risk-sensitive and more compatible with current market practice than thecurrent accord. My focus today is on what all of this means for the overwhelming majority of U.S.banks, specifically community banks.The new Basel proposal clearly applies to all of the institutions we supervise under our programdealing with large, complex banking organizations. But that program covers only about twentydomestic entities of the nearly 9,000 U.S. banks, almost all of which have assets exceeding $40billion. The vast majority of banks in this country are neither large nor complex and seem to be unlikelycandidates for a high-maintenance capital standard that requires costly and extensive risk-management systems. More than 98 percent of U.S. commercial and savings banks, for example,have assets of less than $5 billion, and 95 percent have assets of less than $1 billion.Last fall, in anticipation of the Basel proposal, the U.S. banking agencies asked for public comment onpossible alternative standards for noncomplex banks, simpler than anything in the Basel proposal. Iwill be discussing the various "simpler" options--both from our advance proposal last fall and from thenew Basel framework proposed in January. One outcome after considering these options may be toretain the current system, or tweak it only modestly, for most noncomplex, non-internationally activebanks.Innovations in the new proposalThe Basel proposal represents a watershed in supervisory policy, redefining the regulatory approachto bank supervision for some banks and providing others with new incentives to improve their risk-measurement procedures. Let me call your attention to some of the most important innovations in thenew proposal and, at the same time, explore whether these innovations would be appropriate forcommunity banks.Three pillars. The Basel Committee's approach rests on three so-called pillars: (1) the new capitalstandard itself; (2) increased supervisory review of banks' internal assessments of their own capitaladequacy; and (3) additional public disclosure of bank risk profiles. In contrast, the original BaselAccord rested on a single pillar, a regulatory minimum for capital.Pillars 1 and 2 in effect distinguish two concepts of capital adequacy: regulatory minimum capital setby pillar 1 and the supervisor's evaluation of banks' internal calculations of their economic capital
2BIS Review 22/2001under pillar 2. By "economic" capital I mean the amount of capital that management has determined isrequired to reflect the risks, strategy, and objectives of its individual bank, regardless of the regulatorystructure. The regulatory minimum, in effect, provides a threshold for early intervention by supervisors.The procedures and assumptions embedded in the internal measure of economic capital drivebusiness decisions of the bank by permitting management to gauge the capital costs of, and betterestablish the price for, credits of varying degrees of risk. Using pillar 2, supervisors would plan toevaluate the internal capital- allocation process for integrity and economic sense, and to ensure thatthe underlying processes and assumptions used to measure economic capital are reasonable andconsistent with the principles in pillar 1. Finally, pillar 3 looks to market discipline to supplement andreinforce the effectiveness of pillars 1 and 2 in disciplining the risk-taking of banking organizations.In principle, the three-pillar approach applies to community banks as well as to LCBOs. In practice,however, the relative importance and detailed application of the three pillars would clearly be quitedifferent at LCBOs and at community banks. It would be difficult and expensive to develop andmaintain the risk-management infrastructure necessary to evaluate a customer's creditworthiness withthe precision and internal quality controls necessary to use the more-advanced capital approaches inthe Basel proposal. More to the point, virtually all of these techniques and procedures seem currentlyunnecessary for most U.S. banks, and they will remain so unless the economics and the nature ofcommunity banking substantially change. The scale and operations of community banks neitherseparate the management from credit decisions nor involve the complexity that characterizes theprocess at larger entities. As a result, a simpler approach for defining the regulatory minimum capital islikely to continue to work well for community banks, even as we need to move to a more complex andmore risk-sensitive approach for LCBOs.In the United States, supervisory oversight--pillar 2 under the new proposal--has long been an integralpart of our regulatory framework, both for LCBOs and community banks. For both sets of institutions,supervision has evolved to a more formal, risk-focused approach, with our exams increasinglyemphasizing the adequacy of internal processes and controls.Since long before the risk-focused approach was formalized, however, examiners have been rating abank's capital based on their assessment of the risk of the institution. For example, a bank with statedcapital ratios well in excess of minimum requirements--or in excess of the "well capitalized" thresholdunder today's standard--may still be assigned a less-than-satisfactory rating for the capital componentof the CAMELS rating if, in the opinion of the supervisor, the risk at that institution warrants such arating. In 1991, with the passage of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act, theCongress formally recognized the role of supervisory oversight in assessing capital adequacy of banksin relation to risk, permitting federal bank regulators to reclassify a bank's capital category undercertain conditions. Thus, for example, a federal bank regulator may reclassify a "well capitalized" bankto the "adequately capitalized" category if the bank is in unsafe and unsound condition or if it fails tocorrect unsafe and unsound practices. The supervisory oversight of capital adequacy, to be sure, ismore intense and continuous in the case of large, complex institutions, but what is now being calledpillar 2 has long been, and will continue to be, an integral part of the framework for community banks.Market discipline (pillar 3), however, may be particularly problematic for community banks, since suchinstitutions are often closely held and not rigorously and continuously evaluated by market analystsand investors. Even if they are traded on a regional basis, the depth of the trading is likely to beinadequate to provide timely signals to supervisors and discipline to management. So, though pillar 3is not irrelevant for community banks, it is unlikely to be as effective as it is for large, complex banks.Multilayered approach. As I have noted, the proposed Basel capital standard is highly complex, butfor good reason. The proposal contains overlapping options that offer several approaches toaccommodate banks with varied resources, expertise, and risk profiles. The question is whether thedifferentiation goes far enough for the U.S. banking structure.The most basic approach under the proposed accord is the so-called standardized method. Thestandardized approach is conceptually the same as the current capital accord, but more risk-sensitivein some respects. Under all the Basel approaches, a bank, as now, would allocate a risk-weight toeach of its assets and off-balance-sheet positions and calculate a sum of the risk-weighted assetvalues. The capital requirement remains 8 percent of the institution's risk-weighted assets. Theprimary change, under the standardized approach, would be to base the asset risk-weights forexposures to sovereigns, other banks, and corporations on the borrower's external credit ratings,when possible. The proposal would also give more recognition to a bank's efforts to mitigate riskthrough guarantees, collateral, credit derivatives, and netting agreements.
BIS Review 22/20013Those changes may be attractive to many institutions; however, the clear focus of the new Baselproposal is the basing of regulatory capital requirements on a bank's own internal credit ratings, theso-called internal rating based or IRB approach. There are two variants of the IRB approach: the"foundation" and "advanced" options. Both were designed for banks with the resources and expertiseto build and maintain sophisticated risk-management systems and for which the current capitalstandard more seriously mismeasures risk.The difference between the two IRB methods is that the foundation approach is designed for bankswith systems that do not permit full reliance on internal risk estimates for calculating capitalrequirements. Under the foundation approach, missing risk parameters would be supplied by thesupervisor and would be set conservatively. If banks believe these conservative estimates areinappropriate or too large, they can invest in the research and systems to prove the point and pursuethe advanced IRB approach. Banks using the advanced approach would have more freedom, but theirmethodologies would first be closely reviewed and approved by the supervisor.This multilayered structure offers a flexible approach that could apply to a wider group of banks, notjust to large, internationally active banks. The key question for U.S. community banks and theirregulators is whether any of the options in the new Basel proposal--especially the standardizedapproach--is a good match for community banks. Another question is whether competitive pressureswould provide incentives--perhaps overwhelming incentives--for community banks to pursue an IRBapproach. Would such an allocation of resources by community banks and supervisors be desirableand efficient? Finally, if not one of the Basel alternatives, what capital standard would be mostappropriate for community banks in the United States?Comprehensive treatment of risk. Although originally portrayed as dealing only with credit risk, thestandard covers, in effect, virtually all banking risks through the experience-based, but unscientific,capital charge of 8 percent. That is, although the current standard was structured on the basis of creditrisk alone, its level was set higher than warranted for just credit risk, in effect incorporating a "buffer"that could be used to cover "other risks."As we get more precise in measuring credit risk, we lose some of the buffers previously built into thestandard to cover operational and other risks. Explicitly or implicitly, we now need to make judgmentsregarding the respective correlations of different risks. Are they additive or independent, and to whatdegree are they one or the other? Can the same capital cover all of them, or do banks need capital foreach one? But again the question is whether the current approach, with its less precise measurementof credit risk and its buffers for other risks, is working well enough for community banks and should beleft as it is.The bifurcation alternative: the interagency advanced notice of proposed rulemakingAs I have mentioned, community banks in the United States have, besides the new Basel proposal,another capital proposal to consider. I am referring to the advance notice of proposed rulemakingissued last October by the U.S. banking and thrift agencies that explores alternatives for simplifyingthe capital standard for noncomplex, non-internationally active U.S. depository institutions. This is theso-called bifurcated approach. The advance proposal suggested three possible ways to structure acapital standard for non-complex banking organizations. The first option would combine a risk-basedratio with a leverage ratio. This option would retain much of the current approach while tailoring capitalcharges to the size, structure, and risk profile of less- complex banking organizations. The secondoption would use only a leverage ratio. Taking an approach not unlike the primary capital standard weused throughout the 1980s, it would drop any semblance of a risk-weighted measure and base abank's capital requirements only on the ratio of its capital to total assets. The third alternative is simplya modified leverage ratio that would add the exposures arising from loan commitments and other off-balance-sheet transactions to total bank assets.Reflecting its early stage of development, the proposal presents more questions than answers anddoes not flesh out any of the three alternatives it presents. One important question relates to hownoncomplex institutions would be defined. The proposal suggests basing the decision on a bank'sasset size, the nature of its activities, and its risk profile--for example, assets less than $5 billion,moderate amounts of off-balance-sheet transactions that are mostly loan commitments, and a focuson traditional banking activities. In effect, the size threshold would be the determining factor for mostbanks, permitting all but a few hundred of the nearly 9,000 federally insured commercial and savings
4BIS Review 22/2001banks to calculate their capital requirements using a simple approach. Almost all thrifts as well wouldlikely qualify for the simpler approach.This seems to be the proper time to consider a simpler approach for community banks as weundertake major revisions to the Basel Accord. However, to be consistent with the spirit of Basel, theagencies proposed that a simpler system should also be more conservative, requiring at least aslightly higher minimum capital charge. Such a higher minimum would still, however, be below theactual (or economic) capital now maintained by virtually all community banks.The higher capital ratios now maintained at smaller banks reflect certain economic realities. Thesebanks generally carry greater risk than larger banks because of their greater concentrations inexposures and funding sources, byproducts of their limited geographic scope and scale. In addition,because of their more limited access to capital markets, community banks have fewer options foraugmenting capital when it is needed. The higher capital ratios at community banks, compensating forthese greater risks, result as much from bank managers' tolerance for risk and market expectations forbanks' capital as from the influence of bank supervisors. Bank management, the market, and thesupervisors all understand that the current capital standard sets minimum capital requirements, not theeconomic levels that are required for prudent operations.For all these reasons, community banks have consistently maintained higher capital ratios than largerbanks since long before a regulatory capital standard was implemented. At the end of 2000, forexample, banks with total assets of less than $1 billion had an average tier 1 leverage ratio of almost10 percent and an average total risk-based capital ratio of almost 15 percent--both about double theminimum standard. In contrast, banks with assets greater than $10 billion had average ratios of about7 and 11.5 percent, respectively. These and often larger differences extend back as far as data areavailable.Despite having capital ratios typically well above any minimum that regulators would require,community banks appear to have little interest in the advance proposal for noncomplex banks. In thesmall number of comment letters we have received, community banks did not express a clearpreference for gaining a simpler regulatory capital measure in exchange for potentially higherminimum capital requirements--requirements still well below their economic or maintained capital. Thegains in simplicity were apparently not viewed as offsetting the costs of changing from the current setof rules to a purportedly simpler system. The intent of the proposal, by the way, was to reduceregulatory burden on smaller banks while ensuring that their capital remains at prudent levels.Key questionsI hope my comments have clarified that the new Basel and interagency proposals raise someimportant questions about the appropriate capital standard for U.S. community banks. If communitybanks want to shape the outcome, they must convey their views on several key questions.Who is under what standard? A crucial question that we should consider is which banks or types ofbanks will pursue which alternative capital standards. Clearly, all or almost all of the truly globalinstitutions, worldwide, would be expected to use an IRB approach, with most of them moving to theadvanced approach, if they are not there at the outset. Most other large banking organizations, suchas the large U.S. regional banks, are also likely to pursue that approach, at least eventually.Supervisory and market pressures, alone, would presumably force the global and large regional banksin that direction. Given the systemic risk posed by implications and sheer complexity of many of ourlargest institutions, supervisors worldwide should at least be urging these firms in that direction.However, if the standard is designed and calibrated properly, the incentives should include both acarrot and stick. Institutions that meet the demanding risk-management and public-disclosurestandards required under the IRB approach deserve some consideration in the form of regulatoryminimum capital charges more accurately reflecting the underlying risks. The IRB banks' risk-measurement and management processes will be strengthened, and capital markets will have moreinformation with which to judge risks and arguably assert more discipline, if risks appear to rise. Thekey is to align the incentives--capital charges and costs--just right and to ensure, largely through thesupervisory process, that the required operating standards are met.Is the standardized approach a good fit for community banks? Perhaps the larger questionrelates to which alternative most community and smaller regional banks will choose. Most of them, Isuspect, would opt for the standardized approach, or a still-simpler method, as suggested in the
BIS Review 22/20015bifurcated approach proposals of last fall. Or, as noted, many might just prefer the existing rule inorder to avoid transition costs. Of course, transition costs should be balanced against the resultantregulatory burden and capital charges. If, for example, the incentives for banks to move to more-advanced standards are exceptionally attractive, a larger number of community and regional banksmay choose to bear these costs. My own judgment is that will not be the case for most communitybanks. From the supervisors' point of view, any incentives to move to the more-advanced approachesshould be commensurate with the identified risks and should not materially disrupt the terms ofcompetition.Although the alternative was not specifically highlighted, is remaining on the current capitalstandard a reasonable option to consider for community banks? The standardized approach isonly a modest change from the current system, and many of the other changes are not relevant tocommunity banks. Community banks, for example, presumably do not have many externally ratedcredits, nor do they generally lend to foreign governments. Does it make sense then to require them tochange their system to be compatible with the standardized approach, resulting in some costs, whenthe benefits may be minimal?One possible solution may be to think of the current system as one of the simpler regimes fornoncomplex banks--that is, simpler than the new Basel options. This would allow community banks toremain under today's system with the same regulatory capital minimum.Would the current system need to be tweaked to minimize competitive pressures? I have heardsome community bankers say that competitive pressures would force them to follow larger banks to anIRB standard. That is certainly not our intent, and I am not convinced that result is inevitable. If it is, weneed to look more closely at how well the incentives are balanced.The few respondents to the interagency advance proposal for noncomplex banks suggested somerevisions to the current standard. Specifically, they suggested reduced requirements on certain assets,such as low loan-to-value mortgages and certain collateralized consumer loans. In such cases, theyclaimed, much less capital is needed than is required, and most supervisors would probably agree.The difficulty is that the respondents did not also suggest which exposures, in turn, should get highercapital requirements, or how high-risk exposures could be as easily and objectively identified incommunity banks. Simply cherry-picking a bank's best assets to receive lower requirements is notworkable. Indeed, since supervisors do not believe that overall capital requirements are excessive,you should not expect to be offered lower risk-weights for low-risk assets without also accepting higherrisk-weights for higher risk activities. At the very least, that might mean a higher risk-weight--possiblyfar higher on the basis of the historical record--for classified assets. It could also mean a higher risk-weight for subprime and generally riskier loans.ConclusionIn closing, I would emphasize that the current standard appears to be working well for communitybanks. As with any change in regulation, an appropriate cost-benefit analysis must be undertaken.That is, do the benefits from any new standard more than outweigh the added costs of any increase incomplexity as well as the one-time cost of adjusting to a new system? The proposed Basel Accordappears to be well designed to remedy the deficiencies of the current standard for large, complexbanking organizations. The U.S. banking agencies, however, will have to give careful thought as towhether any of the options in the Basel proposal are a good fit for U.S. community banks. If they arenot, we need to consider what simpler standard would be more appropriate. That was the rationale forthe advanced notice of proposed rulemaking. Remaining on the current standard (with or without someminor modifications) is an option we will need to consider for community banks. And we need to hearyour views.
BIS Review 22/20011Bank of Japan’s March report of recent economic and financial developments1Bank of Japan, 21 March 2001.*      *      *The Bank’s view2The recovery in Japan’s economy has recently come to a pause, reflecting a decrease in exports.With regard to domestic demand, business fixed investment is increasing. The recovery in privateconsumption continues to be weak as a whole, but there are somewhat positive signs in someindicators. Housing investment is virtually unchanged. Public investment is bottoming out.While domestic demand remains steady, net exports (real exports minus real imports) are plummetingreflecting a sharp slowdown in overseas economies such as in the U.S. and East Asia. Mainly due tothese developments, industrial production is starting to decline, and inventories of some materials andelectronics parts are becoming excessive. Corporate profits continue to improve but the pace isthought to be slowing significantly, particularly in the manufacturing industries, as exports andproduction are recently weakening. Income conditions of households have not deteriorated but theeffects of the decline in production are starting to be observed in new job offers and overtime workinghours.As for the outlook, public investment is expected to start increasing with the advance in theimplementation of the supplementary budget for fiscal 2000. Net exports, however, are likely tocontinue decreasing for a while, as adjustments in overseas economies will take some time. Leadingindicators suggest that business fixed investment is likely to peak out gradually, although there will bea backlog of orders to be implemented for a while. In addition, the need for inventory adjustments,although not to a large extent, is heightening for some goods. Thus, industrial production is expectedto follow a declining trend.  In these circumstances, the increase in corporate profits is likely to besubdued, and recoveries in household income and consumption are projected to be sluggish.Overall, the economy will likely remain stagnant for some time. Meanwhile, it is generally thought thatoverseas economies, particularly the U.S., will follow a gradual recovery trend from the latter half of2001.  In this case, together with the effects from the depreciation of the yen, exports are expected tounderpin the economy once again. However, attention should still be paid to the possibility of aprolonging deceleration of overseas economies and risks of a negative impact on the economyinduced by developments in foreign and domestic capital markets through corporate and householdconfidence.With regard to prices, import prices are rising, mainly reflecting the depreciation of the yen. Domesticwholesale prices are declining somewhat mainly due to the decrease in prices of electrical machinery.Consumer prices continue to be somewhat weak owing to the decline in prices of imported productsand their substitutes. Corporate service prices are falling slowly.As for the conditions surrounding price developments, the recent yen depreciation is exerting upwardpressures on prices. However, given the pausing economy as well as the heightening excessivenessof inventories, albeit the latter is observed only for some goods, the balance between supply anddemand in the domestic market is likely to exert downward pressures on prices. In addition, thedeclining trend of machinery prices caused by technological innovations, the decrease in prices ofconsumer goods arising from the streamlining of distribution channels, and the reduction incommunications fees aided by deregulation will continue to restrain price developments. Overall,prices are expected to be somewhat weak for the time being. Moreover, given the high uncertainties                                                     1 This report is based on data and information available at the time of the Bank of Japan Monetary Policy Meeting held onMarch 19, 2001.2 The Bank’s view of recent economic and financial developments, determined by the Policy Board at the Monetary PolicyMeeting held on March 19 as the basis for monetary policy decisions.
2BIS Review 22/2001regarding future economic developments, possibilities that weak demand will intensify downwardpressures on prices warrant careful monitoring.In the financial market, the overnight call rate generally moved around 0.25 percent in February, and ismoving around 0.15 percent from March in response to the decision at the Monetary Policy Meetingheld on February 28 to change the guideline of money market operations.3Interest rates on term instruments are declining substantially due to the announcement of theimprovements in the way of liquidity provision and monetary easing by the Bank. The Japan premiumremains negligible.Yields on long-term government bonds have declined to 1.1-1.2 percent due to the even morecautious view of market participants towards the economic outlook. The yield spreads between privatebonds (bank debentures and corporate bonds) and government bonds are mostly unchanged orexpanding somewhat.Stock prices dropped substantially reflecting the decline in U.S. stock prices and the downwardrevision of the outlook on firms’ profits.In the foreign exchange market, the yen depreciated again from the end of February. The yen iscurrently being traded in the range of 122-124 yen to the U.S. dollar.With regard to corporate finance, private banks continue to be more active in extending loans, mainlyto blue-chip companies, while carefully evaluating the credit risks involved. There seem to be nosignificant changes in the fund-raising conditions of firms in the markets for such instruments ascorporate bonds and CP.On the other hand, credit demand of private firms continues to lack momentum as corporate demandfor external funds is subdued, since firms’ cash flow is at a high level. Moreover, firms continue toreduce their debts as part of their balance-sheet restructuring measures. As a result, credit demand inthe private sector has continued to be basically stagnant.In view of this, the underlying tone of private banks’ lending remains sluggish, although the year-on-year rate of decrease moderated somewhat in January and February. Meanwhile, the amountoutstanding of corporate bonds issued continues to be slightly above the previous year’s level. Theamount outstanding of CP issued remains at a high level.Recently, the growth rate of money stock (M2 + CDs) is increasing reflecting the inflow from postalsavings.As for funding costs for firms, both short- and long-term funding rates are declining reflecting thedecrease in market interest rates.In this financial environment, the lending attitude of financial institutions and corporate financingconditions remain easy. However, the effects of the decline in stock prices on the behavior of financialinstitutions and the fund-raising conditions of firms need to be carefully monitored.                                                     3 “The Bank of Japan will encourage the uncollateralized overnight call rate to move on average around 0.15 percent.”
BIS Review 20/20011Masaru Hayami: Recent economic developments and monetary policySpeech by Mr. Masaru Hayami, Governor of the Bank of Japan, at the Research Institute of Japan,Tokyo, 7 March 2001.*   *   *1. IntroductionTwo months have passed since the dawn of the new century. After Japan’s economy went through avery tough decade at the end of the twentieth century, it has yet to regain economic strength andrestore a full-fledged growth.In 2000 Japan’s economy was on a moderate recovery path as improvements became increasinglyevident mainly in the corporate sector. However, unsavory developments followed. In particular, USeconomic growth slowed down in autumn 2000 more steeply than had been expected, and hasrecently begun to exert a significant influence over Japan’s economy.In a longer-term perspective, there had been a number of incipient cyclical recoveries in Japan’seconomy during the past decade, but they were followed not by a strong recovery but by a repeatedthreat of recession. At present, pessimism seems to overwhelm Japan’s economic outlook. This hasan aspect of both short-term business cycle and longer-term adjustment of Japan’s economy.Bearing these in mind, I would like to discuss, today, recent developments in Japan’s economy as wellas financial markets, and offer my thought about monetary policy.2. Recent economic and financial developmentsEconomic developmentsAllow me first to discuss economic and financial market developments. To put it in short, the Bank ofJapan is of the view that Japan’s economic recovery is slowing further and uncertainty over economicprospects is growing. Accordingly, we are becoming increasingly cautious.During the past two years, a moderate economic recovery has been supported by the followingmechanism. Growth in exports and demand for information technology (IT) has led recovery inproduction as well as profits, which in turn induced increase in business investment. However, therecovery in the business sector has exerted only a limited impetus to the personal sector because ofstrong pressures of corporate restructuring. Nonetheless, wages began to grow year on year insummer 2000. In other words, there was a momentum in the economy by which recovery in thebusiness sector led, albeit slowly, that in the personal sector.In late 2000 it became gradually evident that growth in exports and production slowed under theinfluence of rapid slowdown in US economic growth. In fact, Japan’s exports stopped growing in thefinal quarter of 2000, which is now being followed by a decline. In accordance with exportdeceleration, production has come to a halt, and inventories have become somewhat excessive insome areas of industrial materials and semi-conductors whose export demand fell sharply.Consequently, some IT firms have announced a downward revision of their profit forecast althoughthey continued to expect an increase. Under these circumstances, some concern has begun to bevoiced with respect to the prospect for business investment. In view of the fact that economic recoveryhas been pulled by manufacturing and other industries, the recent developments might as well beconsidered to foreshadow economic outlook.Downside risksThese discussions lead to the question of what are important risks in economic outlook and themagnitude thereof. The economy always faces a variety of risks, but since last autumn, we have paid
2BIS Review 20/2001particular attention to two downside risks, i.e. slowdown in world economic growth and instability incapital markets both at home and abroad. These risks intensified in early 2001, and now appear to bematerializing gradually.With respect to world economic slowdown, US economy has a key role to play. Having displayed arapid growth of 5 percent until mid-2000, US economy has slowed its growth considerably in thesecond half. This slowdown proved to be more drastic than had been widely anticipated. Against thisbackground, the Federal Reserve, or the central bank of the United States, decided on a reduction ofits target interest rate by 0.5 percentage points at an unscheduled meeting of the FOMC at thebeginning of the year, followed by an additional reduction of 0.5 percentage points at the end ofJanuary 2001. This sudden change in the economy is reflected in a significant downward revision ofthe central tendency among FOMC members with respect to real GDP growth rate from 3 ¼-3¾percent in July 2000 to 2-2 ½ percent in February 2001.With respect to US economic outlook, a low growth rate seems inevitable as far as the first half of2001 is concerned. A more critical question concerns the likelihood and degree of rebound later in theyear. Economists and market players are divided in this regard: some expect a quick rebound, someothers a modest recovery, and others prolonged deceleration. Optimists, who expect V-shapedrecovery in the second half of 2001, point out the continued improvements in productivity bolstered byIT revolution as well as wide room for actions of both monetary and fiscal policies. On the other hand,it is pointed out that after an extremely high economic growth, the subsequent adjustment might proveto be severe and also that the adjustment period is practically unpredictable before it is over. In recentmonths, optimistic views appear to be receding. Under these circumstances, I would like to remainvigilant as well as unprejudiced about the extent to which US economy regains its strength later in theyear.As I have mentioned earlier, the US economic slowdown has already begun to exert a negativeinfluence on Japan’s economy through a variety of channels including an indirect impact involvingeconomic slowdowns in East Asian countries that are closely linked to the US economy. In Japan,production growth slowed under the influence of decreases in exports. If this leads to declines incorporate profits and reductions in business spending, the momentum for economic recoverystemming from the business sector will be put at a greater risk than before. Therefore, we all need toexamine carefully the ongoing production, profits, and investment plans for some time.There is another downside risk for Japan’s economy, i.e., capital markets both at home and abroad,especially stock price developments and their impact. Weakness of Japanese stock prices has beenparticularly pronounced in recent months. Nikkei Stock Average renewed its lowest record during thepost-bubble period beginning in 1990 although one must make allowances for the technical changesin the index of April 2000. It is by no means easy to identify the causes for weak stock pricedevelopments, but they seem to be influenced by not only US stock market adjustments but alsobearish sentiment in the market with respect to Japanese economic outlook. They may as well be areflection of concerns that the markets both at home and abroad have with respect to delays inaddressing a number of structural problems that Japan’s economy has. The Bank of Japan will remainvigilant about the influences that these weak stock prices will have on consumer and businesssentiment as well as corporate finance.Price developmentsAgainst the background of recent economic and financial market developments, analysis of pricedevelopments is becoming an issue of renewed interest. In recent months, a variety of price indices,such as domestic wholesale prices, consumer prices, and corporate service prices, have beenshowing small declines year on year, and are expected to be weak for some time.These price developments have obviously been influenced by both supply and demand elements. Awide output gap remains after a significant improvement on the demand side since the economy hitthe bottom two years ago. Because economic growth is decelerating further at present, there is aconcern that downward pressures on prices stemming from weak demand might intensify in comingmonths. On the supply side, a variety of elements are at work, e.g., technological innovation, increasein efficiency in the distribution system, and deregulation, all of which exert a downward pressure onprices. Take domestic wholesale prices for example. Declines in prices of electric equipments andother machines have been most pronounced under the influence of a very rapid technologicalinnovation. For another example, declines in consumer prices have been accounted for in large partby imports and import competitive goods, e.g., clothing.
BIS Review 20/20013Let me hasten to add to it by saying that the Bank of Japan has never argued for so-called “good pricedeclines.” Instead, the Bank has repeatedly said that the present price developments have been underthe complex influence of both demand and supply elements, and therefore, no one can afford tounderstand on the basis of movements of price indices alone whether the ongoing price developmentsare consistent with sound developments in the economy. The issue of utmost importance is whetherthe current weak prices will invite declines in corporate profits and/or incomes of workers, leading to adeflationary spiral, or vicious cycle of economic recession and price declines. The Bank of Japan is ofthe view that Japan’s economy has so far avoided such a deflationary spiral, but that becauseeconomic growth has recently weakened further as I mentioned a few minutes ago, the economy hasentered the phase that warrants enhanced attention to price developments.3. Deliberation on monetary policya. Improvements in the way of liquidity provision and reduction in interest ratesDecisions of February 9 and February 28, 2001Now let me offer my thought about monetary policy on the basis of the economic and financialdevelopments I have discussed. As you are well aware, the Bank of Japan decided at its MonetaryPolicy Meeting of February 9, 2001 on both improvements in the way in which liquidity is provided tothe market and a reduction in the official discount rate by 0.15 percentage points. With respect toliquidity provision, we decided upon three specific measures: introduction of a Lombard-type standbylending facility, active use of outright purchase operations of short-term government securities, andpreparation for bill purchase operations at all offices of the Bank.At the Monetary Policy Meeting of February 28, 2001, the Bank decided to reduce, by 0.10 percentagepoints, both its target level of overnight call rate to 0.15 percent and the official discount rate to 0.25percent.Lombard-type lending facility and the new role of the official discount rateAmong these policy measures, the Lombard-type lending facility is new to Japan. Officially, it has aname of “Supplementary Lending Facility.” Under the existing framework of liquidity provision, theBank of Japan selects its counter-parties and decides on the timing as well as amount of lending. Incontrast, the Lombard-type lending facility entitles financial institutions to borrow at the Bank ofJapan’s discount window the amount that they want at any time they wish, as long as collateral isproperly set against the borrowing and the borrower meets the conditions pre-specified with respect toeligibility of collateral and other technical aspects. From a viewpoint of financial institutions, this is ameans of funding available any time.The most important function that this supplementary lending facility performs is to stabilize interestrates in the market. Under usual circumstances, the overnight call rate fluctuates below the officialdiscount rate because the former is the rate of which the Bank of Japan sets such a target level. Whenend-of-fiscal year pressures mount or a shock arises in the market, e.g., steep declines in stock pricesor rumors of a large bankruptcy, interest rates tend to go up in the market. Even in that case, overnightmarket rates will be kept below the official discount rate because financial institutions are able toborrow at the Bank of Japan’s discount window at their discretion. Moreover, because financialinstitutions are freer from anxiety over funding capabilities, this will have a stabilizing effect on not onlythe overnight call rate but also other short-term interest rates across the board. This effect has beenstrengthened further by two reductions in the official discount rate amounting to 0.25 percentagepoints in February 2001.Now let me say a few words about the roles that the official discount rate plays. In the past, the Bank’sdecision as to the official discount rate was a basic tool of monetary policy. Therefore, change in thatrate had an announcement effect since it embodied change in the basic stance of monetary policy. In1994, however, deregulation of interest rates was complete, and the institutional linkage between theofficial discount rate and bank deposit rates disappeared. In 1996, the Bank of Japan made it clearthat the Bank would no longer use the discount window lending, to which the official discount rate wasapplied, as a means of monetary operations. Consequently, the role of the discount rate as a policyvariable was played down, whereas the target level of the overnight call rate began to assume thatrole.
4BIS Review 20/2001By the introduction of the Lombard-type lending facility, however, the official discount rate is given anew function of setting a ceiling on call rates and thereby ensuring stability of short-term interest ratesin the market. The Bank of Japan will continue to guide the call rate at an intended level by dailymarket operations, but at the same time it will begin to use the new function of the discount rate as ameans to supplement the effects of market operations.Timely and flexible implementation of monetary policyHaving explained the policy decisions made at the two Monetary Policy Meetings in February 2001,allow me to elaborate on their background. First of all, we have taken these policy measures on thebasis of our understanding of economic and financial developments at present and in the future. As Isaid a few minutes ago, economic recovery is weakening in Japan and uncertainty over economicprospects have intensified under the influence of overseas economic slowdown and declines in stockprices. In part of money and capital markets, there was a certain degree of instability, reflectingconcerns over the future. Under these circumstances, we decided on the policy measures with a viewto ensuring both smooth functioning and stability of the financial market as well as to strengtheningmonetary support for economic recovery. Subsequently, not only the overnight call rate but alsointerest rates of longer maturities, e.g., those maturing beyond the fiscal year end and even long-terminterest rates, declined by a considerable degree.Another point I would like to emphasize is the fact that the Bank of Japan continues to conductmonetary policy in a timely and flexible manner, in view of changes in economic conditions. As I saidearlier, Japan’s economic recovery has decelerated further against the background of suddenslowdown of US economic growth and other elements. In light of these developments, we believe wehave taken appropriate policy actions in a timely manner, and will continue to do so in the future. Atthe same time, the Bank of Japan hopes that the policy measures that it took in February 2001 willcontribute to autonomous economic recovery led by private demand.b. Monetary policy stance in the futureNow let me leave aside the discussion of a series of policy measures the Bank of Japan decided inFebruary and take up something else. There continue to be a variety of arguments about monetarypolicy in Japan. For example, we sometimes hear the views that the present monetary ease isinsufficient, and therefore, the Bank of Japan should resort to so-called “quantitative easing” or returnto the zero interest rate policy. I would like to explain the basic thought about monetary policy on thebasis of the discussions held at the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan.First of all, I would like to emphasize the fact that the Bank of Japan has implemented aggressivemonetary easing to a degree unprecedented in the history of central banking in the world in terms ofboth interest rates and volume. Under the influence of this monetary easing, both short and long terminterest rates have been kept extremely low. The Bank has also provided the market with ampleliquidity and consequently, the monetary base, which consists of money that the Bank directly providesthe system with, has shown a considerable growth, to which I will come back later.A second point I would like to make is whether or not the Bank should resort to additional measuressuch as “quantitative easing” hinges crucially upon conjectural analysis of growth and priceperformance of the economy. The word “quantitative easing” is meant differently across people whouse this term. For example, there is an argument for stepped up outright purchases of long-termgovernment bonds. The Bank of Japan has been buying such bonds in line with a trend growth inbanknotes in circulation. This purchase amounts to \5 trillion per year. If the Bank increased itspurchase dramatically, that would have some positive effects but at the same time it might beaccompanied by negative side effects. Therefore, a careful examination of both positive effects andside effects must be in place before that policy is implemented. The possible effects of the stepped upbond purchases include a decline in long-term interest rates or a rise in expected rate of inflation. Inlight of the serious budget situation of today, however, the possibility that such a bold measure woulddamage credibility of fiscal discipline and in turn raise long-term interest rates cannot be ruled out.A policy to induce a massive depreciation of the yen’s exchange rate is another drastic,unconventional policy. In the present legal framework, it is the Ministry of Finance that has theauthority for exchange market intervention. Leaving this issue aside, it is uncertain how effectiveofficial intervention can be in affecting exchange rates. Neither is it certain how to cope with terms-of-trade losses stemming from rises in import prices and adverse influences over Asian economies.
BIS Review 20/20015After all, before the Bank embarks on unconventional policies like the ones categorized by quantitativeeasing and the zero interest rate policy, it has to judge that the conditions of the economy and priceswarrant such policies. In this regard, the Bank of Japan will continue to examine and analyze thesituation with its full force and on that basis it will seek the most appropriate policy that the centralbank can take.A third point I would like to emphasize is we all have to face the reality that during the past decadeboth monetary and fiscal policies have been eased dramatically and yet they have failed to meet withrobust economic growth. There are reasons for it.Let me mention three numbers here. During the past five years the monetary base expanded at anannual rate of 7.3 percent, the money stock at 3.3 percent, and nominal GDP at 0.4 percent. Incontrast to the 1970s and 1980s, when all three indicators grew pari passu, what large differencesexist between them in recent years.The difference between the growth rate of monetary base and that of money stock can be interpretedin the following. The monetary base consists of all banknotes and all current deposits that banks andother financial intermediaries hold at the Bank of Japan. A textbook of monetary economics tells youthat the Bank of Japan supplies the monetary base, on which basis banks extend credit so that themonetary base creates a multiple increase in the money stock. In the course of discussions aboutmonetary policy at present, an argument is sometimes made as if the monetary base were inshortage. As I pointed out a minute ago, the monetary base has been expanding at a relatively highrate. Despite this, however, the money stock failed to increase as much. It is mainly credit extension offinancial institutions through which the money stock is supplied, but bank lending, which constitutesthe core of credit extension, has decreased at an annual rate of 1.4 percent during the past five years.In contrast, bank holding of government bonds expanded at a remarkable rate of 15.7 percent. Inother words, financial intermediation took place during this period in the way that government bondissues increased, financing government expenditure, through which channel money circulated to agreater extent.There is another discrepancy, i.e., the money stock and nominal GDP. The money stock grew at amodest rate of 3.3 percent per annum. This amounts to as much as \20 trillion every year, but nominalGDP stayed virtually unchanged notwithstanding. In sum, despite relatively ample supply of monetarybase, economic growth remains lackluster.All this suggests the significance of structural obstacles in Japan’s economy, e.g., problems of thefinancial system, and on the flip side of the coin, corporate restructuring. Resolution of these problemswill prepare a foundation on which the effectiveness of monetary policy can be enhanced. I plan tocome back to this issue before closing my remarks today in conjunction with a topic of non-performingassets.c. Price stability and monetary policyAllow me to turn to another topic: the relationship between price stability and monetary policy. I hearoften that it is nothing but monetary policy that can prevent deflation as well as inflation. Indeed, theBank of Japan Law stipulates that the Bank’s purpose is the maintenance of price stability, and theBank in fact conducts monetary policy in accordance with that idea. In terms of practicalimplementation of monetary policy, however, the relationship between the objective of price stabilityand monetary policy is somewhat more complex.This complexity is mentioned in the report that the Bank of Japan published last year with respect toprice stability. For one thing, the relationship differs, depending on the length of time you envisionabout price stability. For example, during a very long period, say ten or twenty years, excess supply ofmoney in many cases corresponds to rises in prices while short supply does to price declines. This isquite natural in light of the fact that prices are the rate of exchange between goods/services andmoney. Based on this long-term relationship between prices and money, price fluctuations are referredto as essentially monetary phenomenon and price stability is considered to be the objective ofmonetary policy.During a shorter period, say a few months or a few years, however, price fluctuations are influencedby not only money but also a variety of other variables. Output gap of the whole economy, inflationexpectation, international commodities prices, exchange rates are interrelated in a complex fashion. Insuch a complex world, it is no easy task to decide on how precisely monetary policy can control prices,
6BIS Review 20/2001and also on how far it should do. Suppose an oil price shock gives rise to inflation pressures. If we areto contain them in a short period, it will take a very tight monetary policy. The upshot may be a steepdecline in economic activity. This is inconsistent with sustainable price stability in the long run.Conversely, at a time when prices decline on account of productivity gains based on rapidtechnological innovation, a forceful reduction in interest rates with a view to raising prices may amplifyeconomic swings.I firmly believe that monetary policy is an important determinant that ultimately influences pricedevelopments, but in order to fulfill its responsibility in the long run, we must first analyze not onlysuperficial movements in price indices but also a variety of underlying developments, and see if theongoing price developments are consistent with sustainable economic growth. I believe that this isindeed what the Bank of Japan Law means by its clause that the Bank’s currency and monetarycontrol shall be aimed at, "through the pursuit of price stability, contributing to the sound developmentof the national economy."4. Concluding remarksHaving discussed monetary policy issues, allow me to close my speech today by touching onstructural problems of Japan’s economy. In my view, efforts to enhance productivity by addressing thesupply side structure of the economy are essential for Japan’s economy to achieve strong growth. Thefact that US and UK economies revived strongly in the 1990s can be attributed to such efforts. Fromthis viewpoint, it is of utmost importance that Japan speed up reform on the basis of commonunderstanding of the following issues.First, economic growth stems from the innovative strength of the private sector. Creativity andknowledge of the private sector are the key to bring the economy to its maximum potential. Excessivedependence on the public sector is not the answer.Second, strength of the private sector will materialize when the market mechanism functions fully.Productivity of the private sector will improve when the resources of capital and labor are reallocatedand repositioned between the business area of high growth potential, efficiency, and profitability andthat otherwise. This process goes on most efficiently through the market mechanism.Third, such reform is inevitably accompanied by a certain degree of pains. In the course of structuralreform, negative influences may arise to the economy, albeit temporarily, e.g., corporate bankruptciesand restructuring. Opportunities must be accorded to those firms and workers who are defeatedamidst structural reform so that they can make a new attempt in the area they can take advantage oftheir own competitiveness.There are a variety of views with respect to specific forms of reform, but today I would like to say a fewwords about my ideas that I have always been turning in my mind.The first issue concerns the resolution of non-performing assets of banks. During the past three yearsof my term as Governor of the Bank of Japan, Chairman Greenspan of the Federal Reserve and othereminent people in the international circles have said to me that from the S&L problem and bankingcrises in the United States, they had learned a lesson about the importance of removing non-performing assets off the balance sheet of the banks. On Japan’s side, too, we have maintained thatmere provisioning against non-performing assets would not solve the problem and that it is essential toremove them from the balance sheet. During the past several years, the aggregate non-performingassets remained virtually unchanged in the magnitude of \30 trillion. This is a regrettable fact. Underthese circumstances, Minister for the Financial Services, Mr. Yanagisawa expressed his view thatbanks should step up write off. We are of the same opinion. I consider his remark to be bothappropriate and timely.I believe that increase in write off will facilitate structural reform. To promote write off, there are somespecific means. For example, a company be split into good and bad parts, and the bad part, or non-performing part be written off. Loan sales markets be also enhanced. It is to be hoped that suchspecific actions be announced and put in practice soon. At the same time, I strongly hope thatmanagement of banks will determine to embark on an enhanced write off. As for the assets classifiedunder the category of “special mention,” the importance of sufficient provisions cannot be over-emphasized.While such stepped up write off will contribute to the resolution of the non-performing problem, it mightaccelerate bankruptcies and have an adverse influence over employment. The Bank of Japan is
BIS Review 20/20017prepared to conduct monetary policy to relieve the negative impact of this painful friction on theeconomy.The second issue I would like to mention is that it is absolutely necessary to invite the personal sectorto stock and bond markets in order to help resolve the problem of banks’ non-performing asset as wellas to promote structural reform. At present, the aggregate financial assets in the personal sectoramount to \1,380 trillion, 54 percent of which is held in the form of cash and deposits.In Germany a shift from indirect financing to direct financing has been going on successfully in recentyears, and as a result risk capital has increased. Between the early 1990s and 1998, the law has beenenacted three times to promote financial and capital markets, by which several reforms of the stockmarket and investment trusts have proceeded. Specific measures include a reduction in the minimumdenomination of stock, lifting of a ban on Fund of Funds, improvement in product design of investmenttrusts, promotion of senior citizens’ fund. As a result, the proportion of cash and deposits within totalfinancial assets of the personal sector declined from 45.8 to 35.2 percent in Germany between 1991and 1999, while in Japan it went up from 50.8 to 54.0 percent. The proportion of stocks andinvestment trusts went up dramatically in Germany from 14.6 to 27.3 percent while in Japan from 10.9to 10.4 percent.Growth of investment trusts and mutual funds are expected to happen also in Japan. In this regard,improvements in product design of investment trusts are an urgent task. In particular, a wide variety ofinvestment trusts should be marketed to meet a variety of demand of the personal sector, and at thesame time sound market practices should also be established.Furthermore, establishment of investment funds can contribute to increasing flow of funds into riskcapital.  Private Investment Funds Ripplewood, which established Shinsei Bank after acquiring theLong Term Credit Bank of Japan, and Lone Star, which bought Tokyo Sowa Bank, are both equityfunds whose shareholders consist of mutual funds, pension funds, university endowments. In Japanmeasures to promote the establishment of a large number of such funds should be taken.If the financial assets of the personal sector that are currently held predominantly in cash and depositsare to be invested more in financial and capital markets through a variety of channels, that would, Ihope, contribute to ensuring stability in the financial system through prompter resolution of the non-performing asset problem as well as to facilitating structural reform in Japan.
BIS Review 20/20011Y V Reddy: Implementation of financial standards and codes: Indianperspective and approachSpeech by Dr YV Reddy, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the Conference onInternational Standards and Codes organised by the IMF-World Bank, held in Washington DC, 7-8March 2001.  The appendix mentioned by Dr Reddy can be obtained from the Reserve Bank of India.*  *  *In this paper it is proposed to describe the Indian perspective and approach in regard to theimplementation of international financial standards and codes advocated by the Financial StabilityForum (FSF). The Indian efforts in this direction also seek to complement and support the ongoinginitiatives of the G-20 aimed at encouraging implementation of standards and codes among membercountries.The paper is schematized as follows. Section I explains India’s stand on global initiatives forimplementation of standards and codes. While Section II narrates India’s association with globalefforts in evolving and promoting financial standards and codes, Section III describes the Indianapproach to the implementation. Section IV mentions the institutional arrangements that have beenput in place to guide the process of implementation. Section V provides an account of the workprocesses followed by Advisory Groups in the course of preparation of Reports. Section VI indicatesthe current status, while Section VII touches on the plans for following up on the submission ofReports. Section VIII brings out some highlights of Indian experience so far.I. India’s stand1.1India is fully supportive of the need to observe certain minimum universally acceptedstandards in areas relevant to the maintenance of stability in the international monetary system,including increased transparency in formulation and implementation of monetary and financial policiesand improvements in dissemination of relevant data. The establishment of a high-poweredStanding Committee on International Financial Standards and Codes (Standing Committee)underscores India’s commitment to this international enterprise. At the same time, India has beenvoicing, in the international fora, some of its concerns regarding the manner of internationalfinancial institutions spearheading the implementation and assessment of codes and standards. Indiaadvocates a voluntary approach, fair, equitable, and continuous process taking duly into account theinstitutional and legal structure and stage of development in different countries.1.2Although the notion of a code of good practices is intuitively appealing, the temptation toprescribe universally valid model codes which do not allow for differences in institutionaldevelopment, legislative framework and, more broadly, different stages of development must beavoided. Sometimes there is a tendency to recommend the practices of major industrial countries todeveloping country environments without adequate consideration being given to a country’s stage ofdevelopment and its ground realities.1.3Moreover, it stands to reason that the accent should be on voluntary adoption andgradualism rather than a big bang. In fact, the process may, in any case, be a medium term one andhence one should not look for instant compliance. Basle Core Principles of Banking Supervision offersan interesting example of how a standard attains a near universal acceptance based on voluntaryparticipation and country ownership. It is also important that the manner in which theseinternational standards are monitored does not degenerate into categorizing countries as‘performers’ and ‘non-performers’. In other words, the transformation of a best practice goal shouldnot result in premature conditionality for countries that approach the Fund for balance of paymentssupport.1.4The extent pace and sequencing should ideally be left to the country authorities. In keeping withthis spirit, it has been held that the International Monetary Fund (Fund) may furnish the ROSCs(Reports on Observance of Standards and Codes) in respect of individual countries only with thecountries’ specific permission. The release of Article IV reports should also be left to the judgment
2BIS Review 20/2001of individual governments. This is because the goal of transparency could best be served by abalanced and symmetric evalution of data as between the authorities and the private sector.1.5It must also be added that the plethora of codes, standards and principles could beoverwhelming and also highly demanding of manpower and financial resources. They also have apotential to become overly intrusive vis-à-vis national authorities. In any case some prioritisation ofCodes for considering implementation is inevitable in respect of each country. There is a strongcase for undertaking or fostering more intensified research on the relationship betweenimplementation of standards and macroeconomic and financial stability.1.6.Work on standards and codes is evolving in relevant interational fora and priorities forimplementing them would have to vary from country to coutry. In this regard, the potential for self-assessment on the part of individual countries needs to be explored. Besides being cost-effective,such an approach would also greatly facilitate country-ownership.1.7.Some of the other serious concerns that deserve attention in this regard pertain to the specificityand the source of financial difficulties that might have to be adequately reckoned in individual cases.Since financial crises can have multiple causes, overemphasising financial standards could detractattention from other policy priorities. The relative importance of financial standards in crisis preventionmust also be adjudged from the standpoint of the relative openness of the economy’s capital accountand in this sense the “one size fits all” approach may have to be eschewed.1.8Since the primary motive for having standards is to catalyze orderly capital flows, while ensuringfinancial stability, greater consultation with the private sector in evolving and prioritizing of corestandards is of utmost necessity. All standards and codes are not equally relevant to all segments ofprivate sector and further they do tend to evolve over a period reflecting concerns of both publicpolicy and market participants.1.9It is gratifying to note that currently there is a better appreciation of India’s stand in theinternational fora as compared with the past.II. India’s Association with the Global Efforts in Fostering International Standards and Codes2.1 India has been closely associated with various standard setting bodies and has been takingactive part in the work of several key international fora devoted to the task of developing andpromoting implementation of financial standards and codes. Although India is not a member of theFinancial Stability Forum(FSF)@, it was one of the countries specially requested to help the Forum inTask Force on the Implementation of Standards and to participate in the Joint Committee Groupmeeting. The Task Force was set up to explore key issues relating to standards/codes/core principlesand consider the strategy for fostering the implementation of international standards relevant for asound financial system.2.2The Reserve Bank is also represented at the Follow Up Group on Incentives forImplementation of Standards instituted by the FSF following submission of the Task Force Report.The Group has been ascertaining how various elements of market and official incentives could bestreinforce one another within the framework of the overall strategy to foster implementation ofstandards and, for this purpose, engages in a dialogue with a cross section of relevant marketparticipants.2.3 Reserve Bank of India officials worked closely with the Basel Committee on BankingSupervision(BCBS). In 1997, in consultation with the supervisory authorities of a few non-G-10countries including India, the BCBS drew up the 25 ‘ Core Principles for Effective BankingSupervision’ aimed at guiding supervisory authorities seeking to strengthen their current supervisoryregime.2.4From its inception, India was also represented on the Group on Joint Task Force onSecurities Settlement Systems constituted by the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems(CPSS) and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO).The CPSS and IOSCO have since released the report of the Task force in January 2001 for publicconsultation. Based on the comments received, the Task Force will develop the finalrecommendations.
BIS Review 20/200132.5As a member of the Core Principles Liaison Group (CPLG) constituted by the BaselCommittee on Banking Supervision(BCBS), the Reserve Bank has been attending the meetings ofthe Group and actively contributing to the discussions.2.6 The Reserve Bank is also represented in the Working Group on Capital (WGC) set up by theCPLG. Recently, during February 6 to 9, 2001, the Reserve Bank of India hosted the meeting of theGroup in Delhi to discuss the salient features of the second consultative paper issued by the BaselCommittee. The meeting was attended by 26 representatives of supervisory agencies from severalnon G-10 countries as well as from international financial agencies.2.7India is one of the countries that has sought participation in the joint IMF-World BankFinancial Sector Assessment Programme (FSAP). As part of the Reports on Observance of Standardsand Codes (ROSCs), India’s compliance in respect of five standards and codes has already beenassessed, viz., Monetary and Financial Policy Transparency, Banking Supervision, Securities MarketRegulation, Payment and Settlement system and Corporate governance.2.8Furthermore, the professional expertise in the Reserve Bank of India has been madeavailable to IMF/World Bank in their FSAP exercises in other countries.III. Indian approach3.1The Indian approach to implementation of financial standards and codes is based on theefficiency-enhancing elements of the standards and codes, and on the need to consider them aspart of process of institutional development in the country, while not ignoring their relevance todomestic as well as international financial stability. Thus, they are viewed as an integral part ofthe process of economic reform, most appropriate to the country’s needs. The emphasis is oncreating awareness to promote adoption by the relevant official agencies, self regulating bodiesand market participants rather than prescribing compliance at the instance of a central authority.3.2The Indian approach to the implementation of standards and codes is noteworthy in that itfollows a systematic process. The process consists of the initial recognition, identification andtaking on record of standards and codes in relevant areas. This is followed by in-depth assessmentby independent experts of issues pertaining to the present status of applicability, relevance and theexisting degree of compliance, the feasibility of compliance and the earmarking of the possible timeframe for transition given the prevailing legal and institutional practices. It is also common to seekcomparison of the levels of adherence in India, vis-à-vis industrialized and emerging economies,particularly to understand India’s position and to prioritize actions on some of the more importantcodes and standards. The process seeks to map out a comprehensive course of possible actionsfor achieving the best practices. This approach is put in the public domain through publication ofReports on each of the selected standards and codes.3.3The next stage involves putting efforts for the widest possible dissemination of expert opinionon the subject in the form of the reports mentioned and by means of outreach programs like seminarsand workshops. The objective is to obtain involvement and stimulation of interest among public-authorities and other stake holders in the debate and to garner a higher level of general awareness onthe subject. This is to be followed by invitation of and consideration of inputs and feedback fromrelevant public and private sector organizations to enhance the sense of involvement and to buildconfidence. Such a participative and consultative approach is advocated to secure a convergence ofviewpoints and, hence, favorable public disposition towards the necessity of change.IV. Institutional ArrangementsStanding Committee4.1In order to facilitate positioning of international financial standards and codes in relevant areasof the financial system in India and to guide the overall process of implementation of appropriatechanges in respect to various segments of the financial system, the Reserve Bank of India inconsultation with Government of India, in December 1999, constituted a ‘Standing Committee onInternational Financial Standards and Codes’ under the Chairmanship of Deputy Governor,Reserve Bank of India and Secretary, Economic Affairs, Government of India as Alternate Chairman.The Committee could co-opt members depending on the subject under consideration.
4BIS Review 20/20014.2The Committee has been enjoined with the responsibility of identifying and monitoringdevelopments in global standards and codes being evolved especially in the context of theinternational developments and discussions as part of the efforts to create a sound internationalFinancial Architecture, considering all aspects of these standards and codes to Indian financialsystem. The Committee has also been asked to consider plotting a road map for aligning India’sstandards and practices as necessary and desirable in the light of evolving international practices,periodically reviewing the status and progress in regard to the codes and practices; and reaching outits reports on the above to all concerned organizations in public or private sectors.4.3 The Standing Committee by itself will not take a view on the Standards and Codes and it willdisseminate views expressed on the subject mainly on the basis of the Advisory Groups constituted byit in different subject areas. The Standing Committee will identify action points that may arise out ofthe views expressed and also make a mention of these to the concerned authorities viz.,Government, Reserve Bank of India, Securities and Exchange Board of India(SEBI) etc., thus actingas a catalyst in the whole process, while leaving it to the concerned institutions to consider appropriatemeasure. The Committee will no doubt make arrangements to track the progress inimplementation.Advisory Groups4.4The Advisory Groups constituted by the Standing Committee on International FinancialStandards and Codes in ten core subject areas pertaining to the financial system are entrusted withthe task of studying, in detail, the present status of applicability and relevance and compliance ofrelevant standards and codes, reviewing the feasibility of compliance and the time frame over whichthis could be achieved given the prevailing legal and institutional practices, comparing the levels ofadherence in India, vis-à-vis in industrialized and also emerging economies particularly to understandIndia’s position and prioritize actions on some of the more important codes and standards, and tochalk out a course of action for achieving the best practices.4.5Out of the set of twelve subjects (actually eleven as Accounting and Auditing are taken together)areas for which standards and codes that have been prescribed by international financial institutionsand other standard setting bodies pertaining to the financial system, the Standing Committee has sofar identified ten core subjects for immediate attention and assessment by Advisory Groups. Theseare, Transparency in Monetary and Financial Policies, Data Dissemination, Payments and SettlementSystem, Banking Supervision, Securities Market Regulation, Accounting and Auditing, FiscalTransparency, Insurance Regulation, Bankruptcy Laws and Corporate Governance. The twelfth areanamely ‘Market Integrity’ associated with the forty recommendations of the Financial Action TaskForce(FATF) on money laundering is not being presently looked into by the Standing Committee.4.6It may need to be mentioned that all Advisory Groups are chaired by eminent experts notgenerally holding official positions in Government or other regulatory bodies. While theChairmen of these Advisory Groups were identified and nominated by the Standing Committee, takinginto account the experience and expertise, the choice of members of these Advisory Groups, wascompletely left to the Chairmen of Advisory Groups. The members are generally non-officialexperts in relevant subject areas. The Groups have, however, the option of including officials fromGovernment, Reserve Bank of India, SEBI, etc., as special invitees. Such officials help inproviding inputs on the understanding of extant position relating to the relevant standards and codesand also the steps under way towards improvements. This arrangement keeps the Advisory Groupsoutside the sphere of official influence and allows them to make critical assessment of relevance aswell as state of compliance with standards and codes and give unbiased recommendations withregard to the feasibility of compliance and the necessity of achieving best practices in the areascovered by them.4.7In order to facilitate exchange of information and expertise on matters of mutual interest, theAdvisory Groups have the option of having interactions/consultations amongst themselves andmany did exercise the option. The Advisory Groups may also jointly deliberate on overlappingissues in certain subject areas to evolve a consistent approach. In finalizing its Report, the StandingCommittee would, however, attempt to consolidate these overlapping areas. The Reports of theAdvisory Groups are made public, as soon as they are submitted to the Standing Committee.4.8The Standing Committee also periodically reviews the progress of Advisory Group and isrequired to review its own status after the completion of one year and report to Government/RBI. TheSecretariat support to the Standing Committee is provided by the Reserve Bank of India.
BIS Review 20/20015V. Work Processes5.1In view of the varied nature of the subject areas, each Advisory Group decided to design itsown methods and processes of work. Thus, some Groups mounted special studies or technicalpapers, some divided the work of preparing basic technical papers among each of the members andmost depended heavily on the background material collected and analysed by professionals inReserve Bank of India. While an Advisory Group gave an interim report, the general preferenceturned out to be in favour of final reports, sometimes in parts submitted sequentially.5.2 In some of the subject areas, concerned governmental or regulatory bodies had alreadyconstituted some study groups and hence it was argued on occasions that the Advisory Groups areduplicating such efforts. In such cases, it became necessary to clarify that the work of the AdvisoryGroups is without prejudice to any other official and non-official initiatives, and that the work isnot meant to be intrusive. It also became necessary to encourage the Advisory Groups to takeaccount in their deliberations such parallel, though partial, efforts and provide appropriate inputsto such efforts whenever sought. The process was made easier in several cases since one or moremembers of relevant Advisory Group happened to be so eminent as to be involved in several of theinitiatives.5.3Some Advisory Groups had to reckon with the fact that their perception of compliance withinternational standards differed from the official stance of concerned authorities i.e. regulator orgovernment body. The non-official status of the Advisory Groups has enabled them to consider theofficial stance but make its own independent assessment of degree of compliance.5.4In some of the Advisory Groups there has been a view in favour of making recommendationson substantive policy-issues, while the mandate was, say on, transparency. There have also beenoccasions when the Group tended to comment on functioning of official bodies in the context ofstandards.5.5In the preparation of their respective Reports, most Advisory Groups have also been studyingand reviewing international experience in various subject areas. In particular, the Report of theAdvisory Group on Monetary and Financial Policies took comprehensive account of extant institutionalarrangements and practices in five countries namely, the UK, USA, Australia, New Zealand and SouthAfrica. The Advisory Group on Bankruptcy Laws has examined the existing Acts on insolvency andbankruptcy in the US and selected countries in Europe and Asia. The Advisory Group on Accountingand Auditing has conducted in depth studies of the International Accounting Standards (IAS), the USGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP) and the comparative structure of AccountingStandards in India and standards issued by the Accounting Standards Board of the Institute ofChartered Accountants of India (ICAI).5.6In the course of their work, the Advisory Groups have also been having the benefit ofdiscussions with market participants, members from professional bodies as well asacademics. The Advisory Group on Insurance Regulation met the officials of Life InsuranceCorporation of India and the Advisory Group on Fiscal Transparency had extensive discussions withall State Finance Secretaries and the Office of Comptroller and Auditor General of India. AdvisoryGroups have, in most cases, co-opted market participants and members from professional bodies asspecial invitees. For example, the Advisory Group on Payments and Settlement System has specialinvitees from the National Stock Exchange(NSE) and a member from academia. The Advisory Groupon Accounting and Auditing has a member from the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India(ICAI)and other well known market participants and practicing professionals. Similarly, the Advisory Groupon Securities Market Regulation and the Advisory Group on Banking Supervision has eminent expertsfrom the Housing Development Finance Corporation(HDFC) and ICICI Bank. The Advisory Group onBankruptcy Laws also includes practicing professionals and eminent academics, including the formerDirector of National Law School as the Chairman of the Group.5.7The Advisory Groups were encouraged to prepare in tabular form the given internationalstandard/code, current status in India and the corresponding recommendation of the Group as asupplement to the narrative to facilitate easy reference.5.8As and when the Reports are received by the Standing Committee, they are placed on theReserve Bank of India’s website for immediate wider public dissemination.
6BIS Review 20/2001VI. Current Status6.1As of now, the reports/part of reports in respect of the following subjects have already beenreceived by the Standing Committee : Transparency of Monetary & Financial Policies (Final),Payment and Settlement System (Parts I and II ), Insurance Regulation (Final- Parts I and II), BankingSupervision (Part I), Accounting and Auditing (Final), Bankruptcy Laws (Interim). All Reports havebeen placed on the RBI website <www.rbi.org.in> and are in the process of being published forwider dissemination and discussion.6.2 The ‘Foreword’ to the first in these series of Reports on ‘Transparency in Monetary andFinancial Policies’ is presented as an Appendix to this paper. As may be seen, the effort is to makethe readers aware of what standards and codes are and their importance for national economies in thecurrent milieu.VII.  Plans for follow up7.1The submission of the Reports by Advisory Groups would be followed up in accordance with thedecisions of the Standing Committee meeting held on September 20, 2000.7.2The Standing Committee would consolidate the Reports of all Advisory Groups and prepareits own report containing executive summaries/highlights of all the reports, action points requiringattention by regulatory authorities/agencies concerned with the follow up.  The Standing Committeereport also would be widely disseminated to the public as the Advisory Group reports.7.3The Advisory Group would be requested to help organise a seminar/workshop for a day in anappropriate institution/centre for creating awareness and this would help the Standing Committee toconcretise the views on recommendations.7.4For each Report, a mailing list covering both public sector and private sector organizations,international institutions and experts, both local and international, would be also be identified andfinalised in consultation with the Chairman of each Advisory Group. The Standing Committee wouldrequest specific comments/feedback on the recommendations of the Advisory Group from theseaddressees.7.5The Standing Committee would prepare an annual review of status and progress regardingcompliance with, and implementation of standards and codes and submit it to the Ministry ofFinance.VIII. Highlights8.1The Indian position which recognises the significance, scope, limits and contextual degreeof relevance of international financial standard and codes has been considered by a broad spectrumof experts, intellectuals and market participants as reasonable.8.2Second, the need to assess Indian standards and codes with international benchmarks hasalso elicited broad support.8.3Third, the impact of the process could often be indirect and not necessarily direct andinstant. For example, the Secretary Department of Company Affairs in a recent address to theAccountants and Auditors referred to the work of the Standing Committee and related it to the ongoingamendments to the Company Law.8.4Fourth, the participative processes also have a multiplier effect in terms of several means bywhich the codes and standards are disseminated. For example, the widely read Economic Survey2000-01 of Government of India released as part of set of Budget Documents makes a detailedreference to the subject (vide Box 6.4 on International Financial Standards and Codes). There havealso been extensive references to this in several publications of Reserve Bank of India.8.5Fifth, several prominent intellectuals, professionals, and market participants contributed to theprocess of benchmarking, and identifying gaps and they participated in the exercise in a purelyhonorary capacity, as a national endeavor.
BIS Review 20/200178.6Sixth, such a process brought out the possible differing views between official bodies orauthorities and domestic independent opinion as regards the extent of compliance with such codesand standards. It is considered necessary to recognise this and try to arrive at a consensus.8.7Seventh, some concern on the part of official authorities to such an independentassessment is understandable but could be significantly overcome through their participation asspecial invitees and the efforts of advisory group which have members of national standing.8.8Eighth, many areas of overlap among the areas covered by different Advisory Groups wereobserved. Also, each Advisory Group had to interact with several regulatory and standard settingbodies. The process thus becomes quite complex, especially when the jurisdictional issues comeup.8.9Ninth, several standard setting bodies including professional associations and self-regulatorybodies of market participants involved with current practices have, on occasions had concerns aboutthe Advisory Groups findings but special efforts by the Advisory Groups helped assuage theseconcerns.8.10Tenth, the work of the Advisory Groups required substantial technical and professionalinputs located in several agencies, public and private. These had to be pooled and collated.8.11Eleventh, the Advisory Groups have found it difficult to focus entirely on compliance issuessince there is a preoccupation with immediate issues of operational significance to the marketparticipants and such issues may be policy or procedural or may even be of short term relevance. Themain focus has not been, however, lost sight of.8.12Twelfth, the enthusiasm for disclosure and transparency in public agencies is not matched byeagerness to be transparent on the part of private sector. The private sector’s participation in theprocess helped a better appreciation of the importance of disclosures.8.13Finally, four lessons from the exercise appear to be relevant. The process of implementationdemands significant resources and is time-consuming. Moreover, most of the follow-up activitiesrequire some legislative changes. In the ultimate analysis, adoption of the standards has to be drivenby self-interest of the country and attempts should be toward harmony and ultimate convergencerather than mechanical compliance.                                                     
BIS Review 19/20011Svein Gjedrem: The global economy and Norwegian monetary policyAddress by Mr Svein Gjedrem, Governor of the Norges Bank, at the Southern Norway Conference,Kristiansand, 6 March 2001.*      *      *IntroductionOver the past few centuries, Norway has been transformed from one of the poorest countries inEurope to one of the richest, thanks to its profits from international trade. Foreign capital was importantfor the utilisation of Norwegian natural resources.Cross-border capital flows have increased sharply, particularly in recent years. The chart showsNorwegian inward and outward direct investment. These are strategic investments involving ownershipinterests of 10 per cent or more, unlike portfolio investments that normally involve small stakes.Norwegian companies’ direct investment came to NOK 74 billion last year. The figures were boostedby substantial acquisitions abroad by Telenor and Norske Skog. Over the past two years foreigncompanies’ investment of this type in Norway came to around NOK 100 billion. Over time, Norwegianacquisitions abroad and foreign acquisitions in Norway are more or less balanced.
2BIS Review 19/2001The state is accumulating substantial foreign assets through the Government Petroleum Fund. Asresult of these investments, Norway is in a net asset position vis-(cid:224)-vis abroad. In addition Norwegianinsurance companies and securities funds have markedly increased their foreign investments in recentyears. At the same time, Norwegian banks finance a large share of their lending through foreigncapital, and foreign investors are steadily increasing their share of Norwegian securities holdings.What we are seeing is a sharp increase in private holdings of assets both in Norway and abroad. Thisconstitutes the core of globalisation. Capital finds its way to the highest return irrespective of nationalborders.Challenges posed by a global capital marketThe Norwegian capital market is part of a Nordic market, which is being increasingly integrated into aninternational capital market. Capital markets are a very efficient tool for channelling funds from saversto investors. Capital markets act as a catalyst for restructuring and growth, but also for financialbubbles and crises. This places new demands on economic policy.If a country is to benefit from a free capital market, it must draw up legislation providing for regulationsand supervision that ensure stability. Countries with poorly developed capital markets may benefitfrom some limitations. They should exercise some caution in opening these markets too suddenly. Theflow of capital is like electricity. Adequate insulation should be in place before it is turned on.When the Nordic countries liberalised credit markets in the 1980s, we experienced considerableproblems because supervision and rules were not adequate. The same was witnessed in the crisis inAsia and Russia a few years ago. Inadequate and ineffective legislation and supervision resulted inweak control of financial sectors in the beleaguered countries.The liberalisation of the capital market within a country requires national regulations and supervision.The liberalisation of capital movements across national borders requires coordination and regulation atan international level.Countries on the European continent have a regional approach to this. They have drawn up a set oflaws and rules that govern a common European market, the single market. Norway also participates inthis market by virtue of the EEA Agreement. European Monetary Union effectively removes thepossibility of speculation between the currencies of the countries involved, thereby increasing thestability of the financial system in Europe.International rules for economic relations with other countries are important, particularly for smallcountries. Cooperation within the framework of the WTO and GATT agreement on trade in goods andservices are examples of this. The OECD Capital Code, which provides a framework for membercountries(cid:146) laws and regulations on capital movements is another example. Initiatives have been takenby both the International Monetary Fund and the Bank for International Settlements to create a newinternational regulatory framework and system. The aim of this work is to reduce the risk and effects ofserious financial crises.One solution that will not be effective is the reimposition of direct capital controls, given the vastincrease in technological capabilities to evade them. The business sector is already international.Capital controls are disadvantageous to the business sector in the countries that introduce them.International developmentsTurnarounds in the international economy are often abrupt. 1998 was marked by pessimism. Thecrisis-hit countries in Asia were struggling. Russia was faced with severe economic problems. Lastyear, only two years later, growth in the world economy reached the highest rate recorded in 15 years.Global economic developments are marked by the turnaround in the US economy. The US accountsfor about 20 per cent of the world economy. The turnaround in the world’s largest economy will havean impact, also in Europe. The question is how severe the turnaround will be, and how strong theimpact will be on European economies.
BIS Review 19/20013The US economy expanded by 5 per cent last year. The upturn in the US has spanned almost 10years - the longest cyclical upturn ever. The chart shows OECD forecasts and actual developmentsover the past five years. As we can see, growth has been stronger then expected every year in thisperiod. At the same time, inflation was moderate and unemployment declined.Many observers attribute the prolonged period of strong growth to the new economy, which featuresthree main aspects:• The labour market had become more flexible. While earlier experience implied anacceleration in the rate of increase in wages and prices at an unemployment rate of six percent, unemployment fell to four per cent without triggering higher inflation.• Productivity growth increased in both the IT sector and in other industries. The forecasts forthe annual growth potential of the US economy were revised up substantially to around 4 percent.• Equity prices for technology stocks advanced sharply, with more than a sixfold increase inthe Nasdaq index from the beginning of 1995 to the peak in March 2000.Strong productivity growth and low wage growth led to a sharp increase in corporate profitability.Expectations of a continued rise in profits spurred sharp growth in investment. At the same time,advancing equity prices boosted household wealth. Households could reduce their current saving andstill increase wealth, allowing them to use a growing share of income for consumption.
4BIS Review 19/2001But imbalances heightened. The fall in the household saving ratio was based on gains in the stockmarket, which after a time reflected unrealistic expectations of future earnings. Corporate debtincreased sharply and current account deficits grew larger.In spring last year, equity prices declined. The Nasdaq index showed a particularly strong decline. Theindex continued to fall through autumn and winter, with the overall decline nearing 60 per cent. Themore broad-based stock indices have also shown a decline, albeit a more moderate one.Growth has been expected to slow this year for some time. In spite of this, the turnaround in the USeconomy was surprisingly strong and came faster than expected. Consumer and business confidenceindicators have shown a marked fall.The Federal Reserve has sought to counter the downturn. Interest rates were lowered by 1percentage point in January. The Government has announced substantial tax cuts. This maymoderate the downturn, but hardly bring it to a halt. Consolidation in the household and businesssector may imply lower consumption and investment for a period. In 2001, we expect the US economyto expand by less than half the rate recorded last year.Growth in the Japanese economy is also sluggish, but the downturn in Japan has continued for tenyears.
BIS Review 19/20015At the beginning of the 1990s the financial bubble burst, following a sharp increase in stock andproperty values in the preceding years. The banking industry faced serious problems, which have stillnot be solved.In addition, government debt has increased sharply in recent years, but neither strong growth in publicspending nor near-zero interest rate levels has sufficed to boost growth in the Japanese economy.
6BIS Review 19/2001Growth in Europe was weak in the mid-1990s. The situation has shown a substantial improvement,particularly from 1997. Growth has picked up and unemployment has declined in an environment ofmoderate price and wage inflation.The US and Japan account for close to a third of the world economy. When their economiesdeteriorate, the question is whether the upturn in Europe is sufficiently robust to maintain itsmomentum.Historically, there has been a close correlation between developments in the US and Europe. Slowgrowth in the US economy will also now have an effect on demand for European goods, but theeffects via financial markets are likely to be more important. A turnaround in the US could feed throughto European stock markets and may also trigger financial unrest.Thus far developments in the US have not resulted in a corresponding turnaround in Europe. Shareprices in Europe have been relatively stable so far this year, and European economies are stillshowing solid growth.The effects on the Norwegian economyThere are no signs of unrest among economic agents in Norway. Households and enterprises stillexpect growth in future income. If oil prices fall, the situation may be different.The chart shows the probability of various oil prices ahead. The curve is based on prices in the optionsmarket for contracts maturing in December. The vertical axis shows that market participants havepriced in a 10 per cent probability that oil prices will be below USD 18 per barrel in December 2001and a 10 per cent probability that oil prices will be higher than USD 35.5 per barrel in December thisyear. This would suggest considerable uncertainty.
BIS Review 19/20017The chart shows that high oil prices and petroleum production are generating large current accountand budget surpluses, with an attendant increase in Norway’s disposable income. The current accountsurplus came to about 14 per cent of GDP last year, which is one of the highest surpluses recorded inan OECD country in the post-war period. In addition, government budget surpluses have increasedsharply and reached 14 1/2 per cent of GDP.The Government Petroleum Fund shall serve as a buffer against short-term fluctuations in oilrevenues. As large portions of the revenues from oil activities accrue to the state, fluctuations in oilprices and oil revenues will primarily result in changes in allocations to the Petroleum Fund. Since allof the capital in the Petroleum Fund is invested abroad, such changes will in principle not influence thelevel of activity in the economy. This makes the Norwegian economy more robust to fluctuations in oilprices and thus less dependent on oil, even in the short run.Nevertheless, the mainland economy is not completely protected from fluctuations in the oil price. Afall in oil prices will influence petroleum investment and may thereby have a direct impact onemployment in some industries. Household and business income expectations may also be affected.A shift in international developments may also have a direct effect on the Norwegian economy viafinancial markets.An international turnaround with a decline in equity prices could influence enterprises’ possibilities forfinancing investment. Household wealth may also decrease. Norwegian households’ direct ownershipin enterprises is still smaller than in many other countries, which suggests that the effect on domesticdemand via equity prices will be limited.Perhaps the most important transmission channel is the foreign exchange market. The experience ofrecent years shows that international financial market developments can have a short-term impact onthe krone exchange rate. Heightened uncertainty and unrest in foreign exchange markets can lead tohigher risk premia on small countries’ currencies. Developments in 1998 are one example, when thekrone came under growing pressure as a result of the sharp fall in oil prices, turbulence in internationalcapital market in the wake of the Russian crisis and imbalances in the Norwegian economy.Monetary policyThe long-term objective of monetary policy is to provide the Norwegian economy with a nominalanchor - domestic price stability, and thereby the basis for a stable krone. Nominal stability is the bestcontribution monetary policy can make to economic growth and prosperity. A nominal anchor is also anecessary precondition for stable financial markets and property markets. High inflation and wideswings in the exchange rate impair the function of prices as an information vehicle. This leads tobooms followed by busts and an arbitrary redistribution of income and wealth. Inflation thereforepoisons the economy. By linking movements in the krone to the euro, we have chosen to follow thesame standard for nominal stability in the economy as set by the euro area countries.
8BIS Review 19/2001Since 1997, inflation has been higher in Norway than in the euro area. The difference partly reflects aperiod of strong growth in Norway, while the level of activity in Europe has been low. But the relativelyhigh inflation rate in Norway cannot continue as this will undermine the basis for stability in the kroneexchange rate and weaken confidence in monetary policy.Short-term capital inflows and outflows are probably the most important factor determining movementsin the krone exchange rate from day to day, from week to week and from one quarter to the next. Theyare governed by expectations concerning future returns. Changes in expectations concerning thefuture value of the krone can trigger extensive capital movements.As a rule, Norges Bank does not intervene in foreign exchange markets with a view to influencing thekrone exchange rate. The krone is floating, and the value of the krone fluctuates in periods by thesame magnitude as exchange rates in other open economies. Nevertheless, the prevailing stability ofthe krone is largely a reflection of confidence that inflation in Norway will be kept at a low level.Our experience is that changes in the Norwegian interest rate level only have a predictable effect onthe krone exchange rate when the change in interest rates also contributes to stabilising inflation.However, the relationship between interest rates and price and cost developments is uncertain. Thesetting of interest rates thus requires the use of professional judgement and discretion. The basis forexercising discretion is subject to limitations, however. Should any doubt arise as to whether theinterest rate is oriented towards nominal stability, this would trigger substantial capital movements.Interaction with income formationA precondition for a stable krone exchange rate against European currencies is that price and costinflation in Norway must over time not exceed the corresponding aim for inflation of the EuropeanCentral Bank (ECB). The ECB orients monetary policy to maintain price stability, which has beendefined as inflation of less than 2 per cent.
BIS Review 19/20019In recent years, cost inflation in the euro area countries and among trading partners has beenrelatively low. Growth in labour costs in Norway has been roughly 11 percentage points higher than inthe euro area and 10 percentage points higher than among trading partners for the past three years.A number of other small, open economies have recorded a decline in unemployment and lower growthin labour costs than Norway. In Sweden, unemployment has shown a substantial decrease over thepast five years and wage growth is below 4 per cent. Three-year wage agreements are now beingconcluded, underpinning the basis for low cost inflation. In the Netherlands, unemployment has fallento a very low level. Wage growth has picked up, but is lower than in Norway. In Denmark,unemployment has come down without an increase in wage growth. In Finland, unemployment hasfallen sharply from the high level that took hold in the 1990s, and wage growth has slowed. In the euroarea, unemployment has dropped without an increase in wage growth. In Norway, the high growth inlabour costs may be a source of rising unemployment.Interaction with fiscal policyIt is important that the annual budgets are based on a long-term strategy that takes into accountpossible fluctuations in oil revenues from one year to the next. With large and, to some extent, varyingbudget revenues, the basis for determining central government expenditure and taxes from one yearto the next may easily be impaired. If budget spending is allowed to vary in step with oil prices, theNorwegian economy may experience abrupt shifts and instability. Changes in oil prices may thenquickly influence wage and price expectations, the exchange rate and long-term rates. In addition,short-term rates would have to be changed frequently and sharply.
10BIS Review 19/2001In recent years, central government real underlying spending growth has accelerated somewhat. In2000 and 2001, spending growth has been higher than 2 per cent, which is higher than normal growthin the mainland economy. At the same time, direct and indirect taxes have increased. Fiscal policy hasthus had a virtually neutral effect on domestic demand for two years while wage growth has beensubstantially higher than in other countries.A possible interpretation of this development is that it is more demanding to use the governmentbudget to dampen cyclical fluctuations during an upturn than during a downturn. The willingness andability to pursue a counter-cyclical policy may in itself be cyclical. Another interpretation is that aneutral fiscal stance this year, with a strong increase in government financial wealth, is a balancedapproach to using the budget to stabilise the economy while phasing in an increase in financial incomein the economy.ConclusionThe Norwegian economy is fragile and vulnerable. As long as oil prices are high, the Norwegianeconomy is fairly sheltered. Many central banks are now reducing their key rates. As our economy isaffected to a lesser extent, the differential between short rates in Norway and abroad may widen.Thank you for your attention.
BIS Review 18/20011Willem Duisenberg: Hearing before the Committee on Economic and MonetaryAffairs of the European ParliamentHearing before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament withDr Willem F Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, held in Brussels, 5 March 2001.*      *      *Introductory statementIt is my pleasure to continue today our regular exchange of views on monetary policy and otheractivities of the ECB and the Eurosystem. As usual, I shall first present the ECB's analysis on recenteconomic developments and its assessment of the prospects in the euro area, focusing on how tofoster the continuation of non-inflationary growth in the euro area. Then, I shall report to you onseveral important decisions taken by the Governing Council of the ECB with regard to the introductionof euro banknotes and coins.Before beginning my speech, I should once again like to take this opportunity to welcome the newestmember of the euro area. By adopting the single currency on 1 January 2001, Greece has become thetwelfth member of the euro area, sharing the rights and obligations of the other Member States whichhave already adopted the single currency.1. Economic and monetary developmentsSince the last hearing before this Committee on 23 November 2000 the Governing Council of the ECBhas decided to keep the ECB's main interest rates unchanged. This was because, overall, recentdevelopments have pointed towards more balanced risks to price stability than the ones prevailing atthe time of our last meeting. However, some factors still argue for caution. Allow me to comment inmore detail on the Governing Council's assessment of the current economic situation in the euro area.I should like to start with the first pillar of the monetary policy strategy of the ECB. On 14 December2000, the Governing Council decided to confirm the existing reference value for monetary growth,namely an annual growth rate of 4 1/2% for the broad monetary aggregate M3. This decision wastaken on the grounds that the evidence continues to support the assumptions underlying the derivationof the first reference value in December 1998 (and confirmed in December 1999), namely those fortrend potential output growth and the trend decline in M3 income velocity in the euro area.Turning to recent monetary developments, there were already indications in November 2000 that amoderation in monetary growth had been under way for some months. In late 2000 and early 2001,these signs of moderation became stronger. According to the latest available data, the three-monthaverage of the annual growth rates of M3 in the months from November 2000 to January 2001 was5%, gradually moving into the direction of the reference value of 4 1/2%. All in all, the risks to pricestability from the monetary side have become increasingly balanced.As regards the second pillar, since my last appearance before this Committee, several developmentshave changed somewhat the prospects of economic growth in the euro area. On the one hand, theslowdown in the US economy and developments in Japan have increased the uncertainty surroundingthe prospects for world growth. On the other hand, the fall in oil prices should have positive incomeeffects in the euro area.All the information available shows that euro area real GDP growth declined slightly in the second halfof last year compared with the strong growth recorded in the first half. However, the general outlookfor this year and the next remains positive. Economic activity in the euro area is mainly determined bydomestic factors such as long-term financing costs and disposable income developments, which haveremained favourable. In addition, the euro area's high rates of capacity utilisation, the ongoing growthin employment and continued declines in unemployment should help to maintain solid growth inprivate investment and consumption. All in all, the overall level of confidence in the euro area hasremained high. Economic indicators relating to developments around the turn of the year support theview that economic growth will remain fairly robust for the period ahead. Although the more moderate
2BIS Review 18/2001prospects for world growth might end up being associated with a certain slowdown in euro areaexports, at present there are no convincing signs that the slowdown in the US economy is havingsignificant and lasting spill-over effects on the euro area economy as a whole. Nevertheless, a closemonitoring of global developments is warranted.As regards recent price developments, the annual rate of increase in the Harmonised Index ofConsumer Prices (HICP) in January 2001 was 2.4%, as published by Eurostat, 0.2 percentage pointslower than in December 2000. Since November 2000, developments in oil prices and the exchangerate of the euro have contributed to lower short-term inflationary pressures. In January, the rate ofincrease in energy prices continued to decline, but other HICP components, notably unprocessed foodand services prices, rose significantly.As developments in oil prices and the foreign exchange rate in January and February 2001 have beensubject to some volatility, caution should be exercised when assessing their likely impact on HICPinflation in the short-term. Moreover, indirect effects of past oil price increases and euro depreciationare still coming through as witnessed by the continued rise in producer price increases for consumergoods. Other short-term factors, such as increases in indirect taxation or in administered prices, mayalso prevent consumer price inflation from falling rapidly below 2% over the next few months.I should also like to emphasise that market participants consider the current level of consumer priceinflation as temporary. Bond yields in the euro area indicate that the general expectation is for inflationto be within the ECB's definition of price stability in the medium term. The ECB is committed to fulfilthis expectation.The current uncertainty regarding the prospects for world economic growth heightens the need tomaintain the foundations for strong non-inflationary growth in the euro area as well as to strengthenthe potential of the economy. The ECB shares the objective of the governments and citizens of theeuro area of a growing prosperity in the euro area. By focusing on the maintenance of price stabilityover the medium term, the ECB is making an essential contribution to the achievement of thisobjective.At the same time, it is of paramount importance that all policy actors help to maintain the currentfavourable outlook for growth and inflation in the euro area.First, it is crucial that social partners continue the process of wage moderation seen in the past. Thiswill not only facilitate the task of monetary policy, but will also contribute to continuing the process ofreducing unemployment in the euro area.In addition, long-term growth perspectives for the euro area will benefit if governments intensify theirefforts to progress along the path of fiscal consolidation. I consider that budgetary plans recentlyexpressed in countries' updated stability programmes are not very ambitious as tax cuts are notaccompanied by appropriate expenditure restraints. If the macroeconomic environment remains asfavourable as expected, the envisaged fiscal policy stance could add to demand pressures. Fiscalpolicy could, thus, become an additional source of upward risks to price stability. In addition, thestability programmes do not make the necessary progress in addressing long-term fiscal challenges.These challenges include, inter alia, the budgetary adjustments needed in many countries to cope withpopulation ageing.More efforts are also needed in the ongoing process of implementing structural reforms to foster thegrowth potential of the euro area. This is of crucial importance to promote the supply of labour andcapital and to innovate and disseminate new technologies and production methods. More flexibility inlabour markets and reforms aimed at enhancing labour force participation are needed to offset the lowgrowth in the working age population. Additional measures that are needed are the removal of barriersto investment and the creation of the institutional structures needed for a rapid and efficient adoptionof new technologies. In this respect, the Governing Council considers that there is no clear indicationyet that these structural factors have led to a measurable and lasting increase in productivity growth inthe euro area. This notwithstanding, the uncertainties surrounding estimates of the medium-termdevelopment of potential output growth in the euro area have become skewed to the upside. Thisbeing the case the Governing Council will carefully monitor further evidence of an acceleration ofproductivity growth in the euro area. The ECB's monetary policy would naturally take such changesappropriately into account, if and when they occur.
BIS Review 18/200132.Issues relating to the introduction of euro banknotes and coinsI should now like to report on several decisions that have been taken by the Governing Council of theECB with regard to the euro cash changeover on 1 January 2002.Given the crucial importance of this matter and the responsibility of the Eurosystem as a whole toachieve a smooth cash changeover, the Governing Council has adopted an ECB Guideline on the2002 cash changeover. The aim of this Guideline is to ensure that the framework of the changeover isconsistently implemented, such as the provisions for frontloading and sub-frontloading and thefinancial modalities for credit institutions, as well as to provide a level playing-field for all creditinstitutions, their agents and sub-frontloaded entities. The ECB Guideline can be viewed on the ECB'swebsite and has also been published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.Moreover, the Governing Council considered measures which should help to ensure the availability ofeuro banknotes in non-euro area countries, so that customers demanding euro banknotes are able toobtain them in a timely and efficient manner. This is particularly relevant for countries in eastern andsouth-eastern Europe. For example, a significant amount of Deutsche Mark-denominated banknotesare estimated to be held in these countries, and also some other euro area currencies are held outsidetheir national borders. Therefore, the Governing Council agreed on the following principles regardingthe distribution of frontloaded euro banknotes outside the euro area:• credit institutions which are counterparties for monetary policy operations within the Eurosystemwill be allowed to distribute frontloaded euro banknotes to their branches, or headquarters, asappropriate, located outside the euro area;• credit institutions with their main place of business inside the euro area will be allowed to sub-frontload euro banknotes to their subsidiaries that are also credit institutions and are locatedoutside the euro area or to other credit institutions which have neither their registered nor theirhead office inside the euro area; and• branches, headquarters and subsidiaries of euro area-based credit institutions, as well as othercredit institutions, located outside the euro area, to which euro banknotes would be distributed orsub-frontloaded, are not allowed to further sub-frontload euro banknotes to any third party (egretailers) whatsoever.In contrast to the euro area, where frontloading and sub-frontloading may start as from 1 September2001, the distribution and sub-frontloading outside the euro area will only be permitted as from1 December 2001.Regarding the Euro 2002 Information Campaign, I should like to report to you that a detailed outlinehas been agreed and presented to the media, including the principal slogan to be used throughout thewhole information campaign: the EURO. OUR money.Moreover, a website dedicated to the campaign was launched in all 11 official languages of theEuropean Community, and can be visited at www.euro.ecb.int. The website contains a number ofsections providing a broad range of information which should help specialist groups and the generalpublic to prepare for the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins.The Governing Council also agreed to organise a series of conferences on euro changeover issues- the "Euro 2002 Information Campaign conferences" - which will bring together the key partiesinvolved in the euro cash changeover process at both national and European level. These events willbe organised in the course of 2001 in all euro area Member States, hosted by the respective nationalcentral bank. The conferences will support the visibility of the Euro 2002 Information Campaign andprepare the ground for the mass media part of the campaign, which will begin in earnest in the lastquarter of the year. The first conference of this series, to be hosted by the National Bank of Belgium,will take place tomorrow here in Brussels.
BIS Review 18/20011Alberto Romero: At the beginning of a new century: the current economic andfinancial situation in the Netherlands AntillesSpeech by Mr Alberto Romero, Executive Director Bank van de Nederlandse Antillen at the "Arubaand Curaçao Tourism and Public Finances" seminar, 3 March 2001.*      *      *IntroductionLadies and gentlemen, good morning. I would like to thank the UNA for inviting me today to present toyou an overview of the economic and financial development of the Netherlands Antilles during the last15 years.Let me also express my appreciation for my friends of the Central Bank of Aruba that are here todayand that have accepted the invitation of the UNA to participate in this seminar. During the last decadethe cooperation between the Central Bank of Aruba and our Central Bank has grown to become oneof mutual respect for each other’s work and there also exists a great desire between staff members ofboth institutions to cooperate with each other, to share information and work closely together on topicsof common interests.As you all know, our economy has been suffering from a severe recession since 1996. During the year2000 only, the Antillean economy shrank as measured by the gross domestic product (GDP) by anestimated 4.4%. This decline can be explained by a weak domestic demand, migration, new taxmeasures, lay-off, all of which resulted in reduced private consumption. Private investment alsodeclined due to a lack of confidence in and uncertainty of the economic future of our country. Inaddition, the difficult financial situation of the governments constrained further domestic publicexpenditures.All these factors contributed to a further lowering of the domestic spending and this is now reflected ina depressed economy and a constantly shrinking GDP since 1996.Going back to the last decade of the 20th century our real GDP recorded an average growth of only0.7% as compared for instance to all developing economies which showed an average growth of 2.4%. As an economist it is in a sense puzzling to see that, while the world economy has been expandingduring these past few years, and our major trading partners, the USA and Holland, are showingremarkable positive overall economic performance, we do not seem to benefit from thesedevelopments and are even falling behind in the region.One would wonder as to what the main causes are for our poor performance, particularly if placedwithin the context of new emerging international trade relations and a positive business environment.Let me give you my views on the various internal weaknesses that have, to a great extent, hamperedeconomic growth in the Netherlands Antilles during the past few decades.• In the first place the mounting disequilibrium in the fiscal balances of the governments as aresult of the weakened tax base and rising expenditures on wages, salaries and interest is amain reason for the poor economic development;• In the second place, and closely related to the fiscal imbalance, is the weak balance ofpayments outcome. Given the openness of our economy, the medium to long term effects offiscal imbalances will unequivocally be reflected in imbalances in the current account of thebalance of payments;• Thirdly the rigidity in the labor market and the related high general cost of doing business, toa great extent have resulted in high unemployment. There is a simple law in economics thathas proven to be useful for policy-makers. Whenever the per unit labor cost rises above theproductivity level of labor, employment opportunities will shrink and unemployment will rise.In addition the poor results in the educational field and inconsistent human resource trainingprograms have resulted in a high youth unemployment and massive migration of thisyounger age-group of our community to Holland;
2BIS Review 18/2001• The various attempts to modify, adapt and re-shape our tax structure has gradually raisedthe tax burden on the islands of the Netherlands Antilles and this has resulted in additionalcost effects that is now spreading throughout the economy;• The policies to correct perceived market failures in the past has caused our product marketto become rigid and, associated with this development, the price mechanism did notcorrectly reflect the demand and supply situation in the various market segments;• Finally the lengthy discussion between the two layers of government has practicallyparalyzed the urgently needed efficient functioning of the decision making process.Some of the above mentioned weaknesses, particularly those associated with high budget deficits,triggered an unsustainable high public debt and as a consequence of this a financial crisis that startedoriginally in the public sector, but is now spreading throughout our society, creating a social andeconomic crisis, accompanied by increasing poverty and a migrating population.To address the topic of this seminar I have chosen to single out two main areas of risk that haveintensified due to the crisis in the public sector. I will first start with the consequences of the publicsector’s financial situation for APNA’s public pension scheme. In addition to the negative effects of theimbalance in the public sector on the pension fund, we also see that the interest burden in the budgetsof the governments have magnified due to the uncontrollable debt situation.Rationalizing the APNA pension schemeAnother important side-effect of the situation in government finances is the imbalance in the publicpension fund system (APNA) that I would like to discuss with you next.Since 1998 the governments have focused their efforts on rationalizing and reforming the public sectorpension scheme. It is important to note that the cost savings efforts that the governments haveintroduced into the pension scheme must be seen as important positive steps to bring the publicpension system more in line with private sector pension schemes. Despite the increasing criticism onthe foreseen reforms, one should have do bear in mind that the long term viability of the fund is atstake if no reforms are undertaken now.Various cost saving measures were implemented with the objective to balance the contribution of theparticipants in the scheme on the one hand and to safeguard their pension benefits in the long run.Some of the most important rationalization measures were:• Raising the retirement age to 60 years;• full pension rights will be obtained after 35 years of service for new participants in thescheme instead of 30 years;• the early retirement option for new participants into the fund was eliminated while a gradualphasing out of this option for those that acquired this right prior to 1998 is being worked out;• the inclusion of the AOV (old age pension) into the public pension scheme.Due to all these amendments into the APNA scheme the total premium paid has abruptly beenreduced from 34% in the past to the current 16%. In addition this 16% premium scale has now beenchanged into a so-called dynamic premium system, which was proposed by the management andboard of the APNA.This dynamic premium scheme is based on the crucial assumption on the level of the funding ratio,being the ratio between the liquid assets and the pension liabilities.If the funding ratio at a given point in time becomes higher than 115% the dynamic contributionscheme automatically adapts the total premium to be paid to the APNA by lowering it by 1% pointsfrom 16%. If on the other hand the funding ratio falls below the 95% threshold, the total premium willhave to be raised by 2% points from the basis of 16%. With a funding ratio between 105% and 115%the total premium can be maintained at its present level of 16%.Based upon these assumptions made by APNA the present 16% dynamic premium scale is in theshort term at the safe end. Recently1 also an IMF panel of experts concluded that this premium                                                     1 Special IMF mission that studied the pension scheme from January 29 to February 8, 2001
BIS Review 18/20013scheme could be maintained in the short term on condition that the actuarial assumption used in thecalculation of this new premium scheme be re-evaluated by an independent actuarial study.Other important considerations however, should be studied in more detail in order to mitigate thelonger term risk to the public pension system. One of these risks factors is the modus operandi of allisland governments that together contribute to the premium system. In the past decade without anyexception all of the island governments and the general government were unable to meet the fullpension contribution and therefore forced the pensionfund management and board into renegotiatingand converting premium arrears into new interest bearing loans. It is also important and fair to statethat the governments were able to fully comply with the interest payments obligations to the fund.One of the consequences of this payment attitude results in a forced annual or automatic ‘investment’of the APNA in government securities, and due to this development currently 45% of the balancesheet assets of the public pension fund is made up of receivables from the governments. Theliquidation of these assets to comply with the short term pension obligations will become crucial at onepoint in the future and this needs closer attention and monitoring of the APNA management andboard.As long as there is certainty that these government securities can be readily and easily liquidated intoa secondary security market, there is no risk at all for the pensionfund obligations. The story becomesmore worrisome if the liquidation of these securities cannot easily be converted into cash. This shouldbe, in my view, the focal point in the discussions among the participants of the APNA pension schemein the coming years.In the past some other possible solutions were brought forward for consideration to APNA and thegovernments in order to safeguard the long term viability of this public pension scheme. Some of theoptions discussed were:• the opening up of the scheme for other non-governmental participants to reduce the risks ofover investment into one type of security;• a further increase in the retirement age to e.g. 62 or 65 years to also better reflect the life-expectancy on the islands;• reorientation of the premium system from a "defined benefit" system into a "definedcontribution" system.In my view these are important issues to be discussed in order to further rationalize the APNA pensionscheme in the future.The relation public debt and interest payments.The second important side effect of the consistently high budget deficits of the past is shown in anincreasing share of interest payments into the total public sector expenditures. This phenomenon isalso related to the aforementioned conversion of arrears to creditors (including APNA) into interestbearing loans.In 1986 for instance the interest payments in the budgets of the governments amounted to NAf 25.4million or 7.9% as a share of the total public expenditure. The most recent data on the public sectorinterest burden shows that for February of 2001 the total interest payment amounts to NAf.226.4million or 15.6% of the total expenditures of the general government. This means that in a 15 years’time-span the share of the interest payments in the total expenditures have doubled. Thisdevelopment should be of great concern for policy makers on the islands for various reasons. Some ofthese reasons are:• If for instance the governments had been able to theoretically operate the public sectorwithout debts in the past 15 years, this would have generated savings of over 200 millionguilders in the year 2001 only;• Furthermore, these 200 million guilders of interest savings would have generated in theprivate sector billions of guilders of investments because of the fewer crowding out effects ofpublic expenditures than we are currently experiencing;                                                                                                                                                                     
4BIS Review 18/2001• The deterioration in public assets as a consequence of maintenance backlogs would havebeen reversed if only part of the savings mentioned in this context would have been investedin these assets;• Finally we should imagine the positive effects that investment of these 200 million in savingshad generated in the educational field for the entire community.I have given you just a few general remarks on the positive external effects that a more balanced andresponsible management of public funds would have generated in the past decades.The focus on new economic areas of development for the futureConsidering the fact that the real per capita income of the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba2 is morethan US$ 10.000 this situation does not put us in the range of the ‘poor countries’. On the other handthere seems to be a concern, particularly on the islands of the Netherlands Antilles, that thedistribution of this income is not equitable among all members of our community. According to somestudies done last year on the poverty situation on the islands of the Netherlands Antilles, there seemsto be an increasing poverty among our fellow countrymen and some of them regrettably have takenthe easy way out of poverty through migration to the Netherlands.In the past 20 years the islands of the Netherlands Antilles have been hit by a number of externalshocks which are still having an important negative effect on the GDP of our country. I do not have torepeat here the reasons for these external shocks nor will I dwell in detail on the background of theexternal shocks, but recent estimates put the income effect of these external shocks at approximately20% of GDP or over 800 million guilders. Particularly for well developed economies this type of severeeconomic blows of this magnitude would have thrown them back for years in development if noexternal assistance had been available. As an example the Latin-American debt crisis of the 80s is anexcellent reference point in time to illustrate how external shocks can severely hamper economicdevelopment in larger and less vulnerable economies. Still, many countries in Latin America are slowlyrecovering from these shock even today.How have we reacted to these external shocks here since 1986? There is a number of ways that canbe given on how we are managing ourselves out of this crisis:Migration as a social safety net:During the last 5 years and estimated number of some 40.0003 persons from our islands (mainly fromCuraçao) left to Holland to secure a better future for their families.The migration has dramatically affected the workplace, so much that it is one of the explanations forthe tempered decline in the unemployment rate. This migration makes it also more difficult to quicklyrecover from the recession on the islands. For the year 2000 we estimate that the unemployment ratedeclined from 15.5% to approximately 14.9%, in spite of the economic downturn. This is to a greatextent attributable to the migration effects.Labor market flexibility:Another important explanation for the structurally high unemployment rate is the rigidity problems thelabor market on the islands of the Netherlands Antilles. Under the program of economic recovery thatthis government signed with the IMF on September 15, 2000 significant positive steps wereundertaken to increase flexibility in our markets. Most of the economic measures agreed upon with theIMF are focused on enhancing labor market flexibility and improving the business climate.For example, almost all measures related to the labor market are focussed on increasing the flexibilityfor the employer to adjust capacity to market demand. Furthermore, the procedures for obtaining apermit for establishing a business are being streamlined, and it was agreed to introduce more flexibilityin regulations on shop opening hours. Moreover, legislation on e-commerce and on the establishmentof economic zones (E-zones) has been adopted by parliament in order to promote business                                                     2  For Aruba the real capita income as per the end of 1999 reached US$11.6003 Preliminary information of the Statistics (CBS) "Census 2001" indicates that the population of Curaçao dropped from144.000 to 130.000 from 1992 2001
BIS Review 18/20015development. In addition to these local efforts, several international organizations are involved inassessing the business climate. The Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS), a subsidiary of theWorld Bank, is looking into the attractiveness of the Netherlands Antilles as a location to invest, whilethe OECD has evaluated the legislation for the international financial and business services sector.Furthermore, during a two-week mission in December 2000, the World Bank visited all the islands inan effort to develop a long term economic growth strategy for the Netherlands Antilles.Debt financing to pay for adjustments:The third way we are trying to get out of the crisis is through debt refinancing. I have to clarify myposition on this by saying that this is not the correct way of resolving the crisis.Since 19864 our governments have adopted the policy of adjustments through additional localfinancing and accumulation of arrears. To a great extent this policy option explains the growing debtand interest burden in the public sector budgets.Coming back now to the more recent economic and financial situation, I can say the following. On thefiscal front, a budget deficit of NAf.160 million (3.6% of GDP) is estimated for the year 2000.Compared to 1999, government revenues have increased considerably due to more tax revenues.This increase resulted from the rise of turnover tax rates and measures to improve the tax assessmentand collection. On the other hand, expenditures increased also, mainly because the government hadto pay part of the claims related to the Parker-guarantee to a foreign financial institution.The NAf. 160 million budget deficit equals the target agreed upon with the IMF in the Memorandum ofEconomic Policies, signed on September 15, 2000. This program, which has to be implementedbefore the end of March 2001, contains a number of measures in various areas, such as the reductionof the budget deficit, the flexibilisation of the labor and product markets, and trade liberalization.Furthermore, the program contains targets for the level of credit extension and the foreign exchangereserves. As a result of the agreement with the IMF, the Dutch government has made available asubstantial amount of liquidity support in 2000 (NAf. 110 million). The release of these funds isconditional on the progress made in the implementation of the policy measures.For 2001 no economic recovery is yet foreseen, as economic activity is expected to drop by 0.5%.This decline is related to the drop in public expenditures in an effort to cut the budget deficit by 50%.In addition to the decline in public expenditures, private consumption will drop further due to continuedmigration, the reduction in the number of civil servants and the freeze on government salaries.In contrast, private investment is expected to pick up in 2001. This increase is related to several largeinvestment projects in the tourism sector and at the Isla refinery. Contrary to domestic demand, foreigndemand is excepted to increase as a result of a recovery in stay-over tourism.The inflation rate accelerated from 0.8% in 1999 to 5.1% in 2000, mainly due to the increase inturnover tax rates. In addition to this domestic factor, the sharp increase in the oil price and theincrease in inflation at our main trading partners contributed to the higher price level.The tourism industry is currently undergoing a difficult period. Stay-over tourism has been slow forsome time, and the spectacular increase in cruise tourism has not been able to compensate for this.The decline in stay-over tourism particularly for Curaçao and Bonaire, is related to the weak Euro,which makes our islands more expensive for European visitors. Fortunately, the average length of stayand the average amount spent on the islands have increased slightly, dampening the effect of thedrop in the number of visitors.The tourism industry in the Netherlands Antilles is expected to improve, as room capacity will berestored in St. Maarten. The projections for Curaçao looks quite positive also, as a number ofinvestment projects are under way, like Brionplein Hotel, Kura Hulanda, Cornelisbaai, and Jan ThielBaai.                                                     4This was the last year that the general government had a positive balance in their budgets.
6BIS Review 18/2001Furthermore, there are plans for tourism related projects at Caracasbaai and Blauw Baai, while theCuraçao Ports Authority is considering a second mega-pier to accommodate the growth in cruisetourism.To conclude, we have to acknowledge that the Antillean economy has been going through a deeprecession during the past few years. The financial crisis with the government spread through the entireeconomy, creating a social and economic crisis. The only way out of this negative spiral is to tackle thefinancial problems of the government. The government has made considerable progress in theimplementation of the policy program agreed upon with the IMF, but some delays have surfacedduring the last two months. The reduction in the financial needs of the government, coupled with thegradual restoration of confidence, will lay in my view a solid basis for sustainable economic growth.Economic growth will create better prospects for jobs and an improvement of living standards.
BIS Review ??/20011Laurence Meyer: The new Basel capital proposalRemarks by Mr Laurence H. Meyer, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem, at the Annual Washington Conference of the Institute of International Bankers, Washington,D.C., 5 March 2001.*      *      *I am pleased to be here today to speak with you about the proposed new Basel Capital Accord, whichwas issued for public comment on January 16th. Developing and implementing a revised capitalaccord – and the associated other changes in supervisory practices – is a watershed in bankingsupervision. It will clearly affect banks' plans and practices in the years ahead – particularly the large,internationally active banks represented here. Thus, it is important to both the bankers and theregulators that you carefully review and comment on this proposal. In my remarks today, I will raisesome issues that I believe should particularly be called to your attention. I urge you to think carefullyabout them and let the regulators around the world know your views.More than a decade ago, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision adopted the current accord forseveral reasons: (1) to make the capital requirements more sensitive to risk profiles among banks;(2) to factor off-balance-sheet exposures into the assessment of capital adequacy; (3) to minimizedisincentives to holding liquid, low-risk assets; and (4) to achieve greater consistency in supervisoryassessments of bank capital adequacy throughout the world.These same objectives underlie the new proposal. Let me be clear: The 1988 accord, the current rule,has served us well. At its inception, it was a significant step forward, reflecting the state of risk-management technology at the time; it also clearly reflected compromises necessary for internationalagreement. But technology and business practice have moved on, and for the larger institutions thisdecade-old rule has developed critical shortcomings. Risk-measurement practices have improved, andcapital markets have become more tightly intertwined. Assumptions and shortcuts taken in the currentaccord are far too crude, given practices today. To take one example, large, complex bankingorganizations now routinely structure their portfolios in ways that arbitrage around the current capitalstandard. These banks can often lower their capital requirements with little, if any, reduction in theiractual risk-taking. As a result, reported capital ratios may – and too often do – overstate a bank's truefinancial strength.Thus we need a capital framework that is more risk-sensitive and compatible with current marketpractice. Absolute levels of capital must be consistent with risk in order not to shift risk-taking eitheraway from or to banks, but we also need a standard that better reflects relative levels of risk.Identifying and correctly measuring relative risk is critical for avoiding capital arbitrage. Because thecurrent standard largely ignores the relative risks of different assets, it encourages banks to shedover-capitalized, low-risk assets and to retain high-risk assets for which capital requirements are tooweak In short, the increasing sophistication of markets demands that, to be effective, regulatory capitalcharges need to be reasonably attuned to underlying economic risks.Key innovations in the new proposalThe proposed new capital accord is both far reaching and ground breaking. It redefines the regulatoryapproach to bank supervision and provides new incentives for banks to improve theirrisk-measurement procedures. It is a recognition that technology and market practices have changedand that our oversight function needs to change, too. Let me call your attention to some of the mostimportant innovations in the new proposal.Three pillarsAs many of you know from an earlier 1999 proposal, the Basel Committee's approach rests on threeso-called pillars: (1) the new capital standard itself; (2) an increased supervisory review of a bank'sinternal assessment of its own capital adequacy; and (3) additional public disclosure of bank risk
2BIS Review ??/2001profiles. The original Basel Accord, in contrast, rested on a single pillar, the setting of a regulatoryminimum for capital.The first two pillars of the proposed accord distinguish two concepts of capital adequacy: theregulatory minimum in the first and economic capital needs of the institution in the second. Theregulatory minimum provides a threshold for early intervention by supervisors. Economic capital –determined by the bank but overseen by supervisors as part of the second pillar – is the amount ofcapital that the bank allocates both for internal management reasons and to achieve desired creditratings and risk premiums on its debt. The new proposal, in effect, increases the emphasis on thesupervisors' oversight of the institution's economic capital needs, as it refines the calculation of theregulatory minimum. And, of course, it seeks to obtain the assistance of market discipline as asupplement to supervisory oversight.These three pillars, I think, reflect important realities. As I noted earlier, changing technology andmarket practices are undermining the current accord at the largest institutions. They have also addedto the complexity of modern banking organizations, a complexity already in progress from theincreasing scale and globalization as well as from a widening range of banking activities. Thesefactors and the associated moral hazards from bank supervision and the increased systemic risk fromscale have left supervisors with a choice between more extensive and burdensome supervisoryoversight, on the one hand, and increased reliance on market discipline coupled with a more incentive-compatible regulatory and supervisory framework on the other.That is what the three pillars are all about. To be sure, the proposed capital standard – at least forlarger banks – is more complex than the current accord. But I emphasize that the proposal is based onevolving current best risk-management practices, which, in turn, represent the judgments of bankmanagers – not supervisors – of how best to measure and manage their risks given the availabletechnologies. The proposed accord requires banks to establish comprehensive risk-managementpolicies and then follow them. Supervisory oversight is designed broadly to test that this is occurring.Public disclosure is intended to harness market discipline so that supervisors can, in fact, be lessintrusive as the market becomes more so. As I will discuss further below, the proposals alsoencompass elements intended to make the regulatory capital framework more responsive toimprovements over time in banks' risk-measurement and -management capabilities.Clearly, the proposed capital framework will challenge both regulators and banking organizations.Although the Committee amended the accord, fully effective in 1998, to recognize internal measures of"value-at-risk" for trading activities, the effect of that amendment was quite small compared with whatwe are now proposing. In the United States, the trading amendment affected roughly a dozeninstitutions and applied, of course, only to their trading activities and market risk. Now we are dealingwith a more complex topic that goes to the core business of banking – credit risk. And we're trying totackle operational risk as well.Within the United States, both the Federal Reserve and the Comptroller of the Currency have, forseveral years now, focused their examinations on the adequacy of internal processes and controls,particularly at large, complex institutions. That approach is particularly consistent with the goal ofpillar 2. Supervisors here and abroad will be looking more than they did before at an institution's ownmethods for evaluating capital adequacy and at how well those methods serve the bank. The processwill be evolutionary, but it will continue along the path already begun.At the Federal Reserve, we began that process more than a year ago, with the adoption of oursupervisory policy statement, SR 99-18. In that letter, which is available on our web site, examinersare directed to ensure that each institution has a comprehensive and rigorous internal process forevaluating its own capital adequacy. On our part, we are developing consistent approaches for thereview of bank economic capital methodologies through dedicated staff specialists. These specialistsare expected to be able to engage bank management on the assumptions and analyticalunderpinnings of the methodologies used by the bank to establish its capital requirements. Ourintention is that this evaluation will be made against an evolving sound-practice standard. The art andthe science of risk management and economic capital determination are changing so rapidly thatneither the banking community nor the supervisors have the luxury of determining an acceptable orbest practice and adhering to it very long. However, for some – and perhaps for many – supervisorsabroad, implementing pillar 2 will be an even greater challenge and a more significant event,potentially introducing a material change in their role. For all of us, though, it is the right approach –relying more than before on the internal measures and management practices of banks, giving them
BIS Review ??/20013more incentives to invest in better information systems and controls, and, I must emphasize, lookingclosely to see that their processes work.Pillar 3 could be characterized in much the same way: another step along the path for U.S. institutionsand supervisors, but a more dramatic change from many practices abroad. In this country, we havelong had the benefits, discipline, and disclosure practices associated with large, deep, and widelyanalyzed capital markets. Yet, even in this country, financial disclosures do not always provide themarket with sufficient information to fully assess a bank's risk position and overall capital adequacy. Atthe same time, we recognize there are limits to how much informed and timely discipline our marketscan assert, because of the inherent difficulty of measuring and understanding banking risks. Despiteall of their insights and detailed knowledge, even a bank's own managers and supervisors can bewrong and surprised.Market judgments will never be perfect, but as banks develop and disclose better information, marketfeedback can play a larger role. For their part, bank supervisors can certainly use the market's help asthey deal with ever-more-complex rules and banking practices. Indeed, we believe additionaldisclosure and more informed market oversight are essential elements of the proposed new accord.Just as pillar 2 represents a higher priority on supervision, pillar 3 represents an increased emphasison market discipline.Multilayered approachIn addition to the three pillars, the proposed capital standard is itself multilayered, offering a variety ofapproaches to accommodate banks with varied resources, expertise, and risk profiles. The most basicapproach is the so-called standardized method. It is conceptually the same as the current capitalaccord, but somewhat more risk-sensitive. A bank, as now, assigns risk weights to its assets and off-balance-sheet positions and then sums the risk-weighted asset values. The total capital requirementper dollar of risk-weighted assets remains at 8 percent. The primary difference from the current accordis that risk weights would be based on borrowers' external credit ratings, when available. The proposalwould also give more recognition to a bank's efforts to mitigate risk through guarantees, collateral,credit derivatives, and netting agreements.The centerpiece of the proposal is clearly the internal ratings based (or "IRB") approach, under whichthe regulatory capital requirement would be based on a bank's own internal assessment of eachborrower's credit quality. The use of the proposed IRB approach, in turn, is keyed to the bank's abilityto meet minimum supervisory requirements that demonstrate the rigor of its assessment. Reliance onbanks' internal credit risk-measurement and -management methodologies is perhaps the single mostfar-reaching innovation in the new proposal.Under the IRB approach, a bank would need to have several core inputs for each credit facility: theprobability of default (PD) for borrowers assigned to each internal borrower grade; the expected lossrate, given a default (LGD), appropriate to each type of exposure; the expected amount of exposure atdefault (EAD) for each type of exposure, reflecting any undrawn credit lines; and the maturity of theexposure. Those parameters that banks provide will need to be well founded and empirically linked tothe financial strength and condition of borrowers, the realizable value of collateral or other risk-mitigating provisions of the credit agreements, and many other factors.The Basel Committee has designed two versions of the IRB approach: a less sophisticated"foundation" method and a more flexible, but also more demanding, "advanced" approach.The foundation IRB offers those banks able to meet rigorous standards associated with assessmentsof borrower risk, but with more limited ability to measure transaction-specific risk, the opportunity tobase their capital requirements on their internal credit ratings. This option is designed for those banksable to estimate default probabilities, but not yet able to determine losses given default or exposuresat default. In such cases, estimates of loss given default and the effective amount of exposure wouldbe determined using formulas set by the regulator, and most transactions would have an assumedmaturity of three years. If a bank finds these regulatory parameters too restrictive – and they will beconservative – it may develop its own evidence, use it, and convince the supervisor of its accuracy,after which the bank could move to the advanced approach.Banks using the advanced approach will have more freedom, but their methodologies for deriving lossgiven default statistics and effective exposures will be closely reviewed. In all cases, supervisors willrequire a rigorous analysis supporting their estimates, whether they are based on internal or vendordata. Banks need to understand the basis for their calculations, and credit grades must reflect the
4BIS Review ??/2001banks' own views. Of course, banks will not be permitted to use internal estimates for some types ofexposures and regulatory parameters for others; this will be an all-or-nothing proposition.Regardless of the alternative selected, the regulatory risk-weighted capital ratio is computed, as is thecase today, as the ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets. The definition of total capital isunchanged. The minimum regulatory risk-weighted capital ratio, 8 percent, is also unchanged. Theonly changes are in the risk weights used to compute risk-weighted assets and in thecomprehensiveness of the risks included.In the new proposal, the denominator is the sum of credit risk, market risk, and operational risk. Therisk weights for credit risk are significantly modified, increasingly so as one moves from standardizedto advanced IRB. The treatment of market risk is unchanged. Operational risk is a completely newcategory. If measured credit risk declines because of the new risk weights – especially for the moreadvanced approaches – the addition of operational risk will partially offset that decline. Notsurprisingly, that will focus a lot of attention on operational risk. And, of course, if capital arbitrage has,in fact, shifted lower-risk assets to the market, the required capital on the remaining bank-heldrisk-weighted assets may increase rather than decrease under the new proposal. The effects may alsodiffer, perhaps significantly, among banks in different countries, depending on the extent to whichlow-risk assets have left the banking system. Remember that the new risk-weighted charges aredesigned to be more risk sensitive: to reduce capital charges for less risky assets, relative to currentcharges, but increase them for riskier assets.The expectation – which depends importantly on the extent of capital arbitrage already accomplished– is that, for a given asset, the effective risk weights would decline with the more sophisticatedapproaches, resulting in lower total regulatory capital charges and, consequently, in a higher reportedrisk-weighted capital ratio. At the same time, given different risk profiles, capital requirements almostcertainly would vary more widely under the new risk-based capital ratios than under today's measure.However, banks would then presumably respond to changes in their risk-based capital ratios. Forexample, a bank with a relatively low risk portfolio would find that its risk-weighted capital ratio rosebecause its risk-weighted assets had declined. It would, as a result, presumably either reduce itscapital or increase its leverage, or even its risk exposure. A bank with lowered capital ratios wouldpresumably do the opposite: raise more capital, reduce its leverage, and/or reduce its risk exposures.At the end of this adjustment process, we might again – for either competitive reasons or because ofthe incentives from the prompt corrective action structure – have a relatively tight configuration ofrisk-weighted capital ratios, especially at the LCBOs, but riskier banks would be holding more absolutecapital to support those risks. Indeed, it is the whole purpose of the exercise.Comprehensive treatment of riskAlthough the current accord emphasizes credit risk, it was intended to cover virtually all banking risks.That is, although the current capital charge was initially articulated in terms of credit risk alone, its levelwas set higher than would have been warranted for credit risk alone, in effect allowing a buffer thatcould be used to cover other risks.Three years ago, we carved out and dealt separately with trading activities and most market risk. Thatprocess worked well because it led to a better risk measure and also spurred risk-measurement effortswithin the industry. It worked within the current capital framework largely because trading activities andcapital requirements associated with them were relatively small for almost all banks. Taking a "one-off"approach for trading activities did not materially disrupt the underlying assumptions or integrity of thecurrent rule.We don't have that luxury now. As we get more precise in measuring credit risk, we lose some of thebuffers previously built into the standard to cover operational and other risks. Explicitly or implicitly, wenow need to make judgments regarding the respective correlations of different risks. Are they additiveor independent and to what degree? Can the same capital cover all of them, or do banks need capitalfor each one?Similar issues arise with risk mitigation and the proper treatment of collateral, guarantees, and otherrisk-reducing steps. Though these practices are important in measuring a bank's effective risk, theirvalue, in principle, is reflected implicitly in the 8 percent charge, as part of the "on average" nature ofthe current accord. Again, in principle, without such traditional cautionary efforts by banks to reducerisks, in 1988 the current regulatory capital minimum would have been set higher than 8 percent. The
BIS Review ??/20015difficulty, of course, is quantifying precisely the importance of each risk and of each risk-mitigatingeffort, and how they all fit together.Taking industry's leadWhen developing new regulatory standards, bank supervisors traditionally look first to common or"best" business practices within the industry to serve as a guide. For credit risk, however, we havefound that though many banks are beginning to adopt more formal quantitative approaches and thesystems of some banks are quite advanced, virtually no bank follows best practices in all areas ofcredit risk measurement and management. This is so even though, I hasten to add, the proposed IRBframework draws heavily from concepts and systems developed by leading-edge institutions. Foronce, supervisors seem to be ahead of – or at least even with – the curve rather than behind it.The lag in application reflects, I think, the reality that measuring credit and operating risk is moredifficult than measuring market risk. In trading activities transactions are marked to market daily, andlong series of data are readily available for measuring rate and price volatility. Once developed, value-at-risk and various stress-measurement techniques also spread throughout the industry, at leastamong the relevant institutions. With credit risk, we find a greater range of practices and of risk-measurement skills.As noted, the economic capital models used by some banks have been of great help in structuring theproposed framework and showing the way. Nonetheless, the work done to develop this proposalmakes clear that there is room for much improvement in certain business practices and in the internaluse of model output in evaluating capital adequacy. Given the difficulty of developing, maintaining, andvalidating measures of credit risk, supervisors will need the reassurance that would come fromknowing that banks actually use their credit risk measures for other than regulatory reasons. Beforesupervisors can seriously consider using the results of bank measures of portfoliowide credit risks – asopposed to measures of borrower- or transaction-specific risks – banks themselves need to haveenough confidence in the statistics and demonstrate that confidence by integrating the risk measuresinto important parts of the banks' business and management decisions.Critical issuesThe Basel Committee and commenters will need to focus on several critical issues as we worktogether to refine and complete the capital proposal. I urge you to address them in your comments.To whom does the proposal apply, and how will banks choose among the options in theproposal?The original 1988 Basel Accord was designed for large, internationally active banks. However, in theUnited States and many other countries, the current accord is applied to all domestic banks, both largeand small. With the new proposal, national regulators will once again have to decide how widely toapply the Basel capital framework.In my view, the greater complexity of the new accord, at least with respect to the IRB options,suggests that it should cover a narrower range of banks: those that have been active pursuers ofcapital arbitrage, those that have made – or can make – the greatest advances in risk measurementand management, and those for whom the adequacy of the current standard is most in question. Theneed and desirability of limited application is especially true in the United States, where we have sucha large number of relatively small and less complex community banks.Indeed, it is not at all obvious that the proposed standardized approach fits the needs of smallerbanking organizations engaged primarily in traditional banking activities. Recall that the currentstandardized approach originally was designed with larger banks in mind. The new standardizedapproach is more complex than its predecessor, but I question whether the added implementationburdens are cost-effective for traditional banking organizations, especially since neither the current northe proposed capital frameworks yet address what is perhaps the most critical risk factor for smallerbanks – geographic and sectoral concentrations of credit risk. In another talk later this month I willdiscuss in more detail whether and how the capital standards should be changed for communitybanks. So let me focus here on how larger banks may choose among the three options in the newproposal.
6BIS Review ??/2001The largest and most sophisticated U.S. and foreign banks will undoubtedly strive immediately tomove to the IRB approaches. Indeed, to the extent that the operational demands of the foundation andadvanced IRB approaches are viewed as comparable – particularly in light of input from consultingand third-party vendors – many institutions may desire to migrate directly to the advanced approach soas to achieve the largest possible reductions in regulatory capital. This possibility raises a veryimportant practical issue: How many banks will believe that they must operate under an IRB approachto remain competitive?It will take considerable supervisory resources to validate banks' internal methodologies and tomonitor their compliance with sound practices under the IRB approach on an ongoing basis. There is,therefore, a practical limit to the number of institutions that we – and, I would argue, other countries –can effectively supervise under the IRB approaches. Under the proposal, we have attempted toprovide incentives for banks to migrate over time from the standardized to the foundation and, then,advanced IRB approaches. If competitive forces encourage too many banks to choose for the IRBapproaches, then more careful attention would have to be paid to the risk weights under thestandardized approach and to the associated incentives built into the IRB approaches.In any event, and I cannot emphasize this enough, U.S. regulators intend to establish very highstandards both for those banks permitted to participate in the IRB approaches and for ourselves, asoverseers of the credibility and integrity of the IRB process.Does the new proposal strike the right balance between rules and discretion?As I noted earlier, the current proposal rebalances the regulatory and supervisory approach to capitalmore toward oversight of economic capital and away from a disproportionate focus on compliance withthe regulatory minimum. This is sensible, given that banks today uniformly hold capital above theregulatory minimum. But the key question is how well capital at individual banking organizationsreflects the risk profiles and risk-management capabilities of the individual entities. Unfortunately,oversight of a bank's economic capital needs and measures requires much greater supervisoryresources, authority, and expertise than enforcement of regulatory minimums. Countries without therequisite resources, authority, and expertise may need to tilt more toward rule-based approaches, atleast during a transitional period while their supervisory methodologies are modified and theirresources supplemented. Does that mean that during the transition the regulatory minimums shouldbe higher in these cases, as the pillar 1 is required to shoulder more of the burden relative to pillar 2?Or will market discipline (pillar 3) be enough to ensure that banks' economic capital decisions areappropriately disciplined? Does the current set of options provide sufficient flexibility to meet the needsof countries with varying supervisory capabilities?Will the new accord be implemented consistently within a country and across countries?This is an issue precisely because the new proposal offers greater discretion to banks, and implicitly tosupervisors, and therefore could lead to greater variation in capital among banks and countries.The issue is also important in the United States, since two agencies supervise large, internationallyactive banks: the Federal Reserve and the OCC. These agencies must uniformly implement the newproposal to preserve competitive equity among U.S. banks. Fortunately, the Fed and the OCC haveworked closely during the development of the new proposal. And, even more to the point, we havealready begun to work closely to develop jointly procedures to validate banks' internal risk-measurement methodologies.The question remains, however, how uniform will implementation be around the world? The proposalrelies heavily on supervisory oversight and market discipline to promote consistency. Supervisors willbe responsible for validating banks' internal methodologies, ensuring ongoing compliance with soundpractices, and providing oversight of the economic capital process. The importance of thesequalification standards is precisely why the new proposal makes them a requirement for any bankpermitted to operate under an IRB option. These requirements are therefore an integral part of pillar 1.Even countries without supervisory authority can impose these qualifications as a requirement for thepreferential capital treatment offered under pillar 1. Carrying out this validation and overseeingcompliance on an ongoing basis will be a considerable challenge everywhere, including the UnitedStates. As I noted, this challenge will be particularly pronounced in countries where the supervisorytradition has not emphasized the types of on-site review needed to validate a bank's IRBimplementation.
BIS Review ??/20017I have been impressed that those members of the Committee with such a tradition have been veryexplicit about the need to obtain the resources to carry out the necessary supervisory review. There isalso general agreement that ongoing structured exchanges of our experiences will occur amongCommittee members as part of the process of assessing the degree of uniformity in implementation.Nonetheless, your comments about expected or evolving problems with consistency issues would bequite helpful.Even if supervisory resources are adequate, market discipline must also play an important role inensuring uniformity in implementing the proposed Basel standard among banks. Of course, banksdon't all have to make the same choice with respect to capital levels, but they should pay theappropriate price in the market for lower levels of capital relative to risk. At any rate, it is important thatan appropriate level of disclosure requirements be included in pillar 1 to facilitate such marketdiscipline. The pillar 3 disclosure recommendations themselves are very far reaching. But at this pointmany of them are recommendations, not requirements. In addition, we recognize that we still havemore work to do in fashioning a more disciplined and prioritized set of disclosure requirements, onethat balances the cost of compliance against the benefits of disclosure. This, too, is an area in whichbank comments would be particularly helpful.Does the new proposal maintain competitive equity around the world or provide competitiveadvantage to some countries relative to others?Obviously, this is a sensitive issue. All parties to the negotiations want a standard that promotes safetyand soundness and deters systemic risk. Within these boundaries, though, we also view the worldfrom our own perspective. As countries negotiate, supervisors appropriately seek to avoid rules thatwould disadvantage their own banks. Hopefully, we hope that we will ultimately reach an agreementthat is acceptable to us all. But, it is crucial that banks, in their own self-interest, review the proposalscarefully, identify potential problem areas, and alert supervisors of material concerns.Did we set relative and absolute required capital levels about right, and did we properlybalance the incentives to move to more sophisticated options?I would be surprised if anyone could, at this point, provide a definitive answer to these questions,although they are central to the success of the proposal. Part of the problem, of course, is that manygaps remain in the current proposal, making it impossible for banks to compute the amount of capitalthey would have to hold under the IRB approaches. There is, as a result, an interactive process atwork. We need comments on what we have already proposed, including feedback on the implicationsfor banks' capital levels. We will continue to work to fill in the gaps and, when this work is completed,will need further feedback about the effects of the overall proposal on required capital levels.I hope the banking industry can provide detailed and constructive feedback on the proposed structureof risk weights, especially for those portfolios that have been explicitly addressed under the proposedframework – primarily corporates, banks, sovereigns, and retail under the IRB. Are the proposedrelationships reasonable between a loan's risk weight and its default probabilities, loss given default,exposure, and other inputs to the IRB approach? As I suggested earlier, if we do not get relative riskweights about right, it will be difficult to achieve the broad goals established by the Basel Committee –such as encouraging effective risk-management practices and discouraging capital arbitrage.Obviously, setting the right absolute level of capital requirements is important as well, both to avoidexcessive systemic risk and to provide a fair playing field vis-à-vis nonbank financial institutions.When we started out to determine an appropriate absolute level of capital requirements for banks, wehoped to take a "bottom-up" perspective. The IRB approach begins with a careful assessment ofrelative risks across different credit instruments. But it ultimately has to be grounded in some absolutecapital standard. A bottom-up approach would start with the maximum insolvency probability thatregulators are willing to accept. This would be used, in principle, to calibrate the absolute capital levelfor the regulatory minimum. The problem is that to implement such an approach requires supervisoryjudgments in areas where the right decision is not obvious.Consequently, for the most part, the structure of risk weights in the January proposal have beenguided, instead, by a top-down approach, which seems more comfortable to many Committeemembers, even if more ad hoc. The natural point of departure for this top-down approach is thecurrent level of capital. In an attempt to maintain about the current overall amount of capital in thesystem, the new standardized approach – which is intended to be conservative – is calibrated to the
8BIS Review ??/2001current 8 percent capital standard. Under the IRB approach, enhanced risk sensitivity will result inlower capital charges on some assets, but the precise amount of the overall benefit is difficult todetermine at this point.Within the Basel Committee is some concern that the IRB approach to credit risk could result in asignificant decline in capital requirements relative to current levels, especially under the advancedapproach. There could, therefore, be a temptation to offset any expected decline in credit risk capitalwith the imposition of a non-risk-sensitive capital charge against "other risks." Operational risk is anobvious candidate for such a "plug," especially given the absence of much progress in developingmethodologies to estimate the amount of capital appropriate for this risk. The danger is that anarbitrary or ad hoc approach to capital for operating risk could deny banks the full benefits that wouldotherwise be available under the advanced approach. Such an approach could easily subvert anyimprovement in the new accord's overall risk sensitivity that might otherwise flow from its more refinedtreatment of credit risk. It is also likely to discourage banks from investing the resources necessary tobetter measure operating risk. At a minimum, it provides them no incentive to do so.This issue, especially on methods for determining operational risk, is one about which your commentsare eagerly anticipated.Are even the largest banks ready to take advantage of the IRB approach?The fact that both banks and supervisors need to make much more progress explains the relativelylong (three-year) transition period proposed before the new accord would be implemented. Asbankers, you should ask yourselves whether you are truly ready. The quick answer, "we're there," isprobably wrong. Based on our examinations of U.S. banks' internal risk-rating processes, I suspectthat few banks would or should get a clean sign-off from their supervisor today.Despite the importance of evaluating a borrower's probability of default, banks have been surprisinglyslow, it seems, to distinguish among acceptable credit risk levels in their pricing and in their ownassessments of capital adequacy. In recent years, some leading institutions have clearly expandedtheir risk gradations, with some using twenty categories or more and paralleling the practices of largeexternal rating firms. Typically, though, banks have used half a dozen "pass" grades or less.Moreover, the distribution of credits among these grades often has been insufficient, with largeportions of portfolios falling into only one or two grades. Most significantly, the rigor and internalconsistency of internal risk-rating processes is often handicapped by insufficient or unclear ratingcriteria or by limited resources dedicated to independent reviews of risk-rating assignments.Last fall, the Basel Committee conducted an initial survey of large internationally active banks in orderto estimate the quantitative effects of the proposal on their capital requirements. The Committee wasdisappointed in the modest number of banks worldwide that could provide meaningful distributions ofcredit quality, even for their corporate portfolios. I hope that experience says more about the time andattention banks devoted to the exercise or about the lack of guidance they received than it does aboutthe state of their risk-management systems. If it is the latter, the industry clearly needs to increase thepace.ProcessThe new rule is, of course, still a proposal, although one in which much time and effort has beeninvested. It can certainly be changed and needs to be developed further, but the overall structureseems set. The industry needs to take the current proposal seriously and to comment on it insubstantive and helpful ways. Tell us what you like and dislike, but be constructive, offering alternativesolutions when you can. Your constructive proposals that pay due regard of the objective of the reformwill, I assure you, play a significant role in shaping the final proposals of the Basel Committee.Once adopted by the Basel Committee, the proposal will be submitted to the G-10 central banks fortheir endorsement and then to national jurisdictions for necessary domestic rulemaking. In the UnitedStates and in many other countries, the rulemaking process requires further public comment periodsthat must be respected. In this country, they most definitely will be. By that point, though, theinternational process will be at a much-advanced stage. Consequently, now is the time to commentand to influence the results. Don't miss the chance. Once fully adopted by the countries on the BaselCommittee, the standard is likely to have broad application worldwide and to replace the currentaccord, particularly for internationally active banks. Every bank here should expect to be affected.
BIS Review ??/20019ConclusionThe proposal may be complex and at times confusing, but I believe we are on the right track. We needregulatory capital standards that are far more risk sensitive than the one we have now and that providethe industry greater incentives to measure and manage risk. The IRB framework seems compatiblewith the efforts of best-practice banks and with the direction in which risk management seems to beheading. The advanced IRB approach, in particular, provides banks with substantial flexibility in theirrisk-measurement techniques and should eliminate much of the pure capital arbitrage, provided thatwe calibrate the various methods reasonably well.Such flexibility means the standard, itself, will evolve as banking practices improve. With experienceand better data, the risk parameters will change, and the models will get stronger. Banks will no longerhave the shelter of a static and uniform regulatory standard but will be required to defend their ownassessments and procedures to their supervisors and the market. They can start the process slowly,moving from the standardized approach to the foundation and advanced IRB methods only as theyfeel ready and as their supervisor agrees. Better risk management should lead to lower capitalrequirements.The proposal is still very much a work in progress, with important issues still unresolved. Yourcomments will be important in helping us refine and complete the proposal. Let's do all we cantogether to get it right.
BIS Review ??/20011T.T. Mboweni: Trends in economic growthAddress by Mr. T.T. Mboweni, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, at the Rotary Club ofPinelands, Cape Town, 23 February 2001.*   *   *IntroductionLadies and gentleman, it is indeed a great honour and a privilege to be invited here to speak at thisspecial induction meeting. I thank you for seeing fit to elect me as an Honorary Member of the RotaryClub of Pinelands. The topic I have chosen to talk about this evening is economic growth. It is asubject that affects us all, as citizens of South Africa, and it is something in which we all share;something from which we all reap the benefits.I have noted during my recent international visits (to the US, London and Davos), that many peoplehave become focused on South Africa's low growth rate. Over the past 40 years, the country'seconomic growth has declined from an average rate of 5 per cent per year in the 10 years immediatelyprior to the first oil crisis of 1973 to just over half of that in the latter years of the 1990s; not nearlyenough to create and sustain the levels of employment we would like to see.Economic growth since 1963Between 1963 and 1973 growth in real GDP came to 5,0 per cent on average, and a large degree offinancial stability and low inflation prevailed. The manufacturing sector expanded production, onaverage, by a solid 8 per cent per year over the period, although much of this was a result of theimport replacement policies and protectionist measures in force at the time. The services industry wasalso expanding strongly at an average rate of 5,5 per cent per annum. Non-gold mining outputexpanded at a vibrant arithmetic mean rate of 7 per cent per annum while the gold mining sectorreaped the benefits of new mine developments up to 1970 and a higher gold price thereafter.From the expenditure side, all domestic expenditure components recorded strong growth during thisperiod. Gross fixed capital formation was exceptionally strong, with a recorded average growth rate of9 per cent per annum. The expansion of the capital stock was widespread and considerable attentionwas given to infrastructure spending.The supply side of the economy was also boosted by the immigration of a considerable number ofentrepreneurial and highly skilled people. Education and training of the whole South African populationunfortunately did not receive the required attention, which came back to haunt us later on.For the next 10 years, from 1973 to 1983, the country’s real GDP growth dwindled to 2,6 per cent perannum. In the early 1970s, the semi-fixed exchange rate system, which had been in force up to thattime in most parts of the world, broke down, reducing the discipline imposed on policy makers. Thefirst oil price shock together with a substantial increase in the gold price initiated an inflation spiral andfinancial conditions became less stable with inflation rising to double-digit levels from 1974. Growth inmanufacturing slowed to 3,4 per cent per annum, as momentum could not be sustained given themore uncertain economic environment and the shortages of highly skilled people.Still, growth in the tertiary sectors remained relatively buoyant at 3,5 per cent per annum. Non-goldmining output expanded by 3,6 per cent per annum during this period, with coal performing well as thehigh price of crude oil lifted the prices of all energy-related minerals. Although gold productioncontracted as ore grades were reduced to prolong the lives of mines, gold mining profits remainedrobust because of the high gold price. The high gold price of 1979 and 1980 acted as a buffer andprotected South Africa from the effects of the second oil crisis in 1979, ensuring record growth in 1980.However, this artificial boost did not last as the gold price declined from its $800 a fine ounce peak.Fixed capital formation remained positive during 1973-83, although its average growth rate sloweddown appreciably to 2,8 per cent per annum. But final consumption expenditure by generalgovernment recorded the strongest growth rate amongst the expenditure components. During thisperiod, its growth rate averaged 5,3 per cent per year.As South Africa became more isolated from the international arena, growth contracted. From 1983 to1993 real GDP growth fell to a mere 1,0 per cent average per annum. Manufacturing grew at only
2BIS Review ??/20010,3 per cent per annum, and confidence was shaken as international pressure, sanctions and internaldissatisfaction mounted. Financial instability severely undermined the economy. Consumer priceinflation peaked at 20,7 per cent in January 1986 and the prime overdraft rate rose from 14 per cent in1983 to 25 per cent in 1984 before declining to 12 per cent at the end of 1986. The subdued gold pricealso impacted negatively on the economy. Only agriculture, which is an inherently volatile sector,managed to grow at a rate in excess of the 2,2 per cent per annum population growth rate. On theexpenditure side, fixed capital formation fell by 3,2 per cent per annum. Household consumptiongrowth declined while government consumption grew at an average rate of 2,9 per cent per annumand once again came to the fore as the strongest expenditure component. However, this implied ahigher tax burden for the man in the street and large government dissaving, which could not besustained.From 1993 to 1999 (and incidentally also from 1993 to the third quarter of 2000) real GDP growthaccelerated once more to some 2,6 per cent per annum. Confidence started to return, not only assanctions were abandoned but also especially as evidence accumulated that economic policies weregoing to be prudent, sustainable and transparent. The improved growth rate was achieved in spite ofadverse external shocks such as the East Asian markets crisis, some 3 years ago, and the floodsearly last year. The strongest growth over this period was recorded in the services industries, whichaveraged 3,3 per cent per annum. Growth in the transport and communications industry wasespecially vibrant, amounting to approximately 7,2 per cent per annum. A relatively strongperformance of this sector, driven by technology and tourism, is likely for many years to come.Viewed from the expenditure side, gross fixed capital formation picked up from extremely low levels,growing at a rate of 5,1 per cent per annum. Given the opening-up of the economy, reduced protectionand the fact that it was highly concentrated in the private sector, this capital formation is likely to beeconomically productive and sustainable. The high rate of expansion in fixed capital formation wasachieved in spite of the adverse shocks I have already mentioned. From 1993 to 1999 both exportsand imports rose strongly as international integration proceeded.Foreign direct investment flows into South Africa have picked up somewhat since the late 1980s andearly 1990s, but have not reached healthy levels. Foreign direct investment into South Africa hasaveraged around 1 per cent of GDP per year since 1994. Almost certainly, the planned privatisationover the next three years will help to boost this figure.While South Africa's depressed growth has become something of an overriding concern for many, wemust not forget the sharp acceleration in growth recorded during the course of last year. Revisedquarterly growth figures showed that the economy was more buoyant than had initially beenforecasted by many economists and resulted in third quarter growth of 3,8 per cent, seasonallyadjusted and annualised, when compared with the second quarter.Macro-economic fundamentalsAnd we must not forget, too, the progress that has been made in shaping South Africa'smacro-economic fundamentals to within internationally accepted standards. Economists, analysts andobservers have long agreed, and I am sure that you will agree, on the successes that have beenachieved over the past decade in sprucing up the country's macro-economic situation. Major economicrestructuring, which was absolutely necessary in South Africa's case, often leads to a prolongedperiod of subdued economic activity. We have every reason to believe that the economic is nowpoised to maintain higher growth rates in future.InflationOver the last 10 years, inflation has come down steadily from the double-digit figures of the 1980s andthe early 1990s. From 1989 to 1992, consumer price inflation rates of some 14 to 15 per cent wererecorded. The index then decelerated to single-digit rates from 1993, as the effects of the tightmonetary policies of the preceding four years came to fruition. By the close of the millennium furtherprogress had been made on the inflation front and in 1999 and 2000 the average consumer priceinflation rate slowed down to a level of 5,2 per cent and 5,3 per cent per annum.CPIX, the CPI index excluding mortgage costs, is the measure targeted by the Reserve Bank in itsinflation-fighting strategy and is closely monitored by the Bank. According to this policy, CPIX must fallto a rate between 6 and 3 per cent by the year 2002. CPIX inflation has proved sticky over the past
BIS Review ??/20013year and averaged 6,9 per cent in 1999 and 7,7 per cent in 2000, mainly as a result of highinternational oil prices. The most recent data, released on Tuesday this week, indicates CPIX was at alevel of 7,7 per cent in January 2001. Most analysts B and the Reserve Bank B expect CPIX to slowdown further over the course of the year, given the prudent monetary and fiscal policies that have nowbeen put in place. Incidentally, while CPIX data is not officially available before 1997, the ReserveBank estimates that CPIX inflation would have peaked at between 17 and 18 per cent in 1991 and1992 - a full 10 per centage points higher than where it now stands.Current account of the balance of paymentsProgress on the current account of the balance of payments has also been evident over the pastdecade. The country was forced to maintain current account surpluses from the mid-1980s to 1994.This was related to the 1985 debt standstill and the international isolation of the South Africangovernment, which acted as a barrier to foreign investment and other capital flows to South Africa.With foreign debt having to be repaid, South Africa had no option but to run its affairs so that exportsexceeded imports, thereby earning foreign exchange.The political transition in 1994 set the scene for normalisation of South Africa's financial ties with therest of the world. From 1995 South Africa ran current account deficits but kept these contained at lessthan 2 per cent of GDP. The deficits were easily financed through net capital inflows, which weresizeable enough not only to pay for the excess of imports over exports but also to build up SouthAfrica's gold and foreign exchange holdings to a record level. Late last year, holdings of gold andforeign exchange exceeded the equivalent of 15 weeks' worth of imports, against the internationallyaccepted norm of around 12 weeks.In spite of a low gold price, high oil prices and unfavourable conditions in certain trading partnercountries in the wake of the emerging markets crisis, South Africa has managed to record very smalldeficits on its current account in recent quarters.Over the past decade both exports and imports have increased relative to GDP, as can be expectedas part of the process of globalisation. South Africa's authorities have added momentum toglobalisation by phasing in lower import duties in terms of the World Trade Organisation agreements.This has been painful, but has enhanced South Africa's international competitiveness and ability togrow on a sustainable basis. The volume of non-gold exports has risen at an average rate of around7 per cent a year since the early 1990s - much faster than GDP growth - which enables the country tofinance imports largely needed for investment purposes.Debt levelsDuring the decade we are looking at, government debt rose from 36,4 per cent of GDP in 1989 to50,4 per cent in 1999, before receding to 48,1 per cent in 2000. Its most rapid rises were recordedwhen the government incurred large deficits from 1992 to 1994. However, South Africa's debt levelsstayed firmly below the 60 per cent level, which is deemed by the Maastricht Treaty participants as thelevel beyond which fiscal health is at risk.South Africa's foreign debt receded from 26,8 per cent of GDP in 1989 to just above 20 per cent in theearly 1990s. As international borrowing was resumed from 1994, foreign debt rose significantly to29,9 per cent of GDP in 1999. But this is still quite low in comparison with other developing countries.The South African private sector's indebtedness to the banking system has risen over the pastdecade. From a level of 58 per cent of GDP in 1989, bank credit to the private sector rose to 67 percent in 1999. This was a sign of increasing intermediation of credit and financial development in theeconomy - so-called financial deepening..Budget deficitsSimilar progress has been made on the government's budget deficits. The relatively low budgetdeficits and high government expenditure during the fiscal years of the late 1980s to the early 1990swere largely achieved through increased tax revenues. However, in the 1991/1992 fiscal year thedeficit doubled to 3,7 per cent of GDP, as the recession impacted negatively on revenue whileexpenditure growth accelerated. There was no respite in the 1992/1993 fiscal year when the recession
4BIS Review ??/2001deepened and expenditure accelerated sharply after drought aid had been disbursed in the wake ofthe worst drought in half a century. This propelled the budget deficit to a record high of 7,3 per cent ofGDP, a level that was clearly not sustainable. After fluctuating around 5 per cent of GDP, the deficit fellbelow 3 per cent of GDP after the 1997/1998 fiscal year. This was achieved through a combination ofbudgeting in accordance with the country's most pressing priorities, strict expenditure control andimproved tax collection. With a budget deficit of below 3 per cent, South Africa's finances comparefavourably with internationally acceptable levels.Fiscal policyCoupled with these improvements, the degree of transparency in fiscal policy was strengthened withthe introduction of the three-year Medium-Term Expenditure Framework, which marked a departurefrom the one-year budget announcements. The three-year framework has provided certainty, a crucialfactor for financial stability, and an opportunity for decisions to be informed by public debate.Clear objectives are set out for fiscal policy, such as the elimination of government dissaving andreducing the tax burden on society. This prudent approach has kept South Africa out of a debt trapwhere government's deficit, government debt and the interest cost of such debt spiral out of control.The strategy has also contained government's interest costs, enabling more funds to be redirected tothe priority areas where the most pressing needs have been identified. Although capital expenditurewas initially a casualty of the strict control over government spending, it is now set to accelerate, giventhe fiscal room for maneuver that the government has created.Although 10 years is a relatively short period in economic terms, the trends that emerge since 1993underline the solid foundation and relative macro-economic stability that has been achieved in SouthAfrica. The policies that are in place will ensure that this strong foundation will be strengthened furtherto enable the country to embrace any challenges that may arise.While much success is evident from the side of the government concerning the country'smacro-economic framework, the responses to the government's policies have at times been slow. Forexample, the agricultural sector has undergone immense challenges as South Africa shifted awayfrom the excessive state regulation and intervention which characterised agricultural markets in thepast. In keeping with the global trends the majority of agricultural marketing schemes and controlboards have been phased out. The agricultural markets have been liberalised and access to thembroadened through legislation. As a result, farming has become market-driven and not production-driven, and this naturally leads to greater agricultural price volatility. The removal of these marketingboards should create space for competition, but we are only beginning to see some encouraging signsthat farmers are reacting appropriately to the new agricultural policies.As a central bank we continue to be encouraged by what we hear from the government. In his state ofthe nation address earlier this month, President Thabo Mbeki indicated that the government was set toembark on a programme of action, starting with the economy. The President noted the generalconsensus that we have established the necessary level of macroeconomic balance and stability, andhave turned away from the precarious position we found ourselves in during 1994. This, as thePresident said, was in spite a very volatile international environment.President Mbeki also observed that South Africa's economic growth rate, aggregate savings andinvestment rates remain too low. The President went on to say, and I quote: While continuing to focuson the maintenance of the correct macroeconomic balances, we have therefore decided to paydetailed attention to the critical microeconomic issues. In particular we have decided that this year thegovernment itself, in all its spheres, and the public sector as a whole, must make a decisive andintegrated contribution towards meeting the economic challenges the country faces.The objectives we seek to achieve are moving the economy onto a high-growth path, increasing itscompetitiveness and efficiency, raising employment levels and reducing poverty and persistentinequalities.The government will draw on the advice of some of the world's top economists, lower input costs andstrive to create a climate of certainty. By doing this, the government is showing its commitment to theeconomic well being of South Africa. We at the Reserve Bank are convinced that the micro-reformswill play an important role in boosting growth and job creation.
BIS Review ??/20015Concluding remarksLadies and gentlemen, we at the South African Reserve Bank must also do our bit. We believe, asmost central banks do, that sustained high economic growth and creation of employment opportunitiescan only be fulfilled when stable financial conditions prevail. This is the objective of the Bank: toachieve and maintain stable financial conditions in our country. This task is spelled out in both theConstitution and in the South African Reserve Bank Act. The primary role of monetary policy,therefore, is to keep inflation in check, which is an essential ingredient in the recipe for sustainableeconomic growth. We aim to do this through our approach of inflation targeting. By all counts, thispillar of growth is coming into place, and our economic growth rate will be set against this morehealthy background.
BIS Review 16/20011Arnold Schilder: Banking in the new economy: a supervisory perspectiveSpeech by Mr A. Schilder, Executive Director of De Nederlandsche Bank N.V., at the Take OffConference ‘Information Battle: Consequences of the New Economy on Economic and Business Life’,University of Maastricht, 14 February 2001.*      *      *IntroductionThe new economy affects the almost two-hundred-year-old Nederlandsche Bank in many ways.Today, I will focus on the implications of the new economy for banks and for banking supervision. Thesubject therefore is: e-banking supervision.Electronic bankingFirst, what is e-banking? E-banking is the provision of banking services by means of electronic datatransfer between participants. The information is transferred via a network, which may be a computernetwork such as the Internet, or a telecommunications network. Rabobank’s Random Access Bankingis an example of e-banking. By that, customers can make payments, deposit savings, and makeinvestments over the Internet or by telephone. In addition, when people shop in a Dutch cybermall,such as Davista (www.davista.nl), Random Access Banking mostly offers the possibility to pay usingRabo Direct. This last application could be described as using your PIN code over the Internet.Another recent example of e-banking is Wellowell, owned by ING. This is an on-line marketplace.Customers can compare insurance offers and banking products from various providers here, andclose the deal there and then. Examples are a car insurance or a savings account. In this way, INGoffers its own products, as well as those of its competitors.What does the advent of electronic media mean for banks? I would like to mention threeconsequences. One is that the Internet makes the market more transparent. Consumers can compareproducts and services from different providers more easily, and shop around for the best offers. This isparticularly the case for standard products like consumer credit, where price is the key factordetermining the customers’ selection. In addition, the costs of switching suppliers are lower in the caseof electronic banking. Combined with the increased comparability of products, this could reducecustomer loyalty. This in turn means fiercer competition for banks.A second consequence of the new information and communication technologies is that theorganisational structure of banks will be affected. Banks have a very integrated value chain,horizontally as well as vertically. This means that all elements of their service are provided by thesame organisation. Examples are account management, product development and infrastructure. TheInternet puts pressure on this integrated organisational structure. An important aspect of Internettechnology is that its development requires very high initial investment, but that the marginal costs ofuse are low. This raises the possibility that new, specialised suppliers are able to carry out certainspecific activities more efficiently than the banks themselves. On the one hand, this situation offers thebanks the option to outsource some of their operations to others, thus achieving cost reductions. Onthe other hand, it could bring unwanted pressure on parts of the banks’ value chain, and ultimatelylead to deconstruction of the chain itself. A practical consequence of this trend is that banks aredeveloping into network organisations by way of alliances and cooperation with both financial and non-financial institutions. For example the cooperation between ABN AMRO and KPN in relation to thelaunch of the ‘Money Planet’ Internet site.A third consequence is that new suppliers can enter the market more easily. In the virtual world,barriers to entry are significantly lower. There is no longer a need for an extensive branch officenetwork, for example. Lower entry barriers mean more suppliers in the market, which intensifiescompetition. These suppliers may take different forms. They may be existing banks originating fromother countries. These banks can use the Internet to bring about a rapid internationalisation of theiractivities. Various institutions have already set up electronic subsidiaries, which offer banking serviceson an international scale under a new brand name or under the name of the parent bank. Examples
2BIS Review 16/2001include the Bank of Scotland’s electronic subsidiary Eubos, which offers mortgages on the Internet inthis country, or ING Direct, ING’s electronic offshoot, which is active in Canada and elsewhere.New suppliers can also be pure electronic banks, or institutions from the non-banking sector. Pureelectronic banks are not linked to an existing physical bank. Although they do not have the high fixedcosts of a branch network, they do have to invest heavily in building up their reputation. It is interestingto note that the current market share held by such banks is still very small. The principal reasons forthis are probably the lack of confidence resulting from the lack of a physical presence and the highcost of marketing the brand name. Newcomers from the non-banking sectors can be existingnon-financial institutions that offer a limited range of financial services through electronic channels.Volkswagen in Germany is one example. They offer consumer credit. Also companies whichspecialize in payment systems are part of the non-banking category. Right now I am talking, they offeryou the possibility to make payments over your mobile telephone. This sevice is already available inthe United States. Other non-banking institutions include consumer comparison sites like Wellowell,portals and personal agents.The implications of e-banking for supervisionSo far I have described some consequences of electronic media for the banking system. But what arethe implications for banking supervision? Let me discuss some recent activities undertaken bysupervisors.First, the Nederlandsche Bank supervises the banking system in accordance with the Dutch CreditSystems Supervision Act. The Policy Regulations for the Media (Beleidsregels Media) were formulatedto indicate how this Act should be applied where financial services are offered via electronic media.Briefly put, these Regulations state that it makes no difference whether banking services are providedvia traditional channels such as branch offices, or over the Internet. In both cases the institutionconcerned is required to hold a banking license. For example, an institution established in theNetherlands which provides banking services over the Internet comes under the supervision of DNB.However, a provider which is established abroad but via the Internet is active in the Dutch market isalso subject to DNB supervision. Several indicators play a part in deciding whether activities areconsidered to be directed at the Dutch market, like the use of the Dutch language, contact points inthe Netherlands, and the addressees of the media used. The existing regulatory legislation is thereforeadequate for proper banking supervision, also with the advent of e-banking. E-banking has howevermade the regulator’s task more complicated. How do we check that all providers that are active overthe Internet in the Dutch market do indeed comply with regulatory legislation? This brings me to arecent DNB initiative.Second, in combination with its fellow regulators the Dutch Insurance Board and the Securities Boardof the Netherlands, the DNB has entered into a co-operative agreement with the Dutch National PoliceAgency (Korps Landelijke Politiediensten, or KLPD) and the Dutch Economic Investigation Service(Economische Controle Dienst, or ECD). We are working together on developing new trackingmethods. The objective is that those whose actions on the Internet are in breach of the regulatorylegislation can be traced.A third initiative is the introduction of the internet officer. The digital detective, or cybercop, is already afamiliar phenomenon in police circles. From the beginning, the use of cybercops has inducedinvestigation authorities to develop techniques to discover the identity of those who are in breach ofthe law. The regulators want to use this technology in their supervision of the financial sector. TheDNB now has one internet officer, which like the digital detectives is engaged in tracing financialoffenders. So far, several indications of offences on the internet have been found. For exampleinstitutions that offer banking services over the internet without having a banking license. Also someso-called ‘study investment associations’ (studiebeleggingsclubs) were in breach of the regulatorylegislation. These investment funds, founded by students, operated over the internet without a licenseof DNB.A fourth initiative to protect consumers against unauthorised banking services is the introduction ofso-called hyperlinks. This possibility is currently being investigated. Every financial services providerusing e-commerce would be required to place a hyperlink on its website referring to the relevantregulator. By clicking on this hyperlink, consumers would access a list of providers licensed by theregulator, and could easily see whether a provider is on the list, and therefore is trustworthy. Anotherpossibility being considered is a regulator’s ‘black list’, which would be a special page on the
BIS Review 16/20013regulator’s website listing financial services providers that are operating without a license andtherefore not trustworthy.So we work together with fellow regulators, the police and investigation services. However, the Bankhas a separate unit concerned with the supervision of banks and information technology within itsSupervision department. The fact is that e-banking involves several specific operational risks. Oneoperational risk mainly relates to the security of systems and transactions, including dataconfidentiality and authentication of the parties involved. Another operational risk refers to thecontinuous availability of the Internet as a medium for financial transactions. This availability is proneto serious hazards, such as computer viruses and hackers. Think for example of the Homebankingapplication of ABNAMRO, that was subject to an attack of hackers in September last year. Such anincident may damage the reputation of the internet as a means of payment. It is therefore veryimportant for banks to ensure the safety of e-banking. The regulators at our IT- unit monitor whetherthis is sufficiently done. To that end, they have conversations with the banks to gain insight in thecontrols, the legal implications and particularly the security of e-banking. Furthermore, they retrievedocumentation, such as the banks’ risk analysis, an independent EDP audit report and the results of apenetration test. This test is a legal attempt to hack, conducted by an external organisation.As well as the national initiatives I just mentioned, there are international activities under way in thee-banking area. A good example of this is the work of the Electronic Banking Group, or EBG, which isa working group of the so-called Basel Committee of Banking Supervision. This group is engaged informulating international guidance and principles regarding e-banking. The EBG recently published itsprinciples for risk management in electronic banking, which also include issues relating to consumerprotection. One example is a principle that concerns appropriate disclosures for e-banking services.This principle states that banking organisations should provide on their websites some coreinformation in order to assist customers in making informed choices. Examples of such disclosedinformation could include contact details for the supervisory authority responsible for the supervision ofthe bank’s head office as well as details of access to national compensation or insurance schemes.The risk management principles for e-banking are currently presented to the banking sector forconsultation. It is expected that the final version will be presented to the Basel Committee next month.Around April, the principles will be published at the website of the BIS (www.bis.org). Beside thepublications at our own website (www.dnb.nl), such as this speech, you also find a link to the site ofthe BIS.Besides the work of the Basel Committee that applies specifically to the banking sector, there is moregeneral legislation in the form of EU directives. These affect e-banking as well. For example theDirective on electronic commerce, which requires providers of electronic services to make informationon prices and conditions accessible for consumers. Another relevant directive for e-banking is that onthe remote provision of financial services. This states for example that consumers have the right torecall an agreement if a supplier did not provide them with the terms of delivery, like prices, beforeentering into a transaction.ConclusionTo summarize: e-banking is a phenomenon which affects both banks and regulators. I hope I havemade clear that this subject has the regulators’ full attention, both nationally and internationally. Aswell as participating in international discussions on e-banking, the Bank has undertaken variousinitiatives to include e-banking in its supervisory policy. This does not mean that we can afford to becomplacent. Developments are proceeding rapidly, and the DNB is closely monitoring developmentsto ensure a timely response. In various ways we keep up our know-how on an continuous basis. Bymeans of courses and self-study, for example. But also by benchmarking through third parties, as it isrelevant to review one’s own organization from time to time. Finally, a very important way for keepingup our know-how is by recruiting new staff. So if the supervision of e-banking has aroused yourinterest, DNB is probably something for you.
BIS Review 5/20011Urban Bäckström: The Swedish economySpeech by Mr Urban Bäckström, Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank and Chairman of the Board ofDirectors and President of the Bank for International Settlements, to the Swedish Shareholders’Association, Gotland section, in Visby on 29 January 2001.*      *      *Thank you for inviting me to Gotland to talk about the Swedish economy. Being in Visby is always apleasure, besides reviving many memories — as some of you may know, I spent some time here inthe Sixties.Today I intend to begin by looking back at economic developments in recent years. That should helpto put the current discussion about the Swedish economy in perspective. After that I shall be sayingsomething about the economy’s recent cyclical path and how I assess the future in the light of theinformation that is presently available.We have now experienced a series of years in which the economy has been expanding strongly.Since the upturn began in the summer of 1993, the annual GDP growth rate has averaged about 3 percent. Not since the period in the late Sixties and early Seventies have we had growth figures like this.The favourable trend has contributed to rapidly rising employment and decreased unemployment.Open unemployment has dropped in only four years from 9 per cent to less than 4 per cent. In recentyears, moreover, an average of almost 100,000 new jobs have been created annually. A look at thestatistics shows that this expansion of employment is the strongest Sweden has experienced since thelabour force surveys were first published in the early Sixties.The markedly favourable trend is not confined to growth, employment and unemployment. Both ourforeign transactions and the public finances are generating surpluses.Another aspect of the good situation is that inflation has remained moderate. In recent years the rateof inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, has been just under 2 per cent. This has pavedthe way for real wage increases on a scale we have not seen since the Sixties.In the light of all these factors — rapid economic growth, rising employment, falling unemployment,internal and external surpluses, low inflation and favourable real wage increases —the picture of theSwedish economy is very bright. What, then, is the explanation for this advantageous course ofevents? In my opinion, it has to do with a combination of factors.The economic crisis that ravaged Sweden in the early Nineties clearly meant that plenty of resourceswere available when activity subsequently recovered. That reduced the risk of production soonreaching its ceiling.At the same time, the Swedish economy has been performing more efficiently, particularly comparedwith the previous quarter-century, when even relatively low growth rates tended to generate inflation.One explanation lies in the realignment of economic policy that began in the late Eighties to promotestability and predictability. Today we can say that confidence in the Riksbank’s 2 per cent target forannual inflation is strong; it functions as a clear benchmark for price-and wage-setting decisions.The transformations that have been achieved with new establishments — not least in the IT sector —and increased competition, as well as the deregulation of important markets, should also be includedin a complete account of factors that have contributed to the good performance in recent years. Theyhave pushed prices down and thereby kept inflation in check, making a strong expansion of demandfeasible.Sooner or later, however, an excessively rapid increase in demand that is allowed to continue willresult in an unbalanced economy. This is simply because rising resource utilisation increases the riskof tensions between supply and demand. Even in the best of worlds, an economy cannot disregard thefundamental laws by which it functions. In many respects, the most recent crisis in the early Ninetieswas occasioned by the economy being left for so long to expand at a rate that could not be sustained.This ended in a crash. So in order to avoid a situation with mounting imbalances, in time economicgrowth in Sweden will have to start slowing down to a rate that is sustainable in the longer run.What, then, is the level of this potential growth rate? According to a common, though not entirelycertain estimate, the Swedish economy’s sustainable annual growth rate lies between 2 and 2.5 per
2BIS Review 5/2001cent. In view of the high growth rates in recent years and considering that we have moved towards asituation where resources are becoming increasingly strained, it might be concluded that it would behealthy for the Swedish economy if activity were to slow a little in the future.Many observers counted on interest rate hikesI recall that during the past year a good many observers counted on fairly large interest rate increases.They thought they saw clear signs of the Swedish economy being on the way to overheating andconsidered we ought to act promptly to prevent this from happening. Along with the frequent warnings,moreover, a number of other central banks increased their instrumental rates. The U.S. FederalReserve, for instance, raised its rate in the course of last year to 6.5 per cent. In Europe the ECBtightened its monetary stance and increased the refinancing rate to 4.75 per cent, while the Bank ofEngland adjusted the interest rate upwards during 2000 to 6.0 per cent.The Riksbank, however, took a more cautious course. For although our assessment of economicactivity was relatively similar to that of other forecasters, we differed all the more about the path ofinflation. In a sense, the inflation forecasts can be said to register the temperature of activity andindicate how quickly the economy is capable of expanding. We saw clearer and clearer signals thatthe relationship between growth and inflation had become more favourable. It looked as though theeconomy could cope with somewhat higher growth for a period without becoming overheated andgenerating higher inflation. We took it in stages, with a relatively mild monetary stance, as the forecasthorizon shifted into the future. Today we can note that at 4 per cent, the repo rate in Sweden is lowerthan in most other industrialised countries.Closer focus on resource utilisationDuring the autumn we focused increasingly on resource utilisation. The economy was moving towardsa situation in which the growth of total production was ultimately liable to be excessively high. Therewas nothing dramatic about this; in view of the strong activity, it was only to be expected. What wasperhaps surprising was that shortages had not become more acute, particularly in the labour market.In an upward cyclical phase, the development of a situation where the tensions in markets for goods,services and labour threaten to gain the upper hand and threaten price stability is a gradual process.That makes it difficult to tell exactly when the imbalances will constitute a genuine problem for inflationprospects.What we and other observers have to do is endeavour to draw conclusions from a continuous inflow ofeconomic information, where each item is carefully scrutinised. This is not a simple matter and there isa risk that interpretations will sometimes be wrong. Moreover, there is a time lag before measures ofmonetary policy elicit effects — our premise is that the full effect of an interest rate adjustment takesone to two years to materialise. We therefore have to balance the risks of acting too soon againstthose of acting too late. If the Riksbank acts prematurely, unemployment is liable to fluctuate morewidely than otherwise. Acting too late, on the other hand, may lead to higher inflation expectations aswell as rising prices and wages. In that case, the economy may ultimately land in a recession, perhapswith higher unemployment.Fortunately, it is not a question of either/or. A monetary policy adjustment can be decided gradually,with stepwise adjustments to the repo rate. Consequently it is always possible to compare forecastswith outcomes, assess the policy stance continuously and make any adjustments that are called for.If monetary policy is successfull, a foundation is laid, not only for low, stable inflation in line with thetarget and the Riksbank’s statutory objective, but also for stable output growth in the longer run and astable development of employment. That is something I find important to underscore.Various forms of demand adjustmentIn the coming years there will accordingly have to be some adjustment of demand to the Swedisheconomy’s long-term growth trend. In principle, this can happen either as a spontaneous slackening ofactivity, for instance because Sweden is affected by an international economic slowdown, or via amonetary adjustment. In practice it can result from a combination of the two.
BIS Review 5/20013There are increasingly clear signs of a slowdown in the U.S. economy. In Europe’s euro area, too,activity has been somewhat weaker than expected. In Japan it looks as though a recovery will befurther delayed on account of the problems that have already beset the country for a long time.Moreover, the weaker trend in the United States may have a regional effect on Southeast Asia.The global economic slowdown, together with the Riksbank’s repo rate increase of 0.25 percent agepoints last December, are tending to adjust the expansion of demand towards the long-term growthpath. As far as Sweden is concerned, the slowdown we have observed to date can to some extent beregarded as welcome.Alternative scenarios in the inflation assessmentNow for some comments on the alternative scenarios that can be discerned in the future and whichadd up to our risk spectrum. As you no doubt know, the Riksbank’s quarterly Inflation Report containsa thorough account of our appraisal of economic developments in the coming twenty-four months.In the Report we presented early last December we counted on growth rates for the Swedish economyof 3.4 per cent this year and 2.9 per cent in 2002. The main scenario accordingly incorporated theassessment that demand growth will slacken somewhat in the forecast period. The underlyingassumptions included somewhat lower international growth, a weaker development of consumptionand an appreciating exchange rate.The rate of underlying or core inflation, measured as UND1X, was judged in the main scenario to be1.8 per cent one year ahead and 1.9 per cent after two years. The corresponding assessment ofconsumer price inflation, measured by the CPI, gave rates of 1.8 and 2.1 per cent, respectively.In addition, we presented alternative scenarios that highlighted four different factors that were liable toupset the main scenario. All in all, however, the risk of inflation being higher than in the main scenariowas judged to be greater than the risk of lower inflation.Of the four risk factors, three accordingly pointed to rising inflation:• For one thing, there was judged to be a risk of the oil price remaining at a high level.• For another, there could be a risk of the Swedish krona not appreciating as foreseen in thefuture.• Thirdly, a risk was perceived of the wage trend being stronger than in the  main scenario.• Fourthly, we considered there was a downside risk of international growth being weaker thanin the main scenarioA weighted combination of these four factors indicated an overall upside risk for inflation both one andtwo years ahead. It was against that background that the repo rate was raised 0.25 percentage pointsin December, to 4 per cent.So how does that assessment stand today? As far as the exchange rate is concerned, the levelrelative to Sweden’s main trade partners is still weak. On the other hand, the international price ofcrude oil has become somewhat lower. It is still too early for a more definite assessment of wageagreements, not least because settlements have still to be concluded for a relatively large proportionof the labour market. Thus far, however, it can be noted that there now seems to be less risk ofsizeable upward deviations from the Riksbank’s earlier wage assessment. When concludingagreements, the negotiating parties appear to start from the inflation target, which is positive.Generally speaking, it can be said in conclusion that the slowdown which so far seems to be going onin the Swedish economy is in a way to be welcomed. A limited retardation helps us to adjust thedevelopment of demand to the long-term path of growth, and thus reduces the need for further interestrate hikes. It remains to determine the extent to which the international slowdown will suffice todampen the Swedish economy’s somewhat too rapid earlier expansion. But neither can one rule outthe possibility that the downturn in the U.S. economy will be more pronounced than various observerscount on at present. It is thereore important to keep a close eye on and interpret incoming statistics onactivity, in Sweden as well as the rest of the world, with the aim of arriving at a picture of futureinflation prospects that is clearer than we can form at present. For the same reason, it is alsoimportant to monitor the outcome of the current wage negotiations and other influential factors.
BIS Review 15/20011Otmar Issing: The euro - a stable currency for EuropeSpeech by Professor Otmar Issing, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, atEuromoney Institutional Investor Plc, London, 21 February 2001.*      *      *IntroductionSlightly more than two years ago the European Central Bank (ECB) assumed responsibility for thesecond largest economic area in the world after the United States. The euro is now the currency for300 million people. The transfer of monetary policy competence from 11 national central banks, manyof them characterised by a long history and impressive monetary policy results, was met with a greatdeal of scepticism. All the more so, because the asymmetry between a self-contained central bankand - in the meantime 12 - national governments brought with it an historically unique situation.The single monetary policy has not experienced any significant accident so far in its short life: thetransition to the single currency has been quite smooth and the Governing Council of the ECB wassuccessful in fulfilling its mandate, namely in maintaining price stability in the euro area over themedium term. Clearly, we are not satisfied with HICP inflation above 2 %, as we have seen since themiddle of last year. However, we have announced before we started to conduct our monetary policythat the ECB could not precisely control inflation in the short-term and would not try to as, for example,in the case of an oil price shock. But we have good reasons to expect that, if nothing comparablehappens again, HICP inflation in the euro area will fall back to below 2% in the course of this year.You may ask why I am so confident about this. There are three main reasons. First, the institutionalset-up on which the ECB and the euro have been built is very sound. Second, the Governing Councilof the ECB managed to set up an efficient framework both as regards the monetary policy strategy aswell as monetary policy instruments. Finally, monetary policy in the last two years has rightly beenperceived by most observers as having been appropriate to maintain price stability in the mediumterm. All this is reflected in a high degree of credibility of the ECB, as evidenced by low inflationexpectations.The institutional designLet me start with the institutional design. The Treaty establishing the European Community - which Iwill refer to as the "Treaty" - and the mandate of the ECB provide a sound basis both for an effectivemonetary policy and for the establishment and development of a good reputation and a high degree ofcredibility for the ECB.I will focus my attention on four aspects of institutional design which are of the utmost importance forthe ECB's reputation and credibility: (1) its mandate; (2) its independence from political interference;(3) its transparency; and (4) provisions that contribute to fiscal discipline.First, the Treaty establishes a clear hierarchy of objectives for the single monetary policy, givingoverriding priority to the maintenance of price stability in the euro area. This reflects the fact that thebest contribution that the ECB can make to long run sustained economic growth, employment creationand raising standards of living, is maintaining price stability. The clear priority given to the pricestability objective also highlights the fact that the ECB itself does not have either the means or theresponsibility for ensuring a high level of employment and real growth, beyond the positive impact ofprice stability just mentioned. Such a clear allocation of task and objective to different policy-makersensures efficiency, transparency and accountability.Second, the Treaty has made the ECB one of the most independent central banks in the world. In thisway, political pressures can be avoided and European citizens can be assured that a long-term euro-area wide perspective will be taken by the central bank in pursuing its mandate of maintaining pricestability.
2BIS Review 15/2001Third, the Treaty recognises that the assignment of an important policy responsibility to anindependent institution has to be accompanied by transparent and accountable policy design andimplementation. Transparency and the accountability of the central bank add to its credibility byimposing discipline on policy-makers. For these reasons, the ECB went significantly beyond thestatutory requirements regarding transparency.Finally, let me emphasise that the Treaty, reinforced by the Stability and Growth Pact, containsimportant provisions to facilitate the co-ordination of economic policies and ensure sound publicfinances. The EU countries must regard their economic policies as a matter of common concern. TheECOFIN Council is required to formulate broad guidelines for the economic policies of the MemberStates and to monitor economic developments within a multilateral surveillance framework. EUgovernments are also subject to a common code of conduct in fiscal matters, in particular imposinglimits on government deficits, as laid down in the Treaty. The Stability and Growth Pact, together withthe "no-bail-out clause" and other Treaty provisions, contributes to maintaining fiscal policy discipline.In fact, fiscal discipline makes it easier for the central bank to maintain price stability and thus indirectlycontributes to keeping inflation expectations low.To summarise, the institutional design of Economic and Monetary Union directly addresses the mainproblems that a new central bank may face in establishing its credibility: overriding priority is given tomaintaining price stability, central bank independence is assured and various provisions go a long waytowards ensuring sound public finances. History has taught us that in these institutional features wehave laid the foundations of a safe currency.Setting up a new central bankLet me now make a few remarks about the experience we have gained in the first two and a half yearsof setting up a new central bank, both in general terms and in particular with regard to the instrumentsand monetary policy strategy.It came, I suppose, as a surprise to those who had been very sceptical about the euro that the birth ofthe new currency proceeded as smoothly as anyone could have hoped for. Indeed, it was aresounding success. The process of the changeover to the euro was virtually free of technical faults.Almost overnight a unified money market was created, which - notwithstanding a formidabletransactions overload - functioned from the very start without any major complications. Short-terminterest rate volatility remained well contained, and the main refinancing operations, along with thestanding facilities and the reserve requirement system with its averaging provisions, have sinceguaranteed money market developments closely in line with the ECB's intentions.The operational framework of the ECB is very market oriented, i.e. it relies on tender procedures,leaving the initiative to banks, and lets automatic stabilisers, through the averaging provision in thereserve requirements system, work. While the ECB sets the framework and the rules, it is up to banksto best exploit the incentives set under this framework.On this issue, let me add a few remarks on the increase in money market rates which has occurredover the past few days. These developments have occurred following the low amount of bidssubmitted in the main refinancing operation of 13 February. The recent increase in money marketrates should not be seen as reflecting a change in the stance of monetary policy, which continues tobe signalled by the minimum bid rate.Also the monetary policy strategy of the ECB has proven successful from the start. The recognitionthat monetary policy will always have to cope with a changing and imperfectly known world has been akey consideration in the design of the ECB's monetary policy strategy. In addition, we had to bear inmind the fact that the mere establishment of the ECB as a totally new institution marked a historicaldiscontinuity, with potentially profound implications for economic behaviour and measured structuralrelationships.In these circumstances, the Governing Council chose to equip itself with an internally consistent and atthe same time comprehensive and appropriately flexible approach to policy analysis. It was decidedthat the best way we could serve the lasting objective of guaranteeing a stable measure of value in anon-discretionary manner was to adopt a robust analytical framework well-suited to informing policy-makers in a changing world. Developing and refining this framework was our main challenge.
BIS Review 15/20013This tension was resolved - and in my view this is the optimal solution - by announcing a quantitativedefinition of price stability and by adopting an encompassing approach to analysing and assessinginformation relevant to detect risks to price stability.Defining price stability as "a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices ofbelow 2%", along with the emphasis on the medium term, was designed to enhance clarity, to anchorexpectations and to provide a yardstick against which the new independent institution could be heldaccountable.Likewise, the eclectic but systematic approach to the processing of information relevant for assessingrisks to price stability, which we call our two-pillar strategy of monetary policy, was intended toguarantee that no piece of evidence relevant to policy decision-making would be excluded from theGoverning Council's information set. The prominent role assigned to money, as the first pillar of ourstrategy, ensures that monetary developments are always part of the picture, and receive the attentionthat they deserve, given the monetary nature of inflation beyond the immediate horizon. In parallel, thesecond pillar of the strategy ensures that other forms of analysis, such as the investigation of theinterplay between supply and demand and cost-push dynamics, are also incorporated into the policyprocess. Together, the two pillars ensure that information and analysis produced on the basis of onemethodological perspective are always cross-checked against information and analysis produced onthe basis of the other.Analysis under the two pillars provides the Governing Council with all crucial information regarding thenature of the shocks within the euro area economy and the resulting risks to price stability. Thecomplementing viewpoints of the two pillars have served us well as a comprehensive framework foranalysis in the past two years. The strategy has provided the basis for a thorough and timelyexplanation of monetary policy decisions to the general public.The current situationSince November 1999, the Governing Council raised the main ECB interest rates by a total of 225basis points in reaction to a perspective of upward risks to price stability. These rises have beenappropriate. Recent developments point towards increasingly balanced risks to price stability in themedium term. However, the analysis of the information relating to the two pillars of the monetary policystrategy showed that there are still factors which might pose upward risks to price stability and as suchwill need to continue to be closely monitored.Starting with the first pillar, monetary and credit growth have slowed down in the course of 2000. Thegrowth of M3 has gradually approached the reference value of 4 1/2% confirming that the risks to pricestability stemming from the monetary side have become more balanced in comparison to the situationin early 2000. In fact, the short term dynamics of M3 growth in the second half of 2000 were clearlyweaker than in the first half of 2000. This will become visible in the annual growth rate of M3 in thecoming months which will be affected downwards by base effects resulting from the strong growth ofM3 in the first quarter of 2000.Turning to the second pillar, several developments have recently changed somewhat the outlook forthe euro area. Most notably, the slowdown in the US economy and recent developments in Japanhave increased the uncertainty surrounding the prospects for world growth. It is now clear that theinternational outlook is no longer as positive as it has been for almost two years. World real GDPgrowth, which in 2000 posted its strongest performance for many years, may moderate in 2001, but isexpected to remain solid.However, whereas the euro area is not immune to external developments, it is a relatively closedeconomy. While the more moderate prospects for world growth might end up being associated withsome further slowdown in economic activity in the euro area, the dynamics of domestic demandsuggest that, overall, the outlook for sustained euro area growth remains positive. Thisnotwithstanding, real GDP growth in 2001 might turn out somewhat lower than expected earlier.However, all in all, realistic optimism is justified.Turning to consumer price developments, the euro area has seen HICP inflation above 2% for somemonths now. This was mainly due to the unexpected increases in oil prices and the depreciation of theeuro. In December 2000 the annual rate of increase in the HICP declined to 2.6%, from 2.9% inNovember. It is expected that this trend continues in this year although it may take some time for HICPinflation to fall again below 2%. The moderation in oil prices and the appreciation of the euro exchange
4BIS Review 15/2001rate would, if sustained, contribute to a faster decline in overall HICP inflation over the course of thisyear.The evolution of external inflation forecasts and of inflation expectations as derived from the analysisof long-term interest rates is reassuring. It suggests that financial markets and economists expectprice developments in the medium to long term to be in line with the ECB's definition of price stability.In spite of the assessment that the risks to price stability in the medium term are now more balanced,there are still factors posing upside risks which require continued attention. One risk is related to theevolution of wages in the period ahead. It is important that wage moderation continues. This should befacilitated by the decline in consumer price inflation which is expected to occur over the comingmonths. However, the increase in some labour cost indicators in 2000 warrants close scrutiny. Asecond important factor will be fiscal policy in the euro area. The relaxation of consolidation efforts atthis juncture will lead to an undesirable pro-cyclical impact. In order not to threaten the progress infiscal consolidation, the reduction in the tax burden has to be accompanied by a structural reduction ofexpenditure.When evaluating the current situation, I would like to emphasise the obvious, namely that themonetary policy decisions of the ECB are based on the assessment formulated under both pillars ofthe monetary policy strategy of the ECB and nothing else. The outcome of this assessment is not leastreflected in the level of the minimum bid rate on the main refinancing operations. This assessmentwhich is transmitted to the public by the ECB's well-known instruments of communication, and notshort-term oriented expectations in financial markets on decisions in the next meeting of theGoverning Council, is decisive for the monetary policy stance of the ECB.Challenges for the euro areaIn the context of the recent US slowdown, the following question is often raised: Who might takeresponsibility over from the United States for "global growth"? I would contend that this question ismisleading from the outset. Indeed, the US economic policy has, in my view, always been conducted,and rightly so, with a clear focus on domestic objectives. It is important to note in this regard that theperiods of success of the US economic policy from a domestic point of view, i.e. the periods ofsustainable non-inflationary growth in the US, have actually coincided with the periods whensignificant contributions to both growth and stability in the whole world were made by the US.In principle, the same logic should also hold for the euro area. The euro area is the second largesteconomic area in the world. Therefore economic developments in the euro area are significant fordevelopments and prospects elsewhere. The mandate of the ECB clearly states that price stability inthe euro area is its primary objective. Price stability is indeed a key element of an overall environmentleading to sustained growth at domestic level.In such a context, the best contribution which a large economy as the euro area can provide tosupport sustainable non-inflationary growth in the world economy is to pursue policies maintainingprice stability "at home". This is the only reasonable allocation of responsibilities across world policy-makers. Anything else risks blurring responsibilities and diluting accountability. This, in turn, woulddistort incentives in a perverse way.It goes without saying that exchange of information and views, for instance in the context ofinternational fora, may in such a context further help the policy-makers of large economies assumetheir global responsibilities by providing them with a better understanding of the economicenvironment.Notwithstanding the clearly positive outlook for the euro area, a lot has still to be done. While monetarypolicy will have to remain focused on its commitment to maintain price stability -thereby providing acredible anchor for expectations, the challenge for the euro area will be to best exploit and enlarge itsgrowth potential in the coming years.Structural reforms have taken place but are far from being satisfactory in most countries. Theirimplementation is of crucial importance to foster the supply of labour and capital and the innovationand diffusion of new technologies and production methods. More flexibility in labour markets andreforms aiming to encourage labour force participation are necessary to offset the low growth in theworking age population. Fostering a knowledge-driven economy, removing barriers to investment andcreating the institutional structures needed for a rapid and efficient adoption of new technologies, willstrengthen the process of capital accumulation. The ongoing current regulatory reform process will
BIS Review 15/20015create the conditions to enhance competition and is expected to have important economic benefits.Overall, sound economic policies designed to avoid the appearance of economic imbalances andstructural reforms will allow the euro area to better exploit its growth potential, thereby alsocontributing to growth and economic stability worldwide.ConclusionTo conclude, let me recall what I said at the beginning of my address. While I am not satisfied withHICP inflation of above 2% as we have at present, price stability will be maintained over the mediumterm. What I regard as most important is the fact that medium-term inflation expectations are still inline with price stability and, in my view, rightly so. We are convinced that we are well equipped topursue a stability-oriented monetary policy and thus gain the trust of the public. The euro has provento be a stable currency for Europe and the world economy, and the best contribution the ECB can doto sustain this achievement is to maintain price stability in the euro area.
BIS Review 14/20011Svein Gjedrem: Economic perspectivesAnnual address by Mr Svein Gjedrem, Governor of the Norges Bank, at the meeting of theSupervisory Council of Norges Bank, Gausdal, 15 February 2001.*      *      *IntroductionNorway’s economy is today characterised by substantial petroleum revenues, sharp growth ingovernment expenditure, a tight labour market and high cost inflation. High oil prices and sizeablepetroleum production are contributing to surpluses on the current account and the central governmentbudget. This has also resulted in a vigorous rise in Norway’s disposable income. The current accountsurplus in 2000, which was equivalent to about 14 per cent of GDP, is among the highest surplusesrecorded by an OECD country in the post-war period. The total general government budget surplusalso rose sharply, reaching 14½ per cent of GDP.With the exception of a brief pause in growth from the summer of 1998, the Norwegian economy hasbeen expanding since 1993. Employment has risen and unemployment has fallen to just over 3 percent. A shortage of labour in many sectors has resulted in a relatively sharp growth in labour costs inNorway.Surplus as a percentage of GDP andincome growth for Norway-40481216199819992000-40481216Current account balancePublic sectorDisposable income(growth rates)Employment growthPer cent-4-2024691929394959697989900-4-20246General governmentManufacturing
2BIS Review14?/2001Whereas the upturn was balanced for a long period, the public sector has laid claim to a large share ofthe increase in the labour supply in recent years. Manufacturing employment has fallen markedly since1998.The mainland economy features some aspects that are associated with a boom period, althoughgrowth is low. After several years of mainland GDP growth in the order of 3-4 per cent, activity is nowincreasing by less than 2 per cent a year. The economy is operating near capacity limits.New working time reforms, increased use of sick pay and disability benefits and a reduced supply oflabour from other Nordic countries are restraining growth in many sectors. Moreover, there is noevidence suggesting that productivity growth in Norway has picked up to the levels in some of ourneighbouring countries.International equity prices declined sharply last autumn. In the US, output and employment arestagnating. As shown in the chart, the risk premium in capital markets on long-term credit toenterprises has increased. In addition, many international enterprises now have a poorer credit ratingthan earlier This has also affected borrowing in Norwegian companies, which now have to placegreater emphasis on their customers’ ability to honour commitments. International financial and capitalmarkets are characterised by uncertainty and unrest.This unrest is not found among economic agents in Norway. As long as oil prices are high, theNorwegian economy is fairly sheltered. Many central banks are now reducing their key rates. As oureconomy is affected to a lesser extent, the differential between short rates in Norway and abroad maywiden.Monetary policyThe long-term objective of monetary policy is to provide the Norwegian economy with a nominalanchor – domestic price stability, and thereby the basis for a stable krone. Nominal stability is the bestcontribution monetary policy can make to economic growth and prosperity. A nominal anchor is also anecessary precondition for stable financial markets and property markets. High inflation and wideswings in the exchange rate impair the function of prices as an information vehicle. This leads tobooms followed by busts and an arbitrary redistribution of income and wealth. Inflation thereforepoisons the economy.By linking movements in the krone to the euro, we have chosen to follow the same standard fornominal stability in the economy as set by the euro area countries.Risk premia for private companies in the USPercentage points02461993199419951996199719981999200020010246Low riskMedium riskHigh risk
BIS Review 14/20013Since 1997, inflation has been higher in Norway than in the euro area. The difference partly reflects aperiod of strong growth in Norway, while the level of activity in Europe has been low. The higher levelof inflation in Norway cannot be sustained, however, as this would undermine the basis for stability inthe krone exchange rate and confidence in monetary policy.Short-term capital inflows and outflows are probably the most important factor determining movementsin the krone exchange rate from day to day, from week to week and from one quarter to the next. Theyare governed by expectations concerning future returns. Changes in expectations concerning thefuture value of the krone can trigger extensive capital movements.As a rule, Norges Bank does not intervene in foreign exchange markets with a view to influencing thekrone exchange rate. The krone is floating, and the value of the krone fluctuates in periods by thesame magnitude as exchange rates in other open economies. Nevertheless, the prevailing stability ofthe krone is largely a reflection of confidence that inflation in Norway will be kept at a low level.Our experience is that changes in the Norwegian interest rate level only have a predictable effect onthe krone exchange rate when the change in interest rates also contributes to stabilising inflation.However, the relationship between interest rates and price and cost developments is uncertain. Thesetting of interest rates thus requires the use of professional judgement and discretion. The basis forexercising discretion is subject to limitations, however. Should any doubt arise as to whether theinterest rate is oriented towards nominal stability, this would trigger substantial capital movements.An inappropriate setting of interest rates could easily jeopardise financial stability in the domesticeconomy. The experience of Norway and other countries shows that credit and property markets canbe very unstable. If interest rates are kept at too low a level for too long, credit demand will riseInflation 1990 - 2001Per cent012345199019921994199619982000012345NorwayEuro areaIndexPer centHouse prices and real interest rateafter tax80100120140160198019841988199219962000-8-4048Real interest rate(right-hand scale)Real house price(left-hand scale)
4BIS Review14?/2001sharply, as we witnessed in the 1980s. At that time, rising property prices generated expectations offurther price increases, which in turn led to rising credit demand. When the bubble burst, recessionensued with falling asset values, a debt crisis and a growing number of bankruptcies. It is important tobear in mind that this instability is inherent in financial and property markets. We cannot rely on thememory of market participants.Interaction with income formationA precondition for a stable krone exchange rate against European currencies is that price and costinflation in Norway must over time not exceed the corresponding aim for inflation of the EuropeanCentral Bank (ECB). The ECB orients monetary policy instruments towards price stability, and hasdefined price stability as an inflation rate below 2 per cent. The rise in prices for imported goods isexpected to continue to be relatively low, leaving room for a somewhat higher rise in prices fordomestically produced goods and services. Corporate profits and margins vary and influence priceinflation from one year to the next, but are to some extent self-regulating. High margins tend to resultin stronger wage growth, while low margins lead to tighter cost control. Profits will thus revert toprevious levels. Over time, productivity growth therefore determines the level of wage growth that isconsistent with stability in prices and the exchange rate. With productivity growth around the averagefor the 1980s and 1990s, ie in the order of one and a half per cent per year, nominal wage growthshould be brought down to between 3 and 4 per cent. There will be room for higher wage growth ifproductivity growth increases, as seems to be the case in Sweden and Finland.In recent years, cost inflation in the euro area countries and among trading partners has beenrelatively low. Growth in labour costs in Norway has been roughly 11 percentage points higher than inthe euro area and 10 percentage points higher than among trading partners in the past three years.Rise in labour costs Per cent0246819901992199419961998200002468NorwayEuro areaTrading partnersRise in labour costs andunemployment1995 and 2000.

BIS Review 14/20015A number of other small, open economies have recorded a decline in unemployment and lower growthin labour costs than Norway. In Sweden, unemployment has shown a substantial decrease over thepast five years and wage growth is below 4 per cent. Three-year wage agreements are now beingconcluded, underpinning the basis for low cost inflation. In the Netherlands, unemployment has fallento a very low level. Wage growth has picked up, but is lower than in Norway. In Denmark,unemployment has come down without an increase in wage growth. In Finland, unemployment hasfallen sharply from the high level that took hold in the 1990s, and wage growth has slowed. In the euroarea, unemployment has dropped without an increase in wage growth. In Norway, the high growth inlabour costs may be a source of rising unemployment.In connection with the wage settlement last year, short-term interest rates rose by 1½ percentagepoints. The substantial rise in costs in Norway, which was reflected in the strong pay increases forwhite-collar employees and in the centralised income settlement, contributed to pushing up interestrates. In previous periods, higher wage growth has also been accompanied by a rise in interest rates.In 1998, the negotiated wage increases, in conjunction with the depreciation of the krone exchangerate, led to a rise in interest rates of 4½ percentage points over the spring and summer months. Theincome settlement in 1986, which was negotiated during the strongest boom in the post-war period,resulted in a severe cost shock for Norwegian enterprises and, combined with the fall in oil prices,forced a devaluation of the Norwegian krone. This was followed by high interest rates over severalyears. Falling wage and cost inflation from 1989, however, provided the basis for the decline in interestrates from 1992. The centralised income settlements are important for wage and interest ratedevelopments, but they do not take place in a vacuum. The outcome is influenced by labour markettightness and income developments for groups other than those covered by the centralisedsettlements.Norwegian key rates are currently 1½ percentage points higher than in the US, 2¼ percentage pointshigher than in the euro area, and 3 percentage points higher than in Sweden. In some countries,short-term interest rates are now moving down and in other countries expectations of interest rateincreases have receded. Norges Bank has a neutral bias with regard to interest rates developments,partly reflecting price and cost developments in Norway, as illustrated in the chart.In general, it can be argued that when wage and cost inflation is expected to rise and deviate from therate of increase in the euro area, or when unexpected upwards shifts in labour costs occur, interestrates must be raised to avoid rising inflation and a weaker krone. In our open economy, with a floatingexchange rate, it can be assumed that an increase in wage growth of one percentage point willgradually translate into a corresponding increase in price inflation unless the wage increases areanchored in higher productivity. The magnitude of the increase in interest rates must be consistentwith this. First, nominal interest rates must be increased in order to maintain real interest rates.Second, real interest rates must also be increased with a view to removing the causes behind thedifferentials.Rise in labour costs, 1998-2000Key rates and rise in labour costsPer cent0246802468Euro areaSwedenUSNorwayNew ZealandJapanDenmarkUKAustraliaCanadaInterest rates
6BIS Review14?/2001Interaction with fiscal policyIt is important that the annual budgets are based on a long-term strategy that takes into accountpossible fluctuations in oil revenues from one year to the next. With large and, to some extent, varyingbudget revenues, the basis for determining central government expenditure and taxes from one yearto the next may easily be impaired. If budget spending is allowed to vary in step with oil prices, theNorwegian economy may experience abrupt shifts and instability. Changes in oil prices may thenquickly influence wage and price expectations, the exchange rate and long-term rates. In addition,short-term rates would have to be changed frequently and sharply.In recent years, central government real underlying spending growth has accelerated somewhat. Bothin 2000 and 2001, spending growth has been higher than 2 per cent, which is above potential growthin the mainland economy. At the same time, taxes have increased. Fiscal policy has thus had avirtually neutral effect on domestic demand for two years while wage growth has been substantiallyhigher than in other countries.A possible interpretation of this development is that it is more demanding to use the governmentbudget to dampen cyclical fluctuations during an upturn than during a downturn. The willingness andability to pursue a counter-cyclical policy may in itself be cyclical.Another interpretation is that a neutral fiscal policy in a year featuring a sharp increase in governmentfinancial assets reflects a balance between using the government budget to stabilise the economy andphasing in higher financial revenues in the economy.Irrespective, a gradual shift in economic policy is taking place. While fiscal policy is having a neutralimpact on domestic demand, monetary policy is having a contractionary effect. This is partly reflectedin higher short-term rates compared with long-term rates. The focus of the income settlements mayalso be said to have changed somewhat since the mid-1990s, with less emphasis on balanced labourmarket developments.Natural resources and growth capacityPetroleum revenues fluctuate widely, with substantial uncertainty as to future developments. Thisraises the question of how quickly petroleum revenues shall be used. The term “Dutch disease” wasfirst used to describe the situation in the Dutch economy in the 1970s and 1980s after revenues fromthe large gas finds in the Groningen field were used to finance strong growth in public expenditure.When the gas revenues declined and growth in the economy came to a halt, a tightening of policy wasnecessary and unemployment rose.The Norwegian economy was also hit by the Dutch disease in the 1980s. The reason was that in theprevious decade the state had budgeted on the basis of future strong growth in petroleum revenues.Welfare schemes were expanded. As in the Netherlands, manufacturing industry was scaled back.The recession after the bubble burst in the credit market and oil prices fell in 1986 was much deeperthan would have been the case if we had maintained a larger and competitive manufacturing sector.Budget tightening and spending growthPercentage change from previous year-2-10123-2-10123939495969798990001Spending growthTotal effect of the budget
BIS Review 14/20017Norwegian industry lost export market shares in the late 1980s in spite of the booming conditionsabroad and substantial capacity slack at home. The Dutch disease, both in the Netherlands and inNorway, led to higher unemployment and substantial social losses. However, in both countries theeconomy was back on track in the 1990s.At the same time, the experience of other countries indicates that in the long run the supply of naturalresources can prove to be just as much of a disadvantage as an advantage for a nation’s economy.Many countries with an abundance of natural resources are poor today. They have not used theresources to provide for sustainable higher income. Since 1950, developments in many oil-producingnations have been very unstable, while many Asian and European countries without access to naturalresources are among the world’s richest countries. It would appear that easy money can reduce thegrowth capacity in an economy. A comparison of economic developments in Norway and the otherNordic countries in recent years may also be a source of concern. Their business sector now seems tohave a stronger growth capacity than our own.There are three pitfalls that must be avoided.First, in countries with substantial revenues from natural resources, growth conditions for theinternationally exposed sector may become less favourable. The exposure of large parts of theeconomy to intense foreign competition provides a breeding ground for learning, innovation anddevelopment. Competitive pressures in sheltered sectors, such as internal trade and publicenterprises, are normally more limited. In my view, it is essential to maintain a broad exposed sector inthe mainland economy, primarily because of the effect this has on the growth capacity of the economy.Second, substantial petroleum wealth can weaken financial discipline in enterprises that are financedor assume that they can be financed by the public sector. If enterprises assume that the centralgovernment will provide support, resources may be squandered and the risk of substantial losses maybe given little emphasis. The organisation of public enterprises is thus important. The centralgovernment’s financial responsibility for individual enterprises and for other levels of publicadministration must be delimited in a credible manner.Third, petroleum production generates a profit in excess of a normal return, ie economic rent. Aseconomic rent accrues to the state, the central government is now accumulating substantial capital. Astrong interest in gaining access to this capital can easily arise. There is a risk that entrepreneurship,talent and energy in the business sector and political life are used to acquire a piece of the economicrent – to dance around the golden calf – rather than for innovation, restructuring and growth.Decision-making forms in economic and political life must provide an effective shield to prevent specialinterests from gaining a dominant influence and control over petroleum wealth. The risk is particularlyhigh in cases where markets are not efficient and where the remuneration for an assignment or theprice of the resource that is transferred from the state are agreed through negotiations. The EEAAgreement restricts the scope for favouring individual enterprises or groups of enterprises. The eagercontrol exercised by the surveillance body, the ESA, reduces the possibility for pressure groups toprevail. It is important for growth capacity that both national and international competition authoritiesengage in effective supervision in order to avoid the development of a business sector that isdependent on protection.Against this background, I would like to expand on the central government’s asset position and wealthmanagement.
8BIS Review14?/2001The government’s asset position and wealth managementThe table shows in simplified form the central government’s financial assets and liabilities, withestimates for the balance at the end of 2000. The government’s most important assets are theGovernment Petroleum Fund, assets in the National Insurance Fund, and the state’s direct ownershipinterests in enterprises. The estimate for the government’s direct ownership in the table includesStatoil, Norsk Hydro, Telenor, Statkraft and DnB. In addition, the state has many smaller stakes anddirect loans through the state banks. The government has loan debt. In the table, the figures for theNational Insurance Fund are consolidated as the Fund’s claims on the central government and thecentral government’s debt to the Fund are offset. The table shows that the central government’s loansthrough the state banks are approximately the same as the central government’s loan debt. Thecentral government raises loans in the bond market and lends through the state banks. The interestrate on the loans and the pricing of risk are market-related. If we exclude this credit intermediation, themanagement of government wealth is primarily linked to state ownership interests in the Norwegianbusiness sector, the National Insurance Fund and the Government Petroleum Fund.In the years ahead, the capital in the Petroleum Fund will increase as the surplus on the centralgovernment budget is transferred to the Fund. The chart shows the estimates for growth in thePetroleum Fund. The projections, as they should be, are based on prudent assumptions concerning oiland gas prices, the return on the Fund and the domestic use of oil revenues.The state’s direct financial interest in petroleum activities (SDFI) may be regarded as part of the taxsystem.

BIS Review 14/20019economic rent benefit society without such a field-specific instrument. It is doubtful whether thegovernment can fully realise the value of the SDFI through its disposal.Buyers may have more knowledge about the holdings than the seller. Companies that buy SDFIstakes will also face some uncertainty as to the future tax system, which will have a negative effect ontheir willingness to pay. It is therefore understandable that only a smaller share of the SDFI is offeredfor sale. At the same time, the sale of the SDFI increases the need to remedy the substantialloopholes that have been found in the petroleum tax system.The previous table showing government assets and liabilities does not, however, provide a completepicture of the government’s financial position. The right to tax corporate and personal income andwealth and to levy indirect taxes is clearly the government’s most important asset. Generalgovernment tax revenues are estimated at close to NOK630 billion this year. The expected real returnon government net financial wealth is about a sixteenth of this. In 2005, when the value of theGovernment Petroleum Fund could reach NOK1200 billion, the total return on government financialassets will approach one tenth of general government revenues at the current tax level.At the same time, future expenditure on pensions, health, education, infrastructure and the judicialsystem represents a major commitment for the government.Government expenditure for maintaining and developing the welfare state will increase substantially inthe years ahead, primarily as a result of demographic trends. Estimates show that governmentexpenditure on old-age pensions and disability benefits will double from 7½ per cent of GDP in 2001to 15 per cent of GDP in 30 years. At the same time, it is reasonable to assume that spending on otherprogrammes, which are today financed over government budgets, will increase as a share of totalGDP.With the current tax level, in conjunction with the challenges that increased trade and globalisationpose to the tax system, there would hardly be scope for increasing taxes. It would therefore bereasonable to assert that the value of the right to tax is lower than the value of commitments taken onby the government when the intention is to develop the welfare state. Without substantial governmentsaving in the years ahead, promises to preserve the welfare state will lose credibility. The governmentthus has a clear motive for saving. At the same time, the high level of petroleum revenues, asmentioned, provides scope for accumulating substantial government financial wealth.In my view, three points are of importance with regard to government wealth management.First, investment must be based on the reason underlying government saving which, as I understandit, is to distribute petroleum wealth across generations and establish a foundation for maintainingimportant elements of the welfare state.Second, the manager must seek to achieve a maximum return within duly considered risk limits.Returns and risk must be monitored continuously. The return and the risk limit must reflect thegovernment’s motive for saving.Government assets and liabilitiesEstimates In billions of NOKRight to taxCommitments of thewelfare stateAssetsPetroleum FundNorwegian NationalInsurance FundDirect ownershipMinor holdings39050300100LiabilitiesBonds andTreasury bills170State banks’ lending165
10BIS Review14?/2001Third, the management must be organised so that the manager pursues the objectives of the ownerand does not develop its own goals.The government’s motive for saving resembles the motives underlying saving in pension funds and lifeinsurance companies. Among the government’s saving vehicles, investments in the NationalInsurance Fund and the Government Petroleum Fund are best adapted to this motive for saving.For both funds, there is a clear division of responsibility between the manager and the government,with the Ministry of Finance as owner. In the case of the Petroleum Fund, Norges Bank’s mandate isto achieve the highest possible financial return in keeping with the strategy and risk limits establishedby the government.The Fund’s investments are distributed among many countries and spread among a large number ofequities and bonds. At end-2000, the Fund had invested NOK 153 billion in about 1800 companies in21 countries, while NOK 234 billion had been invested in bonds in 18 countries. All ownership interestsare now less than 1 per cent of the companies’ total value. A turnaround in one country or a region,which in isolation may be pronounced, will not have a major effect on the total value of the Fund. Thevalue of the Fund’s equity portfolio will therefore shadow developments in prices on international stockexchanges. There is a substantial element of risk diversification, although we are not immune to therisk associated with the uncertainty in global developments. Along the same lines, the return on bondinvestments will reflect international interest rate developments.The Government Petroleum Fund is built up through transfers of petroleum revenues that are not useddomestically. In other words, the value of a natural resource is converted into a financial asset. Thename of the Fund was chosen to reflect this. However, one weakness that may be associated with thePetroleum Fund is that the objective of saving is not sufficiently highlighted. The future use ofrevenues could have been made clearer either by choosing another name or by earmarking the capitalfor specific future uses, even though this would imply a constraint on the government’s scope formanoeuvre. The study that is being planned may analyse fundamental and practical aspects ofestablishing a link between the pension system in Norway and the assets in the GovernmentPetroleum Fund.The National Insurance Fund’s investments are mainly confined to Norway. As a result, changes in thevalue of the Fund’s equity portfolio primarily reflect developments in Norwegian business and industry.The Fund has larger ownership interests in individual companies than the Petroleum Fund, and widerfluctuations in value.As indicated in the chart, the government has substantial holdings in individual companies. Thegovernment’s five largest stakes in Norwegian companies can be roughly estimated atNOK 300 billion. In general, concentrated ownership requires a more strategic ownership approachand gives rise to higher risk than diversified ownership.State ownershipNOK bnOwnership interests per enterprise0501001500-11-55-1010-1515-4040-4950-7475-99100Financial investorStrategic ownerRiskPetroleum Fund'sequitiesNational InsuranceFund's equitiesDirect ownershipLowHigh
BIS Review 14/200111This is illustrated further in the chart. The composition of government assets is broken down intoequities and bonds in the Petroleum Fund and the National Insurance Fund and governmentownership interests in the five largest companies. The horizontal axis provides a normal measure ofrisk, in other words the standard deviation of the return. The risk is estimated on the basis of thehistorical performance of the companies’ share prices. For unlisted companies, we have used shareprice performance for comparable international companies. Higher risk means that the assets aremore exposed to fluctuations in return. As a whole, the return on the Petroleum Fund and the return onprivate bond holdings in the National Insurance Fund feature a moderate risk profile. The risk is higherfor both the National Insurance Fund’s equities and the state’s ownership interests in the five largestcompanies.For a given expected return, the owner should aim at reducing risk because future income will then bemore secure. Conversely, the owner should require a higher return on investments with higher risk.The absence of this excess return will reflect social losses.It is important to bear in mind that the government can choose the composition, the required returnand the risk profile with regard to its financial investments without taking into account the fundingrequirements of Norwegian companies. By the same token, Norwegian companies can choose theirdebt and equity structure independent of the government’s financial investments. The capital marketserves as an intermediary between the government as investor and enterprises seeking capital. Thismarket makes it possible to separate the government’s choices from companies’ choices. Thedistribution of the government’s financial investments and the choice of corporate funding structureshould not be based on the notion that we are living in a barter economy. The Norwegian capitalmarket is part of a Nordic market, which is being increasingly integrated into an international capitalmarket. Capital markets are a very efficient tool for channelling funds from savers to investors.Direct strategic ownership could nevertheless be the best solution if it generates a high return and thegovernment has a solid basis for exercising its role as owner. There is some room for doubtconcerning both points. The government has often neglected its demanding role as owner. A numberof shortcomings stand out with regard to the way government ownership is managed.First, the government has shown little ability and willingness to impose clear and ambitious returnrequirements and control the financial risk in companies where it has a dominant stake. In addition, ifthe companies are underperforming, both jobs and regions will be adversely affected.Second, the government has not developed effective management of equity in the companies. Thesize of equity and the dividend policy seem to be randomly determined by historical factors. Newequity management instruments, such as share buy-backs and extraordinary dividends, are seldomused. On the whole, it seems difficult for a state-owned enterprise and for the state as owner toacknowledge that a growth period may have come to an end and that the owners should invest theircapital elsewhere.Third, the state as owner will always have a strong aversion to negative corporate events. On theother hand, the state will provide little extra rewards to a company that has boosted its return on equityby one or two percentage points. The result is an erosion of an important driving force behind growth.Risk associated with stateownership010020030001020PetroleumFund's equitiesNational InsuranceFund's equitiesNational InsuranceFund's private bondsThe five largeststate enterprisesPetroleumFund's bondsNOK bnReturn risk
12BIS Review14?/2001In a state-owned enterprise the board or management of the company and the state as owner mayhave a common interest in overcapitalising the company because they will then both be on the safeside.Fourth, the state has complex and elaborate procedures for making decisions. Moreover, theprocedures are designed to accommodate tasks other than the role of ownership. Studies in politicalscience show that the weighing of interests occurs through deliberations in ministries or parliamentarystanding committees. As a result, decision-making procedures may not be suitable for the owner toprovide clear management signals and ensure consistency over time.Fifth, it is difficult for the government to maintain clear dividing lines between its various roles.Considerations regarding business policy, state finances and demand management can impairownership management and make it a disadvantage for an enterprise to be owned by the state.Historical factors tend to explain each of the government’s current strategic ownership interests. Somestate enterprises have changed from a state monopoly with administrative functions to companies thatnow compete in a market. Ownership, for example in the electricity sector, may in other cases havebeen a historical instrument for providing the government with economic rent.Several of the former state-owned enterprises have been partly privatised, which could contribute toimproving the management of companies by its owners. Company performance will receive greaterattention, for example. This would enhance the management of equity capital and create greaterimpatience with regard to performance. This would stimulate growth. The sale of state ownershipinterests will also enhance the efficiency of the domestic capital market, which now primarily features ashortage of investment vehicles rather than a shortage of capital.At the same time, it is important for the state to assume the ownership responsibility associated withits remaining ownership interests. As a large owner, the state will have to safeguard its financialinterests ensuing from its current holdings. This is partly because various owners may have differentinterests to promote. Joint ownership is not the same as joint interests.The reason for government ownership that seems to have been highlighted most is the importance ofnational ownership. There may be concern that the acquisition of Norwegian companies could lead toa relocation of head offices, research and product development to a foreign country. Proximitybetween decision-makers and enterprises may also be important. On the other hand, it may be adisadvantage for an enterprise to be designated as a means of safeguarding national ownership. Thestate may after a period find that it owns enterprises that were, but no longer are important. Thebusiness sector is not static.At the same time, cross-border acquisitions and sales of companies are important for disseminatingknowledge and technology and thus for enhancing growth. Value added in Norwegian companies canbe increased when they acquire foreign companies, and in many cases Norwegian jobs may be moresecure under the ownership of a company located abroad. The best contribution to balancedownership is a well functioning Norwegian capital market, a solid infrastructure in infrastructure, aneutral tax treatment of investment and a well educated workforce. Changes in state ownership of twoof the three largest Norwegian commercial banks illustrate that national considerations, althoughdeemed important, are not always decisive.Management of centralgovernment wealth•The central government's motive for saving- confidence in the welfare state•Management adapted to the motive for saving•Separate the government’s investment profilefrom corporate funding•Sale of state shares contributes to highergrowth
BIS Review 14/200113Allow me to conclude by summing up my discussion of government wealth management as follows:• The government has a clear motive to save, which is to distribute petroleum wealth acrossgenerations and foster confidence in the welfare state. These considerations may imply aconsiderable accumulation of capital in the hands of the government.• Wealth management must be adapted to the government’s motive to save. The modelschosen for the National Insurance Fund and the Government Petroleum Fund satisfy this.• The government’s choice of investment strategy and Norwegian companies’ choice offunding structure should be looked upon as two separate things. The capital market is themost effective tool for channelling funds from saver to investors.• Divestment of government ownership interests in the Norwegian business sector willcontribute to enhancing ownership management and will stimulate growth.Thank you for your attention.
BIS Review 13/20011Joseph Yam: Fourth Hong Kong Monetary Authority Distinguished Lecture:opening remarksOpening remarks by Mr Joseph Yam, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, at theFourth Hong Kong Monetary Authority Distinguished Lecture on the theme of Monetary Policy andFinancial Stability, Hong Kong, 13 February 2001. *      *      *It is an honour for me to welcome Mr Andrew Crockett to deliver this Fourth Hong Kong MonetaryAuthority Distinguished Lecture. I am also delighted to welcome Dato’ Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz as theDiscussant. Both are good friends of the HKMA, and it is a special pleasure to see them here todaybefore this large and diverse audience. I extend to all of you, on behalf of the HKMA, a very warmwelcome.The subject matter of this Lecture – monetary policy and financial stability – is at the heart of centralbanking. Much attention has been given to resolving the apparent conflicts between the two desirableobjectives of monetary stability and financial stability, at the policy as well as the operation levels. Therecent experience of a number of jurisdictions has indicated problems in achieving bothsimultaneously. Some have gone as far as to introduce institutional changes to alleviate the tension,or the embarrassment, or the risk of policy credibility being undermined as a result of such conflicts.While the jury is still out on what institutional arrangements for delivering simultaneously monetary andfinancial stability are appropriate, there is doubt as to whether institutional changes, politicallyattractive as they may be, are the right answer. Today Andrew will give us his insights on the subject.He is particularly qualified to do so, being responsible for the running of the central bank of centralbanks.Some of you may feel that this subject matter is a little arid. I am aware of the fact that those in theprivate sector have, particularly at this time of the year, more practical and "profitable" issuesoccupying their minds. But the achievement of monetary and financial stability is central to anysuccessful economy and therefore important to the general conduct of business. It is also a burningissue in this region, where the experiences over the last few years have underlined its importance, andthe consequences of failure. Knowing Andrew, who has an admirable ability to present technicallycomplex issues of money and finance in the simplest of terms, I am sure you will find the subjectrefreshingly interesting.Andrew Crockett has been General Manager of the Bank for International Settlements since 1994. Topursue the classroom metaphor that I used at the last lecture to describe how central bankers get onwith each other when they come together at meetings, Andrew’s job is to be the "class prefect" or"captain", who maintains order and prevents us from banging our heads too hardly at each other. Hedoes this difficult job with immense grace and diplomatic skill. He is also the "sports captain", amongcentral bankers, and organises the annual Governor’s Cup at a very fine golf course close to theFranco-Swiss border. In addition, Andrew doubles up as our gastronomic and oenological consultantat the informal social events that are an important part of any international gathering.Andrew has been a staunch supporter of Hong Kong and the HKMA for a very long time – indeed,formerly as an Executive Director of the Bank of England, he played an instrumental role in theconception of the HKMA. Since he became General Manager of the BIS in 1994, the HKMA’s ties withthe BIS have gone from strength to strength. We joined the BIS as a shareholder in 1996. In 1998,Hong Kong became the location of the BIS’s first overseas office – an office which has becomeextremely active in this region, with its most recent event being the organisation in Hong Kong of amajor BIS Governors’ meeting, held just this last weekend. In 1999, Hong Kong was invited, as one ofthe four non-G10 economies, to join the Financial Stability Forum, which Andrew chairs: this forum hasthe job of proposing reforms to the international financial architecture, and it is making good progressin this herculean task.As discussant for today’s lecture, we are privileged to have Dato Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz, who has beenGovernor of Bank Negara Malaysia since May last year, and who is another one of the ‘classmates’ atBIS. I have known Dr Zeti for some years now and benefited from her wise counsel, particularly duringthe time when she was Assistant Governor in charge of economic research. Dr Zeti is a career central
2BIS Review 13/2001banker who joined Bank Negara in 1985 and who has taken up various important positions withinBank Negara. She played a pivotal role in steering, very successfully, Malaysia through the AsianFinancial Crisis and in introducing the very important financial sector reforms. Dr Zeti is therefore ableto offer a particularly practical perspective on today’s theme, and I look forward to her comments withmuch interest.Ladies and Gentlemen, I now have great pleasure in calling upon our speaker, Mr Andrew Crockett, todeliver the fourth HKMA Distinguished Lecture. Mr Crockett, please.
BIS Review 13/20011Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz: Response to “Monetary Policy and Financial Stability” byMr Andrew CrockettResponse by Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz, Governor of Bank Negara Malaysia, to “Monetary Policy andFinancial Stability” by Mr Andrew Crockett, at the Fourth HKMA Distinguished Lecture, Hong Kong,13 February 2001. *      *      *Mr Joseph Yam, Chairman, Mr Andrew Crockett, Distinguished guests, Ladies and Gentlemen,Monetary and financial stability is not an end in itself. It is a means to achieving the ultimate objectiveof a broad based economic prosperity. While there is general agreement that monetary and financialstability are important pre conditions for sustainable growth, there has been less agreement as to howthis might be achieved. The means by which monetary and financial stability is achieved involvescosts. All too often, the focus on achieving monetary and financial stability has been at all costs. It hasbeen argued that the cost of financial crisis, and the subsequent economic crisis would far exceedthese costs. While this may be the case, our quest for monetary and financial stability must take intoaccount the need to minimise the costs of such policy measures on our financial systems and oureconomy.Ladies and Gentlemen,It is my pleasure and indeed my honour, to be invited by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority tocomment on the Distinguished Lecture by Andrew Crockett on this subject of Monetary Policy andFinancial Stability. Andrew Crockett has provided us with a stimulating analysis of what he terms asthe nexus between monetary and prudential policy. He argues that the intensity of this relationship hasbeen underestimated. He makes the point that the failure to appreciate the important synergiesbetween the two objectives of monetary and financial stability has resulted in policies that are lessthan optimal.The presentation highlights that while solid macroeconomic policies are important for maintainingfinancial stability, it is also important to recognise that success in containing inflation is not sufficient toensure financial stability, that financial instability had in fact in recent years been seen to occur inenvironments of low inflation. Andrew Crockett goes on to argue that some of the main causes offinancial instability were in fact macroeconomic in origin, in terms of both the diagnosis and theremedies. In the former, this resulted from misjudgments on the growth prospects as well as changesdriven by market sentiment while in the latter, the pursuit of price stability had infact inadvertentlyendangered the stability of the financial system. This relationship therefore required an enhancedappreciation of the interdependence of policies in the two areas.In this context, Andrew raises the question as to whether monetary policy should have as one of itsobjectives, the prevention of financial excesses and imbalances. While Andrew notes that the end ofthe debate on this issue is not in sight, he does proceed to suggest that in formulating monetarypolicy, Central Banks should take explicit account of the impact of financial developments on thebalance of risk. When credit expansion is rapid and asset prices are increasing faster than the price ofcurrent output, the authorities, he argues should aim for price increases in the lower part of the targetcorridor. While Andrew does acknowledge that such a policy may be considered excessively cautious,particularly when the potential for inflation is remote, he does however makes the point that the cost ofa financial crisis would be far greater than the output forgone by the policy action to constrain suchunsustainable growth.The difficulties with this proposition goes beyond those mentioned in the presentation, that is, thedifficulties relating to the proliferation of objectives, of garnering political support for such policies andthe difficulty of distinguishing sustainable from unsustainable changes in asset prices. My reservationsrelate to whether monetary policy is the most appropriate tool to use in the circumstances described inAndrew’s presentation. What he has proposed implies that Central Banks should tighten monetarypolicy by raising interest rates during times of asset price booms even when this coincides with stableprices of goods and services. The reliance on demand management tools, such as interest rates tocorrect such financial developments and their consequent imbalances may indeed produce the
2BIS Review 13/2001desired results, but it will do so at high costs. In essence, an over adjustment can be expected tooccur.Over adjustment not only occurs due to the higher than necessary interest rates, but also due to thevery reasons mentioned in the presentation, due to the potential for misjudgments about the economyand for market sentiments to move with the business cycle thus amplifying the magnitude of the cycle.Just as irrational exuberance drives asset prices to unrealistic levels, irrational pessimism can reversethe process with equal intensity. The paper further suggests that market participants may also besubject to collective misperception of risks and even if the risk is correctly perceived, the marketreaction may not be the appropriate response.The challenge for policy is to correct any such emerging imbalances in an orderly manner.Consideration needs to be given to alternative policy options. If the concern is with vulnerabilitiesemerging from developments in the asset market, this can be addressed directly by prudential oradministrative measures specific to this sector. Interest rate policy is a blunt instrument that does notdiscriminate between sectors. The end result is a weaker economy and possibly a weaker financialsystem. It is important to recognise that policies that may be generally viable in stable marketconditions may in fact trigger greater instability under unstable market conditions. Under stableconditions and rational market behavior, such policies can be expected to ensure a high degree ofpredictability of the desired results. However, under an environment of financial market instability,when the system has been subjected to external shocks, these policies cannot be expected to yieldsimilar results. Given that shocks to the system are by their nature destabilising, policies that amplifythis instability should therefore be avoided.In the mid 1990s, in 1995 and 1996, Malaysia implemented prudential and administrative measuressupported by fiscal measures to address escalating asset prices. This avoided the formation of anasset bubble. When the crisis occurred in 1997, asset prices had already plateaued. These measuresincluded prudential requirements such as loan margins and credit ceilings. These requirements werethen removed when the objectives had been achieved. While it is argued that such measures mayinvolve costs in terms of the distortions and the uncertainty it might generate, it would be far less thanany over adjustment following a more significant tightening.In our quest for monetary and financial stability, consideration also needs to be made of the influenceof international factors. For small open emerging economies like Malaysia, with the encroachment ofinternational financial forces on their domestic financial systems, the authorities are confronted withfurther challenges in the quest for monetary and financial stability. Andrew Crockett’s discussion is forthe most part in the context of a closed economy. In an open economy, where there is the rapid flow ofspeculative capital across borders, national authorities have been confronted with exchange ratevolatility or alternatively, having the volatility transferred into bank liquidity and domestic interest rates,both of which have implications on financial stability. In emerging economies with a liberalised capitalaccount, there is the potential for destabilising implications on both monetary and financial stability.Exchange volatility would have implications on foreign exposures in the domestic economy with itsconsequent implications on the financial system, whereas, the build up of domestic liquidity leads tothe increased credit growth and the type of adverse effects on the financial system discussed byAndrew in his paper. In both cases, countries are confronted with the challenge of managing thevulnerability.The presentation also highlights several challenges that confront prudential regulators. In particular,Andrew highlights the need to recognise the role of common factors in generating financial distressand the need to find better ways of identifying and tackling emerging imbalances. Supervisors, heargues, should focus on developments that generate systemic rather than idiosyncratic difficulties. Theconcern should be with overall efficiency and resilience not on the performance of individualintermediaries. Systemic problems, he argues are not caused by individual institutions getting intoproblems and affecting others by contagion. For most cases of financial instability, it was a whole setof institutions that acted in more or less the same way. Financial systems encounter crisis when manyinstitutions operate in a similar way, and collectively fail to detect the common macroeconomic threat.The concern, therefore, ought to be focused on the overall efficiency and resilience and not on theperformance of individual intermediaries. He also raised the issue of the time properties of risk overthe financial cycle and the endogenous character of risk with respect to the collective decisions oflenders need to be recognised. In addressing these concerns, we can agree with the approachesdiscussed, in adopting forward looking provisioning practices, use of loan to value ratios or the use ofother less cyclically-sensitive measures of value. Stress testing as a tool can also address thisconcern.
BIS Review 13/20013Given the increased volatilities of the financial markets, the scope of surveillance by regulatoryagencies over financial activities and developments in financial markets will need to be enhancedsignificantly. Key information on market development would need to be provided in an integratedmanner so as to allow better understanding of the impact of such development on the financial sectoras well as the economy. In the Malaysian experience, quarterly stress tests are conducted on thebanking institutions under different scenarios to detect potential areas of vulnerabilities and to assessthe resilience of the banking system. This stress test provides the authorities with the ability toimplement preemptive measures before problems become crisis proportions. More importantly,Malaysia is developing a single comprehensive system of real time information on financial marketsthat allows tracking of sources of risks in the economy to allow corrective actions to be taken.Finally, Andrew Crockett argues supervisory techniques need to take a balanced view of the utility ofmarket forces as an aid to stabilising behavior. While it is recognised that greater transparency anddisclosure is an important part of this process, equally the appropriate utilisation of information by themarket is important. All too often, the market response is biased towards the short and immediate termperspective, due to the rigid adherence to an ideology, the conditioning by multilateral agencies, theinability to distinguish and differentiate, herd behavior and contagion as well as the inability to dealwith less familiar contexts. Moreover, there are no incentives to ensure the appropriate use ofinformation. There is also no penalty for misuse and abuse of information. As we move into an era inwhich there will be increasing demands for transparency, there needs to be a framework in whichthese concerns are addressed. In this environment, consumer education also needs to be givenpriority so that better informed assessments and decisions can be made.Mention has also been made to rely on market discipline to achieve financial stability. For marketdiscipline to play its appropriate role in containing excesses, a change programme would need to beimplemented with the objective of building the capabilities of domestic banking institutions andincreasing the incentives to improve performance. At the same time, measures that seek to build andenhance financial infrastructure would need to be implemented to better position the financial systemto meet the demands of the economy and absorb any destabilizing shocks. This however cannot beachieved overnight. Reasonable time and support has to be given to emerging markets to becomemore efficient, competitive and resilient. In this regard, market players can play a role in distinguishingthe different risk factors and characteristics of an economy.In this environment of greater uncertainty and change, it will become increasingly more difficult toanticipate future risks. While these future risks may be unpredictable, it is important to understand howthe future might change so we can gauge and assess the approach that we have taken, so that wecan develop new capabilities to deal with these risks. The ability to recognise the potential futuredevelopments and to be able to prescriptively respond and contain these risks would enhance ourprospects for achieving stability and, thereby, improve the capacity of the financial system tocontribute to growth, and thus secure the prospects for prosperity.
BIS Review 12/20011Roger W. Ferguson, Jr: E-commerce: lessons learned to dateRemarks by Mr Roger W. Ferguson, Jr., Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, at the OwenGraduate School of Management, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, on 14 February 2001*      *      *I am pleased to be here with you today at Vanderbilt University. Your e-Lab and e-commerceprograms make this a particularly appropriate place to talk about the lessons that can be drawn fromdevelopments in electronic commerce over the past several years. Governor Daane, thank you forinviting me to speak.The recent past has provided an excellent opportunity to observe how businesses and individualsrespond to significant technological changes. But we should also be mindful that Internet-basedcommerce, in particular, is still young and unquestionably evolving. Hence, I must emphasize thatthese are only preliminary observations.Today I will touch on three main topics. First, I will explore a few early observations about theeconomics of electronic commerce based on the experiences of the past few years. Second, I will talkabout payments, a key part of the country's economic infrastructure, and whether the current paymentinstruments can effectively support future electronic commerce. Finally, I will briefly review someactivities that the Federal Reserve is pursuing to remove barriers to innovations in electronic paymentsand commerce.A few early lessons of e-commerceThe terms "electronic commerce" and "e-commerce" generally refer to commercial activity involvingthe Internet, although they can also describe any commerce that relies primarily on electronicexchange of information. For many entrepreneurs, e--commerce is an entirely new market opportunity,while others see it as a versatile new channel offering opportunities to enhance existing markets.Whatever the business case for an application of new technology, generally successful applicationshave the potential to improve the lives of ultimate consumers by reducing transaction costs. Reducedtransaction costs, in turn, can broaden the array of choices, expand the size of markets, andultimately, through competition, improve the quality of existing goods and services.An initial observation is that, despite the novelty of the Internet applications we see today, electronicshave been used for commercial purposes for well over a century. In the nineteenth and twentiethcenturies, installation of telegraph wires and then telephone networks created a revolution in businesscommunications not unlike the current e-commerce revolution, broadening markets by easingcommunications between distant trading partners and reducing risks associated with slow physicalcommunication and transportation. In the extreme, telephone networks enabled two distant parties tocommunicate interactively and in real time. Of course, there are limits to the uses of voicecommunications. The advent of computers and new communications technology introduced theopportunity to transmit vast quantities of data, as well as voice, over existing telephone networks.The commercial prospects of combining new and existing communications technology with newinformation management technology, both software and hardware, spawned the investment boom thatunderpins, in part, the most recent revolution in e-commerce. But we must be careful to recognize thatthe rapid evolution of modern e-commerce does not repeal the laws of economics. In fact, we see nowthat economies with significant investments in information and communications technology remainsubject to occasional capital goods overhangs, which may influence macroeconomic conditions. Overthe last few months, data on orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods have provided hardevidence of a slowdown in business spending on high-tech capital goods. Our economy is clearlyundergoing a stock adjustment to bring the supply of and demand for capital goods in some sectorsinto better alignment. Importantly, measures of growth of output per hour in the second half of 2000were sufficiently strong to suggest that the growth rate of structural productivity remains robust. This inturn suggests that the rate of return on capital should be sufficiently attractive to foster new investmentonce this stock adjustment is complete.
2BIS Review 12/2001There are two key questions. First, when will the stock adjustment in high tech capital run its course,and the supply and demand for capital goods return to balance? Second, when balance is restored,what pace of investment in high tech capital goods will ensue? Unfortunately, neither question isanswerable with certainty at this stage. With respect to the duration of the stock adjustment, those whothink that the process will be protracted point to both the length of the current investment boom andthe historical experience with lengthy stock adjustments in capital goods to suggest that the period ofretrenchment will be a long one. Those who are optimistic that this phase of rebalancing will berelatively short highlight two facts. The adjustment in capital goods ordering and production has beenrelatively rapid in this cycle and modern high tech capital goods are relatively short-lived--beingdepreciated in many cases in three years or less as opposed to the seven years or more thatcharacterizes many types of traditional capital equipment. Which of these sets of factors predominateswill determine, in part, the shape of the recovery from this period of slowing.Similarly, we cannot know with certainty the pace of investment in capital goods going forward. As Iwill discuss below, it is certain that the pace of future demand for capital goods will depend in part onthe ability of providers of capital--banks, creditors in fixed income markets, and purchasers of equity--to recognize the risks inherent in high tech capital investment plans and to price the risk appropriately.Let me now offer a few observations on cost, demand, and the microeconomics of e-commerce. Thecost structure of electronic networks tends to be characterized by high fixed costs and very lowmarginal operating costs. This also appears to be true of the cost structure of a number of firmsengaged in e-commerce. Initially, purchasing or developing software to support a competitivecommercial enterprise on the Internet can be costly. But once software that meets a market demand isbuilt, it can be paired with scalable hardware to handle significant additional volume for very little extracost.It appears, however, that the basic cost structure of e-commerce has different applicability for differenttypes of businesses in this sector. For example, the high fixed cost, low marginal cost model may fairlyaccurately characterize the cost structure of companies that provide on-line information services, suchas information vendors, search engines, and electronic communications networks. Those that producetheir own information content clearly pay some production costs, but those costs appear to be smallcompared with the cost of building and operating a network. Interestingly, many information providersdo not originate any content at all and rely instead on markets, commercial partners, or evensubscribers to provide the content. For different reasons, information-based e-commerce companiesseek high sales volumes. They all wish to take advantage of the economies of scale that are inherentin their cost structure, seeking large scale to reduce their average production costs as volumes grow.As with other businesses that have this cost profile, e-commerce businesses in this category oftenrespond to their cost structure by charging a flat fee per user, such as a subscription fee, with the pricestructure often transitioning to some form of discounted fee for heavy volume accounts. Obviously forthose information-based e-commerce businesses for which advertising is the major source of revenue,scale is important to keep advertisers happy. Overall, even with rapidly declining marginal costs, ifpricing does not cover the marginal costs and revenues in the long run do not recoup fixed costs, thismodel of e-commerce can prove financially disappointing.On the other hand, the cost structure for those e-commerce firms that use electronic means todistribute tangible goods, such as books, apparel, and toys, appears to mirror more conventionalbusiness models. The network costs for these firms reflect the well-understood high fixed cost and lowmarginal cost model of the electronic world. However, the economics of fulfillment--that is, providingand servicing the goods--still depend on these businesses' ability to achieve efficiencies and low unitcosts for materials, storage, distribution, and after-sales service.The story of the demise of one prominent Internet-only retailer may be instructive in this regard. Newsreports indicate that the company had to build and maintain a web site costing about $40 millionannually, the high fixed cost element of e-commerce, which it thought was required to achieve thedesired revenue in the national market it hoped to serve. Besides this new economy cost, this retailerdecided to build a proprietary distribution network, an old economy cost that, according to publicsources, raised its investment in property and equipment to more than $100 million, a fourfold increasein one year. Analysts indicate that this equaled around 100 percent of the firm's 1999 revenues. As abenchmark, for land-based retailers a comparable number would be 20 percent of annual revenue andfor catalogue retailers, who often subcontract distribution, the comparable number would be12 percent to 13 percent.
BIS Review 12/20013Finally, because of low barriers to entry to the Internet market and the low cost to customers ofswitching from one seller to another, Internet-only firms appear to face high costs to obtain and retaincustomers. Again, published reports indicate that the retailer increased its budget by 30 percent in oneyear as new competitors moved into its market.Clearly, appropriately scaling the cost model to the market potential is another key lesson in the worldof e-commerce.On the demand side, the so-called network effect is extremely important for some e-commercebusinesses because the value of some services increases as the number of customers using themincreases. The most obvious example is an on-line auction site, in which the more buyers and sellersusing an auction site, the deeper the liquidity--that is, the greater the number of opportunities to tradeand the greater the likelihood that trades will occur. For these firms, which include those that supportthe "auction" of equities as well as collectibles, high volume is critical to their success, and volumeexpectations appear to influence investments in these firms. I have already referred to economies ofscale. Auctions and chat rooms provide an example of how network effects and scale economies canbe mutually reinforcing, making high transaction volumes critical to both the supply and the demandsides of the market. Here let me also note that, for those for whom advertising is a key source ofrevenue, there is a virtuous cycle as a large customer base attracts more advertisers, which in turnfinances more and better content and attracts even more users. The need for scale or volume appearsto create an advantage for the first business to achieve critical mass in any market in which there arestrong network effects. Understanding this dynamic and taking advantage of it appears to be anotherlesson from the early experience with e-commerce.The evolution of investment in e-commerce firms, particularly web-only firms, continues to receiveattention in the press. Needless to say, rational economic behavior suggests that investors wouldrequire a high return to invest in unproven but potentially profitable endeavors. After all, someinnovations struggle but succeed, while others arrive too soon for the technology, arrive too soon forthe market, or are not commercially successful for a wide variety of other reasons. The rapidreassessment of the business prospects of some e-commerce firms during the course of last year is areflection of this reality.Of course, the equity securities of these firms were revalued to reflect these changing assessments.Are stocks today overvalued, correctly valued, or undervalued? I certainly do not know, and I am notaware of anyone who does. As a result, I believe that it would be unwise--and indeed impossible--forthe Federal Reserve to target specific levels of valuations in equity markets. However, valuationmethods that are appropriately sensitive to the obvious business risks of e-commerce, as opposed tobeing driven by the assumption of the most optimistic outcomes for every concept, are key. In the longrun such approaches should provide a healthy base for maintaining a reasonable and sustainablepattern of growth and investment in the e-commerce segment. Costs of capital that reflect risksaccurately are critical to a well-functioning economy.Therefore, with respect to observations and lessons, it appears that the basic rules of economics,commerce, and finance continue to apply. Though some macroeconomic conditions have changedimportantly because of the technology investments that underpin e-commerce, the laws of economicshave not been repealed. At the commercial level, any company considering a substantial investmentneeds to understand the business case and underlying market cost, competition, and demandstructures. Companies and their investors still need to assess the potential risks and returns based onthat commercial reality.Payments and e-commerceNow I would like to turn to the topic of payment systems and discuss whether the existingarrangements support electronic commerce. In many ways the rapid growth of some elements ofe-commerce is built on the solid base of preexisting payment systems and protocols.Even with the apparent ups and downs of specific electronic commerce providers, many purchasesare being initiated through the Internet. The Census Bureau estimates that roughly $20 billion worth ofretail transactions flowed over the Internet during the year ending September 2000, excluding large-dollar business-to-business transactions at least partly initiated through the Internet. Some privatecalculations reach twice that amount. These purchases are being paid for predominantly withtraditional payment instruments that predate the World Wide Web. Given the growing importance and
4BIS Review 12/2001apparent potential of e-commerce, it is important that the older protocols of the payment systemevolve to support this new element of our economy.To explore recent payment developments, it may help to distinguish among the markets for differenttypes of payment transactions. Although the consumer-to-business (C2B), person-to-person, andbusiness-to-business (B2B) categories likely break down when pushed too far, they can provide aconvenient organizing framework for identifying payment transactions with some commoncharacteristics.For some types of commerce, existing electronic payment instruments were easily adapted to theInternet. Most notably, small- to medium-sized C2B purchases are frequently made using credit cards.Because credit cards were already widely used for retail telephone transactions, these "card-not-present" transactions were easily accepted as part of commerce on the World Wide Web. Moreover,unlike many other payment instruments, credit cards could already support low-value internationalcommerce, one of the historical barriers being challenged by the Internet. One card network estimatesthat 95 percent of retail purchases over the Internet in 1999 were made using debit, credit, and otherpayment cards.Some entrepreneurs are adapting other payment instruments for C2B electronic commerce. Forexample, debit card networks are exploring ways to enhance security and inter-network arrangementsso that PIN-based debit transactions will be widely accepted as an alternative to credit cards forInternet-based sales. Similarly, vendors have developed pre-paid cards for which value can bepurchased in advance and used to pay for on-line purchases by individuals who do not have access tocredit cards or who prefer not to use them. In addition, some service providers have begun to offer"electronic check" or "e-check" products in which customers enter the information shown on thebottom line of a check and authorize the electronic debit of their checking accounts through amechanism called the automated clearinghouse, or ACH.But existing and evolving payment instruments do not yet satisfy all of the needs of C2B e-commercetransactions. For instance, many firms provide bill payment services, and many are exploring ways topresent bills electronically as well. Despite the growth of electronic bill payment applications, many ofthe bills for which payment instructions are initiated on-line are still paid by check. Similarly, there isnot yet an easy way to pay for transactions such as on-line stock purchases, which have becomepopular. Instead, these purchases are generally charged against pre-funded brokerage accounts,although they could also be paid for by wire transfers through the purchaser's bank or by the promptmailing of checks. Devising new ways to pay for securities trades is becoming increasingly importantas the securities industry tries to reduce the time needed to settle trades from trade-date plus-threedays to trade-date plus one day.For person-to-person commerce over the Internet, typically conducted through auction and similar websites, there are very few electronic payment alternatives that can be easily transferred from physicalcommerce. Over the past few years, however, several service providers have created Internet-basedperson-to-person transfer mechanisms based on the credit card clearing mechanism but requiringtransfer of funds through an intermediary. Other service providers enable individuals to accept creditcard payments, a function previously available only to businesses.Finally, a number of service providers are also trying to address the market for electronic B2Btransactions. Thus far, some companies have adopted corporate purchasing cards, issued bytraditional card-issuing companies, for their low- and medium-value on-line purchases. The demandfor improved payment instruments for B2B transactions, however, may be even greater than for theC2B and person-to-person markets. Improving speed, reducing risk, and ensuring appropriate levelsof privacy are important in all three markets. Also, to attract users, B2B payment mechanisms mayneed to provide additional features--for example, tools that reduce credit and timing risks in domesticand international markets. Other desirable features might enable data to flow seamlessly through theinternal systems of the purchaser, the seller, and perhaps intermediaries--all at a low cost, of course.Because the products or services, scale, and complexity of business-to-business transactions varywidely, satisfying the needs of this diverse market may be more difficult than satisfying those of theother markets. I have heard reports, however, that many banks and other organizations areaggressively seeking ways to provide services for this market.
BIS Review 12/20015The Federal Reserve in the payment systemNow, turning to the role of the Federal Reserve, recall that one reason that the Congress establishedthe Federal Reserve was to improve the nation's payment system; the Federal Reserve Act of 1913provides the foundation for the Federal Reserve to establish a national check-clearing system. Today,the Reserve Banks distribute cash, clear checks, and provide electronic payment services to banks. Inaddition, the Federal Reserve System has had a long-standing role in helping to formulate publicpolicies that improve the overall efficiency of the nation's payment system and reduce risks.Recently, evolving technology and growth in alternatives to cash and check payments have raisedquestions about the Federal Reserve's role in the payment system. In 1996 and 1997, a committeeheaded by Alice Rivlin, then the Federal Reserve Vice Chair, studied the Federal Reserve'soperational role in the payment system. Ultimately, the study concluded that the Federal Reserveshould continue to provide all its existing payment services with the explicit goal of enhancingefficiency, effectiveness, and convenience, while ensuring access for all banks. The study alsorecommended that the Federal Reserve work actively, closely, and collaboratively with providers andusers of the payment system, both to enhance the efficiency of check and ACH services and to helpdevelop strategies for moving to the next generation of payment instruments.To follow up on the recommendations of that study, the Federal Reserve created the PaymentsSystem Development Committee, which I co-chair with Cathy Minehan, President of the FederalReserve Bank of Boston. The Payments System Development Committee has an explicit mission. Inaddition to identifying strategies for enhancing the long-term efficiency of the retail payment systems, italso identifies barriers to innovation and works to address those barriers where possible. Thecommittee is active in monitoring developments in payment markets and has sponsored workshopsand forums that encourage focused discussions with the private sector. Our current activities includeefforts to reduce legal and regulatory barriers to payment innovation, examine future clearing andsettlement systems to support electronic commerce, assess our role in helping to set standards, andfind ways to use new technologies to collect checks more efficiently.ConclusionThe technological developments that enable us to engage in electronic commerce today have createdtremendous opportunities to improve the ways in which we do business. Even as some businessesfail, they are contributing to our store of knowledge about what will and will not work in e-commerce.But beyond just the success or failure of specific businesses, electronic commerce has challenged thethinking of entrepreneurs and of those who lead traditional businesses. The developments in e-commerce have reminded us that change, even rapid change, is part of the normal evolution that weexpect from market economies. They have also shown, however, that no matter what deliverymechanism is used, successful businesses must still follow good business practices, pay attention tobasic economic principles, and sell products and services that buyers want.I believe this to be true for business generally and certainly for payments. A market-oriented approachto payment system innovation promises to provide long-lasting benefits to the consumers andbusinesses that use the U.S. payment system. We need to approach payment system innovations withan open mind and a willingness to learn. This is particularly true in the world of electronic commerce,where payments are being adapted to new technologies, products, and methods of doing business.These innovations are important in themselves. But they are also important because successfulinnovations to support electronic commerce may, over the long term, have a broad influence on thepayment systems we use throughout our economy.I commend Vanderbilt University and its Owen Graduate School of Management for moving soforcefully to train the next generation of leaders in the e-commerce world. Not only are you servingyour students; you are serving the global economy.Thank you for your attention.
BIS Review 24/20011Lars Heikensten: Behind the granite walls up at Brunkebergstorg - monetarypolicy in practiceSpeech by Mr Lars Heikensten, First Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, to the Riksdag'sSocial Democrats, Stockholm, 21 March 2001.*      *      *The theme for today’s seminar is monetary policy in practice. I find it extra stimulating because it is asubject I don’t often get a chance of talking about. While thinking about how to arrange what I want tosay, I felt that, besides talking concretely about how we at the Riksbank go about assessing inflation, itwould be a good idea to spend some time on some matters of principle. In that way I hope to lay agood foundation for the ensuing discussion.First I shall say a little about monetary policy’s purpose and our target. Then I shall describe how wemake our assessment and how the Executive Board works. Before winding up, I shall also considersome issues connected with communication and transparency.‘Hate inflation’As we all know, monetary policy’s purpose is to safeguard low inflation. That has been the case in anyevent since the beginning of the 1990s. It became explicit, of course, when the Riksbank adopted aninflation target in February 1993. Since 1999, moreover, the Riksbank Act states that the objective ofthe Riksbank’s operations shall be to "maintain price stability".So why is this our objective? Basically, there is now a broad consensus that low inflation is good foreconomic development and accordingly contributes to gains in prosperity. While it is true that in certainsituations the economy can be stimulated by means of low interest rates, this works only if there areunutilised resources. Taken too far, it is liable to result in bottlenecks that push prices and wages up.There is then a risk of households and firms gradually starting to act in the belief that inflation willcontinue to be high — inflation expectations become firmly fixed on this.In other words, in the long run monetary policy is not capable of influencing growth. What doesunderlie a country’s economic development and thereby its prosperity are such factors as the labourforce, a willingness to invest and technical progress. The best the Riksbank can do is promote aneconomic development that is more stable, with smaller fluctuations around the long-term trend. Ittherefore seems to me that the economic debate is somewhat lopsided. The long-term issues youwork on in the Riksdag (Sweden’s parliament) ought to attract more attention. The Riksbank’s doingsget more than their fair share.Convincing people in Sweden about the value of low inflation really should not be difficult. After all,what did we get out of letting inflation take off in the 1970s and ’80s? Recurrent devaluation cyclesand a level of prosperity today that is considerably below that in many other countries. The economicimbalances became so large that when the bubble finally burst as we moved into the 1990s, theconsequences were considerable.I should perhaps stress that I am not just talking about the economy in some abstract academic sense.These developments were very tangible to the man in the street. Take the example of someone whoplaced, say, 10,000 kronor in bonds in 1970 and looked forward to reaping interest at the current rateof 8 per cent; by 1990, after twenty years, the real value had actually shrunk more than 750 kronor,leaving only 9,250 kronor. For someone who bought a property in Stockholm at the same time, thingsturned very differently; by 1990 the real value had grown to almost 17,800 kronor. The same amountinvested in the Stockholm stock exchange had doubled in real terms to over 20,000 kronor.Such differences were not solely due to inflation, of course, but it did play a large part. Arbitraryredistribution in this fashion causes problems for those who are hit by them as well as for the socialclimate. It was not by chance that Gösta Rhen, perhaps the Trade Union Confederation’s foremosteconomist, in the 1960s coined the slogan: Hate Inflation.
2BIS Review 24/2001A distinct target: 2 per centSome months after the krona’s fall in 1992 the Riksbank introduced an inflation target of 2 per cent. Atolerance interval of 1 percentage point on either side of the target was included mainly to make itclear that deviations would probably occur but also that they should be limited. The target was tied tothe consumer price index, the measure of inflation that was most familiar and reliable, besides beingpublished regularly.There is a great deal to say about this — the choice of the target’s level and the choice of index — inthe light of our experience and the academic literature that accumulated in the 1990s. I shall have tobe brief, however, because otherwise there will be no time for the more practical issues about ourprocedures, which is today’s theme.So here are three short comments:• The appropriate level of inflation is one debatable point. There are arguments for asomewhat higher level as well as a somewhat lower. With our present knowledge, this isultimately a matter of judgement and so far there has been nothing to persuade me thatthere are any grounds at present for changing our target. As I see it, the most important thingis to set up a distinct target so that a given rate of inflation is anchored among all economicagents, be they households or firms, employers or employees. In this we have been verysuccessful.• The choice of an index is a complicated matter. Unfortunately there is no measure of inflationthat in every situation can show whether monetary policy is properly balanced or whichmeasures are called for. I have already mentioned the CPI’s advantages. The maindrawback is that from time to time this index is markedly affected by price movements thatthe Riksbank neither can nor wants to counter. Not wanting to counter them mainly has to dowith the time lag before monetary measures bite; another reason is that we would bechasing our own tail if, for example, we were to raise the interest rate to counter an increasein interest expenditure that stems from our own earlier interest rate hikes. We have thereforeclarified how policy is formed in relation to price movements that are transitory. In practice,monetary policy in recent years has been based on forecasts of inflation excluding indirecttaxes, subsidies and interest expenditure, that is, on the index known as UND1X.• The third issue is the exchange rate’s role in monetary policy. There is less talk about thistoday but in the early years with the inflation target the public debate was all the more lively.The discussion subsided when the Riksbank, early in 1996, made it clear that policy isguided by the long-term outlook for inflation and continued to lower the repo rate eventhough the krona had weakened. For monetary policy the central consideration is thus theexchange rate’s impact on inflation. Perhaps I should add that we do have a rough idea ofthe level of the exchange rate that seems reasonable in the longer run. We have notintervened since the occasion during the financial turbulence in 1998 when the kronaweakened in a way that both then and in retrospect seemed unreasonable.Assessments of the coming 1–2 years are crucialIt takes time for monetary measures to affect inflation. Some effects of an interest rate adjustment mayindeed occur very quickly. The stock market, for instance, is influenced as soon as an adjustment isannounced and this can have immediate consequences for household consumption, for example, andthereby a quick impact on certain prices. Monetary policy can also elicit exchange rate movementsand quickly affect prices for exports and imports. Normally, however, there is a time lag betweenmonetary measures and their effects. For example, an interest rate hike leaves households with lessmoney for other expenditure and also reduces the return on investments. By gradually influencingconsumption and investment, this leads in time to changes in total demand. With weaker demand,firms then have more difficulty in raising prices and that leads to lower inflation.Interest rate adjustments accordingly affect inflation through a variety of channels that economistsrefer to as the transmission mechanism. We know more about some channels than we do aboutothers. It is not clear just how long it takes for the effects to materialise. Calculations by the Riksbankand other central banks suggest that a reasonable time perspective when formulating monetary policyis the coming twelve to twenty-four months. Our simple rule of action is accordingly that if inflation oneto two years ahead looks like being above the target, then normally the repo rate should be raised and
BIS Review 24/20013vice versa. But we also attach some importance to our policy’s effects before as well as after this timehorizon.In view of the uncertainty in this respect, some differences of opinion — in our Executive Board as wellas in the public debate — as to what policy’s time perspective should be are only natural. If it is fearedthat inflation will, for instance, shoot up beyond the target horizon, then there may be grounds foracting particularly early. In my opinion, however, the clear target horizon has stood us in good stead inrecent years. It has made policy easier to understand and foresee. It has also been beneficialinternally by forcing us to be specific and have good arguments for departing from the rule of action.There have, moreover, been a number of occasions when our ideas about prospects in the longer runwere faulted by new developments. One example is when rising activity and inflation in 1997–98 werebroken by the Asian crisis and the associated fall in international prices. Today, when rising domesticresource utilisation is beginning to slacken in response to developments in the United States andfalling stock markets, the element of uncertainty in our work is highlighted again. All this cautionsagainst attaching undue importance to assessments of the longer run.Another matter that has been discussed a great deal in recent years is how monetary policy ought tohandle price movements in assets such as real estate and shares. This is not much of a problem inthe normal course of events. Rising house prices, for example, are usually connected with a generaleconomic upswing that may generate increased inflationary pressure and thereby prompt an upwardrevision of forecast inflation and perhaps a repo rate increase. But what if that does not happen insideour normal time horizon? I personally believe there may still be grounds for adjusting the repo rate ifone either foresees a future ‘bubble’ that may show up in inflation in the longer run or is concernedabout the consequences for the economy and the financial system when the ‘bubble’ finally bursts. Inthe light of our experiences when the ‘financial bubble’ burst in the early 1990s, I believe that supportfor such a line of action could be justified, which of course would require clear motives and arguments.Not an exact scienceOur preparations for monetary policy decisions consist to a large extent in constructing forecasts. Andas Alf Henriksson, if my memory does not fail me, said on some occasion, making forecasts is difficult,particularly about the future. It calls at least for knowledge of what has happened and is nowhappening in the economy, as well as of various economic relationships that can be used to interpretthe available information.One approach involves assessing the factors that affect prices and trying to identify simplerelationships between them and inflation. Such calculations are a part of the material that is presentedto the Executive Board as a basis for decisions. If they add up to a uniform picture, the calculationspresumably say something about the direction in which inflation is moving.Our main assessment, however, uses methods that are more complex. Like other economicobservers, we endeavour to construct a picture of economic developments in the coming years that iscoherent and consistent. We do this with the aid of what economists call a model: a computer spread-sheet for processing economic data. This largely guides the presentation of our assessments in theInflation Report (Chart 1.The Inflation Puzzle). Starting from appraisals of global economicThe inflation puzzle(cid:1)Developmentof GDP(cid:1)Interest ratesand exchangerates(cid:1)Oil pricesetc(cid:1)Developmentof GDP(cid:1)Productivity(cid:1)Utilisation ofresources(cid:1)Wagesetc(cid:1)Taxes andsubsidies(cid:1)InflationexpectationsThekronaInflationInternationaldevelopmentsSwedisheconomyOther
4BIS Review 24/2001developments, various international prices, for oil for example, the exchange rate, interest rates andwhat is happening in the domestic economy, we estimate a picture of economic activity and resourceutilisation in Sweden. Normally it is resource utilisation that is crucial for inflation. To this we add anassessment of inflation expectations as well as estimates of factors with effects that may be more orless transitory, such as changes in interest rates and taxes. The combined result is a forecast ofinflation.The large model is made up of a number of relationships, The equations for calculating exports areone example. Swedish exports are estimated as a function of, for example, global economicdevelopments and the path of the krona’s exchange rate or some other measure of relative prices. Butas some important relationships are not particularly stable, we have to make judgements on the basisof other experiences. Sometimes, moreover, there are grounds for supplementing a model-basedcalculation with more specific information. There may be indications that investment activity, forexample, will be higher than historical relationships indicate.The information we use comes from many different sources. The bulk of it consists of official statisticsfrom Statistics Sweden, the National Institute of Economic Research and so on or their counterparts inother countries. We also take a close look at the assessments of other forecasters in Sweden as wellas elsewhere. In addition, we try to collected as much information as possible on our trips in Swedenand abroad. I set great store by a continuous dialogue with a number of colleagues about what ishappening in their parts of the world and their thoughts about monetary policy.Monetary policy is obviously not a matter of applying an exact science. As our Governor and I haveboth talked about earlier in this building, domestic inflationary pressure has been unexpectedly low inrecent years, for example. The historical relationships suggested that domestic inflation would behigher. Part of the explanation seems to lie in deregulations and increased international competitionmaking prices increases in the traditional manner more difficult. There are also signs that the low andstable inflation expectations I mentioned earlier have aided us. We now believe, moreover, thatresource utilisation has not been quite as high as our earlier calculations suggested. All in all, theeconomy seems to have been functioning more efficiently than we and most other observers expectedearlier.Examples of other forecasting problems are not hard to find. A highly topical issue is, for instance, howdevelopments in stock-markets, which are now of major importance for households, are likely to affectprivate consumption. Then, of course, forecasts can be wrong simply because something unexpectedhappens. The Gulf war and the Asian crisis are two examples but even smaller shocks can upsetearlier predictions.The uncertainty that is inherent in decision-making is handled by not concentrating exclusively on oneforecast for the economy and inflation. We also look at a spectrum of risks in the form of alternativescenarios. Last December, for instance, it was conceivable that economic activity would be weaker onaccount of a slowdown in the United States, with repercussions on the Swedish economy and inflation.At the same time, factors that might lead to higher inflation were the wage negotiations going wrong,the oil price rising and the exchange rate remaining weak. Since then the picture has shifted; weakeractivity and a lower oil price have reduced the risks of inflation, though there are still certain upsiderisks from domestic inflation, future wage agreements and the weak exchange rate. We try to gaugethe probability of each scenario and multiply this probability by the effects on inflation. In this way wearrive at a distribution of the probabilities in our assessment of inflation. The result serves as afoundation for monetary policy.A broad, comprehensive internal discussionMonetary policy is discussed by the Executive Board eight to ten times a year. On four of theseoccasions the Board also adopts an Inflation Report. The meetings are scheduled about six months inadvance both for the sake of our internal work and to inform those who follow this, for instance in thefinancial markets. Additional meetings can, of course, be arranged if necessary and we have said thatthey will be announced as soon as we have fixed a date. But we have now used this procedure formore than two years and that has not yet happened.The publication of the Riksbank’s quarterly Inflation Report is preceded by at least three discussions inthe Executive Board: one or two to consider which general questions to include in the Report and ourpicture of future inflation, a meeting to finalise the text and a final meeting about a week later to set the
BIS Review 24/20015repo rate. At the intervening Board meetings we simply compare new information with the picture inthe most recent Inflation Report and decide the repo rate.Material for each Board meeting is prepared by the Monetary Policy Department, where some fortyeconomists are involved in various ways. Starting from this material, the Board members endeavour toarrive at a joint view of economic developments and inflation. By and large, we follow the structure ofChapter 2 in the Report and start with international prospects. Our opinions naturally differ on somethings, large as well as small, as can be seen, for example, from the published minutes of themeetings. But an effort has always been made to arrive at a joint view and in this we have generallysucceeded.I want to underscore that this is a balancing act. It is important that different perspectives arecompared and as many difficult questions as possible are discussed. But it is also desirable that weultimately arrive at something of a consensus. In the longer run it would hardly be good for theRiksbank to publish six different inflation reports, which in a way would be the logical outcome ofcarrying the Board members’ individual responsibility to an extreme. This raises the issue of what theInflation Report stands for. The Board’s decision that it represents a majority view enables us tocompile a clear and consistent presentation. The Bank of England has a different procedure that aimsto present different views in a single report.The material produced in the Monetary Policy Department is distributed simultaneously to all theBoard members to make their conditions as similar as possible. As the member responsible formonetary policy preparations, I am in a position to influence discussions and decisions, apart fromthose at Board meetings, mainly as chairman of the internal monetary policy group that is made up ofleading members of the Bank’s competent departments. Matters on the monetary policy agenda arediscussed by this group on a continuous basis. In the light of that discussion, at Board meetings I alsopresent proposals about the direction of policy. However, all the members of the group attend Boardmeetings and are able to present their own views.The arrangements we have chosen for internal discussions and preparations build on experiences atother central banks. A proposal for the approach we have used since autumn 1999 was drafted bysome of us after talks with colleagues at the Bank of England, the Bundesbank and the FederalReserve. There are some important differences, however. The officials who prepare the Board’smaterial are in a stronger position compared with other central banks. We ask them to produce acomprehensive assessment of inflation independently, whereas in the Bank of England, for instance,the counterpart to our Executive Board is involved in this work. And at neither the Bank of England northe ECB are staff present at policy meetings. In other central banks, moreover, before the preparatorymaterial is presented to the counterpart to our Executive Board, it has to be approved by thecompetent board member. So in all these respects our internal process is very open. We opted for thisin order to make discussions as fruitful and lively as possible, as well as to motivate and engage ourstaff.That does not alter the fact that the final decision is up to the Executive Board. In the past two years orso we have not refrained for altering either the main scenarios or the risk spectrums that the staff hasProcesses in compiling theInflation ReportDiscussion ofthe inflationsituation.rDiscussion ofsynopsis.Assessmentof inflationfrom staff.Decisionmade oninterest rate.Decisionmade oninflationsituation andtext.Executive BoardDrafting committeeDiscussion ofinflationsituation.Discussion ofinterest ratedecision.
6BIS Review 24/2001produced. Neither have we always shared the policy group’s majority view of the appropriate interestrate. But the Board has had well thought-out and consistent assessments on which to base itsdecisions.Communication and transparencyThe issue of central banks’ communication and transparency is sometimes discussed as though itwere unconnected with the actual formation of policy — as though it were just a matter of selling agiven message. I see this differently. The extent to which a central bank is understood and thecredibility of its policy do, of course, depend on its track record in goal fulfilment and how long it hasbeen operating. But the clarity of its policy framework also plays a part, as do the procedures forarriving at decisions.That the Riksbank managed to establish reasonable respect for its task and confidence in its policy soquickly was no doubt largely a consequence of the Swedish economy’s good performance in recentyears. But it presumably helped that the Riksbank has endeavoured to open up discussions, presentthe grounds for its policy and do so in accordance with clear principles.In my opinion, the most important link in our communication is monetary policy’s analytical framework.This includes the distinct 2 per cent target and the specification of the deviations from this that may beacceptable in connection with transitory effects. It also includes the rule of action and the fact that to alarge extent we have adhered to it. Finally, it has to do with the forecasts and assessments on whichthe policy is based being published and used to argue for the policy.The changeover to the new Executive Board with six members gave transparency a new dimension.Previously, external communication had been in the hands of the governor and the deputy governorresponsible for preparing monetary policy. It involved mutual consultations and aimed to voice a singleopinion. With the new Board, each of the six members is individually accountable for the monetarypolicy decisions. So ought not each one be allowed to make their voice heard? How could theirindividual contributions be properly assessed without knowing their positions on monetary policyissues? But how were all the speeches and other statements to be coordinated efficiently in practice toensure that they conveyed a single, clear picture?With the procedure we have chosen, you know that each of us normally speaks independently of theothers. The minutes of the monetary policy meetings are published after a time and record ourdiscussions in outline, besides containing information about how each of us voted. We havedeliberately refrained from labelling what we say at the meetings with our names. We believe thatwould not work very well; the discussion would presumably be more premeditated than one wouldwish. But even with the system we have chosen, there is presumably a risk of jeopardising thespontaneous exchange and testing of ideas.Our joint communication about monetary policy issues takes the form of the Inflation Report and thepress notices and communiqués that are issued after the meetings. We also have an arrangementwhereby one of us is entitled to speak for a majority of the Executive Board. An announcement to thateffect is made and to date it has happened only when the Governor meets the Riksdag’s StandingCommittee on Finance. At the press conferences on monetary policy, moreover, the Governor andmyself, as the member responsible for the preparation of material, speak on behalf of the Board.Our procedure clearly entails risks. The media may focus most of the time on differences between ourviews, which could harm the Riksbank’s image and possibly also create internal problems. While thathas generally not been the case, our system is vulnerable. It would not be difficult for a Board memberto act in such a way that ‘conflicts at the Riksbank’ hit the headlines. We have tried to avoid this, forinstance by not arguing with each other in public. We have also refrained from evaluating colleagues’arguments and proposals.Before choosing an approach to communication and transparency, we again tried to learn from othercentral banks. The main issue in the public debate seems to have been the minutes of our meetings. Ibelieve the publication of minutes has advantages. The minutes provide a clear opening for theevaluation of what individual Board members contribute to the monetary policy discussion, besidesfacilitating the democratic control of and insight into our work. In my opinion, the arrangements wehave chosen can promote a better understanding in society in general of the Riksbank’s policy and ourdeliberations. That is important not least in a small country where the discussion of stabilisation policyis not all that broad.
BIS Review 24/20017Some conclusionsWork on monetary policy has been arranged in ways that differ from country to country. This has to dowith historical differences that stem from the society in which the policy is constructed. Scandinavianand Anglo-Saxon countries require a greater degree of openness, for example, than countries inCentral Europe. The duration and acceptance of low-inflation policies also play a part. A reluctance tochange a winning concept was no doubt an important reason why the Bundesbank continued toadhere to money supply targets in its communication for so long even though academic studiesshowed that in practice its policy was being guided by inflation forecasts.The internal construction of monetary policy is also related to the central bank’s legal framework. Witha clear mandate from an elected assembly, there is a sense in which the task becomes moretechnical. That is the British model. It can make it possible to work in a different way and choose otherforms for decision-making.Yet I still feel one should not be too agnostic. Our experiences seem to speak in favour of a number ofthings that ought to be of fairly universal importance.• A clear intellectual framework is an advantage because it makes policy easier to explain,understand and evaluate. That in turn reduces the risks of being misunderstood by mediaand the general public and of disturbing the markets unnecessarily. The clearer the policy,the better it can function as a short-cut to credibility.• Our clear intellectual framework does, of course, tie us down to some extent but it has alsoobliged us to make a deeper analysis. The fact that this ‘straightjacket’ has worked to datedoes not, however, mean that we follow our rule unconditionally. But a departure from simplerules does exact a price in terms of less clarity.• The internal decision-making processes are important because, for instance, they canensure a good foundation for the decisions and contribute to a better internal discussion.Typical features of the Riksbank in an international perspective are the short distancebetween staff and decision-makers and a continuous and extensive two-way communicationbetween the two. We also have an extensive interchange with the academic world.• Transparency has presumably helped to gain acceptance for the low inflation policy morequickly in many circles than would have been feasible otherwise. It has also paved the wayfor a broader internal discussion as well as a dialogue between the Riksbank and externalobservers in markets, academy and elsewhere. This in turn has made us sharpen theanalysis and contributed to a monetary policy discussion in society in general that is morerealistic.
BIS Review 24/20011LS Ipangelwa: Does the banking industry play a developmental role inNamibia?Address by Mr LS Ipangelwa, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Namibia, to the Namibian EconomicSociety, held in Windhoek, 13 March 2001.*      *      *Mr Chairman, Members of the Panel, Ladies and Gentlemen,I’m delighted to take part in this well-directed and well-timed discussion. As a central banker I am gladto see so much attention being paid to this important topic - “Does the Banking Industry Play aDevelopmental Role?”I compliment the Namibian Economic Society in choosing this coveted theme as a topic for discussion.Central bankers are often tipped as conservative in their approach. Let me see how I would be able tobreach this barricade by indulging in fresh thinking on the subject.Role of finance in economic developmentBefore we initiate a well articulated and meaningful discussion on the subject, it would, in my view bebefitting to clearly understand the theoretical underpinnings underlying the role of finance in theprocess of growth. Views of economists on this important issue viz. the inter-relationship betweenfinance and growth, however, diverge.  While some economists feel that finance drives the wheels ofeconomic growth, others opine that the process of economic growth itself induces financialdevelopment.The available evidence seems to strongly suggest a bi-directional relationship between finance anddevelopment. In other words, growth drives the evolution of the financial super structure and thefinancial super structure, by meeting the financing requirements of the economy, facilitate the processof growth. In the latter case, it is well appreciated that if the financing requirements of the economy arenot adequately met and in time, it would affect the growth process adversely.  Against this backdrop, abrief digression on my part, in elaborating on the role of finance in economic development may not beout of place.As you know, the financial institutions, of which the banking system is an integral part, play the majorrole of financial inter-mediation.  In this regard, their traditional role consists of mobilizing resourcesfrom the sectors generating surpluses and channeling them to the sectors that need them. Thus, bymeeting the investment requirements of the economy, they facilitate the process of capital formation.When domestic savings fall short of the investment requirements of the economy, the gap is closedthrough net capital inflow i.e.; the gap is met by way of borrowing from abroad. Banks play animportant role in this sphere too by facilitating international trade and service payments.In recent years, however, the conventional view that financial intermediaries should confine theirtraditional role of mobilizing resources and attracting capital inflows seems to have lost much of itsground. A global perspective on the role of banks reveals a more pro-active and positivist approach tothe bank’s role in facilitating the achievement of broader goals of economic development and makingthem a matter of reality.  In the words of King and Levine, “financial intermediaries determine whicheconomic organizations will survive and which will perish, which entrepreneurs will control organizationand which will not, which types of investment can be made and which cannot, and which neweconomic products can be introduced by firms and which cannot”. This statement is very muchrelevant to our situation here in Namibia and hence there is good reason for the public to beconcerned about the role and behavior of those who are in charge of the financial sector in generaland the banking industry in particular.It is also pertinent to examine as to the precise role and responsibilities of banks in the economy ingeneral and in the specialized function of credit extension, in particular. A pertinent issue that hasoften been discussed in the literature and policy circles in this regard is whether the focus on the modeof financing should be bank-based finance or market based finance. There is no precise answer to theissue as to the relative preference of one to the other. Nevertheless, a pragmatic evaluation of this
2BIS Review 24/2001issue could only be made after taking note of the state of development of the economy, and a criticalassessment of the emerging credit requirements not only in terms of quantum but also in terms of theirdiversity and priority. It may be noted that the credit requirements of the economy are dynamic innature and are basically a function of the way the economy expands in terms of infrastructuredevelopment, commodity specialization and productivity gains. Further, as development gainsmomentum, there is a need to step up the resource mobilization process as well. The structure andlevel of interest rates and the level of ‘efficiency’ (as measured in terms of the spread between thelending and deposit rates) achieved by the banking system thereof gains utmost attention of policymakers in this regard.The role of commercial banksBefore we examine the role of the banking system in Namibia against the above backdrop let mebriefly review the primary functions of commercial banks. The main traditional function of a commercialbank is that of accepting deposits and granting of loans. They accept deposits of various kinds rangingfrom demand to fixed deposits, and lend this money to those who are in need. That’s being a brokerand a dealer in money. It should also be noted that, a banker is a custodian of others surplus funds, sowhile earning a profit he should not forget that he is doing business with other people’s money. Hemust always be ready to meet his liabilities at all times. In case of a banker not able to honour hiscommitment, he will not only suffer a shock of such a failure, but the shock will also be transmitted tothe rest of the economy very quickly. The systemic risks arising from that need to be eliminated orminimized. Besides, bankers are creators of money in the sense that credit creation leads to depositgeneration, which, in turn, leads to credit creation, and the process ultimately would have implicationsfor the monetary framework.It’s therefore important that, a banker should always and at all times bear in mind that, he is a guardianof a very important mechanism. A mechanism, which not only bears relevance for monetary policy butalso paves the way for future economic growth and development and any disruption or deviation in thisregard, could create economic or financial chaos.Do Namibian commercial banks play a developmental role?The traditional functions of Commercial Banking in Namibia have undergone rapid transformationsince independence. The total assets of commercial banks currently operating in the system increasedfrom N$1.9 bn in 1990 to about N$10 bn in 2000 with branches now numbering about 101 and thetotal number of employees reaching close to 3000.Commercial banks real credit to the private sector grew at an average rate of about 10 per centbetween 1990 and 2000. In nominal terms, the total commercial bank credit as a percentage of GDPcurrently stands at about 45 per cent. This is quite high compared with the norm of 13 per cent in sub-Saharan African countries. Except for South Africa and Mauritius, the ratio of credit to GDP in Namibiais the highest among the SADC countries. Although substantial credit is still allocated to individuals,there has been of late, a favorable shift in the allocation of credit to the manufacturing, real estate andconstruction in the last 10 years. Credit extended to the productive sectors of the economy has notbeen that encouraging. This is the area that needs our immediate attention and where we need towork together to find our way through in exploring an ideal solution for resolving the issue.As with real credit to the private sector, the total deposits, on an average, witnessed a higher growthrate since independence of about 13 per cent as compared with about 3.7 per cent (on an average) forthe period 1980-89. If the rate of growth of deposits is an indicator of the ability of commercial banks tomobilize deposits, the performance of commercial banks in Namibia has been quite commendable.However, it is worthy to note here that there has been a considerable shift in the structure of depositsparticularly since 1995 with a noticeable slide in the growth rate of time deposits. This would tend tosuggest, that despite the high growth in the overall deposits level, the commercial banks are no longerable to mobilize substantial long-term deposits particularly in the wake of competition brought about bythe introduction of unit trust and other products of non-bank financial institutions.As you all know the most important indicator of the soundness of the banking system is the bank’soperating efficiency. Research conducted by the research department of the Bank of Namibia showsthat commercial banks in Namibia are characterized by high gross margins, high return on assets,high cost-asset ratios and moderately high equity capitalization ratios. With a gross margin of about
BIS Review 24/200139.0 per cent, a return on asset of 3.5 per cent and return on equity of 54.2 per cent, commercial banksin Namibia outperform their counterparts in Lesotho, Botswana, Swaziland and South Africa. It hasbeen argued that the cost of delivering services is also quite high in Namibia. On a comparative note,this could only be true when weighed against the situation in Botswana. It is, however, encouraging tonote that cost ratios are lower in Namibia than in Swaziland, Lesotho and to a large extent, SouthAfrica.Emerging economic paradigm - need for transformation of bankingFrom the point of view of the central bank and based on a review of banks’ performance reflectedthrough major indicators, one could conclude that Namibia enjoys a robust and stable banking system.Having taken stock of the bank’s ability to perform in the emerging economic scenario, may I reiteratethe point that this is the most appropriate time for us to reflect on some of the major issues as a matterof introspection and with a view to reaping optimal benefits from our strengths?As you are aware, credit extension is very important for rapid economic development particularly in abank-based economy like ours. The volume of credit as well as its allocation to key sectors of theeconomy can help to stimulate productive activities. Although our statistics show that the ratio ofprivate sector credit to GDP is quite high in Namibia, more still needs to be done especially in the areaof long term loans. There is a strong need to direct credit to the previously disadvantaged people whobecause of the accident of history may not possess the specified collateral required by banks.As a logical step forward towards transforming the banking system, there seems to be a greater needfor a review of our lending procedures, practices and credit assessment mechanisms with a view toensuring supply of credit to the genuine clients and particularly to the hitherto neglected sectors.Available evidence shows that most of the credit extended by commercial banks is mainly used tofinance properties and other personal items. There are also reports by loan applicants that banks donot carry out proper investigation on project viability particularly when this has to do with projectsfalling outside the purview of their traditional areas of financing. The application of venture capitalgains relevance in this context. There is therefore, a need for both the commercial banks and thepolicy makers to explore ways of evolving appropriate assessment mechanisms and credit evaluationtechniques with view to extending credit to all viable projects.These steps would result in deploying the high level of financial savings in the economy and reapingthe best possible advantage in terms of gearing the economy towards the optimal growth path.Mobilization of resourcesLet me now turn to mobilization of resources for the purpose of funding. This is another area thatneeds our urgent attention and calls for the extension of banking services to population group-wise aswell as spatially. An increase in the number of bank offices can mean channeling of a greater fractionof the nations savings into investment through the mediation of the banking system, which in turn, maylead to initiation of increasing number of investment projects.Available figures show that in the sub-region, apart from South Africa, Namibia posts a low ratio ofpopulation per bank branch. This in itself would indicate that banking services are available to agreater percentage of the population. This paradoxical situation mainly stems from the lop-sideddistribution of the available branches. As you know, Windhoek alone accounts for close to 25 per centof the total number of bank branches and 4 out of the 13 regions account for about 67 per cent of totalbranches. The two regions with the largest population viz., Ohangwena and Omusati, however, aresparsely banked. This is a situation that deserves attention by commercial banks, as spread ofbanking is imperative for greater deposit mobilization in years ahead. There will, of course, beappropriate support from the authorities in this regard.Banks have made substantial efforts at reducing the spread between the lending and deposit ratesparticularly in the past two years but again in this regard the efforts so far are inadequate. The spreadbetween the lending and the deposit rates fell from 8.96 to 7.48 per cent between 1998 and 2000.However, what is worth noting, is that the level of spread seems to be still high as compared to anaverage level of around 3 to 4 per cent observed in the case of many developing countries.Narrowing of spreads is reflective of the efficient management of the bank through minimization ofoperational costs. The smaller the spread, the greater could be the stimulation for loan demands for
4BIS Review 24/2001industrial development. It will also be easier to provide the necessary stimulus to the process ofdeposit mobilization, particularly from those areas/regions which though endowed withsurpluses/savings but have no investment/saving outlets. Thus, savings could be appreciably boostedby exploring ways of garnering hitherto untapped saving potential across the various regions inNamibia.Commercial banks in Namibia have been able to meet the credit requirements in the economy,particularly, the short-term financing requirements. However, it is worth noting that the situationregarding mobilization and allocation of resources for meeting the medium and long-term financingrequirements of the economy has not been that encouraging.While realizing the fact that commercial banks in Namibia are efficient, the fact remains that, financinggap still exist in the economy. An effort to meet this financing gap requires the creation of appropriateinstitutional structures. Else such financing gaps continue to exist, hampering the growth process. Thisis reflected in high unemployment rate and disappointing performance of the manufacturing andservices sectors that are in dire need of long-term capital. A review of the contemporary globalexperience with the banking systems also suggests the need for resolution of such financing gaps ineconomic development on an urgent footing.Regulatory environmentThe underlying problem in this context arises from the fact that the commercial banking systemnormally operates under certain regulatory framework. The regulatory framework requires that banksshould pursue prudent lending activities. This in most cases has meant adherence to strict lendingnorms as per regulatory requirements. Further, the short-term nature of the liabilities of commercialbanks dictates that the term structure of their loans should be tailored to suit their balance sheets. It isvery important that banks should pursue a policy of maintaining a most appropriate asset-liabilitystructure. In other words, there should be a consistency between the asset structure and liabilitystructure in terms of maturity and yield structure. These requirements very often constrain banks infulfilling the medium and long-term requirements of financing or in extending loans to deservingsections of the society even-though their requirements are genuine.The widening of the financing gaps: options open and the way outIt needs no emphasis that all identified viable projects need be encouraged and financed. For thereasons outlined above and based on a host of other considerations, the encouragement of the growthof other financial intermediaries outside the banking system is imperative. A case in hand is the plan toestablish a development bank. Later, we deal with the need for creation of other financial institutions.The development bankThere are currently two main options available to the authorities in re-organizing developmentalfinancial institutions in Namibia. The first option is to create a development bank and make theDevelopment Fund of Namibia (DFN) part of it and leave out Namibia Development Corporation(NDC) to remain as the government-implementing agency for industrial and other developmentprojects.The second option is to create a development bank by consolidating or converting the NDC and theDFN into one strong, well capitalized, and well structured development financial institution to be calleda “Development Bank” or “Industrial Development Bank”, the name does not matter.In my view, the first option is sub-optimal. It is an expensive and unaffordable option for the size of oureconomy and given the limited resources at our disposal.The second option is much more realistic and optimal in my view. It means consolidation of availableexpertise under one roof. Consolidations of funding streams and resources. It also means savings onbureaucracy.The consolidation of these two institutions into a viable development bank will help to channelresources to well-targeted developmental priorities and supply the missing link between bank finance
BIS Review 24/20015and long-term capital requirements. It is in this regard, that one views the on-going attempt atestablishing a development bank as a step in the right direction.My view on the development bankI believe that, the institution should be developmental oriented but run on business principle wherepossible. As a leading agency of the Government it should trigger medium and long-term projects fordevelopmental purposes. It should be charged with the responsibility of channeling scarce capital intoselected industries, prohibit/minimize risk taking through issuance of guarantees, for medium term andlong-term loans. Its structure should ensure that resources flow widely and efficiently to promisingsectors that are capable of creating additional employment and value addition to the economy.Such an institution shall be owned by the public sector in the majority. This is important to enable theinstitution to raise funding at low costs and have credibility with other Developmental agencies at theregional and international arena such as African Development Bank, Southern African DevelopmentBank, IDC, etc. Other institutions of super national nature or institutions owned by foreignGovernments could be invited to participate as minority shareholders. Private sector agencies couldalso be encouraged to work together with this Institution by way of subscription to preferential sharesand debentures of the institution. What is important here again, is that, the institution should be wellcapitalized, because without sufficient resources, it will never be able to perform its assignedresponsibilities as per expectations.Yet unfinished agenda: the role of other financial institutionsCommercial banks alone will not solve the deficit in demand for long-term credit nor the developmentbank could meet the overall financing requirements. Financing needs being diverse and specific innature, there is a need for other types of institutions like venture capital, private debt equities, etc.Venture capital can play a major role in providing equity capital to finance high-risk investments e.g.grape projects, ostrich and many others. Advantage of venture capital allows investors to share morefully in the rewards to a successful venture and also helps firms in avoiding cash-flow problemsassociated with debt financing. This is one of the options that need to be looked into by the policymakers. In this light, a tax system that recognizes, the authorities should consider the effort of venturecapitalist. The same could be applicable to leasing and factoring companies.Private Debt securities market can also enhance the availability of long-term capital. A well-established private debt securities market can improve the capacity of domestic capital markets toaccommodate large and more complex funding arrangements and diversify the process of financingaway from the banking sector. Private bond market would allow companies to obtain long-term fixedrate financing at a much lower cost relative to bank credit. This will be quite a challenging task to all ofus.ConclusionThe Namibia financial sector is still under-developed. It is still dominated by the commercial bankinginstitutions. Though there are a few specialized financial institutions, a well-designed financial super-structure is yet to evolve.On your question as to whether commercial banks do play a developmental role, my answer would be:Yes, commercial banks have played, are playing and would play a much greater and much moreproactive role in economic development. In this context, what needs to be addressed now is as to howto improve their contributing to economic development further, given the fact that their contribution toGDP is still below their potential. Some of the thoughts outlined by me earlier deserve attention in thisregard and provoke further thinking on the subject. Yes, they need to do more. Yes, they need to beinnovative in order to increase their participation in economic development.Yes, there still exists a wide financing gap. But that gap cannot just be filled by commercial banksalone. Commercial banks may not have sufficient resources to provide long-term loans for investmentpurposes because of the structure of their balance sheets as explained by me earlier. Other players doneed to play their role as well, including the authorities.  The challenge is for all of us to come up withworkable but lasting solution.

BIS Review 23/20011David Dodge: The Bank of Canada and financial stabilityRemarks by David Dodge, Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the Montreal Society of FinancialAnalysts, Montreal, Quebec on 20 March 2001.*   *   *I am pleased to be in Montréal today. Last month, in my first public speech as Governor of the Bank ofCanada, I talked about our contribution to good economic performance through low, stable, andpredictable inflation. I also stressed the importance of frank dialogue with financial markets and thegeneral public in helping the Bank formulate and implement monetary policy successfully, particularlyat times of increased uncertainty.While monetary stability through low inflation is crucial to good economic performance, our economycannot function properly unless it is also supported by an efficient and stable financial system. And asthe world economy becomes increasingly interconnected, sound macroeconomic policies and soundfinancial systems across all countries are even more essential.Today, I would like to talk about the Bank's contribution to financial stability at home and abroad. I willalso comment briefly on the current economic situation.Canada as an international playerAs an open economy, Canada is very much affected by what goes on in the rest of the world. So wehave more than a passing interest in promoting a sound and robust international environment.Since more than 80 per cent of our foreign trade is with the United States, it is developments in thatcountry that have the most profound impact on our economy. Recent experience, however, has shownthat even events in faraway places can reverberate back home. The Mexican peso crisis of 1994–95and the Asian financial crisis of 1997–98 are cases in point. In both instances, Canada wassideswiped by those events.If this somehow leaves the impression that globalization - the increasing integration of economies andfinancial markets - has been of questionable value, I hasten to add that this is not how I see it. On thecontrary, I believe that globalization has been, and will continue to be, a source of opportunity andgrowth for Montréal, for Canada, and for the rest of the world.Recent episodes, however, have highlighted certain vulnerabilities in the global financial system. Andwe must deal with them, if the benefits of economic and financial integration are to be fully realized byeveryone in today's "global village." Let me tell you what the Bank is doing to promote financialstability.The importance of sound financial systemsIn addition to pursuing monetary stability through a low-inflation policy, all central banks, including theBank of Canada, have a responsibility to promote the stability and soundness of their country'sfinancial system.A market economy, like ours, cannot function well without the support of a strong financial system.Sound financial institutions, a robust financial infrastructure, and efficient financial markets arenecessary to facilitate transactions and to properly channel savings into investments. For an economyto perform well, individuals and businesses must be confident that money and financial claims can bereliably and efficiently created, held, transferred, and settled.Now, if the arrangements that are in place do not work properly, the financial system can turn into achannel through which shocks are amplified as they are transmitted from one part of the system to thenext and also beyond national borders. Whether such shocks are of an economic nature or whetherthey originate in the financial system itself, they can end up having an important impact on theeconomy as a whole.
2BIS Review 23/2001So there are good reasons why countries should ensure that their financial systems work well and thatthey do not trigger or spread instability domestically and internationally.The Bank's contribution to domestic financial stabilityIn Canada, the Bank shares the responsibility for financial stability at the federal level with three otherentities - the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, the Canada Deposit InsuranceCorporation, and the Department of Finance. Various provincial bodies also play an important role.The Bank focuses its attention mainly on macro financial stability issues, leaving the principalresponsibility for micro issues to the other entities. The Bank's overriding concern is to ensure that thefinancial system is sound and that it works efficiently. In this context, we provide liquidity to the system,in both ordinary and extraordinary situations. We give policy advice to the federal government on thedesign and development of the financial system. Through our oversight of major clearing andsettlement systems, we act to make sure that the failure of a participant does not lead to dominoeffects and to generalized instability. And we provide banking services to these systems and to theirparticipants. Finally, we collaborate with other domestic and international bodies that work on financial-stability issues.Thanks to the collective efforts of all those charged with the promotion of financial stability in Canada,we have a financial system that is efficient and robust. And, as recognized by the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF) in 1999, it complies with all major international standards.But the financial landscape is constantly changing. Under pressure from greater global competition,and with the benefit of new information technology, more sophisticated financial products are beingdeveloped, and new ways to deliver financial services are continually being devised.What does this mean in terms of the Bank's commitment to financial stability? It means that we, andthe other federal and provincial agencies responsible for the health of our financial system, mustmonitor these developments and understand their potential implications for financial stability. And wemust continue to strengthen the ability of our financial system to withstand shocks. Moreover, since,despite our best efforts, there will be rare occasions when difficulties will develop, it also meansdevising effective, cost-efficient ways of resolving problems. Because even if the probability of suchdifficulties is low, the consequences could be major.The bank's contribution to global financial stabilityLet me now turn to the ongoing efforts to reform the international financial architecture and tell youabout the Bank's involvement in this area.In the aftermath of the financial crises of the 1990s, new international bodies have been created, andexisting ones strengthened, to help identify and deal with weaknesses in the global financial system.The Bank of Canada has been an active participant in several international forums where issues offinancial stability are debated. And we have worked closely with other members to developframeworks for the prevention, management, and resolution of international crises.I would highlight in particular our participation in two new international groups formed in 1999 - theGroup of Twenty and the Financial Stability Forum. The Group of Twenty, currently chaired by FinanceMinister Martin, brings together national authorities from both industrial and major emerging-marketeconomies to discuss key issues that are important for the proper functioning of the global economy.Such issues include exchange rate regimes, good practices on transparency in fiscal, monetary, andfinancial policies, and the role of the private sector in crisis resolution. The Financial Stability Forum isresponsible for identifying system-wide vulnerabilities and has dealt with such issues as offshorefinancial centres, capital flows, and international financial standards and codes.The bank's focus in fostering global financial stabilityGiven our expertise, the Bank's focus in international forums has been, and will continue to be, onthree key issues - exchange rate regimes, financial-system infrastructure, and private sectorinvolvement in crisis resolution.
BIS Review 23/20013In light of our long experience with flexible exchange rates and our strong reputation in inflationtargeting, a number of emerging-market central banks have asked for, and received, assistance fromthe Bank in developing and operating policy frameworks based on inflation targets. We expect this tocontinue in the future.In the area of financial-system infrastructure, parallel to our work on the oversight of majorpayments systems and the provision of liquidity in Canada, we have been studying these issues froma global perspective as members of various committees at the Bank for International Settlements. Andwe have been contributing to the development of standards for the sound operation of such systems.The Bank has also been closely involved in international efforts to reduce the risks associated with thesettlement of foreign exchange and securities transactions.Finally, there is the issue of private sector involvement in crisis resolution. We all recognize that, evenwith the best prevention efforts, we will not totally eliminate the possibility that foreign economic andfinancial disturbances will affect national economies around the world. In the event of an emergency,the international community has agreed to new assistance facilities for distressed IMF membercountries. IMF resources, however, are not limitless. So there is a need for the private sector to play akey role in the resolution of crises.Greater clarity about the size of available official assistance is essential to encourage private sectordebtors and creditors to work together to find solutions in difficult circumstances. And although wehope that most situations could be resolved voluntarily, it is important to recognize that, under certainconditions, an orderly standstill (a temporary suspension of debt-service payments) may beappropriate to give a distressed debtor country some breathing space in which to take steps toaddress its problems.Broad international consensus on limits to official lending and on standstills is still lacking. So we willcontinue to work away at these issues.Before summing up my main points today, I would like to give you a quick update on the Canadianeconomy.Recent economic developmentsIn assessing the near-term course of the Canadian economy, we are all facing a number ofuncertainties. The most important relates to the abruptness and extent of the slowdown in the U.S.economy.The fact that the recent economic data for North America are mixed adds to this uncertainty. Whilethese data confirm a slowing in the pace of activity, some have come in weaker, and some stronger,than expected. This is certainly the case here in Canada. But even in the United States there havebeen both negative and positive reports.In the United States, the number of positive indicators, while not decisive, provides some hope that theend of the slowdown may not be far off. We continue to believe that U.S. economic growth willrebound in the second half of the year, supported by the decline in interest rates and by themoderation in energy prices. The exact timing of the U.S. recovery, however, remains uncertain andwill depend importantly on how consumer confidence evolves in that country.Here in Canada, the latest national accounts data, which incorporate revisions to the growth profile inthe first three quarters of last year, show that the level of economic activity was not quite as high at theend of 2000 as we had estimated earlier. And, based on more recent indicators, the pace of economicexpansion in the first quarter of 2001 will be slower than in the final three months of last year.We can see this clearly in the automobile industry, where there have been production cutbacks mainlyin response to weaker demand and excess inventories in the United States. Electronic goods andtelecommunications products are two other areas where activity has slowed - although from very highlevels - and where world production has been running ahead of demand.All three are high-profile sectors. So naturally they attract a lot of attention, especially in parts ofCanada where there is a heavy concentration of these industries. But to keep things in perspective,there is still considerable strength in a number of other areas that are important to our economy. Forexample, investments in the energy sector and orders in the aerospace industry here in Quebec are
4BIS Review 23/2001extraordinarily strong. Or take retail sales other than autos, or housing, or non-residential construction:in all those areas, and in most other service industries, the level of activity remains high.When we considered the balance of this evidence earlier this month, we concluded that there was, inthe near term, room for greater monetary stimulus without putting pressure on capacity and inflation.Therefore, we lowered the Bank Rate by 50 basis points on 6 March, bringing the total decline sinceJanuary to 75 basis points.In taking this action, we also considered the uncertainties attached to the timing and extent of theexpected recovery in the United States and their implications for growth of total demand in Canada.The Bank continues to believe that the reduction in our interest rates and rising disposable incomes,bolstered by recent tax cuts, should help to support the expansion of domestic demand in Canada inthe second half of the year.This additional stimulus to economic activity is consistent with keeping the core rate of inflation closeto the 2 per cent midpoint of the 1 to 3 per cent inflation-control target range. As for total CPI inflation,we still expect it to move down to about 2 per cent in the second half of 2001, assuming world oilprices remain at about current levels.Thus, as we look ahead through this year and into the next, we remain positive about the prospects forthe Canadian economy. But, given the uncertainties, we will continue to closely monitor developmentsat home and abroad.Concluding thoughtsLet me now conclude.The growing interdependence of national economies, massive capital flows, and new sources ofpotential risks in a globalized environment have brought into full relief the importance of soundmacroeconomic policies and robust and efficient financial systems.Canada's monetary policy approach of inflation targets, a flexible exchange rate, and policytransparency has proven its worth through the difficult times of the past decade.Canadians can also take pride in a financial system that is universally acknowledged as sound andefficient. To keep it that way, we must ensure that as financial markets evolve, those of us chargedwith financial stability evolve with them.The Bank of Canada will continue to work closely with its domestic and foreign partners to strengthenfinancial stability at home and abroad. For to paraphrase John Donne: these days, no country is anisland!
BIS Review 22/20011Christian Noyer: First experiences with the euroSpeech by Christian Noyer, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, delivered at theInternational Center for Monetary and Banking Studies, held in Geneva, on 20 March 2001. *      *      *Ladies and Gentlemen,I am pleased and honoured to be able to speak to such a distinguished and varied audience today. Iam sure you will appreciate in what an exciting and important time we are living. In slightly more thannine months, the euro banknotes and coins will be in the hands and pockets of all citizens of theparticipating Member States. The euro will thus become tangible in the personal dealings of 300million Europeans and cease to exist only on computer screens or in the press headlines. Travellingfrom the sunny islands of the Mediterranean to the icy lakes of Scandinavia will no longer require anystop at a bureau de change. This is no little achievement, to my mind.While the introduction of euro banknotes and coins will certainly bring about a quantum leap inpeople's acceptance of the euro and change their psychological attitude towards it, we should notforget that a great deal has already been done and that Monetary Union is already fully-fledged reality.I am by no means an impartial observer, but I think that the first two years of Monetary Union havebeen a success. I hope to have convinced you of that by the end of my talk. The euro - the crowningachievement of the Single Market programme - has de facto created a common market of 300 millionconsumers, one of the two most important economies in the world. This reinforces the possibilities forproducers to exploit the economies of scale that - at least since the work of Adam Smith - areregarded as one of the main engines driving economic growth and technological progress.Competition is being fostered and will be fostered even more in the future by the increased pricetransparency that the introduction of euro banknotes and coins will bring about.During the first two years of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in Europe, we have dealt with thedifficult task of consolidating a new central bank, the European Central Bank (ECB). This has been byno means easy, also because the ECB plays a role of global importance and is continuously in thelimelight of public attention. In my view, the ECB has proved to be very well equipped to tackle thechallenges it is confronted with in a successful manner. An important contribution to this is to beattributed to the drafters of the Treaty, who have devised an institutional setting which is optimal forthe maintenance of price stability and the achievement of high levels of economic growth and welfarein the euro area. I will come to that in a moment.The transition to Stage Three of EMU in 1999 was a complete success from a technical point of view.A fully integrated euro area money market - an essential prerequisite for a monetary union - wasreality from the very first day of the introduction of the euro. The overnight interest rate, a key indicatorof the monetary policy stance, has been practically the same across the countries in the euro areasince the start of Stage Three of EMU in January 1999. This was certainly not obvious ex ante. Itrequired a substantial amount of preparatory work, not only by the central banks in the euro area, butalso by other economic agents, most notably the banking sector and the governments.The main yardstick for any evaluation of the success of the euro is, of course, the maintenance ofprice stability in the euro area. This is the ECB's primary objective under the Treaty. The monetarypolicy strategy of the ECB was designed in such a way as to ensure the fulfilment of this objective. Asa first element of the strategy, the Governing Council of the ECB defined price stability as "a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%".This definition serves to anchor inflation expectations and provides a framework against which theECB can be held accountable. Short-term fluctuations in the inflation rate are not under the control ofthe central banks. Therefore, it was also announced that price stability is to be maintained over themedium term, imparting a medium-term orientation to the strategy as a whole. In order to attain the so-defined objective, the ECB is pursuing what is known as a two-pillar approach. The first pillar is aprominent role for money. The second is a broadly based assessment of the outlook for pricedevelopments and risks to price stability. Giving money a prominent role in monetary policy analysis issomething quite natural for a central bank geared towards price stability. Inflation is ultimately amonetary phenomenon. The prominent role for money is signalled by the announcement of a
2BIS Review 22/2001reference value for the annual rate of growth of the broad monetary aggregate M3. In December 2000,the Governing Council of the ECB reconfirmed the reference value of 4 1/2% annual growth. While thereference value plays an important role in monetary analysis, the assessment of the first pillar goesbeyond the evaluation of deviations of M3 growth from the reference value. It encompasses a varietyof approaches which assign a central role to money, as well as a detailed analysis of the componentsand counterparts of M3.Monetary data on their own do not constitute a complete summary of all the information on theeconomy required to set an appropriate monetary policy for the maintenance of price stability.Therefore, in parallel with the careful analysis of monetary variables, a broadly based assessment ofthe outlook for price developments and of the various risks to price stability in the euro area plays amajor role in the ECB's strategy. This assessment is made on the basis of a wide range of variablesinfluencing future price developments. This range includes, inter alia, the exchange rate, wages, unitlabour costs, bond prices, the yield curve, fiscal policy indicators, various measures of real economicactivity, price and cost indices. In addition to an in-depth analysis of the individual indicators,macroeconomic projections for real GDP growth and inflation are regularly made. While suchprojections facilitate the structuring and summarising of some of the individual factors, they can onlyprovide a partial summary of the state of the economy. Hence they are only one element of the secondpillar. Overall, the two-pillar approach has proven to be successful in the first just over two years ofStage Three, which were characterised by an above-average degree of uncertainty. The ECB'sstrategy is certainly rather complex, but - at the same time - it has the crucial advantage ofguaranteeing that no piece of relevant information is left out in the policy analysis.Regarding actual price developments, we have to admit that, after very moderate inflation in 1999,HICP inflation has been standing above 2% since June 2000. However, this is due mainly to directeffects stemming from the external oil price shock. Such a shock cannot be prevented by monetarypolicy. It is very positive under these circumstances that the public's trust in the ability and willingnessof the ECB to maintain price stability has never faded. This is signalled, for instance, by the low andstable inflation expectations implicit in long-term interest rates. A high level of anti-inflationarycredibility has been obtained in no easy times, which were characterised by an increase in headlineinflation in the euro area in 2000 due to the oil price shock and the protracted depreciation of the euro.This is important, especially in view of how oil price shocks in the not too distant past have sparkedlong periods of higher inflation in Europe. In the long run, of course, there is no substitute for a trackrecord of price stability to bolster monetary policy credibility. This is what the ECB has been and will beconsistently aiming for. From this perspective, it is clearly too early to come to an assessment afteronly two years of experience.The outlook for the euro area economy remains positive at the current stage. Real GDP growth wasrelatively strong in 2000. However, output growth was lower in the second half of last year than in thefirst. At the same time, the overall level of confidence in the euro area has remained high. Economicindicators relating to developments around the turn of the year support the view that economic growthwill remain fairly robust. The high overall rate of capacity utilisation, continuing employment creationand lower unemployment should contribute to supporting investment and consumption. Lookingahead, for this year and 2002, we continue to expect that positive fundamental factors such asfavourable real disposable income developments and long-term financing costs will underpin growth indomestic demand. At this juncture, there are no signs that the slowdown in the US economy is havingsignificant and lasting spillover effects on the euro area. Nevertheless, the deterioration of the externalenvironment of the euro area constitutes an element of uncertainty, against the background of whichgrowth prospects in the euro area should be carefully monitored. As regards the medium-term outlookfor price stability, risks appear to be more balanced than in late 2000, mainly due to the moderation ofmonetary growth.The credibility of the ECB has also been fostered by the sound institutional setting envisaged in theTreaty, as I have just hinted at some minutes ago. In particular, the clear assignment to the ECB of thetask of safeguarding price stability and its independence are important in this respect. This isfacilitated by the fiscal discipline brought about by the Stability and Growth Pact and by the "nobailout" clause in the Treaty. The Stability and Growth Pact requires government budgets to be closeto balance or in surplus in normal circumstance. The soundness of fiscal and monetary policiesrepresent the cornerstone of an institutional setting which should foster non-inflationary growth inEurope in the future. It is important to recall that the design of this setting took stock of decades ofhistorical experience and of academic research; in short, it took advantage of a long, cumulativeprocess of learning.
BIS Review 22/20013The euro has become one of the two most important currencies in the global economy in a shortperiod of time, as is signalled, for example, by the massive issuance of euro-denominated bondsworldwide. This position has been facilitated by the economic weight of the euro area in the globalcontext. Some commentators have pointed out that the international role of the euro accrues to theECB's mission and gives it a compelling "global" responsibility. Let me stress that, while the use of theeuro as an international currency is likely to increase, the Eurosystem (i.e. the ECB and the twelvenational central banks of the euro area) has adopted a neutral stance in this respect. We will neitherhinder nor actively promote the international role of the euro, but leave its development to marketforces. However, by gearing its policy towards the maintenance of price stability in the euro area, theEurosystem provides a sound basis for the euro's external value in the medium-term and therebyindirectly fosters the euro's international role.Within the euro area, the euro is certainly acting as a catalyst to promote the integration of product andcapital markets. There is evidence, for instance, that the introduction of the euro has led to a strongincrease in corporate euro-denominated bond issues, a segment of the market where Europe was andis still significantly lagging behind the United States. There is also evidence of an acceleration of theprocess of restructuring the banking sector in some euro area countries, although really pan-Europeanmergers and acquisitions have hardly taken place. Finally, some evidence also points to a reduced"home bias" in investors' portfolios since the start of Stage Three of EMU. This would be a signal thatthe creation of a truly area-wide financial market is on its way.Despite all these successes, there is of course no reason to be complacent. Quite the contrary, a lotremains to be done and the right attitude is to roll up our sleeves and go on working. The ECB and thenational central banks of the Eurosystem face many challenges ahead in their efforts to ensure thatthe euro will be a lasting success. Let me now deal with some of these challenges.At the current stage, the most obvious and immediate challenge on our agenda is obviously the cashchangeover, an enterprise of historic relevance that will change the life of 300 million Europeans in alasting manner. You will certainly know that after E-day (1 January 2002) the euro and the legacycurrencies will circulate in parallel for at most two months. The euro will become the only legal tenderin the twelve participating Member States. The ECB and the national central banks are activelyengaged on two fronts, the production of the banknotes and the information campaign (the "Euro 2002Information Campaign"). The introduction of the euro banknotes and coins is an unprecedentedlogistical challenge for all the parties involved, since around 15 billion banknotes and 50 billion coinshave to be produced. In order to support a smooth distribution of banknotes and coins, the ECB hasset up procedures for the frontloading and sub-frontloading of euro banknotes and coins inside theeuro area as from 1 September 2001. We are all well aware of the fact that there will also be aconsiderable demand for euro banknotes by non-euro area residents. Therefore, the GoverningCouncil also decided on some general principles for the distribution of frontloaded euro banknotesoutside the euro area.The "Euro 2002 Information campaign" is aimed at familiarising the general public with the newcurrency and at making sure that the euro banknotes and coins are well received by euro arearesidents. The message of our campaign concentrates on four main issues, namely the detailed visualappearance of the banknotes and coins, the main security features (which will be unveiled inSeptember 2001), the denominations of the euro banknotes and coins, and the changeovermodalities. Let me assure you that we are taking the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins veryseriously. We are well aware that, in one year's time, the public at large will tend to identify the euroand the ECB through the uniform image of the euro banknotes. Therefore, next year is of paramountimportance for the public image of the ECB as an organisation.It should be stressed that the responsibility for the cash changeover does not fall exclusively on theeuro area central banks. Other parties (banks, firms, governments) are also involved in thechangeover. Actually, the Member States have the ultimate responsibility for the changeover, with theEuropean Commission and the Eurogroup monitoring the whole process. This decentralised approachis reasonable because it assigns clear responsibilities, favouring an efficient division of labour andfostering the accountability of all the parties involved.Looking beyond the immediate future, there are still other challenges. For the ECB, maintaining pricestability is a permanent challenge. Building up a positive track record in this respect will be essentialfor its medium-term credibility. Of course, other policy-makers also face a number of challenges. Inparticular, it was decided at the Lisbon meeting of the European Council that all possible actionsshould be taken in order to make the European economy the most advanced knowledge-based
4BIS Review 22/2001economy of the world by 2010. The ECB shares the view that this should be the most importantultimate objective of policy-makers in Europe. Enlarging Europe's growth potential is the mainyardstick for evaluating the pros and cons of different policies. At the same time, the ECB is convinced- and I think for very good reasons - that the best contribution that monetary policy can make tosustaining non-inflationary long-term growth is to maintain price stability in the euro area.Europe's main problems are not of a cyclical nature; its main problem is, in fact, the high level ofstructural unemployment. In the first two years of Monetary Union, the euro area countries have foundthemselves in the best economic situation they have had since at least a decade, with robust outputand employment growth, low inflation and no major economic imbalances. What is needed now is theenhancement of the growth potential of the economy over the medium term. The main task remainingon the governments' agendas is therefore to promote the structural reforms that are essential toincrease the flexibility and competitiveness of the European economies, and to make them morepermeable to the introduction of new technologies and business practices.The area of labour markets is particularly important if the unemployment rate is to be lowered in alasting manner. A well functioning labour market should always ensure that general wage increasesare compatible with the objective of price stability (what I would define as "macro"-efficiency) and bringabout flexibility and an optimal allocation of resources (what I would label "micro"-efficiency). I willconcede that all these matters are not, strictly speaking, related to the euro; they would, very plausibly,have been on the agenda of European governments anyway. The euro, however, makes them morecompelling, forcing European governments to speak to one another even more frequently andtogether to find creative solutions as soon as possible.Efforts to bring about further integration in the product and capital markets by harmonising regulationacross Europe are also very important. They contribute to making Europe really "one market" and toproviding further economies of scale.Fiscal developments are monitored very closely by the ECB. We have noted that a number ofgovernments need to reinforce their efforts to proceed along the path of fiscal consolidation in order toachieve the objectives of the Stability and Growth Pact. By increasing the level of ambition of theirstability programmes, especially in respect of expenditure restraint, they would free resources forproductive investment and reassure the public with regard to future tax developments, therebyfostering economic growth.I have already expressed the view that the ECB's best contribution to economic welfare in Europe is tomaintain price stability in the euro area. The ECB will continue to address governments and otherpolicy-makers, convinced as we are that monetary policy does not act in a vacuum and that the task ofmaintaining price stability is much easier in a flexible and competitive economy. In this regard, wehave taken note that, while some countries have implemented structural reforms, much remains to bedone if the objectives set at the Lisbon meeting are to be attained.One area where further progress is needed is the integration of the equity and securities markets.There is still a certain degree of fragmentation in Europe's financial markets. The Eurosystem isdirectly involved in the area of securities and settlement systems, because of the repercussions thesemay have on the conduct of the common monetary policy. The Eurosystem is also active in ensuringthat retail payments systems are harmonised across Europe. At the moment, cross-border retailpayments cost more and take longer than payments effected within countries; this is incompatible witha well-functioning monetary union. All these aspects represent important challenges for theEurosystem and the financial sector at large.In conclusion, I hope that my presentation of the challenges the ECB and other European policy-makers are facing has not distracted you from the assessment in the first part of my talk. It is perhapsuseful to restate my main findings. The introduction of the euro has been a notable success, and I amsure that the euro will contribute to raising economic growth in Europe in a lasting manner.
BIS Review 22/20011Ian Plenderleith: Monetary stability as a foundation for sustained growthSpeech by Ian Plenderleith, Executive Director of the Bank of England, to the National Association ofPension Funds Investment Conference held in Eastbourne on 14 March 2001.*      *      *The UK economy has embarked on the new millennium with much the same healthy stride as markedits progress through the final years of the old.Over the past year, we have seen the economy continue to achieve steady and sustainable growth.We are, indeed, now in the ninth year of continuous positive growth in output. This remarkable trackrecord has brought with it a steady rise in employment, with the benefits being felt in high levels of jobcreation throughout the regions of the country; and unemployment has fallen to the lowest levels wehave seen in decades. All of this has been achieved with inflation remaining low: the RPIX is currentlyrunning a little below our target of 2 1/2% and has averaged 2.4% pa over the nearly-four years sincethe MPC was given responsibility for managing interest rates. In the process, with inflationaryexpectations now anchored at low levels, 10-year bond yields have fallen to around 4 3/4%, as low ascan be found in any industrialised country except Japan.What is particularly encouraging about the past year is not just that we have been able to continue onthe track of steady growth. More than that, developments during the year have helped in several waysto strengthen the prospect of our being able to sustain this improved economic performance goingforward. A year ago, output was growing at over 3%, which is arguably faster than we can hope tosustain for any length of time without running risks of generating inflationary pressures. We neededtherefore to see some degree of moderation in the pace of overall demand, to ensure that theeconomy could continue to grow without generating strains. For preference, the moderation needed tocome principally in the area of consumption spending, which had been the major factor driving growththrough last year, as households enjoyed the benefits of high employment and rising incomes.Sustainable growth in household spending is, of course, highly desirable and very much the mark of ahealthy and growing economy; but it needed to be balanced against the equally desirable plannedincreases in government spending on public services, and the higher levels planned for publicinvestment on improved infrastructure, both made possible by the government's strong fiscal position.The need was to ensure that all these sources of demand did not over-stretch the economy's overallproductive capacity. The evidence that consumption spending may indeed have moderated somewhattowards the end of the year, and in parallel that there has been a resumption of growth in businessinvestment, represents an improvement in the balance of demand in the economy which in turnimproves the prospect of our being able to sustain growth going forward.An improvement in the balance of the economy was also achieved last year from another source - awelcome easing in the strength of sterling which itself had been a reflection of the persistent weaknessof the euro. As the euro has recovered somewhat over the past year, and sterling has moved backfrom its peak levels, this has, at least in degree, eased some of the pressures faced by exporters andby businesses most exposed to import competition. The result is a better balance between theexternally-exposed sectors of the economy and domestically-orientated businesses, betweenmanufacturing and services, and between different regions of the country.Two other clouds that had threatened the sustainability of our growth performance also recededsomewhat last year. One was the impact throughout the economy emanating from the steep rise in oilprices, which abated as oil prices fell back from their peak levels. The other concern was that shareprices had risen to levels which many felt were not sustainable in terms of reasonable expectations offuture corporate profits. The fall in share prices during last year was not a comfortable experience -falling asset prices rarely are - but it removed some of the sense of unreality. Of course, it is nevereasy to judge what levels of financial asset prices are realistic, and the risk of volatile adjustmentsremains, as we have seen in recent days, but the important point is that the downwards adjustmentexperienced last year, which could have been abrupt and might have generated wider economiceffects, was in fact achieved without significant repercussions on the real economy. In both cases, theresult is a better foundation for the prospects for sustaining growth in the economy.Let me now turn from the year past to the year ahead. I have stressed the encouraging performance ofthe economy over the past year, and the confidence we can hopefully take in its underlyingsoundness, because we undoubtedly face serious challenges and a material increase in uncertainty in
2BIS Review 22/2001the year ahead. Most notably, we have to manage the UK economy against the background of aninternational environment in which the US economy has begun to experience a sharp slowdown.Each quarter the Bank of England publishes an Inflation Report which sets out the MPC's consideredview of the prospects for growth and inflation looking two years ahead. Let me start from our latestInflation Report, published last month. That recognises that the weaker outlook in the US will depressglobal demand and dampen growth prospects in other countries. The UK cannot, of course, expect tobe immune to this weakening process. Our central projection, on the basis that there are reasonablegrounds to expect the US to return to moderate growth in the latter part of this year, is that the impacton the UK from the weakening of global activity should be moderate. But we judge that the risks areweighted on the downside, principally on the basis that the pause in US growth could be deeper ormore prolonged than expected. Domestically, on our central projection we see reasons for domesticdemand to remain fairly well sustained. Overall, therefore, our central projection is for some slowdownin UK growth, to around 2% in the latter half of this year, reflecting the deterioration in globalprospects, but thereafter a recovery in growth to around its trend rate as world activity recovers. Inparallel, we project RPIX inflation running around 2% through this year, but picking up to reach ourtarget of 2 1/2% at around our two-year forecast horizon. On this basis, recognising that the risks areclearly on the downside of the central projection, we implemented a modest reduction in rates, from6% to 5 3/4%, in February.Decision-making under conditions of uncertainty lies at the core of any business activity, so I was oncetaught, and that is just as much true of our job on the MPC as for yours. We all of us get used in ourprofessional lives to looking through a glass darkly. But in relation to prospects for the economy, that iseven more than usually the case now, given the uncertainties we face. Looking ahead, we can in asense see two rather different pictures, one superimposed on the other. One is the domestic economy,where demand remains reasonably well sustained and now, as I have indicated, better balanced thanit was; employment remains high; and consumer and business confidence both seem reasonably up-beat. The other picture is the international environment, where the US slowdown is likely to have adampening effect, but how quickly, and on what scale, and for how long, remains uncertain. Since theUK is not, except literally, an island, these two pictures do not mesh. But it is not easy to see how theywill coalesce into a single image. The operation of monetary policy is often said to be more of an artthan a precise science. But none of us can claim to be a Michelangelo. So let me take you brieflythrough three particular areas of uncertainty we face, in the hope that, when we get to the discussionsession, you will be able to add definition and colour to my half-formed sketches.First, the slowdown in the US is an important area of uncertainty because, if the downside risk of adeeper or more prolonged slowdown materialises, we would face slower growth and lower inflation inthe UK than we are projecting on our central projection. That would, of course, be grounds for us tocontemplate further easing in our monetary stance. That follows because our inflation target is,importantly, a symmetrical one: we need to be just as ready to contemplate easing if we see evidenceon the downside of the economy underperforming, and hence the likelihood of inflation running overtime materially below our 2 1/2% target, as we would be to exercise restraint on the upside. We takethis symmetrical nature of our responsibility very seriously and there is undoubtedly a significant riskthat the US slowdown could have a material dampening effect on UK activity.Analysts have used a large part of the alphabet to try to describe various views of how the USeconomy may develop. I am not sure that I find any of these pictograms particularly helpful, not leastbecause people are sometimes pretty vague about vital details like the dimensions of the letter theyfavour or the angle of its arms: a big V, after all, can feel awfully like a U when you are down thebottom and trying to find your way up again.The short answer is that none of us can pretend to know precisely how the story will develop. It will beimportant to keep an open mind and be prepared to adapt our assessment in the light of actual events.But in doing so, there are four considerations that I would suggest are particularly germane to this firstarea of uncertainty.First, we need to recognise that we are talking of slowdown in the US from what have been extremelybuoyant rates of growth, maintained for several years past, as the US economy has reaped thebenefits of the application of information technology and the rise in productivity growth that hadengendered - the new economy. There is plenty of evidence that growth in the US needed to slowsomewhat, to alleviate imbalances in the economy. So part of what is happening should be helpful inproviding a sounder base for sustainable recovery.
BIS Review 22/20013Secondly, the new economy is, in the US, a reality: there plainly has been a continuing process ofimprovements in efficiency, achieved by harnessing the benefits of IT, which have raised the growthcapacity of the economy. It seems unlikely that those gains will vanish into the night and, if theyremain in place, they should provide a basis for a recovery in US growth when the present adjustmenthas run its course.That, of course, says nothing about how long the adjustment may take. But a third important feature isthat the Federal Reserve has demonstrated a willingness to act rapidly and vigorously in easingmonetary conditions in response to the downturn. Monetary policy cannot remove economic cycles.But active and intelligent management of interest rates can help substantially to alleviate the severityof the adjustment. And a fourth factor suggests that the markets share this view. In the situation wheresome forecasts have been extremely pessimistic, one might expect markets to adjust correspondinglyin an abrupt fashion. In the event, in the foreign exchange markets the dollar overall has remainedrather steady; and the short-term interest rate futures curve implies that rates are expected to bottomout later this year and then begin to rise. Moreover, while the stock market has fallen back over thepast year from what many felt were unrealistic levels, and has been volatile again in recent days, thedownturn in the mainstream market has so far been relatively limited, with the greatest fallconcentrated in more speculative stocks. Equity valuations are always uncertain at times ofadjustment, and we could see some continued volatility in that area, but the overall picture is that themarkets as a whole are "looking through" the present slowdown, on the basis that they see areasonable prospect for a recovery in US growth after the present adjustment.A second area of uncertainty lies much closer to home, and happily its ramifications are almost whollybeneficent. This is the question of whether changes in the supply-side of the UK economy mean thatwe can hope to achieve higher rates of sustainable growth, consistently with our inflation target, thanhas been possible in the past.One essentially empirical argument that is sometimes made to suggest that we can achieve fastersustainable growth is that inflation has in fact run a little below our target for most of the past twoyears. This is not in itself a particularly powerful argument, because the undershoot has been marginaland probably owes a great deal to the unexpected strength of sterling. Indeed, before we began totrack a little below the target, we had for around two years been tracking above it.Nonetheless, the strength of demand in the economy does seem to have exercised less upwardspressure on prices over the past two years or so than we would have expected from earlierexperience; and this applies both to prices of goods sold in the product market and to pay andearnings in the labour market. Why is this? In the product market, one factor may be greatercompetition, which has caused producers and retailers to accept lower margins. Another factor may benew forms of marketing and retailing, for example the spread of e-commerce. This may have cut thecost of distribution, and it may also have intensified consumers' awareness of prices and theirresistance to price increases, by enabling them to compare prices more easily. Another possibility isthat we may be seeing an increase in productivity growth, perhaps stimulated by the pressures manybusinesses faced from the strength of sterling, and perhaps also arising from the application of IT -possibly the beginnings of the arrival of the new economy from across the Atlantic. In the labourmarkets, reforms which have made possible greater labour flexibility, and competitive pressures whichhave stimulated firms to adapt more quickly to changes in their business environment, may underliethe more benign performance of real earnings growth. More widely, the greater stability the economyhas enjoyed in recent years from the medium-term framework that governs both fiscal and monetarydecisions may, by stabilising inflationary expectations at a low level, have made it less attractive, andmore risky, to try to raise prices even when demand is strong, and may also have enabled industryand commerce to plan their business activities on a sounder and more forward-looking basis.There is plenty of evidence that all these factors are, in varying degrees, at work in the UK; and theyoffer the prospect of genuine improvements in the functioning of the economy. But the question is - onwhat scale, and are the improvements temporary or here to stay? We take considerable care to try tofactor these developments into our decisions on interest rates, but the difficult judgment is to assesshow much faster the economy can grow as a result without jeopardising our inflation target. My ownview is that supply-side improvements are delivering benefits, but the process is a gradual andprogressive one, rather than any sudden leap forward. Miracles in the real world are pedestrian affairs,arriving step by step. The appropriate response for us in setting interest rates, therefore, is to try tostay in step and keep pace - not running ahead, but equally not lagging behind.
4BIS Review 22/2001The third and final area of uncertainty I want to focus on is the underlying strength of demand in theUK economy. The US slowdown may, as I have said, have some dampening effect on other countries,including the UK. The supply-side improvements I have described may enhance our growth capacity.Both these factors could provide grounds for the monetary stance to provide more stimulus to theeconomy, depending on how events develop. But a third area of uncertainty - the underlying strengthof demand in the UK - could point to less need for stimulus. Consumer spending may be slowingsomewhat, but it remains relatively buoyant. Retail sales continue to grow and housing market activitymay be picking up. Consumer and business confidence remains steady, with new orders holding upwell. The easing in sterling has improved our competitiveness in key export markets. Businessinvestment is picking up. The planned increases in government spending are beginning to comethrough. Employment remains high and earnings are showing signs of some upwards creep asbusinesses experience skill shortages. All of this is welcome evidence of a healthy and thrivingeconomy, and, with inflation remaining low, it is a performance that can be sustained withoutimmediate risk of overheating. But it is also a situation in which cost and price pressures can begin tobuild up. The task of the MPC is to ensure that this does not happen, by keeping inflation in line withour target so that the economy can continue to grow at a sustainable rate.The uncertainties I have described thus lie in both directions: the economy could grow more stronglyor less strongly than we currently project, though the risks lie predominantly on the downside. Theuncertainties are probably rather greater than normal just at present, but we can take some confidencefrom the underlying soundness of the economy. So we address the uncertainties from a position ofstrength. That does not mean that the ride may not be bumpy at times, but it does mean that we havegrounds for reasonable optimism that we will come through the present uncertainties in good shape.
BIS Review 21/20011Linah K Mohohlo: Bank of Botswana Monetary Policy Statement - 2001Annual monetary policy statement for the year 2001 by Linah K Mohohlo, Governor of the Bank ofBotswana on 27 February 2001.IntroductionIt is now an established tradition for the Bank of Botswana to publicly issue an annual Monetary PolicyStatement at this time of the year. This is done with a view to providing a framework within whichmonetary policy will be developed and implemented during the year, thereby assisting the public inmaking informed investment decisions.When the 2000 Statement was presented, the Bank was concerned about spiralling inflation that hadbegun in 1999. Accordingly, the Bank took strong measures during 1999 and 2000 to slow down therate of increase in private expenditure, as reflected in the rapid expansion of borrowing from thebanking system.In doing so, it was the Bank(cid:146)s belief that the measures taken to slow down the rate of increase inexpenditure, particularly through borrowing from the banking system, would reduce the level ofinflation and dampen inflationary expectations. Furthermore, when designing anti-inflation policymeasures, the Bank had to strike a balance between the need to contain inflation and to avoid anundesirable sharp slowdown in economic growth. The fight against inflation was also aimed at theneed to maintain the competitiveness of Botswana(cid:146)s exports, and to encourage domestic financialsaving by ensuring that deposit interest rates are positive in real terms.At this time last year, when the 2000 Monetary Policy Statement was presented, there was hope thatinflation would decline during the year. In the event, inflation rose, averaging 8.6 percent in 2000,compared to 7.8 percent in 1999. The rise in inflation was due to a number of factors - higher inflationin Botswana(cid:146)s trading partner countries and the sharp increase in international oil prices - which led toan increase in imported inflation. In fact, higher inflation was a global phenomenon in 2000. Importedinflationary pressures were exacerbated by increases in some domestic administered prices. Incontrast to previous years, however, demand-related inflationary pressures declined, with reducedgrowth rates of both credit and Government spending. Nevertheless, the rate of expansion inexpenditure was still high.In the face of rising inflation and concerns about inflationary expectations, monetary policy necessarilyremained tight during the year, and there was no scope for any reduction in nominal interest rates.However, while the objective of lower inflation remained elusive, the Bank broadly succeeded inmaintaining positive real interest rates that were comparable with those in major trading partnercountries. On the competitiveness front, there were mixed developments during the year. Producerscompeting in world markets benefited from the depreciation of the Pula against the US dollar and othermajor currencies, while those competing with South African products faced the challenge of theappreciation of the Pula against the South African rand as this represented a deterioration in thecompetitiveness of Botswana products vis-(cid:224)-vis those of South Africa.This year, the objective of monetary policy is to substantially reduce inflation from the 2000 average of8.6 percent. The desired lower inflation is essential if Botswana exporters are to remain competitive.Moreover, if achieved, lower inflation would permit an eventual reduction in the cost of borrowing.The desired reduction of inflation will require that the momentum of the expenditure restraint measuresthat were put in place in 2000, especially the importance of dampening inflationary expectations,should be sustained this year. In this regard, it is essential that the growth of credit to the privatesector is contained at sustainable levels. It is also hoped that the restraint in public expenditure thathas been evident in recent years, and was supportive of and complementary to the anti-inflationarymonetary policy stance, will be maintained in 2001.Before outlining the Bank(cid:146)s Monetary Policy for 2001, it is important to briefly review economicperformance and monetary policy operations in 2000, as background to this year(cid:146)s monetary policystance.
2BIS Review 21/2001Botswana(cid:146)s economic and financial performance in 2000Economic PerformanceThe year 2000 was good for economic growth internationally, with the rate of expansion in the worldeconomy rising from 3.4 percent in 1999 to an estimated 4.7 percent in 2000. Faster growth wasexperienced in all regions of the world.Botswana(cid:146)s rate of economic growth rebounded to 7.7 percent in 1999/2000, after a relatively slowgrowth of 4.1 percent in 1998/99. The recovery was mostly due to a sharp increase in diamondproduction with the coming on stream of the Orapa 2000 project. As a result, mining output rose by11.9 percent over the previous year and this resulted in an increase in the foreign exchange reservesby 17 percent to P33.9 billion (USD6.3 billion) in December 2000, which was equivalent to 34 monthsof imports of goods and services. The non-mining sector, however, did less well, with growth slowingdown from 7.8 percent to 5.7 percent. The manufacturing, construction and agriculture sub-sectorsexperienced particularly sharp declines in their growth rates. Nevertheless, Botswana(cid:146)s overall growthperformance was rapid by international standards.Monetary and Credit DevelopmentsThere were welcome developments in the growth rates of money and credit during 2000.All the key measures of money supply (M1, M2, M3 and M4) grew at sustainable rates during the yearcompared to 1999.Moreover, the rate of increase in total commercial bank lending steadily declined during the year; itwas 17.6 percent in the year to December 2000, compared to 41.4 percent at the end of 1999. Thiswelcome reduction in credit growth was mainly in response to the increase in lending interest ratesresulting from monetary policy actions. Credit  to  the household sector rose by 20 percent in 2000,down from 45 percent in December 1999, while credit to the business sector grew by 14 percent in2000, compared to 41 percent in 1999. Despite the considerable reduction in credit growth, the overallrate of increase in bank lending was still in excess of the desired rate.Fiscal DevelopmentsThe Monetary Policy Statement for 2000 anticipated a continued slowdown in Government spending.In the event, Government expenditure during the calendar year 2000 was only 4.9 percent higher thanin 1999. Generally, therefore, the thrust of fiscal policy has been in the desired direction. Revisedestimates for the 2000/2001 fiscal year, which were presented in the 2001/2002 Budget, indicate thatyear-on-year expenditure growth is projected at 14 percent, compared to 15 percent in the previousyear.Nominal and Real Exchange RatesNominal exchange rates showed considerable volatility during 2000. The South African randdepreciated by 19 percent against the US dollar and by 12 percent against the Euro. The extent of thisdepreciation was much greater than expected at the beginning of the year, and appears to be due to avariety of factors, including adverse political developments in parts of the region and concerns aboutthe performance of the capital account of South Africa(cid:146)s balance of payments. It was in this contextthat the Pula depreciated by 14 percent against the US dollar and 6 percent against the Euro duringthe year, while appreciating by 6 percent against the South African rand.In real terms (when relative inflation with trading partner countries is taken into account), the Pulaappreciated by 6.2 percent against the South African rand. However, higher inflation in Botswana thanin the USA was more than offset by nominal exchange rate depreciation. As a result, the Puladepreciated in real terms by 9.2 percent against the US dollar and 0.8 percent against the Euro.
BIS Review 21/20013InflationThe consumer price index data for the period January 1999 to August 2000 were revised during theyear1. As a result, average inflation for 1999 was 7.8 percent, which was higher than was previouslythe case. On the basis of the revised price series, inflation accelerated in 2000 to an average of 8.6percent, with a peak of 10.6 percent in July 2000.Higher inflation was driven by prices of imports in the main, especially by the rise in oil prices, whichled to a 23 percent increase in the cost of fuel and power and a 15 percent increase in the cost oftransport. The impact of higher world oil prices was worsened by the sharp depreciation of the Pulaagainst the US dollar during the year. The rise in the cost of imports accelerated from 7.9 percent atthe end of 1999 to 8.8 percent in December 2000. Inflation in South Africa2, Botswana(cid:146)s main sourceof imports, rose from 7.9 percent in 1999 to 8.3 percent in 2000.Domestic inflation was also driven by a 15.5 percent increase in housing costs, due largely to anincrease in rentals charged by the Botswana Housing Corporation. However, food prices, whichcomprise the largest component of the consumer price basket of goods, rose by only 4.1 percent,compared to an increase of 5.3 percent in 1999. Prices of domestically produced goods rose by 6.3percent in 2000, compared to 6.7 percent in 1999, while prices of non-tradeables rose by 9.9 percent,against 12 percent in 1999. The reduction in the domestic component of inflation was consistent withthe slowdown in domestic expenditure due to the decline in growth rates of both credit andGovernment spending.Monetary Policy Implementation in 2000In view of rising inflation and the undesirably high rate of credit growth, monetary policy remainedrestrictive throughout the year. The Bank Rate was raised twice, by 50 basis points each time, from13.25 percent to 13.75 percent in February 2000, and to 14.25 percent in October 2000.Correspondingly, commercial banks increased their lending and deposit interest rates, althoughdeposit interest rates were increased by smaller margins than lending interest rates. Apart fromincreases in the Bank Rate, the Bank continued to manage the liquidity of the banking system throughopen market operations, supplemented by the use of repurchase agreements and the secured lendingfacility.The combined effect of the deployment of monetary policy tools was that the yield on 3-month Bank ofBotswana Certificates (BoBCs) rose from 12.0 percent at the end of 1999 to 12.7 percent at the end of2000, and excess liquidity of the banking system declined by 4.8 percent in 2000,3 contrasting with anincrease of 20.7 percent in 1999. Real interest rates on 3-month BoBCs rose from 3.3 percent inDecember 1999 to 3.7 percent in December 2000. The rates were higher than comparable realinterest rates in South Africa, the USA and the UK, which were 3.0 percent, 2.5 percent and 2.7percent, respectively.Despite the increase in inflation during 2000, it should not be concluded that monetary policy wasunsuccessful. The growth rate of credit, the Bank(cid:146)s key intermediate target variable, was sharplyreduced; and when combined with reduced growth in Government spending, this indicated thatdomestic demand pressures on inflation were on a downward trend. The rise in headline inflation waslargely due to supply-side cost pressures, including international oil prices, exchange rate changesagainst major international currencies and domestic rentals, all of which are largely outside theinfluence of monetary policy.                                                     1 The revisions were backdated to 1999 due to the fact that the increase in Botswana Housing Corporation rentals, effected in1999, had not been factored into the consumer price index for that year.2Reference to South African inflation is to core inflation (i.e. the change in the overall consumer price index excluding pricesof certain food products, interest rates on mortgage bonds, overdrafts and personal loans, value-added tax and propertytaxes) unless otherwise stated.3December 1999 to October 2000 growth rate.
4BIS Review 21/2001Economic and financial prospects for 2001Economic ProspectsExpectations are that global economic activity will slow down in 2001 compared to 2000, particularly inthe USA, where it appears the economic boom that lasted for most of the 1990s has finally come to anend. The anticipated slowdown in the world(cid:146)s largest economy, USA, will have an impact on the rest ofthe world economy.Despite the projected slowdown in world economic growth, the Botswana economy is forecast tomaintain a reasonably high rate of growth of around 8-9 percent in 2000/2001. This will be due, inlarge part, to the full impact of the Orapa Mine expansion on mining sector output, combined withsome recovery in the non-mining sector, especially in manufacturing, transport and construction.However, following completion of the Orapa Mine expansion, there is likely to be a deceleration in therate of growth.Inflation Outlook in 2001While inflation rose worldwide in 2000 in response to higher energy prices, it is forecast to decline in2001 in most advanced economies. The expectation of lower inflation reflects forecasts of lowereconomic growth for the global economy, a factor which would weaken demand. Moreover, despiteuncertainties with regard to the volumes of supply, oil prices are anticipated to decline from currentlevels. For major industrial countries, inflation is forecast to decline from 2.5 percent at the end of 2000to 1.9 percent in 2001. In South Africa, it is expected that monetary policy restraint will continue andthis, together with the anticipated fall in oil prices, is expected to reduce core inflation to 7.5 percent orbelow.Monetary policy for 2001Domestically, there remains a pressing need to bring down inflation. While the ultimate objective is toachieve a level of inflation that would be comparable with that of industrialised economies, a moreimmediate objective should, at least, be to achieve inflation that is no higher than that of developingcountries as a whole.While this objective is ambitious, it is achievable. The external environment is benign, in view of theexpected decline in global inflation and the likelihood that average oil prices will be lower in 2001 thanin 2000. It is also likely that imported inflationary pressures from South Africa will be partially offset bythe impact of the appreciation of the Pula against the South African rand that has already taken placebut is yet to feed through to Botswana inflation.Even with favourable prospects with respect to external inflationary developments, achieving lowerinflation will depend on containing and reducing domestic inflationary pressures. It will, therefore, benecessary to continue the trend of slower domestic public and private expenditure growth that beganin 2000. The desired reduction in inflation implies a further decline in credit growth during 2001, from17.6 percent registered at the end of 2000. A lower rate of credit expansion will still accommodate theneed to finance the real growth of the non-mining sector, and foster a successful diversification of theeconomy. This effort needs to be complemented by continued restraint in the growth of publicexpenditure to below the rate of 14 percent estimated for the 2000/2001 fiscal year.A substantial balance of payments surplus is projected for 2001, as a result of which the foreignexchange reserves should continue to grow and add liquidity to the banking system. This situation willbe compounded by the projected 2001/2002 Government budget deficit. Therefore, the Bank willcontinue to manage interest rates and liquidity in the financial sector in a manner consistent with theobjective of reigning in inflation. Liquidity management will continue to rely on open market operationsusing Bank of Botswana Certificates. The task will also be facilitated by measures aimed at improvingthe functioning and efficacy of the money market.ConclusionInternationally, there are prospects of lower economic growth and reduced inflation which havealready given rise to cuts in interest rates in major industrialised economies, led by the USA with thetwo 50 basis point reductions in January 2001. However, domestically, the economy will expand at a
BIS Review 21/20015relatively high rate in 2001/2002. When economic expansion is high, there is always a risk ofexpenditure growth rising at unsustainable rates that lead to inflationary developments. Therefore,even though the Bank is sensitive to the need to ease monetary policy, it is essential that anyreduction in interest rates should not be premature.As pointed out in past years(cid:146) Monetary Policy Statements, the main objectives of Botswana(cid:146)s monetarypolicy are to achieve price stability and to maintain positive real interest rates at comparable levels tothose of major international financial markets. It goes without saying, therefore, that whenmacroeconomic conditions are right, the Bank will be in a position to reduce interest rates. In thisrespect, the substantial decline in credit growth in the course of 2000 is a positive development.However, the opportunity for reducing interest rates will only be presented when there is clearevidence that overall domestic expenditure trends are appropriate, and inflation is on a definitedownward trend.
BIS Review 20/20011Lars Heikensten: What is happening in the United States and how will it affectus?Speech by Mr Lars Heikensten, First Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, to the SwedishShareholders' Association, Malmö, 9 March 2001.*      *      *First I want to express my thanks for the invitation to speak to you here. It is always a pleasure to visitMalmö at this time of the year; the signs that spring is approaching are more numerous and clearerdown here.The current focus for forecasters — around the world, I would say — is the U.S. economy. As usualwhen activity is turning, opinions among economists differ greatly. This reminds me of the remarksomeone made to the effect that if you placed all the economists in the world in a long line, they stillwould not reach a joint conclusion. That I think catches the mood at present among economists,though assessments do seem to be following a pattern. American economists generally appear to beconsiderably more optimistic than economists with an outside view of the United States.The United States has unquestionably been acting as an economic engine for global growth for almosta decade. It is equally clear that to a large extent it is the U.S. economy’s future path that will steerinternational economic activity and thereby the conjunctural situation in Sweden.Against this background I shall be considering a number of questions to do with the Americaneconomy and outlining some conceivable outcomes. In that respect, however, I must at once admit tohaving no clear answer to the question of how the situation will develop. In conclusion I shall betouching on the consequences for economic developments and inflation in Sweden. In that context it isnot just international economic activity that is important but also such factors as wages, productivityand the exchange rate. That will bring me to the challenges which monetary policy now faces.The longest upswing everFirst let me take you back a number of years. A look at the exceptional performance in the past nineyears can, I believe, help us to understand the problems which now have to be handled in the UnitedStates. Today we know that the upswing which began in the early 1990s and became successivelystronger is the longest period of continuous expansion the U.S. economy has ever experienced.At first this came to be known as the Goldilocks economy: not too hot and not too cold, as the fabledgirl commented on the three bears’ porridge. This referred to the phenomenon of high growth withoutany signs of overheating. Later there was talk of a ‘new economy’ where investment in new technologyand growing use of the internet were the primary factors behind a more efficient performance withrising productivity. Firms that utilised the new technology functioned better and competition increased,partly because the internet made price comparisons easier, stocks could be slimmed and distributionbecame more efficient.In my view, however, the technical innovations are not the only explanation. The deregulations thatbegan in the 1980s, as well as the consolidation of the federal budget during the 1990s, should alsobe mentioned as major factors. The deregulations have helped to strengthen America’s corporatesector and the improvement in the federal finances led to increased confidence among householdsand firms as well as somewhat lower long bond rates.Low interest rates and higher productivity growth then paved the way for the massive wave ofinvestment. The U.S. economy’s growth rate shot up and unemployment dropped to levels that hardlyanyone believed could be combined with low, stable inflation. As outcomes proved earlier forecastswrong, assessments of how strong demand’s long-term growth could be without generating risinginflation were adjusted gradually upwards.Turning then to share prices in the United States, in the first place the Nasdaq exchange with itspredominance of high-tech companies, we can see that expectations of corporate profits rose rapidly
2BIS Review 20/2001to levels that had not been seen since the 1930s. The trend peaked last year with share prices atrecord levels and a GDP growth rate above five per cent, in some quarters even higher.The reverse side of the medal lies in the imbalances that have built up during this period. The UnitedStates has been living on borrowed money; even though the federal budget was first consolidated andthen generated a growing surplus, investment exceeded aggregate saving. Investment was still able toreach record levels because the additional capital could be borrowed from investors abroad whowillingly placed their money in U.S. securities in the expectation that the good times would continue.That explains why the U.S. current account has been able to run up a gigantic deficit, currentlyequivalent to almost 5 per cent of GDP, at the same time as the dollar has appreciated strongly.Even with rapidly rising productivity, the rate of economic growth became incompatible with long-termstability. In order to dampen activity, the Federal Reserve started to apply the brakes in summer 1999,raising the instrumental rate in a series of steps, totalling 1.75 percentage points, to 6.5 per cent.The setbacks were not long in coming. Last year the value of the Nasdaq exchange was virtuallyhalved. Profit warnings have been pouring in, firms are shedding labour, banks have tightened theirlending, consumer confidence is weakening and unemployment is tending to rise. Manufacturingoutput has virtually stopped growing. In the course of a month the Federal Reserve has lowered theinterest rate 1 percentage point to 5.5 per cent and market agents are counting on further cuts thisspring.We now have to consider what is actually happening. Is this just a temporary correction after a periodof undue optimism that has led, for example, to surplus investment and will now be followed by a fairlymild and gradual slowdown? Or has the major long-term and painful correction of the imbalances inthe U.S. economy now begun in earnest? After some months of unpredictable data, even the mostexperienced and qualified observers find it difficult to say anything definite.So let me outline three conceivable paths — one optimistic, another less so, a third pessimistic — andthen discuss them.Three scenariosThe optimistic scenario — the VThe alternative most observers, particularly in the United States, believe in just now is that the fall inthe United States is an unpleasant but innocuous ‘air pocket’ in the flight path of the Americaneconomy’s soft-landing to lower growth rates. The air pocket is attributed to a temporary outputsurplus, so that unduly large stocks and rather too much IT investment have to be adjusteddownwards during one or, at most, two quarters. The profile of this development is commonlydescribed as a capital V; consumption and investment slacken initially and then pick up again, bringinggrowth back up to its presumed potential rate of around 3 to 4 per cent.Underlying this version is the recent years’ exceptional technology-driven improvement in productivity,which helps to inject new life into the optimistic mood. The concern generated by the correction isbrushed away by the active monetary policy and the promise of massive tax cuts in the coming years.The optimists set great store by IT’s impact on growth and productivity, as well as by a quickimprovement in expected profits.The less optimistic scenario — the USome observers see a risk of the upturn occurring more slowly than the V scenario assumes. Theysee a path that instead resembles a capital U, with a downturn that is more protracted. Investment hasbeen a strong factor behind the upward phase in recent years and proponents of the U scenarioconsider the economy has been hit by excessive investment, so that an unduly large capital stockmust now be adjusted. This adjustment is accentuating the economic slowdown, making this moredifficult to counter than seemed likely earlier. It will take time — perhaps a long time — for the interestrate cuts to have an effect on demand from households and firms.Moreover, the conditions for a quick recovery have been worsened by the imbalances that haveaccumulated in the economy. This scenario envisages that the U.S. labour market is still sooverheated that if IT prices fall while commodity prices rise, at the same time as a weaker dollar adds
BIS Review 20/20013to the cost of imports, then inflation will move up even though growth is weak. The Federal Reservemight have more difficulty in handling this scenario because if inflation is threatening to rise, theinterest rate would be less available for turning activity upwards. There is also the possibility of thepromised tax cuts taking time to materialise, which would be liable to postpone a recovery.Instead of the slowdown turning upwards after one or, at most, two quarters in the V scenario, thiswould take another two quarters or a total of about a year.The pessimistic scenario — the LThen there are one or perhaps several pessimistic scenarios in which the imbalances in the U.S.economy undergo a painful correction that paralyses the economy or delays the recovery for a verylong time. This path can be described as a capital L; the economy loses speed and then fails to getgoing again, proceeding instead at a snail’s pace. One assumption behind scenarios of this kind is thatmeasures of economic policy are not capable of reversing the trend.In the L scenario, the higher productivity growth is checked, corporate investment is cut back andconsumer confidence is muted by falling share prices, thereby accentuating the downward path. In anegative spiral, share prices, investment and consumption all decline at the same time as worriedinvestors abroad become averse to placing their funds in the U.S. economy.The problems are accentuated by the saving imbalances. When money ceases to flow into the UnitedStates, the dollar falls. The relatively limited size of foreign trade means that a correction of themassive current-account deficit takes time. The United States has to invest less and save more.Moreover, the debt position of households and firms now seems to be more tangible and perhapsmore troublesome. The debt levels were possibly motivated earlier, when productivity, expected profitsand wealth were continuously improving, but now that wealth stocks have collapsed, this is moredifficult.There is a risk that instead of investing, firms use every cent they can find to strengthen solvency. Asimilar risk is that heavily mortgaged households will not be prepared to take advantage of lowerinterest rates.It is also conceivable that if activity slackens more than expected, the federal finances will not developas favourably as many people believe at present. That could deliver another blow to confidence in thefuture.Which of these scenarios seems most probable is debatable. But they are not mutually exclusive. Theoutcome may well consist of features from more than one of them. What looks at first like a V, forexample, can change into an L. But some variant of the U scenario does seem most likely today. Thatwould call for a clear downward revision of international economic activity in relation to theassessment in our main scenario in December.Conclusions for the Swedish economyIn this situation it is a great help that after a number of years of good growth and low inflation, theSwedish economy now stands on firm ground and that the public finances are in a much better statethan at the time of the previous economic downturn. A series of years of effectively combating inflationand a restrictive budget policy have created a good initial position that makes an economic slowdowneasier to handle.Activity in the Swedish economy slowed in the closing months of last year. The tendency was mostevident in export sectors but it looks as though consumption also became more subdued. This is tosome extent desirable. Earlier last year, growth in Sweden was so high that a continuation wouldpresumably have pushed inflation up and thereby threatened economic stability.The signals received during January and February also point to domestic activity being somewhatweaker than calculated earlier. The change is not dramatic, however. The growth rate seems to fallingback towards the level — between 2 and 2.5 per cent — that the Riksbank identified earlier as beingwhat the economy can achieve in the longer run without generating higher inflation.Turning to price tendencies, some increase has been noted in the rate of underlying domestic inflation(UNDINHX). This indicator excludes changes in interest expenditure, taxes and subsidies, and prices
4BIS Review 20/2001of imported goods. The increase is not alarming and it should be borne in mind that in recent yearsunderlying domestic inflation has been exceptionally low. The downward price effects fromderegulations, for example, have been greater than we expected initially — and presumably than wecan count on in the future.So how will domestic inflationary pressure develop in the future? Will it continue to creep up? Wageagreements that have been concluded to date are admittedly in line with what we allowed for but in aninternational perspective they are on the high side. There are also risks of higher wage outcomes insome of the areas where settlements are still pending and, in that case, of this spreading throughoutthe labour market in the coming years. That could add to domestic price pressure. This might beparticularly troublesome if it were to be accompanied by falling productivity, which has been thehistorical pattern in an economic slowdown. There are grounds, however, for being cautious abouthistorical comparisons. Some slackening of productivity seems likely but not to the same extent aspreviously because firms now seem to adjust their labour force more quickly.These, briefly, are the tensions in the situation in which monetary policy is being formulated at present.On the one hand a clear slackening of international activity that may become more marked; on theother, wage negotiations that can still cause problems, rising domestic inflationary pressure and anexchange rate that may lead to inflationary impulses. It is still too early to judge the strength of thesefactors and reach conclusions about which of them will predominate.Against this background it is important during the spring to maintain a high state of readiness for arepo rate adjustment if new information indicates that this is called for.
BIS Review 19/20011Alan Greenspan: Banking supervisionRemarks by Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem, before the Independent Community Bankers of America, Las Vegas, Nevada (viavideoconference), 7 March 2001.*      *      *It is a pleasure to be here for the ICBA’s national convention. From the largest, most complexinstitutions to smaller banks serving the needs of their local communities, our nation’s banking systemhas thrived amid intense competition and has adjusted to a rapidly changing financial andtechnological environment. Clearly, changes in financial markets have prompted supervisors andbankers to re-evaluate past assumptions in this period of economic slowing and to initiate adjustmentsthat ensure banking promptly adapts to conditions that are less certain and less robust than theextraordinary performance of recent years. In this context, I would like to review the lessons of thepast year and some of the issues and opportunities now facing banking institutions and supervisors.After a near decade of unprecedented prosperity, the banking industry has come to recognize, not forthe first time, the embedded costs of lax credit standards and the overly optimistic assumptions aboutborrower prospects that seem the inevitable consequence of ever-lower perceived risk premiums.Today’s problems generally relate to syndicated credits, especially those to leveraged borrowers. Asproblems materialized, earnings fell significantly for some of the larger banks, which in turn causedaggregate commercial bank industry earnings to fall slightly during 2000, thus bringing to an end theindustry’s string of ten consecutive years of higher earnings.Nevertheless, though the effects of these excesses are likely to continue for much of this year in theform of moderately deteriorating asset quality and earnings at some of the larger banks, theseproblems, one hopes, will prove modest both by historical standards and relative to the resources ofthese institutions. Fortunately, we move into a period of uncertain times with the level of the industry’soverall profitability well above the average of recent decades. Moreover, the source of bankingrevenues is better diversified than in the past, and most institutions hold strong capital and reservepositions.Not surprisingly, in response to past laxity, a weakening economy, and general economic uncertainty,banks have tightened their lending terms and conditions. On commercial and industrial loans, ourSenior Loan Officer Opinion Survey indicates that tightening started in late 1999 and has persistedthrough early 2001. The survey also indicated continued firming of the terms and conditions oncorporate loans by nearly 60 percent of domestic respondents, up from 45 percent in November. Inaddition, more than 40 percent of respondents adopted more-restrictive terms on commercial realestate loans, compared with 26 percent in November. Yield spreads on corporate loans, consistentwith risk premiums observed in the corporate bond market, have also widened. Adjustments instandards and pricing are clearly a necessary and important part of the transition that banks mustmake in moving from overly optimistic assumptions to more-realistic assessments of borrowerprospects.As I have said previously, however, lenders and their supervisors, should be mindful that in their zealto make up for past excesses they do not overcompensate and inhibit or cut off the flow of credit toborrowers with credible prospects. There is doubtless an unfortunate tendency among some, I hesitateto say most, bankers to lend aggressively at the peak of a cycle and that is when the vast majority ofbad loans are made. A more disciplined, less pro-cyclical, long-term approach to lending that provideshigher average risk-adjusted returns to shareholders is obviously in the self-interest of banks.It is interesting to note that the length of the current expansion, coupled with the absence of problemcommercial loans until recently, has led to some depreciation in both bankers’ and supervisors’ skill inhandling weakened or troubled credits. Such problems either are a faded memory or are outside theexperience of some lenders and examiners, despite the serious credit work-out problems of the late1980s and early 1990s. As a consequence, institutions have had to brushup and re-institutionalizetheir policies and practices for managing weakened and problem credits, and supervisors have had tosimilarly bolster their training programs.
2BIS Review 19/2001Recent problems have also helped vividly illustrate the longstanding virtues of sound lendingpractices. For example, losses related to leveraged finance loans have reminded institutions that thesecredits present unique challenges for an institution’s risk-management systems and that propersafeguards are necessary to conduct this business prudently and profitably. Leveraged borrowers, byvirtue of their high interest costs and dependence on third-party funding, have a diminished ability toadjust to unexpected economic events and changes in business conditions. As a consequence,leveraged credits require more-intensive tracking and monitoring than typical commercial credits toensure that their unique risk characteristics are adequately understood and controlled by the bankingorganization. Institutions with sound practices translate the results of their monitoring into appropriateinternal ratings, classifications, and loss recognition to develop a timely and accurate picture of theirinstitution’s credit quality and risk exposure.Though much attention has been focused on problems in corporate loans, other segments haveremained fairly resilient. For example, commercial real estate loans are experiencing below-averagedelinquencies and net charge-offs, as are residential mortgage loans. Furthermore, credit card netcharge-offs, which had escalated in recent years, have fallen to more moderate levels.Still, prudent bankers will need to weigh the potential for less-agreeable credit conditions. In recentyears, buoyant economic conditions raised expectations for continued growth in income andemployment for consumers, which in turn have led to growth in household debt that has outstrippedgains in disposable personal income over the past five years. That growth in debt has pushedconsumer debt service burdens to levels close to the peak experienced in the late 1980s.Neither borrowers nor lenders would enter into these obligations were they not optimistic about theprospects for repayment. Not surprisingly, lenders have recently tempered their outlook, tighteningtheir standards somewhat for credit cards and installment loans. Concurrently, demand by borrowershas weakened moderately. If loans have been extended assuming little or no possibility for less-than-optimal conditions, then problems are likely to emerge. Indeed, loans made using credit-scoringmodels that are estimated only on data from the last five or so years may be too optimistic for morenormal conditions.History provides excellent lessons for banking institutions with regard to appropriate pricing,underwriting, and diversification. One of the most memorable, of course, was the real estate crisis ofthe late 1980s and early 1990s. However, it is clear that such memories and their lessons can dimover time. The exceptional demand for office and other commercial real estate in recent years has ledto a rebound in the volumes of loans secured by these properties. This time, however, as demand hasgrown, larger organizations have managed to keep their holdings modest relative to their asset baseseither through securitizations or sales or by avoiding originations altogether. In contrast, many smallercommercial banks have raised their commercial real estate concentrations relative to assets andcapital. Though underwriting practices appear to be much healthier today than they were in the 1980sand standards have tightened somewhat recently, supervisors are paying particular attention tocommunity banks with concentrations that make them materially vulnerable to a downturn in thismarket.Although asset quality problems at a few of the largest banks may have received the most headlines,a more lingering and widespread source of concern has been shrinking net interest margins. Asliability costs rose rapidly last year, nearly all of the largest bank holding companies experiencedmargin declines, with about one-fourth experiencing a narrowing of 25 basis points or more since ayear ago. However, the aggregate net interest margin of community banks was essentially unchangedlast year. The more-favorable margin trends at community banks are probably linked to theirproportionally higher funding of assets with core deposits, which are less sensitive to rising rates.Moreover, in 2000 the average rate paid on both large and small time deposits by small banksdeclined relative to that paid by larger banks.Despite pressures on funding, community banks have been relatively successful at maintaining theircore deposit bases. For example, a decade ago banks with less than $50 million in assets fundedaround 80 percent of their assets with core deposits. Over the course of the past decade, that figuredeclined 7 percentage points, but core deposits remain a fairly high, 73 percent of assets. For bankswith more than $10 billion in assets, core deposit holdings are only 39 percent.Community banks have experienced only moderate diminishment in the share of core deposits fundingassets, but when that trend is coupled with rapid loan growth, pressures on bank liquidity appear tohave intensified. Community banks have funded the gap between loan and deposit growth largely byliquidating investments. For example, from 1990 to the end of last year, smaller community banks
BIS Review 19/20013increased the share of loans on their balance sheet 8 percentage points, to 59 percent. Over the sameperiod, liquid funds and investments fell 8 percentage points, to 38 percent of assets. The combineddeposit and loan trends have pushed liquidity benchmark ratios, such as loans to deposits, to historicpeaks. However, there are some signs of relief for bank liquidity. For one, the demand for loans bybusinesses and consumers appears to be moderating, and there are some early indications thatconsumers are returning to bank retail deposits in the wake of disappointing stock and mutual fundresults.Still, many of these liquidity pressures are likely to remain in one form or another, and banks willalmost certainly continue to explore nondeposit liabilities to fund asset expansion. While this is notnew to community banks, the growing volume, variety, and complexity of non-deposit funds createsnew issues. To meet this challenge, community banks must strive to fully comprehend the implicationof relying on these types of funds from both liquidity and earnings perspectives.It is, of course, perfectly appropriate for institutions to consider alternative funding strategies to meetcustomer demand. On the one hand, choosing to meet loan growth through wholesale funding ratherthan attempting to attract new money market accounts, for example, may avoid a costly rate hike onexisting deposits. On the other hand, institutions should consider the costs of choosing wholesalefunds in lieu of building the institution’s retail funding base. Significantly, the accumulated effect ofthese decisions on an institution’s risk and liquidity profile may not be noticed until difficult times placepressure on the institution’s ongoing funding. Management should keep in mind that the value of thefederal subsidy provided by lower-cost insured deposits is rarely appreciated until periods of crisis,when a stable funding base cannot be maintained at any price.Management should ensure that complex funding products are well understood, especially those withembedded options that cause cash flows to change dramatically depending on market conditions. Thefunding products should also be consistent with the portfolio objectives of the bank and thesophistication of the bank’s risk-management system. In addition, management should seek to identifyliquidity pressures and other risks through stress tests so that appropriate contingency funding andhedging programs can be formulated.It is important in this market to place the liquidity and core deposit erosion at both small and largebanks, as well as the resultant increased reliance on managed liabilities, in a proper historical context.An unpleasant fact is that the wider range of choices for near-deposit substitutes, and broaderunderstanding by consumers of what those choices are, may have decreased, perhaps permanently,the share of core deposits funding assets. This change may be as significant in the current bankinglandscape as the tax on state bank notes was in the nineteenth century. To be sure, the imposition ofthe tax was sudden, while the erosion of the share of funding from core deposits has been, andpresumably will continue to be, gradual. But just as state banks responded to the tax by innovatingdeposit banking to flourish once again, community banks will, I am sure, adjust to the changingrealities of the deposit market.Moreover, it is also important to recognize that the reduction in portfolio liquidity is more a product ofgood business--high loan demand--than of the relatively slow growth in core deposits. Some liquiditypressures will be alleviated as demand for loans declines. Though core deposits may be more difficultto attract, they have in fact continued to grow, just not as rapidly as the loan portfolio. In fact, bankcredit over the past decade has grown faster at community banks than at larger ones, and so havetheir deposits, both insured and uninsured.But both the changes in financial markets and your success in credit markets suggest anotherimportant area of risk management that requires increasing attention from community bankers:maintaining enough capital and reserves so that your organization can absorb the losses thatinevitably occur as part of risk-taking in a strong economy. As you know, supervisors are proposing toupdate the current Basel minimum requirements with a flexible system that is more finely calibrated toa bank’s underlying risk-taking. However, such an approach does not come without cost, either tobanks or their supervisors.Recognizing that much of the new Basel Accord is tailored to the greater complexity and diversity andthe substantial risk-management infrastructure of the largest internationally active organizations,supervisors issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on the potential use of simplerapproaches. That notice was predicated on the assumption that community banks might prefersomething even less complicated than the current standard. The responses we received are a lessonin the importance of seeking comment on proposals that are largely guided by general impressionsand conventional wisdom. The responses to date indicate that community banks in general do not
4BIS Review 19/2001believe that the current accord is burdensome, mainly because the costs of adapting systems andreporting for such an approach have already been incurred. Indeed, some commenters indicated thata change to an even simpler system would in itself be more burdensome than sticking with the currentregime.The notice also asked whether the industry would be in favor of a blunt, stand-alone leverage ratiowith much less complexity and reporting. The catch to that proposal was that in exchange for less riskreporting, supervisors would set the minimum ratio higher than is required by the current leveragestandard, which is used in tandem with the current risk-based system. Many of the responsesindicated that was not a favorable tradeoff, even though most community banks have exceptionallystrong leverage ratios. I should emphasize that we are still analyzing your many excellent commentsto determine what kind of response we should give.In closing, then, the need for banking organizations to be flexible and adapt to the changes aroundthem has continued to intensify. As the extraordinary economic performance of recent years hasmoderated, weaknesses that were once hidden have surfaced and have separated strong managersof risk from weaker ones. Those that use their recent difficulties as a catalyst for improving their risk-management practices are likely to flourish. In the coming years, institutions both large and small thatfocus on risk-management fundamentals can expect to both support a growing economy and providestrong returns to shareholders.
BIS Review 19/20011T T Mboweni: Transparency and the public understanding of monetary policyAddress by Mr T T Mboweni, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, at the annual banquet ofthe Institute of Bankers, Johannesburg, 6 March 2001*      *      *1.IntroductionGood evening ladies and gentleman. I thank you for inviting me here this evening to speak at thisprestigious event. The Institute of Bankers is an important organisation and encompasses an industrythat is, as I am sure you are well aware, crucial to the South African Reserve Bank as a partner in ourcommitment to maintain and enhance the stability of the country(cid:146)s financial sector.My remarks this evening centre on "Transparency and the Public Understanding of Monetary Policy".The public understanding of what we aim to do at the Reserve Bank is something that concerns usdeeply. It is something that should go hand in hand with the work of the Bank and it is central to theBank(cid:146)s commitment of making monetary policy transparent to the people affected by it (cid:150) the citizens ofSouth Africa.First I will discuss the Reserve Bank(cid:146)s monetary policy framework and the developments that haveoccurred in this area recently. I will then move onto the institutional arrangements for the conduct ofmonetary policy, the work of the Monetary Policy Committee and the Bank(cid:146)s modelling and forecastingactivities. Finally, I will say a few words about the central objective of the South African Reserve Bank.2.The monetary policy frameworkWe announced the adoption of the inflation targeting monetary policy framework in February just overa year ago. The formal adoption of an inflation targeting framework indicated a shift from the previousinformal policy framework. In the past, monetary policy had embraced an eclectic approach in whichrecognition was formally given to a medium to longer-term stance of monetary policy by monitoringdevelopments in a number of financial aggregates and not only money supply and bank creditextension.The eclectic approach to monetary policy was applied during the 1990s, against the background ofexplicitly articulated guidelines for money supply growth. This framework recognised that the ReserveBank had to combat inflation, as outlined in the Constitution and the Reserve Bank Act. However,since the Bank(cid:146)s policies had their most direct impact in the area of money and credit, intermediateguidelines were set for growth in money supply. It was argued that if money supply growth could becontained, too much money would not be chasing too few goods, and inflation would be brought undercontrol.While formally it was stated that broad money supply growth should fall in the range of 6 to 10 percentper annum (since the mid-1990s), in practice the Bank adopted a relatively flexible approach wherethese guidelines were indeed treated as guidelines only. A further guideline for growth in total bankcredit extension of around 10 percent was also adopted. But when these guidelines were exceeded byconsiderable margins, this was on occasion tolerated without strong policy adjustments, on the basisof developments in other variables.In practice it was quite apparent that growth in the money supply could sometimes be a misleadingindicator of current and future inflation. Accordingly, a number of other variables were also analysed indeciding upon the appropriate monetary policy stance. These included the pace of growth in thebanking sector(cid:146)s credit extension, movements in consumer price and production price inflation,domestic production and expenditure, the balance of payments and exchange rate situation, and thefiscal policy stance. The inflationary potential of developments in all these and many other variableswas assessed on an ongoing basis. Accordingly, growth in money supply was not really the pivotalvariable around which monetary policy revolved - although excessive growth in money supply certainly
2BIS Review 19/2001did signal the need for additional caution. However, money supply growth was deemed to be importantand was formally recognised as the intermediate target variable.What has since changed? Instead of targeting guidelines for intermediate objectives, the ReserveBank now directly targets inflation. It monitors and analyses a whole range of factors that can affectthe rate of inflation. The inflation rate, or more specifically CPIX, which is the headline consumer priceindex excluding mortgage costs, has to fall between 6 and 3 percent by the end of the calendar year2002.It is within this target and this monetary policy framework that the South African Reserve Bank willstrive to achieve in the short term what we are mandated to do: that is to achieve price stability. Sucha framework for monetary policy ensures that monetary policy is transparent, in that the authoritieshave a definite and measurable aim in their conduct of monetary policy. And at the same time, itshould give the citizens of this country an aspect of clarity about the future as it makes clear theBank(cid:146)s intentions. In so doing, inflation targeting should also ease the burden and take the"guesswork" out of many of the decisions that businesses have to make when planning for futureexpansion and investment. It should also provide an anchor for inflation expectations and guide bothemployers and employees when undertaking forward-looking negotiations.However, it must be emphasised that at least some of the success of the inflation targeting frameworkrests on whether it is fully understood by labour, business, the private sector and the other sectors ofthe economy. If these sectors understand that the Bank targets inflation and that it is committed to thechosen target, this will engender public confidence about the Reserve Bank(cid:146)s monetary policyprocedures.I will now turn to the specifics of our inflation targeting monetary policy framework. The Reserve Bankmonitors a number of factors that have a direct influence on inflation. These include the growth inmoney supply and bank credit extension, the changes in nominal and real salaries and wages, thenominal unit labour costs, the gap between potential and actual national output, the exchange ratedevelopments and import prices. The oil price is another factor that has played a major part indomestic inflationary trends of late and one that we have closely monitored. This exogenous factor isone over which we have little control. Another exogenous factor is food prices, which can be volatile asa result of drought or floods. And administered prices, those influenced by government or monopoliesincluding medical and education costs, also have an impact on domestic inflationary trends.In order to monitor these factors, the Reserve Bank has embraced the system of a small core modelsupported by other models. It has moved away from the single large-scale macroeconomic model, inkeeping with international developments. The aim is to keep the core model concise so as to focus onthe key economic variables that influence inflation, as I have already mentioned. The core modelincorporates some basic assumptions about the economy. It presupposes, among other things, thathigher output cannot be achieved in the face of persistently higher inflation and that the level of pricesin money terms and the rate of inflation in the longer term depend on monetary policy.Changes in monetary policy, that is changes in the Bank(cid:146)s repo rate, are transmitted through theeconomy via various channels, the so-called transmission mechanism. However, the transmissionmechanism is a complex structure and can encompass a large number of cause and effect scenarios.The traditional channel is the direct effect of changes in interest rates on demand and supply.Changes in the repo rate have a direct effect on other interest rates, the exchange rate and decisionson spending and investment. Changes in the repo rate, therefore, affect the demand for and thesupply of goods and services. The pressure of demand against the supply capacity of the economy isthe key factor influencing domestic inflationary pressures.The link between the Reserve Bank(cid:146)s modelling activities and its forecasting process is indirect and farfrom the mechanical, "black box" approach favoured by scientists. There is no mechanical process inwhich the forecast directly determines the policy decision. It must be remembered that theeconometric models and forecasts are tools to help the Reserve Bank solve economic problems. Theyare also only one set of tools used in the policy decision-making process. I will illustrate my point byreferring to a summary from the Bank of England on the use of models and the Monetary PolicyCommittee(cid:146)s responsibilities. This summary encapsulates the philosophy behind the use of modelsand forecasts at the Reserve Bank. I quote:"In an ever-changing economy, no single model can possibly assimilate in a comprehensiveway all the factors that matter for policy. Forming judgements about those factors, and their
BIS Review 19/20013implications for policy, is the job of the Committee, not something that can be abdicated tomodels or even modellers. But economic models are indispensable tools in that process."To return to the broader picture, while inflation targeting forms the framework for the Reserve Bank(cid:146)smonetary policy, it must be remembered that monetary policy is only a part of macroeconomic policy.The task of macroeconomic policy is to promote economic growth and development, createemployment, improve the living conditions of all the people of the country, and eliminate theunjustifiable discrepancies between the disparate average incomes of various groups in the economy.Monetary policy has a narrower focus but it occupies an important component of the foundation uponwhich the broader goals of macroeconomic policy rest. Monetary policy aims to create and maintain astable financial environment within which overall economic activity can be expanded, jobs created andpoverty reduced.This monetary policy objective is supported by the legal obligations of the Reserve Bank as set out inthe Constitution of the Republic and in the South African Reserve Bank Act. These statutes state thatthe primary objective of monetary policy is to protect the value of the currency in order to obtainbalanced and sustainable economic growth in South Africa. This requires the achievement of twoobjectives: price stability and stable conditions in the financial sector.Price stability is said to occur when changes in the general price level do not materially affect theeconomic decision-making processes. Although relative price movements will still have an impact onproduction, consumption, saving and investment, the rate of inflation should be so low that it is nolonger an important factor in the economic decision making process.We can say that stable conditions prevail in the financial sector when there is a high degree ofconfidence that the financial institutions and financial markets are able to meet their contractualobligations. These stable conditions, however, do not preclude the failure of individual financialinstitutions. A financial institution can fail and be allowed to fail even under stable financial conditions.It is only when there is the threat of systemic risk and an important part of the financial sector is at riskthat the situation can be described as financially unstable.Since inflation is our main focus, you may question where the exchange rate of the rand fits into themonetary policy framework? Targeting inflation does not mean that the exchange rate of the rand isignored. On the contrary, the impact of the exchange rate on inflation is what concerns us and this iswhat we closely monitor. The impact of the fluctuations in the exchange rate on inflation is carefullyconsidered when we go about the daily task of managing domestic liquidity and determining the reporate. If signs do emerge of increased inflationary pressures arising from a depreciation of theexchange rate of the Rand, in the absence of any other counterveiling factors referred to above, thenmonetary policy would have to respond in the appropriate way. This, however, does not imply that theReserve Bank will defend a specific level of the exchange rate.3.Institutional arrangements for monetary policyOur commitment to transparent monetary policy goes hand in hand with the attempts we have alreadymade in communicating both our intentions and the outcomes of our meetings to the public.The Monetary Policy Committee was set up shortly before South Africa adopted the inflation targetingframework for monetary policy. The 14-member-MPC, as it is known in short, meets seven times ayear. It first met on 13 October 1999. The task of its meetings is to decide on the monetary policystance, with a focus on the inflation targets that must be met in the target year. A press conference isheld after the two-day meeting has been concluded and the Committee releases a statement fleshingout the developments in the international and domestic economy and the reasons for its monetarypolicy stance relating to these prevalent developments.The Reserve Bank has also convened Monetary Policy Forums, which as the name suggests, providea forum for open discussions on monetary policy and general economic developments. The MPFs areheld twice a year in the major centres of the country and engage with labour, business, communityand other organisations. The Forums also ensure that the views of interested parties are taken intoaccount when determining monetary policy. This endeavour is an earnest attempt on our part tocommunicate monetary policy and economic issues with the broadest spectrum of people.Unfortunately, to date, these Forums are not that well attended, particularly on the part of the tradeunion movement.
4BIS Review 19/2001The Reserve Bank will also publish a Monetary Policy Review twice a year to increase theunderstanding of its conduct of monetary policy. The first Review will be published on 19 March thisyear and will describe the monetary policy framework in more detail. It will also analyse local andinternational economic developments and the inflationary trends arising from these. The Reserve Bankwill also publish its inflation forecasts in the form of a fan chart. The fan chart is used by many centralbanks to illustrate their inflation forecasts. So-called confidence bands are used to signify varyingdegrees of certainty for each broadly expected level of inflation.Last but not least, the Reserve Bank regularly reports to parliament on the stance of monetary policy.This is in line with international practice and this is part of our accountability to the citizens of SouthAfrica.4.MPC decisions at times still misunderstoodDespite our efforts at creating transparent and open channels of communication on the conduct ofmonetary policy and the centrality of inflation targeting, many people in South Africa are still fixated onthe fluctuations in the exchange rate of the Rand. Questions will be asked of me not about changes inconsumer prices. But, almost certainly, questions will arise when the exchange rate depreciates.Together with this, the Monetary Policy Committee(cid:146)s decisions are misunderstood from time to time.One of those times was on 16 October last year when the Monetary Policy Committee convened aspecial meeting in between its regular scheduled meetings to review the effects of developments onthe country(cid:146)s inflation outlook. We decided to underprovide in the banking sector(cid:146)s liquidityrequirement thereby leading to a rise in the repurchase rate to 12 percent. Some saw this move as astrategy aimed at protecting the rand. Yet the Committee made it quite clear that this was not thecase. It gave the following reasons, and I quote:"At the end of its previous meeting (21 September 2000), the Committee expressed concernabout the second-round price effects of the depreciation in the exchange rate of the rand andthe continued high prices of petroleum. Trade statistics that have been released since thelast meeting indicate that the surplus on the current account of the balance of payments inthe second quarter of 2000 could have changed to a deficit in the third quarter. At the sametime non-residents again became net sellers of South African bonds, signalling a possibleshortfall on the financial account. As a result of these changes and the continued strength ofthe US dollar, downward pressure was exerted on the rand with concomitant import priceincreases, raising the risk of higher inflation. These tendencies were aggravated bycontinued high levels of international petroleum prices."Because of these developments and their likely impact on future price developments andexpectations, the Monetary Policy Committee went on to say that it had decided to revise its monetarypolicy stance. Once again, I quote: "It was concluded that a modest increase in interest rates at thisstage may avoid later steep increases in rates in order to meet the inflation target."To give effect to this, the Reserve Bank marginally under-provided in the liquidity requirement of thebanks at the daily repo auction on October 17, expecting this to lead to an increase of some 25 basispoints in the repurchase rate.Upon evaluating the outcome of its decision at its next Monetary Policy Committee meeting, theCommittee said although prime lending rates were unchanged after the 25 basis point rise in the reporate, other money market rates generally rose. Expectations of future rate increases also heightenedimmediately after the increase in the repurchase rate.Statistics confirmed the Committee(cid:146)s concern that the current account of the balance of paymentswould slip into a deficit from the second to the third quarter of 2000. This current account deficit, theslowdown in the inflow of portfolio capital from the beginning of September 1999 and the reversal insentiment towards emerging markets put further pressure on the exchange rate of the rand, theCommittee said. The concern was that the Rand(cid:146)s depreciation could have inflationary consequencesif it was not countered by other developments.Although the weakness in the rand, the steep rise in the cost of imported crude oil and an upward shiftin food prices led to a sharp increase in consumer prices excluding mortgage costs (CPIX), theMonetary Policy Committee emphasised that the exogenous shocks were not as yet then leading tovisible second-round effects on consumer prices.
BIS Review 19/20015However, the Committee cautioned that there were signs that the second-round effects of theseexternal shocks were appearing in domestic production prices. The production price index, excludingcrude oil and food prices, rose steeply from 3,2 per cent in November 1999 to 5,7 per cent inSeptember 2000. And the Committee also warned that this could indicate that CPIX inflation would beaffected indirectly by external factors in the following months since increases in production pricesusually precede increases in consumer price inflation. The influence of those factors on consumerprices, the Committee said, would depend on competitive forces in the economy and would betempered in the medium term by prudent fiscal and monetary policies.5.ConclusionOn occasions such as these, it is important for us to re-focus our attention on the Reserve Bank(cid:146)scentral objective and the framework under which our mandated objectives are to be achieved. To put itanother way, it is important to place the Reserve Bank(cid:146)s actions in context. Let me reiterate: ouroverriding monetary policy objective is to achieve price stability and we aim to achieve this through theframework of targeting inflation. I will stress what many of you have heard me say before: although wemonitor a number of variables to extrapolate their potential impact on inflation, it is the rate of inflationthat we target.The Reserve Bank(cid:146)s objectives are enshrined in the Constitution and in the laws of the land. The twoelements of financial stability - price stability and the stability of the financial sector - are closelyrelated. If we fail in one area, this will result in uncertainty in the other. We regard financial stability asan important precondition for sustainable high growth and employment creation. Conversely, highrates of inflation can distort the allocation of resources and it can lead to the unequal distribution ofwealth.It is against this background, then, that we place our conduct of monetary policy squarely within theobjective of price stability and within the framework of inflation targeting.Kea leboga.
BIS Review 18/20011Willem Duisenberg: “the EURO. OUR money”Speech by Dr Willem F Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, at the Euro 2002Information Campaign Conference, Brussels, 6 March 2001.*      *      *Thank you very much for inviting me to participate in this Euro 2002 Information Campaignconference. It is the first of a series of conferences in the course of 2001 on the euro cashchangeover. These conferences are being organised and hosted by the national central banks of the12 euro area Members States and will take place in the context of the Eurosystem's Euro 2002Information Campaign. Brussels is the right venue for launching these conferences, not only as thecapital of Belgium, but also as a city which is very closely associated with and linked to the process ofintegration in Europe. The other national central banks of the euro area will also organise conferencesin the course of 2001. The next conference is to take place on 4 April 2001 in Madrid and will behosted by the Banco de España. Subsequent ones will take place on 15 May 2001 in Lisbon and on16 May in Frankfurt, hosted by the Banco de Portugal and the Deutsche Bundesbank respectively.The objective of these conferences is to raise citizens' awareness of the cash changeover at thebeginning of 2002 and to prepare them for it. They will bring together the key parties involved in theeuro cash changeover process, both at the national and at the European level, with a view to focusingon the cash changeover preparations.1.Frontloading and sub-frontloading of euro banknotes and coinsThe introduction of euro banknotes and coins means an unprecedented logistical challenge for allparties involved; 14.25 billion banknotes and 50.1 billion coins have to be produced. Banknotes andcoins have to be distributed. The European Central Bank (ECB) aims to contribute to making thisexercise as smooth as possible. The ECB has decided that the frontloading and sub-frontloading ofeuro banknotes and coins can start as of 1 September 2001. Frontloading is the advance distributionof euro banknotes and coins to those credit institutions that are counterparties for monetary policyoperations within the Eurosystem. Credit institutions can sub-frontload euro banknotes and coins toprofessional groups (retailers, cash-in-transit companies, cash-operated machine industry) providedthat certain conditions are fulfilled.Each national central bank is free to decide the specific date on which frontloading and sub-frontloading can start at the national level in order adequately to meet their respective national needs,provided, of course, that it does not happen before 1 September 2001. The time available forfrontloading and sub-frontloading may differ from target group to target group. The lead-time forfrontloading will largely depend on the chosen national changeover scenario, as well as on thenational logistical infrastructure. These, the scenarios and the infrastructure, differ considerably fromcountry to country.When speaking about the euro changeover we should bear in mind that subsidiary anddecentralisation principles apply. Although the ECB has endorsed some general principles andpractices in order to ensure a common level playing field from a competition perspective, it isnecessary to check the specific national changeover scenarios in order to have complete and detailedinformation. All countries have acknowledged the need to frontload banks with both euro banknotesand coins prior to 1 January 2002, so-called E-day. This is a prerequisite for a smooth and fastchangeover.The ECOFIN Council has agreed that the general public could be frontloaded with euro coins, startingin the second half of December 2001. Most participating countries have already decided to do so orare in the process of doing so. In Belgium, the so-called "starter kits" of euro coins with a value ofapproximately BEF 500 will be available to the general public as of 15 December 2001.The ECB has ruled out the frontloading of euro banknotes to the general public. We are certainlyaware of the fact that retailers are concerned about having to hold large amounts of cash during thefirst few days of 2002. These concerns have, of course, been taken into account and will continue to
2BIS Review 18/2001receive due consideration. However, the frontloading of euro banknotes to the general public hasmore risks than advantages and is not the appropriate means of addressing this concern. What meansthen are appropriate? Let me mention some examples:• Dispensing lower denominations of euro banknotes via automated teller machines (ATMs) atthe start of 2002. This measure would be very useful in view of the fact that, on average,around 70% of the euro banknotes will be put in circulation via ATMs.• Establishing exchange points.• Replacing larger national denominations in ATMs with smaller ones at the end of 2001 inorder to ensure that small amounts can be paid using low-denomination banknotes. Thiswould reduce the need for retailers to have large cash holdings for returning change.• Using lower banknote denominations in countries where welfare payments are largely paid incash.The ECB is open to discussing possible additional measures aimed at smoothing the changeover withall relevant parties involved in the euro cash changeover. Some of these parties have expressedconcerns about the related costs. In this regard, the ECB has made its position clear from the outset.We have emphasised that, as a general rule, the ECB will not cover the operational costs of otherparties. Thus, the same criterion is being applied that was applied when the changeover to the eurotook place on 1 January 1999. Each of the parties involved in the cash changeover - and thisobviously includes the ECB - will be responsible for covering its own costs. The ECB is only preparedto cover costs stemming from extra cash holdings by credit institutions. An appropriate method toensure this has been developed.The ECB is also addressing the issue of the euro cash changeover outside the euro area. We knowthat a significant number of banknotes issued by national central banks of euro area countries arecirculating outside the euro area, especially in the accession countries. The citizens of these countriesshould be aware that several measures are currently under consideration to facilitate the exchange ofthese banknotes for euro banknotes. On the occasion of a seminar organised for the central banks ofthe accession countries at the ECB on 8 February 2001, the first steps to co-ordinate such measureswere taken and agreed. Further steps are planned to facilitate the exchange process in countriesoutside the euro area. Central banks are our natural counterparts to that end.2.The Euro 2002 information campaignIt is sometimes forgotten that the euro has already been in existence as a currency since 1 January1999. Therefore, whenever we pay in cash with current banknotes, we are actually already paying ineuro. However, owing to the lengthy preparations needed to produce the new high-quality eurobanknotes, we are still obliged to use the current national banknotes. This, mainly psychological,drawback will disappear on 1 January 2002. The euro banknotes and coins will be easy to usethroughout the euro area, will make our lives easier and will be visible proof that we have a commoncurrency.It is crucial that we do our best to make sure that the euro banknotes and coins are well received byeuro area citizens. The quick acceptance by the general public will very much depend on our ability tocommunicate with "our" population on "our" money. If we succeed, we will make an importantcontribution to convincing Europeans that Europe is not an abstract and remote idea, but somethingreal and dynamic. The success of the euro cash changeover will depend to a large extent on theinformation the European citizens receive on their new money. This will help them to cope with thecash changeover. It will also help some of them get accustomed to denominations that differ fromthose they are familiar with.In this respect, the two following points are important:• the co-operation of all the professional parties directly involved - such as banks, retailers,cash in transit companies and vending machines operators – and• the quick acceptance of the new banknotes by the public.
BIS Review 18/20013Therefore, the ECB has embarked on the preparation of an information campaign. It has a budget ofEUR 80 million. We have the support of Publicis, the communication agency we have selected to workwith us on this crucial project. The national central banks of the euro area will implement theinformation campaign on a decentralised basis.Our campaign addresses all users of the euro banknotes and coins. It includes users from outside theeuro area, such as tourists, travellers and nationals from countries where the euro banknotes andcoins will circulate widely as a parallel currency. In order to reach such a broad public, the informationcampaign uses relevant groups or institutions as partners or "multipliers". In that context, banks,retailers, educational institutions or the media can be mentioned. We also dedicate particular attentionto vulnerable groups, such as the elderly, the handicapped, the deaf and the blind and partiallysighted, who need and will receive tailor-made information and training.Our information campaign is being co-ordinated with other campaigns prepared by national authoritiesand the European Commission. It can thus be considered a "specialised" campaign. The message ofour campaign concentrates on four main issues:• the detailed visual appearance of the banknotes and coins,• their main security features,• the denominations of euro banknotes and coins; and• the changeover modalities.I should like to emphasise how particularly well the co-ordination of the campaigns in Belgium hasbeen. The national campaign here is really complementary to our campaign. This is ensured since theNational Bank of Belgium is chairing the national changeover board.Although our information campaign, and particularly our communication towards the media and our co-operation with partners, was already started months ago, an advertising campaign focusing mainly onthe details of the euro banknotes and coins cannot start too early. It would be very difficult and costlyto try to keep the public's attention over a long period of time. Moreover, the euro banknotes and coinscontain highly sophisticated security features. They will be new for the citizens in many euro areacountries. In order to limit the risks of counterfeiting, the security features and other details of the eurobanknotes should not be unveiled too early, in other words, not before 1 September 2001, the earliestdelivery date for frontloading. On that particular occasion, the ECB will present the visual appearanceof the euro banknotes and coins to the media and to the general public.Last week, at the ECB's regular monthly press conference on 1 March, I informed the media about theslogan of our campaign. It is "the EURO. OUR money". The research undertaken has indeedrevealed an encouraging degree of affinity between Europeans throughout the 12 euro area countriesand their own currency. The resulting slogan has been chosen for all deliverables of the campaign,especially for the advertisements to be developed for the autumn of this year and the beginning of2002.In line with the timely communication policy I have just outlined, the bulk of the information campaign,in particular the mass media part, will be visible during the last months of this year. The disseminationof the information will continue in the first weeks of 2002, when the changeover will be taking placeand the public will have the euro banknotes and coins in their hands and in their pockets. The publicwill then be in the best position to understand and assimilate the information received.I am fully aware of the fact that, among the general public in the euro area, there is sometimes still afeeling of a lack of information concerning the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins. Raymondvan Buuren, the World-Wide-Account Director of Publicis in charge of the Euro 2002 InformationCampaign, will shortly provide you with the details of the main objectives and tools of the Euro 2002Information Campaign. However, let me emphasise that the citizens of the euro area should beconfident that they will receive detailed information at the appropriate moment.I am repeating myself, but it is important to be aware that we are not introducing the euro in 2002. Theeuro has already been our currency since 1 January 1999. What we are going to do is to introducethe physical euro banknotes and coins. However, I have to admit that, in spite of the effortsundertaken by the European Commission and the national authorities, as well as by other players, theuse of the euro is currently still limited. If the use of the euro as a unit of account or for non-cashpayments were more wide-spread among the public, the introduction of the euro banknotes and coinson 1 January 2002 would be seen as far less inconvenient.
4BIS Review 18/2001The public sometimes tends to reduce the complex activity of any one institution to a very simpleconcept. The ECB's tasks are really complex, involving monetary policy decisions, statistics, monetarypolicy operations, payment systems, legal issues, etc. All these activities are often relatively unknownto the man in the street. He or she will, in one year's time, tend to identify the ECB with the singleimage of the euro banknotes. The euro banknotes will be seen as the face of the ECB. The euro, ourcurrency, and the ECB, our central bank, will be identified by the public with these banknotes.Therefore, next year is also of paramount importance for the public image of the ECB as anorganisation. I am fully aware of the fact that representatives of professional parties involved in theeuro cash changeover are attending this conference. Allow me to conclude by thanking you all for yourgreat efforts, your understanding and your co-operation in making this remarkable historical momenthappen. Let me now give the floor to Raymond van Buuren.
BIS Review 17/20011Roger W. Ferguson, Jr: Understanding financial consolidationRemarks by Mr Roger W. Ferguson, Jr., Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, at aconference sponsored by the Securities Industry Association and the University of North CarolinaSchool of Law, New York, New York, 27 February 2001*      *      *Good afternoon. It is my pleasure to speak to you today, and I thank the Securities IndustryAssociation and the University of North Carolina School of Law for inviting me to participate in thisconference.Consolidation of all types of business activities has been a prominent feature of the economiclandscape for at least the past decade. The financial sector has participated actively in thisdevelopment. Indeed, the last few years have witnessed an acceleration of consolidation amongfinancial institutions. Thus, your choice of topics for this afternoon's session is a timely one.In recognition of the importance of this marketplace evolution, and especially its potential effects on awide range of public policies, the finance ministers and central bank governors of theGroup of Ten nations in September 1999 commissioned a major study of the possible effects offinancial consolidation on matters of policy concern to central banks and finance ministries in the G-10.This study, which I was privileged to direct, was released to the public late last month. Today I wouldlike to discuss the study's major findings and their implications.Before reviewing these findings, however, let me make a few comments about current economicconditions. As always, the views I will be expressing are my own and are not necessarily shared byother members of the Board of Governors or of the Federal Open Market Committee.Current economic conditionsRecent data on the U.S. economy confirm that a significant deceleration in activity has occurred. Oureconomy is clearly undergoing a stock adjustment to bring the supply of and demand for inventory andcapital goods in some sectors into better alignment. One key question is: When will the stockadjustment run its course? Unfortunately, this question is not answerable with certainty at this stage.The predominant risk remains that growth will be notably slower than would be consistent with theeconomy realizing its full potential over time. One factor pointing to a risk of unacceptably slow growthis the uncertainty about consumer sentiment, which has been a feature of the recent period. It istherefore useful to explore more deeply economists' understanding of consumer confidence.Usually, consumer sentiment closely mirrors contemporaneous economic conditions, and it generallymoves closely with the growth in household spending. Not surprisingly, the key influences onhousehold spending, such as the growth of personal incomes and the buoyancy of financial markets,also appear to bear importantly on consumer sentiment.Relative to other indicators for the household sector, the indexes of consumer sentiment are availableon a very timely basis and so can provide an early reading on the direction of household spending.Moreover, while it is a contemporaneous indicator of household spending, sentiment also seems tohave some limited predictive ability for future household spending. These advantages notwithstanding,we are, of course, continually attempting to evaluate those numbers in the context of the entire rangeof other indicators for the household sector.A somewhat puzzling feature of the recent period has been that, despite the sharp weakening insentiment, household spending appears thus far to have held up well. How these apparentlyconflicting signals will be resolved going forward is not at all apparent from today's vantage point, andwill bear close scrutiny.Another recent development has been some adverse movement in inflation rates. Recent inflationchanges have been influenced importantly by increases in energy prices. Prices of petroleum-relatedproducts increased notably through the first half of last year, followed more recently by sharpincreases in prices of natural gas and, in some regions, electricity. Largely reflecting these
2BIS Review 17/2001developments, consumer price inflation has accelerated appreciably over the past year to3-3/4 percent over the twelve months ended in January. The Consumer Price Index excluding foodand energy has accelerated as well over the past year, but much more modestly than the overallindex, to a rate of increase slightly above 2-1/2 percent. Energy prices likely contributed to the priceincreases of non-energy items through their effect on transportation costs and other inputs toproduction. Looking forward, participants in futures markets expect crude oil prices to continue tomove down. Spot natural gas prices are well off their January highs and are expected to move stilllower. If these expectations prove accurate, this should help contain inflation through both these directand indirect channels. Furthermore, any easing of resource utilization associated with relativelydamped economic growth should also restrain price pressures going forward.In the current environment, monetary policy faces the short-term challenge of discerning the uncertaindimensions of the current slowdown in economic growth and responding appropriately. Any suchresponse, however, will be made in the context of our continued commitment to an unchanged long-term mission--namely, the promotion of maximum sustainable employment through pursuit of pricestability over time.The G-10 study of financial consolidationLet me now turn my attention to the topic of this afternoon's program, namely consolidation in thefinancial sector. The G-10 study had two primary objectives. It attempted to isolate the effects ofconsolidation from those of other powerful forces transforming our financial systems and to identify keyareas in which financial consolidation requires new or accelerated policy development. The diversity ofthe economies involved--even among the G-10, Australia, and Spain--and the interdependent natureof many of the forces affecting our financial systems made achieving these objectives difficult, to saythe least. However, I believe the study was a success.Patterns and causesWith a study of the depth, breadth, and quite frankly, the length of this one, it is always potentiallydangerous and even possibly misleading to summarize the key points in a few words. However, Ibelieve that policymakers should communicate to a wide audience their thinking on important policyconcerns, and thereby stimulate and contribute to dialogues in the public and private sectors. Thus,despite the risks, I would like to highlight what are, in my judgment, the study's key findings and policyimplications.The report documents that, in the nations studied, a high level of merger and acquisition activityoccurred during the 1990s among financial firms, defined to include depository institutions, securitiesfirms, and insurance companies. During the decade, approximately 7,500 transactions, valued atroughly $1.6 trillion, were consummated. Moreover, the pace of consolidation increased over time,including a noticeable acceleration in the last three years of the decade. For example, the annualnumber of deals increased threefold during the 1990s, and the total value of deals increased almosttenfold. In Europe, roughly two-thirds of merger and acquisition activity, as measured by the value ofthe European firm acquired, occurred during the decade's last three years. Using a variety ofmeasures, the United States accounted for about 55 percent of M&A activity, partly because of ourhistorically large number of relatively small financial firms. However, it is also true that many very largeU.S. banking institutions expanded their geographic footprint by acquiring other very large banks,especially later in the decade.Most of the last decade's merger and acquisition activity in the financial sector involved bankingorganizations. Acquisitions of banking firms accounted for 60 percent of all financial mergers and70 percent of the value of those mergers in the nations studied. In addition, most M&A transactionsinvolved firms competing in the same segment of the financial services industry within the samecountry, while domestic mergers involving firms in different segments of the overall financial servicesindustry were the second most common type of transaction. Cross-border mergers and acquisitionswere less frequent, especially those involving firms in different industry segments. Still, all types ofmergers and acquisitions, whether within one country or cross-border and whether within one industrysegment or across segments, increased in frequency and value during the 1990s.Joint ventures and strategic alliances provide an interesting contrast with some of the patterns inoutright mergers and acquisitions. As with M&A activity, the number of joint ventures and strategicalliances increased during the 1990s, with especially large increases in the last two years. In the
BIS Review 17/20013United States, which accounted for nearly half of all joint ventures and strategic alliances, thearrangements were overwhelmingly domestic. However, in the other twelve countries studied, cross-border joint ventures and strategic alliances overall exceeded domestic deals.Our research shows that financial consolidation substantially decreased the number of banking firmsduring the 1990s in almost every nation studied, and measures of the national concentration of thebanking industry have tended to rise. Still, at the national level, the structure of the banking industrycontinues to differ greatly, ranging from very unconcentrated in a few nations – the United States andGermany – to highly concentrated in about half of the nations in our study. In contrast to banking,there are no consistent patterns across countries in changes in the number of insurance firms orconcentration in the insurance industry during the 1990s. Within the securities industry, severalspecific activities, such as certain types of underwriting, are dominated by a small number of leadinginstitutions. It is unclear, however, whether this pattern changed much over the 1990s.One of the most important conclusions of our study is that financial consolidation has helped to createa significant number of large, and in some cases increasingly complex, financial institutions. Inaddition, these firms increasingly operate across national borders and are subject to a wide range ofregulatory regimes. These observations have several important implications that I shall return to in amoment.Our work finds that the most important forces encouraging financial consolidation are improvements ininformation technology, financial deregulation, globalization of financial and nonfinancial markets, andincreased shareholder pressure for financial performance. Because we expect these forces tocontinue, we expect financial consolidation to continue as well, even though the pace may beinterrupted by swings in the macroeconomic cycle and other factors. The study considers few possiblefuture scenarios but concludes that the likelihood of specific future developments is impossible toassess with confidence. My own guess is that various patterns will emerge. Globally active universalfinancial service providers will continue to emerge. We should also see the further development offirms specialized in the production of particular components of financial services or in the distributionto end-users of products obtained from specialized providers--providers that may exist within oroutside the traditional financial services industry. I fully expect a large number of efficient andprofitable small and medium-sized financial institutions to remain important players in the UnitedStates. I would guess this will also be the case in many other nations. In addition, the uncertainties ofsuccessful post-merger integration may well favor more use of looser forms of consolidation, such asjoint ventures and strategic alliances.Monetary policyOne of our more important policy concerns in designing the study was the potential effect of financialconsolidation on the conduct and effectiveness of monetary policy. The study finds, however, thatfinancial consolidation has not significantly affected the ability of central banks to achieve theobjectives of monetary policy. Why is this? Although the answer is somewhat complex, let me try toexplain briefly. As part of our research, we asked central banks in all the study nations about theirexperiences with consolidation and monetary policy. Virtually all reported that they had experienced atmost minor effects, and those that had experienced somewhat stronger effects had been able toadjust with little difficulty. A key reason for this finding is that even with the substantial consolidationwe have observed, the financial markets important for monetary policy have generally remained highlycompetitive. Even in those nations where consolidation has been considerable, competitive behaviorhas generally been sustained by the possibility that new firms could enter the markets at relatively lowcost. It is also well worth noting that our work suggests that the development of the euro has beenparticularly helpful in maintaining competition in Europe. The euro has encouraged development ofEuropean money and capital markets, thus making the number of participants in a particular nation'smarkets less relevant.Consolidation could, at least in theory, affect the way changes in monetary policy are transmitted tothe real economy. For example, consolidation could potentially alter the way banks adjust theavailability and pricing of credit to their customers as the central bank changes the stance of monetarypolicy. However, central banks generally indicated that such effects had not been observed. Moreover,frequent reviews of the data should allow central banks to take account of any future changes whensetting policy.On balance, and despite these quite positive results, our study recommends that central banks shouldremain alert to the implications of any future reductions in the competitiveness of the markets most
4BIS Review 17/2001important for monetary policy implementation. Similarly, we suggest that central banks ought tomonitor potential future effects on the transmission mechanisms for monetary policy. Monetary policyis simply too important to the health of all our economies to do otherwise.Financial riskFinancial consolidation can affect the risks to both individual financial institutions and the financialsystem as a whole. Importantly, our study concludes that existing policies appear adequate to containindividual firm and systemic risks now and in the intermediate term. However, looking further ahead,the study identifies several topics that deserve careful attention by policymakers.For example, we conclude that the potential effects of financial consolidation on the risk of individualfinancial institutions are mixed and that the net result is impossible to generalize. Thus, we mustevaluate individual firm risk on a case-by-case basis. Consolidation seems most likely to reduce riskthrough diversification gains, although even here the possibilities are complex. On the one hand,diversification gains seem likely from consolidation across regions of a given nation and acrossnational borders. On the other hand, after consolidation some firms shift toward riskier asset portfolios,and consolidation may increase operating risks and managerial complexities for those firms.Diversification gains may also result from consolidation across financial products and services,although research suggests that the potential benefits may be fairly limited.In part because the net impact of consolidation on individual firm risk is unclear, the net impact ofconsolidation on systemic risk is also uncertain. However, as I noted consolidation clearly hasencouraged the creation of a number of large and increasingly complex financial institutions. Our studysuggests that if such an institution became seriously distressed, consolidation and any attendantcomplexity might increase the chance that winding down the organization would be difficult ordisorderly.We recommend that the risks to individual firms and to the financial system could be reduced bystepped-up efforts to understand the implications of working out a large and complex financialinstitution. Because no institution is too big to fail, I believe that regulators should develop a clearerunderstanding of, for example, the administration of bankruptcy laws and conventions across borders;the coordination of supervisory policies within and across borders; the treatment of over-the-counterderivatives, foreign exchange, and other "market" activities in distress situations; the roles andresponsibilities of managers and boards of directors; and the administration of the lender-of-last-resortfunction. I say stepped-up discussions are needed in some of these areas because consideringadverse developments is or should be a normal activity in all countries. Our study helped to clarify theneed for international attention to this topic.Consolidation, and especially any resulting increased complexity of financial institutions, appears tohave increased both the demand by market participants for and the supply by institutions ofinformation regarding a firm's financial condition. The resulting rise in disclosures has probablyimproved firm transparency and encouraged market discipline and has thus lowered individual firm riskand perhaps increased financial stability. However, the increased complexity of firms has also madethem more opaque, and their increased size has the potential to augment moral hazard. Thus, the neteffect of consolidation on firm transparency and market discipline is unclear. Indeed, we conclude thatthere appears to be considerable room for improvement in disclosures by financial institutions.Our study suggests that both crisis prevention and crisis management could be improved by additionalcommunication and cooperation among central banks, finance ministries, and other financialsupervisors, domestically and internationally. Indeed, the study strongly supports existing efforts inthese areas. In our view, the most important initiatives include proposals to improve the risk sensitivityof the international Basel Capital Accord and bank supervision and efforts aimed at improving marketdiscipline. A critical element of improved risk-based supervision is risk-based capital standards thatare tied more closely to economic risk. Capital standards provide an anchor for virtually all othersupervisory and regulatory actions and can support and improve both supervisory and marketdiscipline. For example, early intervention policies triggered by more accurate capital standards couldprove to be important in crisis prevention.Payment and settlement systemsFinancial consolidation is affecting the market structures for payment and securities settlement as wellas banks' internal systems and procedures for payment and back-office activities. Our study concludes
BIS Review 17/20015that, on balance, financial consolidation has led to a greater concentration of payment and settlementflows among fewer parties. Fortunately, our analysis indicates that the greater concentration ofpayment flows does not appear to have decreased competition in markets for payment and settlementservices. However, we suggest that it would be advisable for government authorities to continue tomonitor competition in the payment system.In contrast, our work indicates we should closely monitor the risk implications of consolidation inpayment and settlement systems. On the one hand, consolidation may help to improve theeffectiveness of institutions' credit and liquidity risk controls. For example, increased concentration ofpayment flows may allow institutions to get a more comprehensive picture of settlement exposures orcreate a greater ability to net internal payment flows. In addition, central banks have made majorefforts over recent decades to contain and reduce systemic risk by operating and promoting real-timegross settlement systems and by insisting on the implementation of risk control measures in netsettlement systems. On the other hand, consolidation may lead to a significant shift of risk frominterbank settlement systems, where risk management may be more robust and transparent, tocustomer banks and third-party service providers, where risk management practices may be harder forusers to discern. In addition, to the extent that consolidation results in a greater concentration ofpayment flows, the potential effects of an operational problem may increase.These and other developments imply that central bank oversight of the risks in interbank paymentsystems is becoming more closely linked with traditional supervision of individual institution safety andsoundness. As a result, we conclude that increasing cooperation and communication between bankingsupervisors and payment system overseers may be necessary both domestically and internationally.Efficiency, competition, and credit flowsOur study concludes with an extensive evaluation of the potential effects of financial consolidation onthe efficiency of financial institutions, competition among such firms, and credit flows to householdsand small businesses. The study determines that although consolidation has some potential toimprove operating efficiency, and has done so in some cases, the overall evidence in favor ofefficiency gains is weak. Thus, we suggest that policymakers should carefully examine claims ofsubstantial efficiency gains in proposed consolidations, especially in cases where a merger could raisesignificant issues of market power.Our work also attempts to shed some light on why academic researchers are less optimistic thanbusiness practitioners regarding the potential for consolidation to lead to efficiency gains. We suggestfour possible reasons, which are not mutually exclusive. First, practitioners may consider costreductions or revenue increases per se to be a success, without also taking into account independentindustry trends as a benchmark. Second, managers may focus on absolute cost savings rather thanon efficiency measures that compare costs to some other variable such as assets or revenues. Third,research finds little or no efficiency improvements on average, but this also means that someinstitutions may improve efficiency while some suffer from lower efficiency. Managers with insideknowledge of their firm may be justified in believing that their institution might be among thoseimproving efficiency through a merger or acquisition. Lastly, past M&As may have suffered fromregulations that reduced the benefits, and such regulations may not exist in the future.The effects of consolidation on competition and credit flows are case-specific and depend on thenature of markets for individual products and services. Some markets, such as those for wholesalefinancial services, generally show few problems. Others, such as those for retail products andservices, sometimes experience problems from consolidation. Thus, as with other issues addressedby our study, a case-by-case evaluation of the relevant facts is required.ConclusionIn conclusion, financial consolidation clearly is a powerful force that is deeply affecting the evolution ofthe financial system of the United States and many other nations. A thorough understanding of thisforce and its potential effects is critical for prudent decision-making in both the public and the privatesectors. I believe the study that I have just summarized takes some major steps toward thatunderstanding, and I hope that my remarks have helped you to comprehend our study's findings andimplications. Still, all of us have much to learn, and much of what we know today will almost surelychange in the future.

BIS Review ??/20011Villy Bergström: The Riksbank’s role in the economySpeech by Mr Villy Bergström, Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, to the SwedishShareholders Association, Jönköping, 28 February 2001.*      *      *Some time ago, the British journal The Economist wrote that the world’s central banks were now at theheight of their power. It is easy to get that impression when you see the enormous amount of interestdevoted to the central banks in the daily press, the broadcasting media and economic journals. Thisapplies to the Riksbank in Sweden, to the European Central Bank – the ECB – and, especially to theU.S. central bank, the Federal Reserve with Alan Greenspan in the foreground.During the autumn electoral campaign in the United States, a number of newspapers put forward theview that it would not make any difference whether Al Gore or George Bush was elected as President- it was in any case Greenspan who was in control. When Greenspan surprisingly cut the Americaninstrumental rate by 0.5% in January between two ordinary monetary policy meetings of the FederalReserve’s decision-making body, the decision was applauded with headlines such as “Greenspansaves the world again”. This type of statement is simply ridiculous. The importance of monetary policycannot be compared with the Government’s general policies or with the office of President. However,things have gone so far that the central bank is regarded as a second government in many countries.These comparisons are, of course, unreasonable.Central banks have one or sometimes two well-defined tasks, namely to maintain stable prices andoften also to safeguard the stability of the financial system. For that purpose, the central banks haveprimarily one instrument, the instrumental rate, sometimes supplemented by other means of exercisingcontrol. The objectives for central bank activities are thus simple and clear, their arsenal of tools islimited. This cannot in any way be compared with the complex tasks of governments, their decision-making situations with conflicting goals and a continually changing agenda. In Sweden, a small part ofthe public policy has been removed from the Government and the Riksdag to the Riksbank by theRiksdag’s own decision, namely responsibility for stable prices and financial stability. Everything elseremains on the Government and Riksdag.The tasks and policies of the central banks are thus not in any way comparable with governmentpolicy as regards importance and degree of complexity.However – having said this – I should like to strongly emphasise the importance of there being a highlevel of confidence in the Riksbank. It can perhaps be said that the most important variable we have tocomply with is the public’s inflation expectations. After all, it is these expectations that reflectconfidence. If disturbances affect the economy through, for instance, an oil price shock, so thatinflation exceeds the Riksbank’s target of 2 per cent, a return to the target can take place more quicklyif public expectations remain at the 2 per cent target. Despite oil prices more than tripling from thebeginning of 1999 to the end of last year, inflation expectations stayed at the Riksbank’s target. Ifexpectations also increase, monetary policy must be made considerably more stringent to expelinflationary expectations from the economy. From this point of view, it is important that monetary policyis reviewed and that a discussion takes place on the Riksbank’s actions, although the importance ofthe bank should not be exaggerated.Having said that to provide a perspective on the tasks we have at the Riksbank, I should like to moveon to discuss the economic situation in Sweden.Favourable growthDuring the past three years, GDP has increased in Sweden by an average a bit more than 3.5 percent. The rate of growth is increasingly higher than what is possible in the long term. The Swedisheconomy has expanded approximately a half per cent more quickly per year than the euro area in thepast four years, although over one per cent more slowly than in the United States during the sameperiod.
2BIS Review ??/2001Strong foreign trade has made a positive contribution to growth in Sweden for large parts of the 1990sand since 1994, the current account has been in surplus. The weak exchange rate for the kronathroughout almost the whole of this period with a floating exchange rate, combined with the vigorousgrowth in the telecommunications sector have been the driving forces underlying the increase inexports.However, it is first when private consumption has accelerated in recent years that GDP growth hasincreased so strongly that unemployment has also fallen. Many factors have led to households startingto consume: Cuts in public finances no longer burden household budgets – instead lower taxes haveincreased disposable income. Unemployment has fallen at the same time as real wages have risenmarkedly. Finally, household net wealth has increased due to increasing property and share prices upto summer last year. However, household’s expectations about the future seem to play a crucial rolefor household’s propensity to consume.In the last few years, investments in the business sector have increased quite strongly in volume whileit is only just recently that investments in housing construction have started to increase.The strong growth we have seen in recent years is higher than that sustainable in the long term. TheRiksbank makes the assessment that annual increases in production of 2- 2.5 per cent are possible inthe long term. The amount that GDP can increase is determined by the increase in productivity and byhow much employment can increase. The larger increase in production in recent years is primarily dueto there being a lot of unused resources in the economy after the problem years in the early 90s, whenthere was a substantial drop in production. While the productivity of the business sector has increased,it has primarily been increased employment that has created scope for growth. If we compare with thehigh-inflation period – the 20 years from the mid-1970s, we can, however, see that we have had afaster increase in productivity in the past five years. We should not therefore rule out the possibilitythat we are on threshold of a faster growth in productivity when IT investments spread on a broadbasis to the “old economy” in the same way as has happened in the United States.The strong increase in productivity in recent years has taken place without inflation accelerating. Thishas surprised many people – for even though the previously high unemployment, indicated that therewere a lot of unused resources in the economy, there were many who doubted whether it would bepossible for so many to return to the labour market so quickly. Month after month, we have seenincreases in employment of 80-90 000 persons on an annual basis, 70 per cent of which have takenplace by an increased supply of labour. Flexibility in the labour market has thus exceededexpectations. Open unemployment is now down to around 4 per cent, which, while it is higher thanthat considered normal in the 1980s, is lower than what many people in the early 1990s feared wouldbe normal.Stable inflation expectationsThe stabilisation of inflation expectations at a low level shows that the Riksbank’s inflation target hasattained high credibility. A number of factors have contributed to confirming confidence in the pricestability objective. High real wage increases despite moderate nominal pay increases are one factorthat has undoubtedly increased the support of wage earners for the price stability objective. The factthat the price stability objective has been confirmed by law has also probably contributed to confirmingconfidence in the inflation target.However, the Riksbank has a pedagogical and practical problem. Monetary policy decisions are basedon assessments of inflation a couple of years ahead and are focused on achieving the inflation targetduring that period. This means that we can often be compelled to increase the interest rate despite theactual rate of inflation at the time being under the target. In December last year, for instance, theRiksbank increased interest by 25 points despite inflation then being at 1.4 per cent. Decisions arethen made on the basis of forecasts over a two-year horizon.The most important reason for not waiting until inflation actually exceeds the target is that inflationexpectations would then risk accelerating since it takes up to two years before monetary policy has itsfull effect. And then we may – to rein in inflationary expectations again – be compelled to tighten upthe economy more than we would have to have done if we had reacted earlier.The Riksbank’s way of conducting monetary policy obviously plays an important role with regard tomaintaining confidence in price stability. However, we should not forget that fiscal policy also has to beconducted in a way compatible with the price stability target. The budget consolidation, the
BIS Review ??/20013Government’s expenditure ceiling and balance targets have strongly contributed to achievingcredibility in the price stability objective. It is was first when the budget consolidation in the mid-1990shad come quite a long way and optimism on the Swedish economy began to return that inflationexpectations showed that the price stability objective had attained credibility. The Riksbank did notthen need to counteract high inflation expectations by monetary policy.The United States important for future growthInflation has not just been kept down by the fact that there have been a lot of unused resources untilnow and that inflation expectations have stabilised at a low level – we have also been aided thepressure on prices from deregulations and increased competition. However, it is no longer probablethat this process will pull down inflation to the same extent in future.Some dampening of the rate of growth in coming years is therefore probably necessary if we are toavoid tendencies to overheating. This dampening can be achieved either by a more stringentmonetary policy or by the economy dampening by itself. It now looks as if a slackening of the cycle ison its way led by developments in the United States. However, the strength and duration of thisdownturn is uncertain and depends among other things on future cyclical development in the UnitedStates and the effect that this has in Europe and Sweden.After many years of exceptional growth, a rapid cooling off is now taking place in the Americaneconomy. The indicators that have been received in recent months have mainly led to successivelydownward adjustments of future GDP growth in the United States by most forecasters. What argues infavour of a brief downturn is the fact that the effects of the IT development in spreading to the rest ofthe economy can hardly be regarded as exhausted. Investments in the American economy have beenof a record size and a lot of these investments have been related in fact to IT investments.Depreciation periods are also short there, which in itself reduces the risk for locking-in effects in largemistaken investments. However, it can also be noted that both households and companies have ahigh level of debt. They have invested and consumed more than they have produced during the periodin question and the current account has therefore been in substantial deficit for a number of years.(See Diagram 1). The savings deficit indicates high indebtedness in both households and businesses.If optimism about the future were to be replaced by considerable uncertainty, the high indebtednesswould per se reinforce the cyclical downturn and make it more prolonged. Uncertainty about the futurecan lead to businesses and households restraining demand in order to consolidate.
4BIS Review ??/2001The earlier optimism about the American economy also made it attractive to invest in American assets.This resulted in the dollar appreciating greatly despite the large deficit in the current account - thestrong demand for investments in American companies and shares resulted in the effects from thecurrent account deficit being counteracted. When optimism has reduced in the past six months,interest in American investments has also been reduced and the dollar has weakened.Although there is fundamentally a lot to indicate that the American economy will continue to be able togrow for a period to come at a historically high rate, there is also an evident risk that there will first be afairly strong downturn. There is also a risk that uncertainty about the future will drastically reducehouseholds’ consumption and increase their low saving, that investments will drop and that the dollarwill clearly weaken because other countries are no longer willing to finance the gigantic currentaccount deficits.The dollar could then drop considerably in value and there would be a risk of considerably poorergrowth. The current account deficit is large – almost 5 % of GDP – and particularly large in relation tothe United State’s limited foreign trade. In my opinion, American analysts who in general have a veryoptimistic view of a very short downturn underrate these risks.What effect will the American economy have on the Swedish economy? The question is also whateffect developments in the American economy will have. If you look just at the effects on trade flows,the effect on Europe and Sweden is not so strong. Exports to the United States only account for a bitmore than 2 per cent of our GDP and the American market has about the same importance for theeuro area. In addition, we are affected by demand for Swedish goods from other countries reducingwhen their export to the United States drops. Moreover, some international companies with activities inthe United States can affect household wealth in Europe as well through share prices –this applies notleast to Sweden. Our “Swedish” companies are very international (Ericsson, Electrolux, Stora-Enso,Volvo, Atlas Copco, Skanska) at the same time as a large part of Swedish households’ shareholding isinvested there.What conclusions should we draw then for the Swedish economy?I would like to begin by reminding that the Swedish economy is better equipped than for a very longtime as regards the underlying climate for growth. We have sound and stable public finances. Wehave paid off our foreign debt after a number of years with a current account surplus. Inflationexpectations are stable and unemployment has been considerably reduced (see Diagram 2).Deregulations have also led to increased competition in many areas. The labour market also seems tooperate more flexibly than before.Financial savings in differentsectors in US, per cent of GDP-8,0%-6,0%-4,0%-2,0%0,0%2,0%4,0%6,0%8,0%Private sectorPublic sectorCurrent account
BIS Review ??/20015And it is considered that there is considerable potential for growth with regard to making use of ITdevelopment. This is perhaps more true for Sweden than for the US economy. In the IT sphere,Sweden is a long way forward although to date development has not affected productivity in the wholeof the business sector to the same extent as in the United States. Neither have we seen such a stronggrowth in investment as in the United States. It will be a while before the new technology isimplemented and used to the full although it will be first then that major benefits for the whole economycan be expected.Many have pointed out that development in the Swedish economy in recent years has resembled thatin the United States although with a time lag. A difference in the assessment of the impact a cyclicaldownturn can have is that Swedish households and companies overall are not indebted to the sameextent as their American counterparts have been in recent years. This is reflected among other thingsin our having had a balance of trade surplus ever since the mid-1990s. The current account in theUnited States has on the contrary been negative throughout the 1990s and it has been the privatesector’s savings deficit that has increased and now totals over 6 per cent of GDP. Swedishhouseholds and businesses have instead had a savings surplus for large parts of the 1990s and it isfirst recently that a deficit has been noted.There are also many other factors that are positive for the Swedish economy in the short term: taxreductions keep household disposable income up and the real hourly wage increases are high.Another factor that counteracts a cyclical downturn is that housing investment is on the increase andwill not be affected in the short term by a dampening of the cycle. It also seems as if the expansion ofbroadband is taking place in an appropriate cyclical situation if the plans are fulfilled. Theseinvestments are also spread throughout the country.However, there is also a risk that uncertainty about the future of the Swedish economy will result inhouseholds reducing consumption. At present, household’s financial savings are insignificant. In thisrespect, the situation is similar to the United States although the problems there are more serious.Uncertainty about the development of the krona remains great, however. There is general agreementthat the krona is fundamentally undervalued – this has contributed to creating the surplus in thecurrent account that has reduced our foreign debt in recent years. When the foreign debt starts toreach levels that are more sustainable in the long run, the krona should be strengthened. There is thusno reason to depart from the Riksbank’s assessment that the krona will appreciate in the long term.However, asset prices and exchange rates are sensitive to changes in expectations. And just now itseems that the krona is being weakened by the focus on the foreign exchange market on the expectedcapital outflows, which will be the result of pension funds being invested abroad. Reduced interest inpurchasing Swedish shares is considered by others to be the explanation why the krona is so weakFinancial savings in differentsectors in Sweden, per cent of GDP-14-12-10-8-6-4-202468198019811982198319841985198619871988198919901991199219931994199519961997199819992000Current accountPrivate sectorPublic sectorPer cent
6BIS Review ??/2001just now. During the years with a floating exchange rate, we have noted short-term fluctuations in theexchange rate do not seem to have any great effect on domestic prices. There is only an effect onprices if businesses believe that changes in the real exchange rate will be of some duration.Competition on markets is also determined moreover by the ability to adjust prices.If export companies decide to reduce their prices in foreign currency, they can win market shares. Thisin itself counteracts the negative effects of the weaker international economic situation. At the sametime, there is a risk that import prices will rise if importers take compensation for the weaker kronaexchange rate. On a market with dampened growth where there is stiff competition, the risk may beless. In this case, the effect of a weaker krona would mainly lead to an increased demand for exports.It is still too early to say anything about the conclusions for monetary policy that can be drawn fromthis reasoning about future cyclical developments. The Riksbank’s overall assessment will be includedin the next inflation report on 27 March. There will then be a clearer basis for assessing whetherresource use is expected to be under such strain that a more stringent policy is required or whetherthe cyclical outlook has weakened so much that stimulation is called for. One thing is clear, however.Downward adjustments of growth assessments mean that the large number of interest rate increasesthat most analysts expected during the spring will hardly be necessary to keep inflation on target!
BIS Review 16/20011Mervyn King: No country is an islandSpeech by Mervyn King, Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, at the Institute of Petroleum AnnualDinner, London, 21 February 2001.*      *      *No country is an island - in terms of economics, if not geography. Trade and capital flows link all theeconomies of the world. Since 1970 the volume of world trade has increased more than five-fold.Globalisation is not a slogan; it is a fact.The economic winds can rapidly alter direction bringing significant changes in the economic weather.What happens in the world economy is of great importance to your industry. But no business in acountry, such as the United Kingdom, which exports and imports almost a third of its national outputeach year, can ignore global economic developments.Recent events have reminded us of just how volatile that economic weather can be. Only a few shortmonths ago, the United States was experiencing rapid economic growth at a rate which surprised usall. The new frontier had become the new economy, and some had forgotten that economic downturnsare a regular feature of a market economy. Share prices had reached levels four times that of adecade earlier, and the price earnings ratio of America's top 500 companies was over forty, anunprecedented level. Now, after a swift and sharp fall of business and consumer confidence, thebusiness cycle appears to be alive and well, and living in the United States. Share prices have fallenby around 20% since their peak in March 2000; and technology stock prices have fallen even more, by50%. Forecasts for economic growth in the United States for the coming year are still being reviseddown and are only one half of their levels of a few months ago.Equally, only a few months ago, some currency traders were openly deriding the euro. The euroreached a low of 0.82 to the dollar - the lowest level for the euro or its antecedents for over 15 years.Since then, however, the euro has recovered, and the euro economy itself appears to be relativelystable. In the other major industrialised part of the world economy, Japan, output has barely risen inrecent years. Real GDP in Japan has grown by only just over 1% a year over the past decade,compared with over 4% a year over the previous ten years.Unexpected changes in the economic weather have also had a significant impact on the oil market. Oilprices rose from below $10 a barrel (for Brent crude) in December 1998 to a recent peak of over $37last September, falling back to around $22 in December only to rise again to around $30 a barrel. Thestandard deviation of daily changes in oil prices rose by a factor of three from the first half of 1999 tothe second half of last year: an indication of just how much volatility has risen.Moreover, volatility has not been confined to the industrialised world. The past five years have seen anumber of damaging financial crises that have afflicted emerging market economies. Sudden reversalsof short-term capital flows to some of those economies resulted in crises that led not only to deeprecessions and sometimes political crises, but also a renewed debate about the role of the IMF inproviding bailouts to some of these countries.Despite this volatility in international economic conditions the British economy, to date, hasexperienced greater stability. At first sight, this is encouraging. The UK has weathered some of therecent international economic storms, and achieved a post-war record of uninterrupted economicgrowth, falling unemployment, and inflation lower and more stable than for a generation. But no twostorms are ever the same. Do the clouds on the international economic horizon threaten our economicstability at home? We cannot know. Rest assured that the Monetary Policy Committee will always actto maintain stability by keeping inflation on track to meet the target of 2½%. But the recent stability ofinflation owes a good deal to the fact that economic shocks from overseas have tended to offset ratherthan reinforce each other. It would be rash to assume that it will be at all easy to keep inflation over thenext five years within the 2%-3% range within which it has largely moved over the past five years.What matters most, however, is that any such deviations from target are short-lived, and that inflationexpectations generally are firmly anchored on the target. If we cannot ensure that the waters are calm,we can at least steer a steady course.
2BIS Review 16/2001I want tonight to look more closely at two clouds on the international economic horizon. First, the USslowdown and its consequences for the rest of us; and second, the risk of further financial crises inemerging market economies.Central bankers are good at finding clouds. We know that one is attached to every silver lining. Andeven on passing through the gates of heaven, a central banker would probably argue for greaterstructural reform while declaring the situation "not wholly unsatisfactory". But the two clouds aremoving towards us. So let us examine them.The outlook for the world economy has deteriorated markedly in recent months as a result of thesudden slowdown in the United States and signs of renewed stagnation in Japan. The speed of thedeterioration was a surprise, but not the fact of a slowdown. Last year saw the fastest growth rate ofthe world economy for twelve years. Growth in the US reached an annual rate of 6% in the secondquarter of last year, well above even optimistic estimates of sustainable growth rates. A slowdown wasnot only inevitable; it was desirable.The main surprise in the US was the sharp and sudden break in both business and consumerconfidence. US manufacturers' optimism is now almost as low as it was in 1991 - the last time the USeconomy experienced a recession. Consumer confidence also fell sharply in January, driven bymarked pessimism over the short-term future. Quite why this break in confidence should have been sorapid is not easy to understand. And its origins will largely determine the nature of the US downturn.On the one hand, greater use of information technology to economise on inventories may have led toshorter lags between changes in final demand and changes in output. If so, then it is possible that thespeed of the downturn will be matched by the speed of the recovery, leading to a short-lived episodeof output growth close to zero as the result of an inventory correction. On the other hand, theslowdown could be much more protracted if the imbalances in the US economy which have built up inrecent years start to unwind, leading to a reduction in spending as both households and businessesseek to reduce the amount of outstanding debt on their balance sheets.The key to the nature of the US downturn is what will happen to productivity growth. Over the past fiveyears there has been accumulating evidence that the application of information technology has raisedproductivity growth in the US economy - the "new economy". Expectations of higher productivitygrowth increased demand by more than it raised supply initially, as firms invested in new technologyand households anticipated higher future incomes. As a result, spending grew rapidly, outstrippingsupply and large imbalances emerged. The current account deficit in the US is now close to 5% ofGDP, a post-war record. It is sustainable as long as foreigners are prepared to finance it. So far, theprofitability of new investment opportunities in the US has attracted capital inflows to finance higherinvestment, which in turn has led to a strong dollar. If expectations about higher productivity growthprove well-founded, then US businesses and families will gradually repay the debts they haveincurred, and the current account deficit will subside, with an adjustment of the dollar accordingly.Although the imbalances will unwind, they will do so slowly, allowing the US economy to recover fromits present slowdown. But if there were to be a reappraisal of the extent to which productivity growthhad increased, then a more sudden downward adjustment to spending could result. In suchcircumstances, the imbalances would unwind more rapidly, leading to adjustments in asset prices,both in stock markets and exchange rates. That would imply a much bumpier ride for both the UnitedStates and the world economy in the months ahead.Clearly, there have been some downward adjustments to stock prices in the US over the past year.But their scale has been limited, and there does, at least so far, appear to be no significant reappraisalof the impact of new technology on US productivity growth. Although it is not easy to reconcile therecent sharp falls in confidence in the US and the relative stability of stock market prices, it wouldappear that investors generally have taken comfort from the Federal Reserve's ability and willingnessto react to the latest data, and take appropriate action.The second cloud on the horizon is the risk to emerging market economies posed by the US slowdownand the unwinding of imbalances in the industrialised world. In some emerging markets, especiallythose in East Asia exporting high technology products to the United States, the immediate outlook isfor weaker economic growth. But for other countries, especially in Latin America, the fall in US interestrates and in the dollar against the euro will mitigate the direct loss of export demand.But the major concern is to avoid another financial crisis, of which there have been too many in thepast five years. From Mexico in 1995, through the Asian crisis in 1997 and Brazil in 1999, and, morerecently in Argentina and Turkey, sudden reversals of short-term capital flows have created financialcrises. In many cases, these crises have proved devastating to the citizens of the countries affected.
BIS Review 16/20013The existence of deep and liquid international capital markets offers opportunities for greater riskdiversification by both borrowers and lenders. But it also increases the risk of contagion from onecountry to another affected by an outflow of short-term debt finance.There remains an urgent need for the international financial community to raise its game in bothpreventing and resolving such crises. On prevention, much has been achieved, built around theoverriding principle of transparency. In itself, transparency will not prevent financial crises. But it canhelp reduce the frequency of crises - by alerting both markets and policy makers to problems on thehorizon - and their severity - by minimising the surprises about the scale of any liquidity problems. Onthe resolution of crises, the past year has seen a significant change in practice with more weight givento the involvement of private sector creditors. The key to progress is the recognition that officialfinance from the IMF is strictly limited. Large bailouts from the IMF are undesirable - partly becausethey reduce the incentive for private sector investors to appraise carefully the risks they take, andpartly because the funds available to the IMF are wholly inadequate for it to play the role of aninternational lender of last resort. Once it is recognised that official finance is limited, then it is clearthat countries need to work closely with their own private sector creditors. Debt obligations must behonoured, although in some circumstances it may be necessary to restructure those obligations. Therelationship between debtor countries and their private sector creditors is one that must be nurtured atall stages. And many emerging market economies have provided excellent examples of goodrelationships with their creditors, thus enabling them to raise new money or lengthen debt maturities attimes of stress. The choice is not between large bailouts and no official finance. It is between anorderly framework, which recognises the complementary roles of private and official finance, and adisorderly process of default.The combination of transparency to prevent crises and private sector involvement to resolve crises,follows naturally from the view that markets require information to work efficiently but that investorsshould take responsibility for the risks they choose to bear. This sentiment is remarkably close toviews expressed recently by the new US Treasury Secretary. Now is the time to put in place a moresystematic framework for the prevention and resolution of financial crises so that emerging marketeconomies can take their rightful place in the international economy.What do these clouds mean for the UK economy? Fortunately, our own imbalances are on a muchsmaller scale than those in the US. But here too, final domestic demand growth, which has averaged4% a year for four years, has exceeded supply and the trade deficit has risen. Indeed, net trade is nowlikely to have made a negative contribution to output growth for five consecutive years, the longestsuch period since the nineteenth century. Final domestic demand growth, and especially that of privateconsumption, needs to slow. Nevertheless, the differences between recent developments in the UKand the US are more significant than the similarities. Perhaps the most striking difference between theUS and UK economies has been the remarkable resilience of business and consumer confidence inthe UK in recent months. Of course, further weakness of the world economy, emanating perhaps inemerging markets, could change the outlook.Nevertheless, Mr President, I am confident that the British economy can withstand the storms andvicissitudes of the international economic weather. But it is in the interests of all of us to work toensure a prosperous international economy. No country is an island. As John Donne expressed thethought so vividly in his aptly-named Devotions upon Emergent Occasions "all mankind is of oneauthor, and is one volume."
BIS Review 6/20011Sakuya Fujiwara: Policies and Internal Management of the Bank of JapanEnglish translation of a speech by Mr Sakuya Fujiwara, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan, givenat the Japan National Press Club on 31 January 2001.This translation covers the full text of his Japanese speech as far as economic outlook and monetarypolicy are concerned. With respect to the other parts, only summary has been translated.*      *      *Economic OutlookToday, I would like to discuss the current conditions of the Japanese economy and its prospect. At theend of October 2000, the Bank published a five-page document titled "Outlook and Risk Assessmentof the Economy and Prices," which I call the "Outlook Report" to make the title short. The OutlookReport describes our baseline scenario of the economy and assessment of risks. The report ispublished twice a year and, in the case of the October 2000 issue, it covers the most likely scenariofor fiscal years 2000 and 2001. At the Monetary Policy Meetings of the Bank's Policy Board, a numberof board members have used the Outlook Report as a yardstick on which they base their argumentsabout questions such as a) whether the economy is following the baseline scenario or b) whether itsrisk profile has changed. This is well illustrated by the Minutes of the Monetary Policy Meeting ofDecember 2000, which were released last week.The baseline scenario in the Outlook Report of October 2000 can be summarized by the followingthree points. First, moderate economic recovery led by private demand is likely to continue in Japan.Second, strong economic expansion is, however, unlikely to happen because a variety of structuraladjustment pressures persist in Japan, including balance-sheet adjustment and continuingrestructuring in both the financial and non-financial business sectors. Third, economic recovery willcontinue to be led by the corporate sector, while the household sector lags behind.The report points out five downside risks and one upside risk. On the downside: a) IT demand in theglobal market, b) impact of oil price rises, c) international financial market developments, d) impact ofthe balance-sheet adjustment and restructuring in both the financial and non-financial businesssectors, and e) increase in consumers' anxiety for the future, whereas on the upside, a possiblerevision of the expected rate of growth medium term in the corporate sector. Since the report raised agreater number of downside risks and described them on a lot more pages, economists and journalistsseem to have understood that the Bank's views on risks to the baseline scenario was biased towardsthe downside. Although you cannot measure our assessment by simply counting the number of riskfactors mentioned or the number of pages that are consumed for their description, it is perhaps fair tosay that the Bank of Japan was more strongly conscious of downside risks than upside. You may alsobe aware of the fact that the elements that are being discussed now were already consideredseriously at the time when the Outlook Report was released.Allow me to turn to economic developments after the release of the report. While a moderateeconomic recovery continues, its pace is slowing down as is reflected in deceleration of productiongrowth caused by export slowdown and pause in improvement in the business sentiment. As you maybe aware, the Bank of Japan's assessment in its Monthly Report of Recent Economic and FinancialDevelopments became more cautious in December 2000, and again in January 2001. Setting theseeconomic developments against the aforementioned Outlook Report, the majority of the Policy Boardis of the view that the economy has developed in line with the baseline scenario, but, at the sametime, some of the downside risks have become greater, especially those related to the globaleconomy.I would like to explain, first, why we maintain our baseline scenario, i.e., moderate economic recoveryled by private demand mainly in the corporate sector. According to the Tankan survey of December2000, the corporate sector continues to expect a substantial increase in profits and stepping up itsbusiness investment plan for this fiscal year. Machinery orders and other leading indicators alsosuggest that the growth trend in investment is likely to continue, being stimulated by IT businesses. Atthe same time, we need to monitor carefully the impact that a slowdown in production and exportsmight have on the business decision-making with respect to investment for the next fiscal year, for theslowdown is a negative element in the corporate sector, which has led the entire economy to date.
2BIS Review 6/2001Weak as they are, incomes of the household sector have stopped worsening as the supply anddemand conditions in the labor market have begun to improve and wages are increasing year on year,albeit to a small extent. Under these circumstances, some positive signs have been witnessed withrespect to auto sales, electronic sales and tourism, although personal consumption as whole still lacksbuoyancy. All this suggests that despite negative factors like stock price declines, the improvement incorporate profits has gradually been exerting positive influences on the household sector after acertain time lag.In sum, the momentum for recovery continues in the corporate sector as is shown by profits andbusiness investment, and the trend in the household sector are also showing firm movements amidsta quite modest growth. Therefore, we consider the main thrust of the baseline scenario, or moderaterecovery led by private demand, to be maintained.It is true, however, that risks to this baseline scenario are becoming greater. We are now payingparticular attention to two risks: global economic slowdown especially in the United States; instabilityin stock markets both at home and abroad. Let me elaborate on each of these risks.First, US economic slowdown is becoming increasingly evident. US economic growth has significantlyslowed down after it registered rates over 5 percent, well above its potential growth rate until the firsthalf of 2000. Some slowdown is not surprising at all in view of very fast growth in the preceding period.The slowdown may be desirable for sustainable growth as long as it is what is believed to be a "softlanding."However, the pace of slowdown in recent months has been more rapid than anticipated. At least in thefirst half of this year, the US growth rate is likely to stay modest. Although the majority view amongeconomists is the one for recovery towards the second half of the year, it is difficult to envisage thedepth and duration of economic adjustment following the very fast growth in recent years. One goodnews is that there remains significant room for US macroeconomic policy. In this regard, the FederalReserve cut its federal fund rate target by 0.5 percent in its FOMC meeting of January 3, 2001. Iunderstand that this reflects Federal Reserve's determination to keep the economy on a sustainablegrowth path in the long and medium run.These US economic developments could have a significant impact on the global economy, especiallythe Asian economies, which have close trade relations with the United States. In fact, a slowdown inexport growth has been observed in Asia. Under the present circumstances, we have to watch verycarefully the impact of the US slowdown on our economy, examining both direct and indirect channelsof influence, including Asian economies, stock markets, and global capital flows.The second risk we are paying particular attention to is unstable developments in stock markets bothat home and abroad. The most fundamental determinant of stock prices is prospect for corporateprofits, and in this respect, the recent Tankan survey and market analysts' views support a continuedincrease in profits. In spite of this, stock prices dropped in recent months in Japan. This can beattributed in large part to adjustment of IT stock prices in the global market, which has bearings on thefirst risk I mentioned a minute ago.In addition, there is of course a domestic element for consideration. In domestic financial markets,bond yields have declined, and so have stock prices together with the yen's depreciation on theexchange market, the combination of which can be interpreted as a reflection of bearish marketsentiment about the Japanese economy. This market sentiment is much more bearish than theeconomic prospect indicated by corporate profits and other real economic activities. We will thereforehave to examine both economic and financial developments attentively and without preoccupation, inorder to find out whether the market is excessively pessimistic or simply preceding economicfundamentals to come about.It is true that the market' s concerns about structural problems are strong and deep-rooted. Themarket has been reminded of delays in structural reforms in Japan whenever it hears bad newsregarding exogenous events such as US economy or stock markets. This has been repeated anumber of times. Once a decline in stock prices sets in, it might have a negative impact, irrespective ofits proximate cause, on the economy through deterioration in creditworthiness of borrowers as well asrisk-taking capability of financial institutions as a result of declines in unrealized profits from theirequity holdings and/or deterioration in the confidence of both the business and household sectors. Inthis respect, however, no changes have actually been observed in lending attitude of banks or creditavailability for borrowers covered by the Tankan and other business surveys. Neither have beenobserved any deterioration in consumer confidence nor business appetite for fixed investments.
BIS Review 6/20013Nonetheless, because these changes may not necessarily become readily observable, we have toremain vigilant.Monetary policyTo sum up, while the baseline scenario of moderate economic recovery still holds, risk elementsinvolving US economic developments and stock markets are becoming more pronounced. Therefore,on the monetary policy front, we consider it to be appropriate to maintain the accommodative stance tosupport the ongoing recovery. Under these circumstances, we intend to examine closely how such riskelements will influence the Japanese economy.At the Monetary Policy Meeting of January 19, 2001, Chairman of the Policy Board, Governor Hayamiissued instructions to the Bank's staff: the staff will examine possible rooms for further improvementsin the way of liquidity provision to the market, with a view to ensuring the smooth functioning andstability of the financial market, and report the results to the Policy Board by the next Monetary PolicyMeeting. This is aimed at maximizing the effect of our accommodative monetary policy. Since we haveyet to explore, I should refrain from making comments on specific measures. Instead, I would like todiscuss here my approach to this question.First of all, we are exploring whether there is no further room for improving the way in which the Bankof Japan provides the market with liquidity under the current directive of money market operations, i.e.,encouraging the overnight call rate to move around 0.25 percent. As long as the market functionsproperly, this directive can be achieved without problems by using existing operational instruments,and monetary ease will be channeled through financial markets and the financial system to permeateinto other markets and corporate finance.However, this mechanism seizes up at a time of market disruptions or dysfunctioning of financialintermediation. For instance, there was a temporary deficiency in corporate financing in autumn 1998,when low interest rates prevailed in the interbank money market. With a view to supporting corporatefund raising, the Bank of Japan adopted several measures, e.g., increase in CP operations andcreation of a temporary lending program.Take a Y2K episode for another example. This happened at the end of 1999, when possible Y2Kcomputer problems overshadowed financial markets. At that time, mounting demand for New Yearliquidity put an upward pressure on interest rates of the contracts maturing beyond the year-end,although there was a widespread perception that the overnight call rate would likely be near-zero forsome time under the zero interest rate policy. The Bank of Japan tried to stabilize the market byannouncing its intention to provide ample fund maturing beyond the year-end in a flexible manner, andin addition, by enhancing its operational capacity through an introduction of new instruments, e.g.,outright purchases and sales of short-term government securities.These episodes clearly demonstrate that decisions of the overnight call rate guidance level is at timesinsufficient for monetary ease to permeate the economy, because the effectiveness of monetary policyvaries, depending on the conditions of financial markets and financial institutions.In order to avoid any misunderstanding, I should hasten to add that we, at present, see no seizing upin corporate finance or any other particular area, or anomalies in interest rates on contracts maturingbeyond the fiscal year-end. Yet, in view of the greater downside risks that I noted earlier, we cannotrule out the possibility that some negative news might trigger instability in financial markets oruneasiness on the part of market participants about fiscal year-end funding. This consideration led tothe Chairman's instructions to improve the Bank's capacity to provide liquidity so that the currentmonetary ease be maintained even in case of contingencies. I believe that enhanced preparedness onour side will help strengthen confidence among market participants, thereby stabilizing the financialmarket and thus the Japanese economy.Financial System Issues (summary)Let me now turn to financial system issues. Although we still cannot afford to be complacent about thesituation, the amount of non-performing loan charge off by the Japanese banking industry has showna significant decline. In addition, its capital adequacy ratio has improved by raising capital in themarket as well as injection of public funds. At present, we think it unlikely that stability of the Japanesefinancial system will be put at risk. In light of the speed in which circumstances may change both at
4BIS Review 6/2001home and abroad, we should continue to be vigilant with respect to developments in the financialsystem.Organization and Operations of the Bank of Japan (summary)The Bank's operations must be conducted in an efficient manner since its costs are ultimately borneby the public. With the independence in monetary policy established and the autonomy of itsmanagement respected, it has become all the more important for the Bank to make efforts to promotethe efficiency of its business operations and organization. Moreover, because the central bank isunique in the nation, it must always be mindful of self-examination so that "the Bank's commonsense"matches the "commonsense of the society."Article 5 of the new Bank of Japan Law stipulates that the Bank "shall endeavor to conduct itsbusiness in a proper and efficient manner." I would like to emphasize at this juncture that, even two tothree years before the discussion of the revision of the law, reforms had been initiated within the Bankin a variety of ways. Three years have passed since the new law became effective, during whichperiod, the Bank has implemented the most significant restructuring in its own history, which coversthe organizational structure, remunerations for the staff and executives, the number of staff, real-estate holdings, and facilities for staff welfare. All of these are intended to bring the Bank's businessstructure in line with the commonsense of the society. Aiming at further efficiency of businessoperations, we have reviewed our branch and office network and reached a conclusion that we shouldclose branches in Otaru and Kita-Kyushuu. We are currently trying to obtain understanding of thepublic, particularly in the regions concerned.The Bank of Japan will enhance for efficiency uninterruptedly rather than by a one-time reform. Inorder to become a more efficient central bank in the 21st century, we would like to make initiative inreviewing and re-examining the Bank's organization.
BIS Review 15/20011David Dodge: The Bank of Canada and monetary policy: future directionsRemarks by Mr David Dodge, Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the Toronto Board of Trade,Toronto, Ontario, 20 February 2001.*      *      *It's a pleasure to be here today, in my home town of Toronto, for my first public speech as Governor ofthe Bank of Canada. And I am particularly pleased to be speaking to the Board of Trade. One of mygreat delights as a boy was when my father would bring me to the dining room of the Old Board ofTrade for lunch in June, if I had done well in school that year! That was my first contact with theToronto business and financial community—a valuable contact that I have sought to maintain over theyears. And it is a contact that I hope to strengthen while I am at the Bank of Canada.The Bank is well respected both inside and outside Canada for the quality of its professionals and thework that it does. I am honoured to join it and to lead it over the next seven years. My task will be toensure that we build on the Bank's record to date and that we strengthen and deepen the progressmade so far in fulfilling our responsibilities to Canadians.There are three main issues I want to address publicly as I begin my term: the Bank's contribution togood economic performance; the Bank's contribution to promoting financial stability, both nationallyand internationally; and the importance of open and frank dialogue with business, labour, and thegeneral public.Today, I would like to focus my comments on the first and the third of those issues. I hope to addressfinancial stability as part of my next public speech. And I will conclude with a few remarks on thecurrent economic situation.The Bank's contribution to good economic performanceAs the country's central bank, the Bank of Canada has a commitment to contribute to the economicwell-being of Canadians. Fundamentally, this means that we must conduct monetary policy so as topromote sustained economic growth, create conditions conducive to rising investment, employment,and incomes, and encourage a more stable macroeconomic environment. How can the Bank ofCanada foster such an outcome?...low, stable, and predictable inflationThe best contribution that the Bank can make to good economic performance is to preserveconfidence in the future value of money. In practical terms, this means that Canadians should not haveto worry about the effects of inflation when they make everyday decisions as consumers, businesspeople, savers, and investors. It means that they should be able to go about their affairs confidently,knowing that they can count on their central bank to do whatever is necessary to keep future inflationlow, stable, and predictable. In this way, they will be able to make sounder economic decisions, whichwill lead to better overall economic performance and rising incomes.Over the past several years, the Canadian economy has experienced low and stable inflation and astrong rate of expansion. Moreover, economic activity has been less variable than in the 1970s and1980s, even though we had to face some important economic shocks, such as the Mexican and theAsian crises. Employment and personal incomes have risen, and business investment in machinery,equipment, and new technology has increased very substantially, particularly since 1996. At the sametime, low inflation has encouraged Canadian businesses to operate more efficiently and to focus oncost control and productivity improvements.That is quite a change from our experience in the 1970s and 1980s. That experience amplydemonstrated what a terrible price the economy and the people pay for high, unstable, andunpredictable inflation. I am thinking here of the increased uncertainty about the future, the distortionof vital signals and information that people rely on to make important decisions, the ups and downs in
2BIS Review 15/2001output and employment, and the waste of valuable economic resources as they are diverted fromproductive investments to speculative activities.All of this should be enough to strengthen our collective resolve not to let inflation break out again.And it convinces me that the focus of Canadian monetary policy since the early 1990s on low andpredictable inflation as an essential building block of a productive, well-functioning economy has beenexactly right.While low inflation is a necessary condition for good economic performance, it is not sufficient by itself.Other factors are also crucial. Clearly, it is very important that we all continue to work to improve thestructure of our economy and the skills of our labour force, and to ensure that our product and labourmarkets operate efficiently. It is also critical that over the next decade all levels of governmentcontinue to focus on reducing their net indebtedness to lessen Canada's vulnerability to externalshocks and to prepare for the pressures we will face with the projected decline in our working-agepopulation.Canada's monetary policy approach: inflation-control targets and a flexible exchange rateLet me now turn to the role of the inflation-control targets and the floating exchange rate in Canadianmonetary policy.Explicit inflation-control targets were jointly introduced by the Bank and the Government of Canada in1991. Since 1995, the target has been to hold the trend of inflation inside a range of 1 to 3 per cent,with a focus on the midpoint of 2 per cent.Inflation targets provide an anchor for policy and an anchor for people's inflation expectations. Theysupply the Bank with an effective mechanism for assessing and dealing with demand pressures in theeconomy in a way that reduces fluctuations in output. Here's how this ‘stabilizer' feature of the targetsworks—bearing in mind that monetary policy actions take anywhere from one to two years to havetheir full effects on the economy and prices. If total demand was pressing on the economy's capacityto produce, so that the future trend of inflation looked likely to move towards the top of the targetrange, the Bank would tighten in order to reduce demand and inflation pressures. Equally importantly,in a symmetric fashion, if demand was weak and inflation looked likely to move towards the bottom ofthe range, the Bank would ease, providing more room for the economy to expand to its productionpotential.Moreover, the focus on inflation control can help the Bank to gauge where the economy's capacity toproduce really is, especially after periods of widespread restructuring that may have raised capacityabove the levels estimated on the basis of past experience. By comparing actual inflation relative towhat the Bank expected, we can draw inferences about the limits of capacity, which is important insetting monetary policy.The basic point here is that the focus on inflation control and the clarity of the targets provide the Bankwith an effective mechanism for guiding monetary policy in a way that reduces output volatility andhelps to assess the economy's production potential.What about the exchange rate, how does it fit in all this? If the inflation targets are the anchor of ourmonetary policy, we need a flexible exchange rate. That much is clear. But in addition, a floatingexchange rate allows the economy to adjust to economic disturbances, including fluctuations inexternal demand for our products. A classic example of this is a sharp movement in the relative priceof our exports compared with our imports. In cases like this, movements in the relative value of theCanadian dollar help our economy to adjust more quickly than if the exchange rate did not move. Andwhen the currency does move in response to shocks, the inflation target serves to anchor expectationsabout its value, thus facilitating the adjustment process.All this is to say that, in my view, inflation-control targets and a flexible exchange rate have workedwell and continue to make sense for Canada in the foreseeable future.Openness, transparency, and public communicationsSo far, I have explained why I consider an ongoing commitment by the Bank to low and predictableinflation to be of paramount importance to sustained strong economic performance in Canada. I have
BIS Review 15/20013also outlined why I think that the Bank should continue to pursue the objective of low inflation withinthe current framework of inflation targets supported by a floating exchange rate.All this is fine, you may say, but how will the Bank ensure that it continues to deliver a credible,effective monetary policy?In a world subject to all kinds of shocks, and with financial markets increasingly more open andglobalized, there are no guarantees that monetary policy will be successful at all times and under allcircumstances. Still, it helps if those who are affected by policy decisions — the financial markets andthe general public — understand what their central bank is doing, and why.Put another way, central bank actions will likely be more successful if they are better understood andmore predictable. Financial markets will then likely respond more effectively, and indeed anticipate,monetary policy actions. And the general public will be better able to take monetary policy into accountwhen making plans for the future. Transparency actually leads to better policy outcomes.In Canada, the move towards greater openness, transparency, and accountability in monetary policyreceived a big boost with the adoption of the inflation targets in 1991. The targets established a clearobjective for monetary policy. And they set a precise yardstick for measuring the Bank of Canada'ssuccess in meeting that objective. The Bank's explicit inflation target and our commitment to achievingit, have provided strong incentives for us to be as candid as possible about the external and domesticdevelopments that are likely to influence inflation and the ability of monetary policy to respond to them.Under the stewardship of my predecessor, Governor Thiessen, who placed particular emphasis onencouraging greater openness and more effective two-way communications, the Bank made importantstrides in this area. Today, we provide large amounts of data and commentary on monetary policy inour regular publications and on our Web site. We also discuss the outlook for the economy, inflation,and monetary policy in the Monetary Policy Report, the Updates to the Monetary Policy Report, and inspeeches by Bank officials. Our latest initiative to improve public understanding of the Bank's actionsis the adoption of a system of fixed dates for the announcement of decisions on the Bank Rate. Thepress release that we issue on each of these dates gives our latest assessment of the economy andthe rationale for changing or not changing the Bank Rate.Communication, however, goes both ways. The Bank also needs to understand what is happening inthe markets and in all key sectors of the economy and across the regions. We need your input, yourinformation, and your views. We can only formulate good policy if we are good listeners. So Iencourage you to talk to us. The phone lines and doors at our regional offices, here in Toronto andacross the country, are open.Recent economic developmentsConstructive two-way communication is particularly critical in times of increased uncertainty about thefuture. So let me now say a few words about how the Bank views the current economic situation.The Canadian economy began 2001 from a strong base—expanding by an estimated 5 per cent, onaverage, in 2000 and with solid growth continuing right through the second half of last year despite theslowdown of the U.S. economy.In our last Update to the Monetary Policy Report, which was prepared on 23 January and released on6 February, we revised down our projection for economic growth in Canada this year to about3 per cent, primarily because of the more abrupt weakening of U.S. economic activity. That projectionassumed that the U.S. economy would expand by 2 to 2.5 per cent, on average, in 2001, with a weakfirst half followed by a relatively strong rebound in the second half.When we released the Update on 6 February, we pointed out that, on the basis of accumulatingevidence, it appeared that U.S. economic activity in the first half of the year would be weaker than wehad projected on 23 January, even though we still expected a reasonable rebound in the second halfof the year. We noted that this posed some near-term risks for the Canadian economic outlook.But, as we also pointed out then, despite the near-term uncertainties, the Bank remains generallypositive about Canada's economic prospects for the year, given productivity increases and risingdisposable incomes aided by tax cuts that are working to sustain domestic demand growth.Of course, there are some sectors and regions of the country that will feel the effects of the U.S.slowdown more than others, for example, those with heavier concentration in the production of cars
4BIS Review 15/2001and equipment, notably equipment related to communications and information technology. Offsettingthose, there will be generally solid growth in construction and services, and particularly strong growthin energy-related sectors.Canadian and international data that have become available since 6 February have not caused us toalter the views outlined at that time.The Bank will continue to monitor the evolving situation closely, and we will have more to say on thesubject in the press release on our next fixed announcement date, 6 March.Concluding thoughtsLet me now conclude by underscoring my two main messages today.First, low, stable, and predictable inflation is the best contribution that monetary policy and the Bankcan make to a productive, well-functioning economy.Second, effective dialogue between the Bank, the markets, and the general public is vital to thesuccess of monetary policy.On both counts, my colleagues and I are determined to carry forward the Bank's commitment toCanadians.
BIS Review 15/20011David Clementi: Recent developments in securities markets and theimplications for financial stabilitySpeech by David Clementi, Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, to the Euromoney InternationalBond Congress, London, 21 February 2001.*      *      *IntroductionLet me begin by saying how pleased I am to be giving the closing address at this Conference. I know,in previous years, the Governor has done the honours. While he is engaged elsewhere today, I amglad to keep up the association with the Bank. Especially now we have joined the ranks of issuers inthe Euro markets in our own name. If you did not have a chance to subscribe to our euronotes inJanuary, the issue - the 4.5% of 2004 - will reopen in April, July and October. But I have not come toplug our paper.Nor have I come to talk about monetary policy. The minutes of the February meeting, published thismorning, are designed to set out the MPC's considered view as well as the vote itself. On the votingfront, you will find there was a rare outbreak of unanimity in the Committee with a nine to nothing votefor the recent ¼% cut in rates. But there is little on this front that I can add that is not already in theminutes or in the Inflation Report we published last week.I want to talk instead about recent developments in bond markets that impinge on the Bank's role inrelation to financial stability. First I want to talk about credit derivatives and the new markets for thetransfer of credit risk. Second about the revised Basel Accord and what this implies for securities firmsand securities markets. And finally about the implications of the shrinking share of government bondsin issue.The Bank's financial stability roleBut I ought to start by saying something about the Bank's role in relation to financial stability. As mostof you will know, regulatory responsibility for individual UK financial institutions is now consolidated inthe Financial Services Authority. The Bank is no longer a regulator of individual firms but as a centralbank we retain a vital interest in the system as a whole. We are the ultimate provider of liquidity tobanks and markets. This interest is reflected in a formal responsibility for the overall stability of thefinancial system set out in a Memorandum of Understanding between the Treasury, Bank and FSA.Responsibility for the overall stability of the UK financial system as a whole sounds a huge and slightlyfuzzy task. It requires the Central Bank to try to see the wood from the trees - to identify and assesspotential shocks, to understand how risk is distributed within the system, and to look for interlinkagesthat might cause a problem in one institution or market to spread and trigger wider difficulties. Giventhe importance of London as an international financial centre, for a full assessment of UK financialstability, we must look beyond this country. So we also have to take a close interest in developmentsin overseas and international financial markets. The international bond market is of course a keyexample. We try to analyse the information in market prices and other data. But the real understandingof the latest developments comes from talking to market participants.Credit risk transfer marketsThis is particularly important when it comes to financial innovation. In recent years, instruments andmarkets for the transfer of credit risk have been a particular focus of change. New ways have beenfound to securitise cashflows which could not previously be traded, to unbundle the credit risk fromloans and bonds, and to re-bundle credit exposures in different ways to create securities with differentpay-offs.
2BIS Review 15/2001The distinction between a loan and a bond is becoming increasingly blurred. Individual loans are soldinto the secondary loan market, although some companies remain reluctant to see their debt traded inthis way. And portfolios of loans and other cash flows, ranging from mortgage payments to recordingroyalties, are sold to special purpose vehicles for securitisation into tranches with different riskcharacteristics and maturities, from AAA to junk, and from commercial paper to long-term bonds.Portfolios of bonds are also repackaged, sliced and diced in a similar way to create collateralised bondobligations.The new area of growth at present, however, is not in these sales of assets to remove them from thebalance sheet. Rather it is in the use of credit derivatives that leave the underlying asset on thebalance sheet but transfer some or all of the credit risk. The market in credit default swaps onindividual investment-grade corporate and country issuers is becoming more liquid, in some cases, wehave been told, more liquid than the underlying bond market. And investment banks pricing new bondissues can increasingly look to credit default swap premia as well as to the spread over the relevantbenchmark on any existing debt. Increasingly, also, banks use derivatives to transfer some portion ofthe credit risk on a loan portfolio rather than selling the portfolio outright, creating so-called 'synthetic'collateralised debt obligations. Data on the size of the market are difficult to come by. But a survey bythe British Bankers' Association last year found that outstanding notional principal of all creditderivatives had increased more than three times since 1997 to around $600 billion. Some contactssuggest the market may now be even larger than this. But I think it safe to conclude that it is alreadylarge and has been growing quickly.In a wider sense, the development of these markets for the transfer of credit risk is highly desirable.The institution best placed to originate a loan is not necessarily best placed to bear the risk. Markets incredit risk allow financial institutions to diversify their exposures across different sectors andgeographic regions while maintaining customer relationships. Just as important, prices from liquidmarkets are valuable information, which can help market participants to allocate resources andmanage risk more efficiently. If they work well, markets in credit risk transfer have the potential toenhance financial stability and efficiency by ensuring that exposures to shocks are diffused throughoutthe system, with no single player excessively exposed.Unfortunately, however, where there is innovation, there are generally questions and I have three. Myfirst is a concern about lack of transparency. These markets mean that a bank need no longer remainexposed to its main customers but can rapidly take on large exposures to other credits without anynew borrowing by the underlying entities. This could make it more difficult for creditors, shareholdersand regulators to assess risk. From the point of view of financial stability, the concern is that theseinstruments might equally be used to concentrate risk as to disperse it. Careful monitoring andmanagement of counterparty risk exposures by firms is an important market mechanism to limit thisrisk. But any individual firm does not know how much total exposure a counterparty has to a particularcredit through its transactions with other market participants. These concerns underline the importanceof the disclosure elements of the new Basel proposals intended to promote market discipline - I havemore to say on the Basel package in a moment.And if disclosure is an issue at the level of individual firms, you can imagine that in aggregate, for thefinancial system as a whole, the gaps in the data can be large. It is a major challenge for theauthorities to keep pace with financial innovation in the collection of financial statistics. The AsianCrisis revealed the importance of derivatives exposures in assessing a country's financial position butthese were not included in BIS statistics on cross-border lending, even though derivatives had been acommon feature of financial markets for at least fifteen years.My second question is a concern that some participants in this market may not fully understand, ormay have differing understandings of, the transactions into which they have entered; and thatuncertainties may remain about how the courts in some countries would treat these agreements. Thisis always an issue in new markets, until market standards and legal precedents are clear. But someaspects of the credit transfer market make it particularly relevant. Purchasers of asset-backedsecurities and creditors of firms that securitise assets need to take care to assure themselves that thistransfer is legally robust - a true sale. An unexpected consolidation of the assets of a securitisationvehicle with those of the original lender could lead to potential losses for either party. Lawyers do, ofcourse, pay great attention to this issue and I am neither questioning their opinions nor suggesting thatthis is necessarily a problem. But transactions differ and investors must do their own due diligence. Ido think that there is too great a tendency to rely unthinkingly on the rating agencies in this area.
BIS Review 15/20013Regulators have signalled their intent in this area in the new Basel Consultative package. Not only willbanks need to demonstrate a clean break to earn a reduction in their capital requirements, but they willalso need to consider the operational and reputational risks involved in securitisations and derivativedeals.My third question is whether we collectively yet have a proper understanding of the way the credittransfer business is bridging the lending, securities and insurance markets. Contracts in banking, onthe one hand, and insurance markets, on the other, are in some respects different animals. Insecurities markets, timing of payments is of the essence. An insurance contract, by contrast, is nottypically a commitment to timely payment. If insurance companies are participating in this market, inpart using reinsurance-type agreements and in part using derivative agreements, there may beimperfect hedges or liquidity risks.The relationship a borrower has with its lending banks has also traditionally been different to that withits bondholders. Any problems the borrower may have in servicing the debt are typically addressed indifferent ways by lenders and bondholders. This problem has surfaced recently with the debate aboutwhether restructuring should be included within the definition of a credit event. ISDA is addressing thequestion and it is clearly desirable that a market standard agreement and set of defnitions shouldexist. I do think, though, that it is intrinsically more difficult to standardise the definition of a credit eventcompared to that of a price or interest rate - the underlying for most other derivative products - wheredata can be taken off screens or lifted from the pages of the FT.Market participants will therefore have to pay even greater attention to documentation - reviewing newand existing transactions regularly to see whether changes in market practice might leave them withimperfect hedges or basis risks. The 1999 ISDA standard documentation was a great advance. Butfirms will need to review carefully transactions into which they entered prior to 1999; and, of course,documentation is valid only if both parties have signed the agreement and confirmations have beenexchanged. It is not a happy position if back and middle offices are struggling to keep up with traders,in particular to deal with unsigned master agreements or backlogs of confirmations.Basel proposalsI have mentioned the new consultative package from the Basel Committee a couple of times. TheBank is of course a member of the Basel Committee, alongside the FSA, and we are keen to hearviews from the market on the proposals. As the second theme of my address today, I would like todiscuss the possible impact of the revised Accord on securities markets and capital flows.While the Basel Accord ostensibly applies only to international banks, directly and indirectly it will havea significant impact on securities firms. Indirectly, in the same way that the change in banks' behaviourin response to the original Basel Accord had a profound effect in shaping developments in securitiesmarkets in the last decade. Directly to the extent that EU investment firms, under the CapitalAdequacy Directive, are subject to the same capital requirements as banks.One of the principal goals of the new Basel framework is, of course, greater risk sensitivity. The lack ofsensitivity of the existing Accord has been one of the drivers of increased capital market activity: boththrough disintermediation, as companies have accessed the capital markets for funding directlyinstead of relatively more expensive bank loans, and through securitisation, as banks themselves havesought to continue originating credit but not incur the capital costs of holding it on their balance sheet.The new Basel proposals to the extent they succeed in aligning capital more closely with theunderlying risk, will we hope significantly reduce incentives for pure regulatory arbitrage.While the original Accord created an incentive to securitise or, by other means, move exposures offbalance sheet, it is too simplistic to assume that adoption of the new proposals will result in a swingback to more traditional bank lending. The wider use of internal ratings, coupled with greatertransparency regarding their compilation and some assurance of quality control by the regulators, mayin fact contribute to further 'commoditisation' of bank loans. It is conceivable that this developmentcould reduce the cost of due diligence on loan portfolios by rating agencies and buyers. And, in turn, itcould mean a reduction in the costs of risk transfer through securitisation or credit derivatives, withbeneficial effects on banks' balance sheets and liquidity.However for this to happen, banks' internal ratings will need to carry credibility in the market and, forthis, transparency is essential. The transparency proposals from the Basel Committee have comeunder a certain amount of fire for their volume and detail. But I would like the critics to dwell for a
4BIS Review 15/2001moment on the alternative: a world in which banks effectively set their own capital, with no assuranceof consistency or comparability from one bank to another. This is an important debate and we arekeen to listen to others' views before the proposals are finalised.Turning to the possible effect of Basel on capital flows more generally, including bank lending,undoubtedly the new risk sensitivity will tend towards changing conditions for certain borrowers andissuers. This is particularly marked in the sovereign context, where, based on current ratings,approximately twenty seven sovereign borrowers will incur a lower bank capital charge versus elevenincurring a higher one. Again I would stress that the cushion of capital which most banks maintain overand above their regulatory minimum will blur the impact of the Basel changes, since in thesecircumstances banks' lending and pricing decisions will not be constrained by the regulatory standard.However, in some sense the Basel proposals will have failed in their purpose unless the pricing ofbank credit better reflects the riskiness of borrowers. By removing perverse incentives for banks, wealso wish to establish better incentives for borrowers.Greater risk sensitivity does, however, carry with it a possible danger, and that is the introduction ofpotential 'procyclicality' into the capital framework. I have touched on this concern more than once inthe past, and make no apology for doing so again. To counteract this danger, regulators should notallow banks' internal ratings to reflect the optimistic prospects of borrowers during an economicupswing: rather, ratings need to be genuinely forward-looking, and to factor in borrowers' likelyperformance during economic stress. Long runs of performance records will be invaluable inestablishing how robust borrowers are to different economic circumstances. In this way, economicdownturns when they come should not prove too much of a shock to the ratings scales.Of course, I do not wish to sound complacent regarding the avoidance of 'procyclicality'. Capital isafter all meant to be a cushion against volatility, also referred to as 'unexpected' loss, but measuringthe unexpected is something of an oxymoron. Some of our researchers at the Bank of Englandrecently reviewed the usefulness of various predictive models of banking problems, but unfortunatelyour conclusion at the moment is that banking crises are each unique in its own way. In the area offinancial stability at least, there appears to be some merit in Sam Goldwyn's admonition that oneshould 'never make forecasts, particularly about the future'. So whilst we may be able to ensure thatthe banking system is protected against the normal ups and downs of a developed economy, moreextreme events will continue to require tailored solutions.Changing composition of bond marketsI have speculated on the possible long-term effect of the new Basel framework on securities markets. Iwant briefly to touch on a third topic and that is the significant change that the markets seem likely toface in the composition of the bonds being issued. A recent BIS report on trends in collateral inwholesale financial markets shows that the share of US government bonds within the dollar bondmarkets decreased from over 44% to under 29% between March 1994 and September 2000, with theincrease mainly in bonds issued by financial institutions and government sponsored agencies.Worldwide, the share of government bonds decline from 53% to under 45%. Of the G10 countries,only in Japan is the share of government bonds on the increase. In the US, the Congressional BudgetOffice recently projected that the government debt might be repaid as early as 2006.From a macro-economic perspective, sound government finances are clearly desirable. Smallergovernment borrowing requirements can also encourage private sector issuance or "crowding in" torevert to the terminology of a similar debate from the early 1980s.For financial markets, however, shrinking government bond markets have a number of potentialimplications that could be relevant to financial stability.First, government bond markets have tended to be more volatile in recent years. Volatility makesgovernment bonds less reliable as a hedge and as a benchmark for pricing, and market participantshave been exploring other instruments, such as swaps and securities issued by public sectoragencies. Indeed, US, European and prospectively Japanese agencies are playing an increasinglyimportant role in the bond markets, with for example, Freddie Mac's €2 billion annual debt programmein Europe and European agencies such as KfW also bidding to position their issues as substitutes forgovernment debt. Given this trend, the Bank continues to follow closely the debate in the US over thecredit status of the US federal agencies, which are not in fact government-guaranteed.
BIS Review 15/20015A second issue is that the growth of private sector debt relative to government debt puts a greaterpremium on credit risk management. This of course brings us back full circle to my earlier remarksabout credit transfer markets. More generally, though, bond investing seems likely to be a higher riskand higher return business than before. The growth of a European high yield market over the past fewyears and the fall in prices of many of those issues in the second half of last year, mean many of youwill need no reminding of this.Finally, a reduced supply of government bonds could have important implications for collateralmarkets, in which they currently play a key role. Wider use of non-government securities as collateralcould have the result that a flight to quality in a crisis might leave lenders exposed to credit risk, orborrowers to liquidity risk as they try to meet margin calls. Larger haircuts can address this risk in part.More generally, wider use of exposure netting through well-managed and prudently designed centralcounterparties may be desirable in future.ConclusionI think it is too early to judge how material these issues will become or whether private sector solutionscould emerge. Bringing together my themes, however, it is clear that credit risk management willbecome an even more important issue for the securities markets. Your challenge will be to understandand manage these risks prudently and profitably. Our challenge, at the Bank of England, will be tofollow market developments closely as part of our financial stability role.
BIS Review 14/20011Tharman Shanmugaratnam: Regulating the capital markets: making marketdiscipline workSpeech by Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Deputy Managing Director of the Monetary Authority ofSingapore at the StanChart-Reuters-Business Times Investment Awards ceremony, Singapore,16 Feb 2001*   *   *The capital markets are undergoing a sea change. Technology and the Internet have opened newchannels for investors to access a wide range of investment information and to transact in securities,often without advice or assistance from market intermediaries. Market intermediaries themselves areconsolidating, and exploring new business models to capture clients and add value to their decisions.It is a more competitive environment all round, and the margins from traditional financial intermediationhave thinned.Regulators are having to rethink their approaches towards the oversight of the markets in this new andrapidly changing environment. The objectives have not changed to preserve confidence bymaintaining fair, transparent and efficient markets, and to minimise the risk of disruptions that threatenthe stability of the system. But the methods of achieving these objectives are being refashioned. It isno longer possible for the regulator to root out all that is evil, dangerous or vaguely suspicious beforethey get to the market. Greater emphasis is therefore being placed on discipline being exercised withinthe market, and by the market.Making market discipline workWe have embarked over the last three years on a shift in our approach to regulating the markets fromwhat is loosely called a merit-based regime, under which the regulator judged the appropriateness ofsecurities being made available to the public, toward to a market-driven, disclosure-based regime ofregulation. It is aimed at allowing market participants greater choice and the free play to takecalculated risks. We have made it clear that the shift in approach will not compromise our reputationinternationally as one of the most open, transparent and well-regulated markets in Asia. Market-basedregulation will indeed raise standards of business conduct, as is necessary for a more open,competitive and innovative market environment.Market discipline will not simply be a matter of 'caveat emptor'. The buyer cannot be expected tobeware if he is not provided with accurate and accessible information so as to make a reasonablejudgement of prospective risks and returns. Neither can he do so if the market is rigged without hisknowledge. It follows that market discipline requires a system of laws, rules and standards todiscriminate in favour of companies with high standards of corporate governance and disclosure, andto exact penalties on those who manipulate the market.Making market discipline work is therefore the responsibility of all participants in the system.Let me briefly outline some of these roles:• The MAS, as the statutory regulator, will monitor compliance with the laws and regulationsthat govern the integrity of the markets, seek enforcement of the laws, and proposeamendments in order to keep them relevant in a changing market environment. We haveundertaken a substantial review of our securities laws in the last year. Insider trading is nowboth a criminal and civil offence, and we have recently proposed to amend the laws tocapture a wider pool of persons who seek to take advantage of inside information. Theproposed new Securities and Futures Act (SFA), to be put to Parliament later this year, willcontain other substantial changes. I will elaborate on one of these, concerning theprospectus registration regime later in the speech.1• The Singapore Exchange (SGX), with its frontline interface with the industry and markets,plays a key role in preserving fair and transparent markets. It is responsible for the listing                                                     1  The SFA would also incorporate the provisions concerning the raising of capital that are presently found in the CompaniesAct, thereby creating a single compendium of laws governing the securities industry.
2BIS Review 14/2001rules for companies that raise capital and have their shares traded on the exchange. It isalso responsible for ensuring that conditions exist for orderly trading of listed securities.• The conduct of issuers themselves is at the core of a system of market discipline. Issuersmust take it upon themselves to make full and prompt disclosure of material information. It isnot just a matter of meeting the requirements of the law and SGX's rules. It is increasingly inthe interests of companies to go beyond the minimum in disclosure standards, as investorsbecome more discerning to the quality of information available to them. A number of studieshave shown that the markets have attached an increased premium in recent years tocompanies which demonstrate sound corporate governance and who are more forthcomingand open with information on their businesses. The so-called 'corporate governancedividend', previously not easily discerned in Asian markets in particular, is now fully visible.• Market intermediaries play an important supporting role. Investment banks, accountants,lawyers and other professionals who advise issuers have a duty to provide highstandards of professional advice, and to exercise thorough due diligence to ensure thatissuers comply with laws and rules, as well as adopt high standards of disclosure. Brokersand investment advisers likewise, have a duty to provide their investing clients withobjective advice that is in their clients' best interests.• Finally, it is for investors themselves to take advantage of higher standards of disclosure inmaking their decisions. Investors and the media also contribute to effective market disciplineby calling for more and better quality information from listed companies. Institutionalinvestors such as fund managers play an important role in this regard. They have greaterresources to monitor and analyse information, and typically greater leverage on companiesto encourage them to improve on standards of corporate governance and disclosure.The move towards market-based regulation will be given a significant push by the recommendations oftwo private sector-led committees that were appointed by the Government last year - the CorporateGovernance Committee and the Disclosure and Accounting Standards Committee. The committeeshave recently completed an exercise of public consultation on their preliminary recommendations, andaim to publish their final reports by April.The development of a market-driven, disclosure-based regime is in progress. It will be naïve to expectan effective system of market discipline to have arrived in a day, or in three years. The transition willcause some uncertainties initially, and even the occasional revanchist call for a return to the regime ofthe past. Market participants will take time to develop high standards of corporate conduct anddisclosure, and to discover the new boundaries. We can expect some of them to test the boundaries inthe process, either wittingly or otherwise. But the boundaries of what is permissible to preserve fairand transparent markets should become quite apparent through a few salutary cases, which will helpdefine the new dispensation.The MAS and SGX themselves have reviewed their respective roles in the new regulatoryenvironment. I will touch now on a number of issues concerning the regulatory functions of the SGX asa demutualised, profit-oriented and listed exchange, and its relationship with the MAS as the statutoryregulator.Can a demutualised, listed exchange regulate the market?As a focal point of market activity, exchanges have traditionally been accorded the role of frontlineregulator of the securities markets. With the demutualisation and public offering of shares by a growingnumber of exchanges - most recently the Deutsche Borse - questions arise as to whether a listedfor-profit exchange is able to discharge its role as frontline regulator competently and effectively.Conflicts of interest in the regulatory functions of an exchange are not new however. They existedbefore demutualisation. Members of the former Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES), a mutual body,had to set and enforce rules in the public interest that could negatively affect their commercialinterests. The exchange was also expected to conduct effective and impartial supervision of itsmember-owners. The potential conflicts of interest in these respects were mitigated by the fact that theSES had only a small number of members, accentuating the financial risks that they each faced from afailure of the exchange to properly regulate.
BIS Review 14/20013More importantly, the potential conflicts of interest made it necessary for the MAS to take a heavyhand in the affairs of the exchange. The folklore sometimes exaggerated this, so much that someobservers attributed every decision of the SES to the mysterious ways of the MAS. But the hiddenhand of the regulator was not ideal for developing a mature and dynamic capital market.Now that the SGX has been demutualised and listed, a new set of potential conflicts arises. Whileprofits were never irrelevant to the SES, they are the primary motive for shareholders of the listedSGX. Share values and dividends also give greater transparency to the business performance andprospects of the SGX, providing the management with greater incentive to raise operational efficiency,and seek competitive advantage. This is as it should be, and is indeed a principle benefit ofdemutualising and listing the SGX. There will however be concern from time to time as to whether thegreater drive for commercial success will reduce the commitment and resources deployed by theexchange to fulfill its responsibility to regulate in the public interest.The MAS believes that the interests of the SGX are more aligned than divergent with public interest asrepresented by users of the exchange. A fair, transparent and efficiently-regulated market isindispensable to the vibrancy and sustained business success of the SGX. Serious investors willnot trade on an exchange that does not have internationally acceptable rules of listing, trading andsettlement, or does not enforce the rules fairly and effectively. The examples of exchanges that havefailed to meet such standards and suffered the consequences of investor shunning their markets arewell-known. Without the interest and liquidity provided by investors, no exchange will find it easy toattract issuers and to build its business.Credibility in regulation is therefore a vital commercial asset for the SGX. The board andmanagement of the SGX recognise this fully. Corporate governance of the SGX is not designed tofavour short-term revenue objectives at the expense of long-term gains. Shareholders of SGXthemselves have it in their interests to hold the exchange to high standards of market regulation, so asto achieve sustained returns on their investments.MAS-SGX Regulatory RelationshipA demutualised, listed exchange however requires an enhanced role for the MAS in some respects,even as the functions of the SGX and the MAS are more clearly delineated than in the past. TheExchanges (Demutualisation and Merger) Act passed in 1999 was drafted to give MAS the power toissue directives to SGX in the interest of ensuring fair and orderly securities and futures markets, andthe proper management of systemic risks. The MAS is the backstop. It is in the position to put thingsright, where any potential conflicts of interest become real.The regulatory relationship between MAS and SGX may be broadly defined as follows. MAS, as thestatutory regulator, will administer the corpus of statutory law regulating the capital markets. We alsomaintain oversight of SGX's regulatory responsibilities and seek to ensure that there are no gaps inthe overall regulatory framework. The SGX has direct and frontline regulatory responsibilities of thesecurities and futures markets, and over the broker-dealers who trade on the exchange. ThisMAS-SGX regulatory relationship applies to all the major areas of regulation:a.Regulation of capital raising• SGX defines and enforces the rules that apply to companies that seek to raise capital on theexchange through primary or secondary issues.• MAS' approval must be sought for any changes to SGX's listing rules. Under the proposedSFA, the SGX will have to notify the MAS of any rule changes 21 days before itsannouncement. MAS will be able to approve, alter or stop any rule change during that21-day period.b.Continuous listing and disclosure requirements• SGX enforces the continuous listing requirements on companies, to see to it that listedcompanies maintain timely and adequate disclosure of material information. SGX has thepower to suspend and even de-list a counter if a company fails to meet the standards set outin the listing rules.
4BIS Review 14/2001• Continuous disclosure by listed companies will also become a statutory obligation under theproposed SFA. This means that non-disclosure or late disclosure of material information willbe a breach of the law, not just a breach of SGX's listing requirements, and carry either civilor criminal penalty.c.Market surveillance• SGX carries out market surveillance to detect unusual trading activities that could reflectattempts to manipulate the market. Such surveillance efforts could also lead to discovery ofparties trading on privileged insider information. SGX has the power to suspend or de-list acounter if conditions for orderly trading are found to be absent.• MAS will carry out independent surveillance on a selective basis, to ensure that SGX isperforming its responsibilities effectively.• The MAS will have the power under the proposed SFA to pursue civil prosecution of listedcompanies which fail to make timely disclosure of material information, and of anyparticipants suspected of market misconduct. The recently introduced civil remedy regimefor insider trading will be extended to cover other forms of market misconduct such asmarket manipulation, or the employment of fraud and deceit in dealing. Civil remedy, whichlowers the burden of proof against offenders, will complement the present framework ofcriminal remedy for offences under securities law.d.Supervision of brokers• SGX supervises and inspects brokers to ensure that they comply with SGX's rules, areprudentially sound, and uphold high standards of market integrity. SGX has to act swiftly andfirmly to deal with any unprofessional conduct by brokers and their representatives.• MAS conducts continuous off-site review of brokers' operations to check if they comply withstatutory licensing requirements. Such off-site reviews will be complemented by MAS'selective, on-site inspection of brokers to assure itself of the competence and effectivenessof SGX's supervision.Regulation of SGX as a self-listed entityWhen the SGX was listed on itself (on its Securities Trading subsidiary), MAS assumed the role offrontline regulator for the listing and trading of SGX's shares. MAS was the approving authority forSGX's listing, and was directly responsible for vetting SGX's prospectus. We are also conductingsurveillance of trading in SGX's shares, and monitoring the continuous disclosure of materialinformation by SGX. MAS has powers under the Exchanges (Demutualisation and Merger) Act toissue directives to SGX to resolve any conflicts of interest arising from its self-listing. Such conflicts arealso addressed in a Deed of Undertaking to the MAS. In keeping with the Deed, SGX has appointed aConflicts Committee to deal with such issues, and MAS is the approving authority for the compositionof the Committee.Revisiting the regulatory structure will be necessaryThe relationship between the regulator and the exchange is evolving internationally. Regulators aremonitoring the effectiveness of self-regulation by the exchanges, and the division of responsibilitiesbetween regulators and exchanges. No single model has gained universal acceptance, and no modelis regarded as good for all time in any jurisdiction.The present MAS-SGX regulatory arrangement has major elements in common with that in the majorjurisdictions which have seen the exchanges demutualised, and in particular with arrangements inAustralia. The UK approach is also similar, except that the Financial Services Authority (FSA) hastaken over the listing authority from the London Stock Exchange (LSE). That decision was shaped bythe inappropriateness of leaving the listing authority with the LSE when other competing exchangesare emerging in the UK.We believe that the current arrangements for the regulation and supervision of the securitiesmarkets between the MAS and SGX, with an enhanced oversight responsibility for the MAS and
BIS Review 14/20015powers to pursue civil prosecution, will prove robust. But we will continually review thearrangement, keep in touch with international practices, and re-calibrate the roles of MAS and SGXwhere necessary to ensure effective oversight of the local markets.I would now like to touch on two features of the regulatory arrangement that we have recentlyreviewed. The first concerns the approval of substantial shareholdings in the SGX; the second,proposed changes in the prospectus registration regime.Approval of substantial shareholdings in the SGXThe Exchanges (Demutualisation and Merger) Act requires anyone who wishes to acquire 5% or moreof SGX to seek prior approval from MAS. This provision recognises the unique and important role ofSGX in providing the infrastructure and marketplace for the trading, clearing and settlement ofsecurities and derivatives in Singapore.Strategic investorsAs announced previously, MAS will allow suitable strategic investors who can promote SGX's growthand development to acquire substantial stakes of 5% or more in SGX. How large a stake thesestrategic investors will be allowed to take will depend on what they are able to contribute to theexchange in terms of business alliances, technology or other ways of supporting the business andinfrastructure of the exchange.Fund managersIn addition, SGX has received indications from fund managers that they would like to hold moresignificant stakes in SGX than is currently permissible under the 5% cap. Fund managers are keyinstitutional players on the buy-side of the capital markets, and will, as shareholders, add to thediverse range of groups with an interest in SGX's business. MAS will therefore generally allow fundmanagers who invest pools of customer funds to hold SGX's shares beyond the 5% limit. Theywill have to apply to MAS for approval first. The combined holdings of such a fund manager will becapped at 10%. A fund manager, however, cannot expect to be represented on the SGX Boardunless it has a substantive, strategic relationship with the Exchange.Proposed changes to the prospectus registration regimeThe Companies Act requires every company seeking to raise funds via a public offer to issue aprospectus to inform potential investors of the financial status of the company, its business plans, therisks of investing in the company, and all other material information which will enable them to makeinformed investment decisions. Currently, companies submit their draft prospectuses to the Registry ofCompanies and Businesses (RCB) to be vetted for compliance with the Companies Act. Companiesapplying to list on the SGX will also send their draft prospectuses to the exchange for vetting to ensurethat they meet SGX's disclosure requirements.When the capital-raising provisions in the Companies Act are transferred to the new SFA later thisyear, MAS will take over from RCB as statutory regulator for prospectus registration. We are nowreviewing the prospectus registration regime with a view to enhancing market accountability, andraising the standards of prospectus disclosure.Under the proposed regime, MAS will register a prospectus not earlier than 14 days and not later than28 days after an issuer has lodged the prospectus with MAS. This period will allow for bothregulatory review by the MAS and SGX, and public scrutiny and comment. (Currently, there is nopublic scrutiny before a prospectus is registered.) The prospectus will be published on the Internet togive investors the opportunity to scrutinise the prospectus prior to its distribution, and raise any issuesof concern. This model is similar to that which has been introduced in the Australian markets.There will be a more measured approach to prospectus review by the regulator. I was told that SGXcurrently vets an average of five drafts for every prospectus that gets published. This is clearly notdesirable going forward. The review of prospectuses by the MAS and SGX will focus, respectively, oncompliance with laws and SGX's listing requirements on prospectus disclosure. MAS and SGX will nolonger vet prospectuses with a view to determining if they contain inaccuracies in information or factual
6BIS Review 14/2001errors. Issuers and their advisers have to bear greater responsibility for ensuring accurate andadequate disclosure.After a prospectus has been registered, it is proposed that MAS be empowered to issue a stop orderand prevent further issues of securities if a prospectus is found to contain misleading or incorrectstatements, or to have omitted material information. Investors who have subscribed for securities onthe basis of the deficient prospectus can withdraw their applications and have their monies refunded.The new prospectus registration regime is aimed at placing greater responsibility on issuers and theiradvisers to meet the high standards of disclosure necessary for the development of more effectivemarket discipline, and a more mature capital market environment. MAS will be seeking feedback onthe proposed prospectus registration regime shortly, as part of our public consultation on the draftSFA.ConclusionApproaches to regulation worldwide are evolving with the times. An effective system of marketdiscipline is necessary to sustain and promote the growth of open, transparent and competitivemarkets. Singapore is making substantial changes to its laws, rules and standards to supportenhanced market discipline. It will be a process of evolution, but we have made good progress.Succeeding in this endeavour will require effort by both the regulator and all market participants,including issuers, their advisers and investors themselves. It is an indispensable part of our efforts tomake Singapore a premier financial hub in Asia, and we have every confidence in getting there.
BIS Review 13/20011Andrew Crockett: Monetary policy and financial stabilitySpeech by Andrew Crockett, General Manager of the Bank for International Settlements andChairman of the Financial Stability Forum, given at the Fourth HKMA Distinguished Lecture, held inHong Kong, 13 February 2001.*      *      *It is a great pleasure to be invited to give the Fourth Annual HKMA Distinguished Lecture. And it is aspecial honour to follow in the footsteps of such eminent predecessors as Bill McDonough, WimDuisenberg and Jean-Claude Trichet. With the BIS having established its Asian office here in HongKong, our links with the Special Administrative Region are now particularly close.My topic today is Monetary Policy and Financial Stability. There can of course be no debate about theimportance of the twin goals of price stability, on the one hand, and the stability of the financial system,on the other. What is less well understood is the relationship between them, and that is what I want toexplore in this lecture.It is an issue that is both important and timely. Important, because we need to ensure thatarrangements for the pursuit of price stability do not inadvertently endanger the stability of the financialsystem. And we need to ensure that financial system weaknesses do not impede the effectiveoperation of monetary policy. Timely, because the new Basel Capital Accord is focussing additionalattention on the issue of systemic risk. Moreover, in a number of countries, responsibility for thesupervision of financial institutions has been moved from the central bank to an independentregulatory authority, with the central bank itself retaining a more general responsibility for overallsystemic stability. Australia and the United Kingdom are perhaps the clearest examples of such a shift,but similar moves have taken place in Korea, Hungary and a number of other countries. Theseinstitutional changes have sparked a lively debate about the appropriate institutional framework formonetary and financial stability policies.In this lecture, I will argue that the terms of this debate are too narrow. What matters is not so muchthe institutional division of responsibilities. It is rather the nexus between monetary and prudentialpolicies and how to devise a set of arrangements that can promote both monetary and financialstability, regardless of the formal assignment of policy tasks. This is a very complex matter becausethe linkages between monetary policy and financial stability go in both directions and take many forms.My argument will be that a greater consensus than now exists is required on the underlyingrelationship between monetary and financial stability (diagnosis) in order to better frame policyresponses (remedies). In implementing prudential policies, supervisory authorities may require akeener recognition that some of the main roots of systemic instability have been macroeconomic. Onecommon macroeconomic element behind overextension in the financial system has beenmisjudgements about the economy’s potential growth rate – a major factor in Japan in the 1980s andin South-East Asia in the mid 1990s. Another element is that financial market sentiment tends to movewith the business cycle. Many of the dilemmas of policy arise because it is difficult in practice todistinguish what is cycle and what is trend.Likewise, in framing monetary policy, central banks may require a keener recognition of the role ofmonetary policy in unintentionally accommodating the credit expansion that contributes to the build upof financial imbalances. In developing these themes, I will try to derive some operative conclusionsboth for the monetary policy and the supervisory function.The structure of what I have to say is as follows: I will begin by recalling, in a somewhat stylisedmanner, the current debate on the relationship between monetary and financial stability. Next, I willbroaden the focus so as to bring out some of the under-appreciated aspects of this relationship.Finally, I will try to draw some policy implications, both for the monetary and the supervisoryauthorities.
2BIS Review 13/2001The current debateThe conceptual framework underlying the current debate is one in which the two objectives ofmonetary and financial stability, and the instruments used to achieve them, can be largely separated.The monetary authorities direct interest rate and credit policies towards a clearly defined objective ofprice stability. Increasingly, this is being done in the framework of inflation targeting, though HongKong, for reasons related to both its history and its economic structure, has chosen to anchor itsmonetary policy on an external peg. Against a background of price stability, financial stability is seen tobe assured by rigorous prudential supervision, targeted at the risk management practices, and thesolvency of individual institutions.Within this broad conceptual framework, there are areas of agreement and disagreement. It isgenerally agreed that there is a clear division of responsibility between the monetary policy functionand the prudential supervisory function. And it is accepted that information needs to be exchangedand actions coordinated, particularly during periods of financial turbulence. But otherwise, little need isseen for continuous interaction between the authorities responsible for these two functions.Where disagreement has arisen is on the subject of whether supervisory functions should be placed inthe central bank or outside. This is a debate that is set to continue for some time yet. Among thearguments made for retaining supervisory authority in the central bank are the following:–The central bank will have easier access to information in the case of a crisis, and it will beeasier to coordinate monetary and prudential policy actions;–It will be easier to assess and respond to the build-up of system risk if the supervisoryauthority also has responsibilities, and hence specific know-how, in other areas of thefinancial system (e.g. market functioning and the operation of clearing and settlementsystems).–Access to supervisory information can help the authorities better calibrate monetary policy(e.g. the case of the “headwinds” that confronted the US economy during the recovery of theearly 1990s).–The central bank may be the only institution (especially in emerging market economies) withthe necessary independence and credibility to implement rigorous prudential policies andlimit governmental interference.There are, however, also arguments on the other side:–Information exchange does not require that functions be grouped within the same institution;–Given the blurring of distinctions between different types of financial institutions, the retentionof supervisory responsibilities within the central bank may give rise to perceptions that thelender of last resort function is being extended, with consequent risks of moral hazard.–The central bank may become too powerful if it is both independent and endowed with abroad range of functions.–There could be a conflict of interest with monetary policy, if central banks were induced to beexcessively expansionary in order to head off weaknesses at individual financial institutions.In these terms, there is no obviously “right” answer to the debate. Individual observers may have theirown preferences, but at the end of the day, the answer probably depends on country-specificcircumstances. For example, how independent from political and industry pressure can a separatesupervisor be? How scarce are the relevant skills? And how blurred have the distinctions betweendifferent types of financial intermediary become? Some, such as Charles Goodhart,1 have argued thatthese considerations lead to the conclusion that the case for combining supervisory and monetarypolicy responsibilities in the central bank will generally be stronger in emerging markets.But whatever is the answer to the question “Who should supervise?”, it is necessary to define tasksclearly and in such a way that the tools are available to discharge them. One risk in the present trendto remove supervision from the tasks of central banks is that central banks could be left with aresponsibility for overall financial stability that is neither clearly defined nor supported with thenecessary powers or access to information to discharge it. So where separate supervisory authoritiesare being established, it is important to set up a structure that promotes the necessary exchange of                                                     1C A E Goodhart: “The Organisational Structure of Financial Supervision”, FSI Occasional Paper No 1, BIS, Basel, 2000.
BIS Review 13/20013information and coordination. Much attention is being given to this subject in the United Kingdom,Japan and other countries where new supervisory structures are being put in place.My argument in this lecture, however, is that even with these developments, the basic conceptualframework for the promotion of financial stability is not fully adequate. It tends to see theinterrelationship between monetary policy and financial supervision as being important in managingcrises, rather than in their origination. There is not sufficient focus on the genesis of financialinstability.It is this framework that I wish to try and broaden. My conjecture is that the relationship betweenmonetary and financial stability runs deeper than is often imagined. More specifically, the pursuit ofprice stability can sometimes allow financial imbalances to arise inadvertently, and can sow the seedsof subsequent instability. Conversely, the pursuit of prudential objectives, institution by institution, cantake inadequate account of feedback mechanisms that can exacerbate macroeconomic cycles. Allowme to elaborate on these points.Beyond the current debate: the genesis of financial instabilityI will begin with two observations to support my conjecture that monetary and financial stability cannotbe put in separate compartments and separately pursued.My first observation is that since the 1980s inflation has been largely conquered, and yet financialinstability has, if anything, intensified. It has taken the form both of price misalignments andwidespread financial distress, both in industrial countries and emerging market economies. Exchangerate relationships have been highly volatile, and “bubbles” appear to have emerged and occasionallyburst in property and equity markets. Bond yields, too, have varied over a wide range. In financialsystems, there have been highly damaging crises in the Nordic countries, in Japan, in East Asia and inMexico.Several common features of these episodes of instability are worthy of comment. First, they occurredin circumstances where inflation was either not a threat, or was on a downward trend. In a liberalisedfinancial system, the absence of inflation is therefore a necessary but not sufficient condition to avoidfinancial instability. Secondly, systemic problems were not caused by individual institutions getting intodifficulty, and affecting others by contagion. In all cases, a whole set of institutions acted in more orless the same way, and were not disciplined by a supervisory authority which certainly knew what wasgoing on. Thirdly, the portfolio behaviour in question was encouraged by expectations that underlyingmacroeconomic conditions – interest rates and growth rates – could be extrapolated uncritically intothe future.My second observation is that there have been several combinations of monetary and financialregime during the 20th century, and none has been conspicuously successful at achievingsimultaneously both price stability and stability in a liberalised financial system.–Under the gold standard, there was a single anchor, gold convertibility, for both monetaryand financial stability. Monetary stability was in fact defined as the preservation of theconvertibility of a currency into gold. Likewise, individual financial institutions had to assurethey could always mobilise gold (or assets convertible into gold) to redeem their liabilities.The gold standard was an example of a liberalised financial system in which the quantity ofgold acted as a visible exogenous constraint on monetary authorities and banks alike. But itdid not prevent waves of excessive expansion, followed by instability and bust. In otherwords, such a system, unmanaged, was inadequate to discipline inherent tendencies toexcess in financial markets.–The interwar years saw the replacement of the brittle discipline of the gold standard with theemergence of fiat monetary standards. This led to a closer identification of monetary policywith the objective of price stability. At the same time, it loosened the constraints on creditexpansion, and did nothing to prevent widespread financial instability. In the wake of theturbulence of the early 1930s, most countries introduced strict regulation of commercialbanking, and sometimes of other financial activity as well.–The Bretton Woods system of the post-war period was a de facto dollar standard. Giventhe experience of the interwar period, it involved heavy regulation of domestic andinternational financial transactions. The system delivered monetary stability, at least for aslong as the US authorities were able to keep inflationary forces in check. It also delivered
4BIS Review 13/2001financial system stability. But there was a heavy cost from repressed financial systems interms of the efficiency with which resources were ultimately allocated.–The floating exchange rates that followed the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system sawa search for alternative monetary anchors, and for a means of disciplining the financialsystem within a more liberal environment. As I noted a moment ago, the approach pursuedwas to segregate pursuit of the two objectives. For the pursuit of price stability, moneysupply targets were the first object of attention, but when they proved unsatisfactory, anincreasing number of central banks resorted to the “constrained discretion” of inflationtargeting. As far as financial system stability was concerned, the answer was found inintensified prudential supervision. This followed several damaging crises that occurred in thewake of financial liberalisation. The focus of supervision was less on permitted activities offinancial intermediaries, but on prudential risk management pursued by a combination ofbalance sheet constraints, supervisory oversight, and, market discipline. Until now, however,this approach has still not delivered durable financial stability.The foregoing brief review leads me to the conjecture that is the basis of this lecture: the combinationof a liberalised financial system and a fiat standard with monetary rules based exclusively in terms ofinflation is not sufficient to secure financial stability. This is not to deny that inflation is often a source offinancial instability. It certainly is. Inflation clouds and distorts relative prices, biases investmenttowards inflation hedges, and when it threatens to get out of control, requires drastic monetarytightening, and the wrenching adjustments that come in its wake.Yet the converse is not necessarily true. There are numerous examples of periods in which therestoration of price stability has provided fertile ground for excessive optimism. “Irrational exuberance”can drive asset prices to unrealistic levels, even as the prices of currently traded goods and servicesexhibit few signs of inflation.The reason is not far to seek. In a fiat money standard, the supply of credit is endogenous, governedby the reaction function of the authorities. If that reaction function responds solely to what ishappening to inflation in the price of current output, there is little to prevent the emergence of cycles inthe price of real and financial assets that do not enter into the inflation measure.If an absence of inflation is not, by itself, sufficient to ensure financial stability, and the authorities’reaction function does not prevent financial imbalances, to what can we look to contain their build-up?The answer is, of course, prudential regulation. However, the tools of prudential regulation arethemselves based on perceptions of risk which are not independent on the credit and asset pricecycle. If prudential regulation depends on assessments of collateral, capital adequacy and so on, andif the valuation of assets is distorted, the bulwark against the build-up of financial imbalances will beweakened. Put in simple terms, even with the necessary prudential rules, the system may not haveenough built-in stabilisers to avoid financial instability.This point can be made more apparent through a closer look at the anatomy of financial instability. In astylised financial cycle, some exogenous development sets off an expansion of credit. It is oftenimproved economic prospects, due to technological innovation, the implementation of reforms – orindeed many other genuine, real factors. Once under way, credit expansion fuels an acceleration ofoutput and an increase in asset prices. Such developments appear to boost returns and lower risk,leading to further credit expansion and increased leverage in the system. If the mechanisms ofprudential oversight – comprising markets, counterparties and official supervisors – work well,excessive leverage will be avoided. In such benign circumstances, financial institutions will weatherany subsequent downturn. But if the extension of balance sheets goes too far, an eventual reversalcan be abrupt and severe, with widespread bankruptcies, and substantial damage to financialintermediaries.This kind of financial cycle is easy to identify ex post. It can be purely domestic in nature, or it can bedriven by international capital flows. Examples are to be found in the Nordic countries following theliberalisation in the 1980s; in Japan in the 1980s and 1990s; and in the recent experience of a numberof East Asian economies. But it is much harder to identify ex ante.I draw first five conclusions from the foregoing analysis, that will be important for what I want to say inthe final part of this lecture, concerning policy challenges.First, the financial industry is unlike other sectors in that the feedback mechanism from supply to priceis less effective, or even perverse. In a traditional industry, an expansion in supply puts immediatedownward pressure on price, squeezing profit margins, reducing the incentives to invest and
BIS Review 13/20015encouraging exit from the industry. In the financial sector, the price that falls when the supply of creditincreases is the interest rate. This has the effect of pushing up asset values and appearing tostrengthen the balance sheets of borrowers and intermediaries alike. Rising asset values encourageleverage and credit expansion contributing to further increases in credit growth. Conversely, fallingvalues lead to deleveraging and reductions in credit growth.Second, fundamental value, the basis on which decisions to buy and sell, to lend and borrow aremade, is extremely hard to assess. We can of course decompose value into an expected stream ofreturns, a discount rate and a risk premium. But this does not take us very far. To an important extentvalue, like beauty, is in the eyes of the beholder. Its assessment is subject to powerful waves ofshared optimism or pessimism. Investors are prone to see new paradigms, to force new facts to fitentrenched perceptions. This helps explain why exchange rates among major currencies can exhibitwide volatility, and why individual stocks, and even stock indices, can move by large amounts even inthe absence of significant new information.My third conclusion is that cyclical upswings are typically sustained by overly optimistic expectations,and muted perceptions of risk. As expansion proceeds, risk spreads usually narrow, asset values arebuoyant and loan-loss provisions are reduced. With the benefit of hindsight, this looks perverse, sincewe can see that risks and imbalances have actually accumulated in the later stages of an upswing,only to materialise in the ensuing recession. The fact is that financial intermediaries are better atassessing relative risks at a point in time, than projecting the evolution of risk over the financial cycle.Unfortunately, however, it is these perceptions of risk, and the asset values that lie behind them, thatconstitute the raw material on which prudential controls operate.Fourth, widespread financial instability typically arises from exposures to common, rather thanidiosyncratic factors. The model in which an individual institution gets into difficulties and affects thesystem through contagion, is the exception rather than the rule. More commonly, financial systemsencounter crisis when many institutions have operated in a similar way, and have collectively failed tosee a common macroeconomic threat. The financial cycle is the most typical cause. Financialintermediaries, and their supervisors, fail to take adequate account of emerging imbalances, and arelulled to a false sense of security by the apparent strength of asset prices.Fifthly, monetary policy loses much of its effectiveness in dealing with a recession if banks, badlyoverexposed as a result of the preceding boom, are unable to lend. I hardly need to belabour this pointto an Asian audience. A well-functioning financial system is essential for successful monetary policybecause of its pivotal role in the transmission of monetary policy measures.Policy challengesIf the argument so far is valid, achieving the elusive twin goals of financial and monetary stability willrequire mutually reinforcing anchors to be put in place in the two spheres. Moreover, it will require anenhanced appreciation of the interdependence of policies in the two areas. I will deal with these two-way channels of inter-dependence in turn, starting with prudential regulation and the goal of financialstability.A key element here is to recognise the role of common factors in generating financial distress, and theneed to find better ways of identifying and tackling emerging imbalances. Supervisors are recognisingthis, and are increasingly focussing on developments that generate systemic, rather than idiosyncratic,difficulties. This means looking at the correlation of risks across institutions, rather than factors thatthreaten individual failure. It also means that prudential controls should be calibrated to the systemicrelevance of individual institutions, rather than being the same for all.We can think of this analogously to the paradigm shift brought about by mean/variance portfolioanalysis in the 1950s. Portfolio analysis now focuses on the aggregate risk/return characteristics of awhole portfolio, not on the characteristics of individual securities. Similarly, our concern with thefinancial system ought to be with its overall efficiency and resilience, not on the performance ofindividual intermediaries. This is not an easy shift in perspective for supervisors to make, given theirnatural focus at the institution level. Nevertheless, it is a shift that is now becoming apparent in thepublic statements of leaders of the supervisory profession.Another area in which a change in supervisory perspective is taking place lies in a greater recognitionof the time properties of risk over the financial cycle, and of the endogenous character of risk withrespect to the collective decisions of lenders. There are two problems here. One is the fact that
6BIS Review 13/2001underlying risk builds up as expansion and leverage continues, while apparent risk declines, with therise in collateral values. The second is that decisions to extend or withdraw credit can have perverseexternalities: what is rational for one lender acting in isolation becomes systemically threatening ifundertaken by all lenders together.The answer seems to lie in stronger incentives to build capital cushions in good times, that can bereduced in bad times. This would better reflect the underlying riskiness of banks’ portfolios and wouldprovide a built-in mechanism to dampen the financial amplification of the business cycle.I am of course aware of the difficulties of implementing such proposals. Fluctuations in regulatorycapital would provide opportunities for regulatory arbitrage and supervisory forbearance. Nevertheless,there are certain options that would limit such dangers. For example, provisioning practices couldcertainly be made more forward-looking than at present. Loan-to-value ratios could be adapted in thelight of potentially unsustainable movements in asset prices or be based on conservative, lesscyclically-sensitive measures of value. More generally, financial intermediaries could be induced bytheir supervisors to adopt a critical attitude to optimistic scenarios particularly during booms. Stresstesting is an essential technique in this connection. Many of the techniques I have just referred toshould find their place in the supervisory oversight pillar of the new Basel Capital Accord.Lastly, supervisory techniques will need to take a balanced view of the utility of market forces as anaid to stabilising behaviour. Disclosure and transparency undoubtedly facilitate the exercise ofcounterparty discipline. They are an important part of a more robust financial architecture, as the thirdpillar of the new Basel Capital Accord recognises. There is still much to do in Asia in raising disclosurestandards and in allowing the market to provide the necessary discipline. Asia’s crises were a starklesson that sweeping problems under the carpet did not solve them. I hardly need to remind thisaudience of that. At the same time, one should be aware that market participants may be subject tocollective misperceptions of risk. And even if risk is correctly perceived, private responses may not beappropriate from the viewpoint of systemic stability. Private behaviour can be affected by expectationsof official action (moral hazard); by short term horizons induced by the nature of contracts; by differinginterests as between principals and agents; and more generally by the combined effect of forces thatmake for what we commonly term “herd behaviour”.Let me turn, finally, to the role of monetary policy. I have argued that excessive credit expansionduring upswings has often contributed to the accumulation of financial imbalances, imbalances whoseunwinding has been associated with bouts of damaging instability. If I am right in this, the questionimmediately arises of whether monetary policy should have as one of its objectives to limit theaccumulation of such imbalances or, more simply put, to prevent the emergence of financial excesses.This has become a hotly debated subject of monetary economics in recent years, and the end of thedebate is not in sight.On the one hand, there are powerful arguments for saying that monetary policy should focusexclusively on consumer price inflation and not concern itself with asset prices and financialimbalances more generally. A proliferation of objectives is a recipe for confusion. Moreover, how canthe authorities distinguish an unsustainable from a sustainable evolution in asset prices? Even if theyfelt confident that a particular development was unsustainable, how could they muster the politicalsupport to resist it, especially if in so doing they were to induce an economic slowdown? Finally, howcould one recognise such a development sufficiently in advance to deflate it without damagingconsequences that would inevitably be blamed on the central bank?Nevertheless, it seems a counsel of despair to say that nothing can be done. The costs of uncontrolledfinancial cycles are sufficiently large that avenues for resisting them should at least be explored. At aminimum, it seems reasonable to suggest that, in formulating monetary policy aimed at an inflationobjective, central banks should take explicit account of the impact of financial developments on thebalance of risks. When credit expansion is rapid and asset prices are growing substantially faster thanthe price of current output, it might be appropriate for the authorities to aim for price increases in thelower part of the target corridor, or else to aim at a slowing in the overall rate of credit expansion. Inparticular, rapid credit growth should prompt the central bank to look extra hard for inflation risks.Such a policy, undertaken when the inflation threat seems remote, would no doubt be characterisedas excessively cautious. Yet it should be remembered that the costs of financial crises have in theevent turned out to be much greater than the output forgone in the short term by restrainingunsustainable growth.
BIS Review 13/20017ConclusionLet me end by recapitulating the main points of my argument. Many institutional actors are involved inthe quest for financial and monetary stability. They share a common goal, but they approach it fromdifferent perspectives.I hope I have persuaded you that the interrelationship between these perspectives is broader anddeeper than is usually thought. Monetary policy and prudential supervision interact in ways thatincreasingly demand a unified, and mutually reinforcing framework. Much progress has been made indeveloping such a framework in recent years. Nevertheless, much remains to be done.The preservation of stability in the financial system requires an understanding of how macroeconomicdevelopments interact with institutional behaviour and prudential norms to support or undermineequilibrating tendencies. And the implementation of monetary policy requires an understanding of thefact that the consequences of monetary policy for economic behaviour go much wider than theirimpact on the consumer price index.This is much more than simply a matter of who does what, of whether responsibility for supervision ofbanks is located inside or outside the central bank. One could even argue that the loss of supervisoryresponsibilities by central banks has prompted a healthy re-examination of what is meant by systemicstability, and how it can be achieved in a world of many actors.Systemic stability remains a key challenge for financial authorities worldwide. Nobody, least of all anAsian audience, needs to be reminded of the costs of crisis and disruption in the financial sector. Anenormous amount has been achieved in improving the capacity of the financial system to contribute toeconomic growth and development. The task now is to ensure that adequate defences are in place tounderstand and limit the system’s exposure to financial instability.
BIS Review 12/20011Alan Greenspan: Semi-annual monetary policy report to the US CongressTestimony of Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board on the occasion of theFederal Reserve Board’s semi-annual monetary policy report to the Committee on Banking, Housing,and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate on 13 February 2001.*      *      *I appreciate the opportunity this morning to present the Federal Reserve's semi-annual report onmonetary policy.The past decade has been extraordinary for the American economy and monetary policy. Thesynergies of key technologies markedly elevated prospective rates of return on high-tech investments,led to a surge in business capital spending, and significantly increased the underlying growth rate ofproductivity. The capitalization of those higher expected returns boosted equity prices, contributing toa substantial pickup in household spending on new homes, durable goods, and other types ofconsumption generally, beyond even that implied by the enhanced rise in real incomes.When I last reported to you in July, economic growth was just exhibiting initial signs of slowing fromwhat had been an exceptionally rapid and unsustainable rate of increase that began a year earlier.The surge in spending had lifted the growth of the stocks of many types of consumer durable goodsand business capital equipment to rates that could not be continued. The elevated level of light vehiclesales, for example, implied a rate of increase in the number of vehicles on the road hardly sustainablefor a mature industry. And even though demand for a number of high-tech products was doubling ortripling annually, in many cases new supply was coming on even faster. Overall, capacity in high-techmanufacturing industries rose nearly 50 percent last year, well in excess of its rapid rate of increaseover the previous three years. Hence, a temporary glut in these industries and falling prospective ratesof return were inevitable at some point. Clearly, some slowing in the pace of spending was necessaryand expected if the economy was to progress along a balanced and sustainable growth path.But the adjustment has occurred much faster than most businesses anticipated, with the process likelyintensified by the rise in the cost of energy that has drained business and household purchasingpower. Purchases of durable goods and investment in capital equipment declined in the fourth quarter.Because the extent of the slowdown was not anticipated by businesses, it induced some backup ininventories, despite the more advanced just-in-time technologies that have in recent years enabledfirms to adjust production levels more rapidly to changes in demand. Inventory-sales ratios rose onlymoderately; but relative to the levels of these ratios implied by their downtrend over the past decade,the emerging imbalances appeared considerably larger. Reflecting these growing imbalances,manufacturing purchasing managers reported last month that inventories in the hands of theircustomers had risen to excessively high levels.As a result, a round of inventory rebalancing appears to be in progress. Accordingly, the slowdown inthe economy that began in the middle of 2000 intensified, perhaps even to the point of growth stallingout around the turn of the year. As the economy slowed, equity prices fell, especially in the high-techsector, where previous high valuations and optimistic forecasts were being reevaluated, resulting insignificant losses for some investors. In addition, lenders turned more cautious. This tightening offinancial conditions, itself, contributed to restraint on spending.Against this background, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) undertook a series ofaggressive monetary policy steps. At its December meeting, the FOMC shifted its announcedassessment of the balance of risks to express concern about economic weakness, which encourageddeclines in market interest rates. Then on January 3, and again on January 31, the FOMC reduced itstargeted federal funds rate 1/2 percentage point, to its current level of 5-1/2 percent. An essentialprecondition for this type of response was that underlying cost and price pressures remained subdued,so that our front-loaded actions were unlikely to jeopardize the stable, low inflation environmentnecessary to foster investment and advances in productivity.The exceptional weakness so evident in a number of economic indicators toward the end of last year(perhaps in part the consequence of adverse weather) apparently did not continue in January. But withsigns of softness still patently in evidence at the time of its January meeting, the FOMC retained itssense that the risks are weighted toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in theforeseeable future.
2BIS Review 12/2001Crucial to the assessment of the outlook and the understanding of recent policy actions is the role oftechnological change and productivity in shaping near-term cyclical forces as well as long-termsustainable growth.The prospects for sustaining strong advances in productivity in the years ahead remain favorable. Asone would expect, productivity growth has slowed along with the economy. But what is notable is that,during the second half of 2000, output per hour advanced at a pace sufficiently impressive to providestrong support for the view that the rate of growth of structural productivity remains well above its paceof a decade ago.Moreover, although recent short-term business profits have softened considerably, most corporatemanagers appear not to have altered to any appreciable extent their long-standing optimism about thefuture returns from using new technology. A recent survey of purchasing managers suggests that thewave of new on- line business-to-business activities is far from cresting. Corporate managers moregenerally, rightly or wrongly, appear to remain remarkably sanguine about the potential for innovationsto continue to enhance productivity and profits. At least this is what is gleaned from the projections ofequity analysts, who, one must presume, obtain most of their insights from corporate managers.According to one prominent survey, the three- to five-year average earnings projections of more than athousand analysts, though exhibiting some signs of diminishing in recent months, have generally heldfirm at a very high level. Such expectations, should they persist, bode well for continued strength incapital accumulation and sustained elevated growth of structural productivity over the longer term.The same forces that have been boosting growth in structural productivity seem also to haveaccelerated the process of cyclical adjustment. Extraordinary improvements in business-to- businesscommunication have held unit costs in check, in part by greatly speeding up the flow of information.New technologies for supply-chain management and flexible manufacturing imply that businesses canperceive imbalances in inventories at a very early stage--virtually in real time--and can cut productionpromptly in response to the developing signs of unintended inventory building.Our most recent experience with some inventory backup, of course, suggests that surprises can stilloccur and that this process is still evolving. Nonetheless, compared with the past, much progress isevident. A couple of decades ago, inventory data would not have been available to most firms untilweeks had elapsed, delaying a response and, hence, eventually requiring even deeper cuts inproduction. In addition, the foreshortening of lead times on delivery of capital equipment, a result ofinformation and other newer technologies, has engendered a more rapid adjustment of capital goodsproduction to shifts in demand that result from changes in firms' expectations of sales and profitability.A decade ago, extended backlogs on capital equipment meant a more stretched-out process ofproduction adjustments.Even consumer spending decisions have become increasingly responsive to changes in the perceivedprofitability of firms through their effects on the value of households' holdings of equities. Stock marketwealth has risen substantially relative to income in recent years--itself a reflection of the extraordinarysurge of innovation. As a consequence, changes in stock market wealth have become a moreimportant determinant of shifts in consumer spending relative to changes in current household incomethan was the case just five to seven years ago.The hastening of the adjustment to emerging imbalances is generally beneficial. It means that thoseimbalances are not allowed to build until they require very large corrections. But the faster adjustmentprocess does raise some warning flags. Although the newer technologies have clearly allowed firms tomake more informed decisions, business managers throughout the economy also are likelyresponding to much of the same enhanced body of information. As a consequence, firms appear to beacting in far closer alignment with one another than in decades past. The result is not only a fasteradjustment, but one that is potentially more synchronized, compressing changes into an even shortertime frame.This very rapidity with which the current adjustment is proceeding raises another concern, of adifferent nature. While technology has quickened production adjustments, human nature remainsunaltered. We respond to a heightened pace of change and its associated uncertainty in the sameway we always have. We withdraw from action, postpone decisions, and generally hunker down until arenewed, more comprehensible basis for acting emerges. In its extreme manifestation, manyeconomic decisionmakers not only become risk averse but attempt to disengage from all risk. Thisprecludes taking any initiative, because risk is inherent in every action. In the fall of 1998, for example,the desire for liquidity became so intense that financial markets seized up. Indeed, investors even
BIS Review 12/20013tended to shun risk-free, previously issued Treasury securities in favor of highly liquid, recently issuedTreasury securities.But even when decisionmakers are only somewhat more risk averse, a process of retrenchment canoccur. Thus, although prospective long-term returns on new high-tech investment may change little,increased uncertainty can induce a higher discount of those returns and, hence, a reduced willingnessto commit liquid resources to illiquid fixed investments.Such a process presumably is now under way and arguably may take some time to run its course. It isnot that underlying demand for Internet, networking, and communications services has become lesskeen. Instead, as I noted earlier, some suppliers seem to have reacted late to accelerating demand,have overcompensated in response, and then have been forced to retrench--a not-unusual occurrencein business decisionmaking.A pace of change outstripping the ability of people to adjust is just as evident among consumers asamong business decisionmakers. When consumers become less secure in their jobs and finances,they retrench as well.It is difficult for economic policy to deal with the abruptness of a break in confidence. There may not bea seamless transition from high to moderate to low confidence on the part of businesses, investors,and consumers. Looking back at recent cyclical episodes, we see that the change in attitudes hasoften been sudden. In earlier testimony, I likened this process to water backing up against a dam thatis finally breached. The torrent carries with it most remnants of certainty and euphoria that built up inearlier periods.This unpredictable rending of confidence is one reason that recessions are so difficult to forecast.They may not be just changes in degree from a period of economic expansion, but a different processengendered by fear. Our economic models have never been particularly successful in capturing aprocess driven in large part by nonrational behavior.Although consumer confidence has fallen, at least for now it remains at a level that in the past wasconsistent with economic growth. And as I pointed out earlier, expected earnings growth over thelonger-run continues to be elevated. If the forces contributing to long-term productivity growth remainintact, the degree of retrenchment will presumably be limited. Prospects for high productivity growthshould, with time, bolster both consumption and investment demand. Before long in this scenario,excess inventories would be run off to desired levels.Still, as the FOMC noted in its last announcement, for the period ahead, downside risks predominate.In addition to the possibility of a break in confidence, we don't know how far the adjustment of thestocks of consumer durables and business capital equipment has come. Also, foreign economiesappear to be slowing, which could damp demands for exports; and, although some sectors of thefinancial markets have improved in recent weeks, continued lender nervousness still is in evidence inother sectors.Because the advanced supply-chain management and flexible manufacturing technologies may havequickened the pace of adjustment in production and incomes and correspondingly increased thestress on confidence, the Federal Reserve has seen the need to respond more aggressively than hadbeen our wont in earlier decades. Economic policymaking could not, and should not, remain unalteredin the face of major changes in the speed of economic processes. Fortunately, the very advances intechnology that have quickened economic adjustments have also enhanced our capacity for real-timesurveillance.As I pointed out earlier, demand has been depressed by the rise in energy prices as well as by theneeded slowing in the pace of accumulation of business capital and consumer durable assets. Thesharp rise in energy costs pressed down on profit margins still further in the fourth quarter. About aquarter of the rise in total unit costs of nonfinancial, nonenergy corporations reflected a rise in energycosts. The 12 percent rise in natural gas prices last quarter contributed directly, and indirectly throughits effects on the cost of electrical power generation, about one-fourth of the rise in overall energycosts for nonfinancial, non-energy corporations; increases in oil prices accounted for the remainder.In addition, a significant part of the margin squeeze not directly attributable to higher energy costsprobably has reflected the effects of the moderation in consumer outlays that, in turn, has been due inpart to higher costs of energy, especially for natural gas. Hence, it is likely that energy cost increasescontributed significantly more to the deteriorating profitability of nonfinancial, non-energy corporationsin the fourth quarter than is suggested by the energy-related rise in total unit costs alone.
4BIS Review 12/2001To be sure, the higher energy expenses of households and most businesses represent a transfer ofincome to producers of energy. But the capital investment of domestic energy producers, and, verylikely, consumption by their owners, have provided only a small offset to the constraining effects ofhigher energy costs on spending by most Americans. Moreover, a significant part of the extra expenseis sent overseas to foreign energy producers, whose demand for exports from the United States isunlikely to rise enough to compensate for the reduction in domestic spending, especially in the short-run. Thus, given the evident inability of energy users, constrained by intense competition for their ownproducts, to pass on much of their cost increases, the effects of the rise in energy costs does notappear to have had broad inflationary effects, in contrast to some previous episodes when inflationexpectations were not as well anchored. Rather, the most prominent effects have been to depressaggregate demand. The recent decline in energy prices and further declines anticipated by futuresmarkets, should they occur, would tend to boost purchasing power and be an important factorsupporting a recovery in demand growth over coming quarters.Economic projectionsThe members of the Board of Governors and the Reserve Bank presidents foresee an implicitstrengthening of activity after the current rebalancing is over, although the central tendency of theirindividual forecasts for real GDP still shows a substantial slowdown, on balance, for the year as awhole. The central tendency for real GDP growth over the four quarters of this year is 2 to2-1/2 percent. Because this average pace is below the rise in the economy's potential, they see theunemployment rate increasing to about 4-1/2 percent by the fourth quarter of this year. The centraltendency of their forecasts for inflation, as measured by the prices for personal consumptionexpenditures, suggests an abatement to 1-3/4 to 2-1/4 percent over this year from 2-1/2 percent over2000.Government debt repayment and the implementation of monetary policyFederal budget surpluses have bolstered national saving, providing additional resources forinvestment and, hence, contributing to the rise in the capital stock and our standards of living.However, the prospective decline in Treasury debt outstanding implied by projected federal budgetsurpluses does pose a challenge to the implementation of monetary policy. The Federal Reserve hasrelied almost exclusively on increments to its outright holdings of Treasury securities as the"permanent" asset counterpart to the uptrend in currency in circulation, our primary liability. Becausethe market for Treasury securities is going to become much less deep and liquid if outstandingsupplies shrink as projected, we will have to turn to acceptable substitutes. Last year the FederalReserve System initiated a study of alternative approaches to managing our portfolio.At its late January meeting, the FOMC discussed this issue at length, and it is taking several steps tohelp better position the Federal Reserve to address the alternatives. First, as announced on January31, the Committee extended the temporary authority, in effect since late August 1999, for the TradingDesk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to conduct repurchase agreements in mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the agencies as well as in Treasuries and direct agency debt. Thus,for the time being, the Desk will continue to rely on the same types of temporary open marketoperations in use for the past year and a half to offset transitory factors affecting reserve availability.Second, the FOMC is examining the possibility of beginning to acquire under repurchase agreementssome additional assets that the Federal Reserve Act already authorizes the Federal Reserve topurchase. In particular, the FOMC asked the staff to explore the possible mechanisms for backing ourusual repurchase operations with the collateral of certain debt obligations of U.S. states and foreigngovernments. We will also be consulting with the Congress on these possible steps before the FOMCfurther considers such transactions. Taking such assets in repurchase operations would significantlyexpand and diversify the assets our counterparties could post in temporary open market operations,reducing the potential for any impact on the pricing of private sector instruments.Finally, the FOMC decided to study further the even longer-term issue of whether it will ultimately benecessary to expand the use of the discount window or to request the Congress for a broadening of itsstatutory authority for acquiring assets via open market operations. How quickly the FOMC will need toaddress these longer-run portfolio choices will depend on how quickly the supply of Treasurysecurities declines as well as the usefulness of the alternative assets already authorized by law.
BIS Review 12/20015In summary, although a reduced availability of Treasury securities will require adjustments in theparticular form of our open market operations, there is no reason to believe that we will be unable toimplement policy as required.
BIS Review 12/20011Bank of Japan’s February report of recent economic and financialdevelopments1Bank of Japan, 13 February 2001.*      *      *The Bank’s view2Japan’s economy continues to recover gradually, but the pace is slowing due to decelerating exportgrowth.With regard to final demand, business fixed investment is on an increasing trend. The recovery inprivate consumption continues to be weak as a whole due to lack of notable improvements inemployment and income conditions, but there are somewhat positive signs in some indicators.Housing investment is virtually unchanged. As for public investment, the pace of decline is slowing.Meanwhile, net exports (real exports minus real imports) are starting to decrease reflecting aslowdown in overseas economies such as the U.S. and East Asia.Reflecting such developments in final demand, industrial production remains on a rising trend, but thepace is slowing considerably. Inventories of some materials and electronics parts, for which demandfrom overseas is declining significantly, have become somewhat excessive, but inventories as a wholestill remain at a low level. Meanwhile, corporate profits continue to improve. Income conditions ofhouseholds still remain severe but are not deteriorating, as employment conditions are on animproving trend.As for the outlook, public investment is expected to start increasing with the implementation of thegovernment’s new economic stimulus package. In the corporate sector, firms still strongly feel thatthey have excess capacity and that they should reduce their debts to restore financial soundness.However, it is very likely that fixed investment in high-growth sectors, including those related toinformation technology services, will increase as corporate profits continue to recover. Moreover, theimprovement in corporate profits will increase household income and this in turn is expected to boostprivate consumption. However, the pace of recovery in household income will be modest for the timebeing, since firms’ perceptions of excess employment still persist, and thus no significant change hasbeen observed in their efforts to reduce personnel expenses.It seems to be inevitable that exports will decline for some time reflecting the slowing of economiesoverseas. Imports are projected to continue increasing, particularly those of consumer goods, andcapital goods and parts. Hence, net exports are expected to decline. Mainly due to thesedevelopments in exports, industrial production is expected to remain at around the current level for awhile.Overall, it is likely that the economy will continue a gradual upward trend led mainly by business fixedinvestment. In addition, the favorable financial environment, created partly by the Bank’s continuationof its easy monetary stance, and the government’s new economic stimulus package are expected tounderpin the economy. However, attention should be paid to growing risks of downward pressures onthe economy induced by a possible further slowdown in overseas economies as well as bydevelopments in foreign and domestic capital markets.With regard to prices, import prices are rising, mainly reflecting the depreciation of the yen. Domesticwholesale prices are declining somewhat mainly due to the decrease in prices of electrical machinery.Consumer prices continue to be somewhat weak owing to the decline in prices of other importedproducts and their substitutes, despite the increase in prices of petroleum products. Corporate serviceprices are still falling slowly.                                                     1This report was written based on data and information available at the time of the Bank of Japan Monetary Policy Meetingheld on February 9, 2001.2The Bank’s view of recent economic and financial developments, determined by the Policy Board at the Monetary PolicyMeeting held on February 9 as the basis for monetary policy decisions.
2BIS Review 12/2001As for the conditions surrounding price developments, the recent yen depreciation is exerting upwardpressures on prices. Moreover, the balance between supply and demand in the domestic market isprojected to be on a gradual improving trend, while an economic recovery is expected to continue at amoderate pace. Recently, however, the pace of recovery seems to be slowing and crude oil prices,which had been exerting upward pressures on prices, are falling. In addition to the declining trend ofmachinery prices due to technological innovations, the decrease in prices of consumer goods arisingfrom the streamlining of distribution channels, and the reduction in communications fees aided byderegulation will continue to exert downward pressures on prices. Overall, prices are expected to besomewhat weak for the time being.In the financial market, the overnight call rate is generally moving around 0.25 percent.Interest rates on term instruments have been declining somewhat. The Japan premium remainsnegligible.Yields on long-term government bonds have declined to around 1.4-1.45 percent. The yield spreadsbetween private bonds (bank debentures and corporate bonds) and government bonds are mostlyunchanged or expanding somewhat.Stock prices continue to be weak and are moving around the lowest level recorded since thebeginning of 2000.In the foreign exchange market, the sharp depreciation of the yen since late December has come to apause. The yen is currently being traded in the range of 114-117 yen to the U.S. dollar.With regard to corporate finance, private banks continue to be more active in extending loans, mainlyto blue-chip companies, while carefully evaluating the credit risks involved. There seem to be nosignificant changes in the fund-raising conditions of firms in the markets for such instruments ascorporate bonds and CP.On the other hand, the improvement in economic activities has not stimulated corporate demand forexternal funds, since firms’ cash flow is at a high level in parallel with the recovery in profits. Moreover,firms continue to reduce their debts as part of their balance-sheet restructuring measures. As a result,credit demand in the private sector has continued to be basically stagnant.In view of this, lending by private banks remains sluggish, declining at around 2 percent year-on-year.Meanwhile, the amount outstanding of corporate bonds issued is slightly above the previous year’slevel. The amount outstanding of CP issued continues to be at a high level.Recently, the growth rate of money stock (M2 + CDs) is slightly increasing due to the inflow from postalsavings.As for funding costs for firms, short-term funding rates basically remain flat but long-term funding ratesseem to be declining reflecting the developments in market interest rates.In this financial environment, the lending attitude of financial institutions and corporate financingconditions remain easy. However, the effects of the decline in stock prices on the fund-raisingconditions of firms need to be carefully monitored.
BIS Review 60/20011Alan Greenspan: Impact of energy on the economyRemarks by Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem, before the Economic Club of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, 28 June 2001.*      *      *Of the number of factors that have contributed to the slowing of economic growth in the United Statesover the past few quarters, the one that has received less attention than it clearly merits is the rise inenergy prices. In what may or may not be coincidence, at least the last three recession periods in theUnited States – those of 1990-91, 1980-82, and 1974-75 – were preceded by spikes in the price of oil.As a consequence, we at the Federal Reserve are especially attentive to developments in energymarkets and their effects on the behavior of households and businesses.Obviously, caution is required in drawing generalizations from only three observations, and indeedmany analysts do not place much credence in the link between oil prices and the business cycle. Inpart, this skepticism arises because the largely linear models that typically economists rely upon totrack the ties between energy prices and gross domestic product do not signal a worrisome linkage.When simulated over periods with observed oil price spikes, the models do not show oil pricesconsistently having been a decisive factor in the subsequent economic downturns. Our heightenedwariness about recent developments, however, reflects the possibility that the responsiveness of U.S.gross domestic product to energy prices may be different when households and businesses areconfronted with abnormal price hikes. Because economic models typically are fit over both thoseperiods with price spikes and the more predominant periods of moderate price fluctuation, theirestimated statistical relationships would not fully capture the effect of sudden and sizable shifts in oilprices on the economy.Pending the development of far better insights into the actual impact of oil price spikes than currentlycan be gleaned from macroeconomic models, it is prudent to follow energy markets far more closelythan our models would suggest is necessary.One important channel through which changes in the prices of oil and of other forms of energyunequivocally influence the economy is through their effects on the profitability of non-energycorporations. This effect is particularly important because a stabilization of profit margins and cashflow will be critical to an eventual firming of capital investment. As best we can infer, a substantial partof the rise in the total costs of corporations between the second quarter of last year and the firstquarter of this year reflected higher energy costs, only a small part of which companies apparentlywere able to pass through into higher prices.Rising natural gas prices, resulting from a significant shortfall in gas storage brought about by growingdomestic demand and a limited ability to import, have been a particular concern. But since the start ofthe year, spot prices for natural gas have fallen significantly as the earlier run-up in prices induced adramatic rise in drilling, a boost to output, and curtailed demand. Falling spot prices are beingreflected, with a lag, in lower contract gas prices paid by U.S. businesses. Electric power costscontinued to rise through May, but overall energy prices paid in April and May were down from thelevels of the first quarter, suggesting some easing in pressures on profit margins from energy thisquarter. We are also experiencing a decline of retail gasoline prices, which also had been risingsharply over the past couple of years. That run-up was of particular concern because in the past steepincreases in the price of gasoline have arguably undermined both the real purchasing power and theconfidence of consumers. This effect has likely been an avenue through which previous spikes in theprice of crude oil have slowed economic activity. The jump in gasoline prices from March through Maywas wholly the result of a twenty cent per gallon surge in gross refining margins. By contrast, refineryacquisition costs of crude oil changed little over that period. In recent weeks, however, refinerymargins have declined noticeably, easing gasoline prices at the pump, especially here in the Midwest.The widening of refinery margins this spring, in turn, reflected shortfalls in refinery capacity, which hadbeen exacerbated by a number of breakdowns. After rising to a peak in the early 1980s, the capacityof operable refineries fell substantially by the middle of that decade and held about flat from thenthrough most of the 1990s. Upgrades of existing facilities in the 1990s served only to offset a declineof more than 20 percent in the number of refineries.
2BIS Review 60/2001Accordingly, a refinery operating rate that languished at around 75 percent in the first half of the 1980shas risen to effectively full-capacity operations currently. The pressure on these facilities impeded theconversion of the substantial buildup of crude oil inventories that occurred since early March intogasoline and, as a consequence, gasoline prices at retail continued to increase through early May.As was the case in 2000, some sharp regional differences in gasoline prices have emerged again thisyear. At the start of the summer, prices in the Midwest were running well above the national averageagain. Because regulations prescribe differing grades of gasoline for different regions of the country,gasoline is not as uniform a product as it was in earlier years. Consequently, the ability to movegasoline from areas of surplus to deficit is far more limited than it was a decade ago, and any givendegree of overall gasoline price containment requires higher levels of gasoline inventories than wouldbe the case otherwise.Elevated domestic prices have damped demand and even drawn increased quantities of gasoline fromEuropean refineries in recent months. As a consequence, gasoline inventories have risen rapidly inrecent weeks. Wholesale prices, as a result, are down substantially from their peaks.We cannot be certain, of course, that the recent spike in gasoline prices in the United States is behindus, especially when crude oil supplies are never fully secure because of the unpredictability of eventsin the Middle East. Nonetheless, it is encouraging that in market economies well-publicized forecastsof crises, such as earlier concerns about gasoline price surges this summer, more often than not fail todevelop, or at least not with the frequency and intensity proclaimed by headline writers. The reason isthat producers and consumers alike react to price signals in ways that help to prevent the predicteddisasters.This phenomenon was also quite evident last winter, when markets worked to help allocate limitedsupplies of fuel oil and mitigate the problems that many had feared at the outset of the heatingseason. In response to low inventories of home heating oil, prices went up, demand slowed, and wedrew in large amounts of heating oil from Europe. In the event, retail prices for heating oil peaked earlyin the season and have declined appreciably since.We even may be beginning to see some indications that responses to market signals are having someeffects in California. There is evidence that higher prices for electricity are beginning to damp demand,which is down significantly from a year ago as a consequence of increases in retail prices sinceDecember that will reach roughly 40 to 50 percent. Wholesale power supply contract prices forthird-quarter delivery have recently fallen to their lowest levels this year. Of course, to assume thatCalifornia is going to be able to avoid serious problems as the full brunt of demands for energy mountthis summer would be foolhardy. The significant additions to capacity currently being planned or underconstruction will not be in place in time to eliminate the potential for disruption in the months ahead.No other area of the United States has experienced the potential supply-demand imbalance in electricpower that currently confronts California. Historically, public utility commissions, there as elsewhere,set prices in order to deliver a guaranteed rate of return on capacity, whether it was used or not. Thatcapacity "buffer" settled around 15 percent of summer peak loads in many cases. For a variety ofreasons – including a failure to expand capacity in response to increased demand – the previoussummertime buffer in California has by now largely disappeared.Because inventory buffers are not feasible for electrical systems, capacity buffers must absorb the fullbrunt of supply-demand imbalances. Such a system, confronted with relatively inelastic demand,cannot avoid extreme price increases or, alternatively, blackouts when demand for power plus anoperationally minimal capacity buffer approaches or exceeds available supply. This would be the casewhether power is being generated in a wholly free market or in the wholly controlled markets that indecades past were governed by public utility commissions.If new capacity is not available in such circumstances, demand must fall. It will fall voluntarily inresponse to high prices or other forms of conservation that dissuade less essential uses, or it will fallthrough brownouts, blackouts, or other forms of involuntary rationing.The recognition of the critical role of adequate capacity buffers has raised interest in deregulatedelectric power systems in the forward selling of the output of new generating plants. The reduced riskthat forward sales provide can increase the incentive to build new capacity. Analogies to theeconomics of office buildings are evident. Few office buildings would be constructed in the absence ofthe ability to reach long-term leases. Short-term rental agreements are no more conducive to newoffice construction than spot prices for electric power are to the building of new power plants. I shouldnote that while much attention is focused on the construction of new generating capacity, questions
BIS Review 60/20013related to the adequate capacity for transmission and distribution also loom large in California andelsewhere.Beyond issues strictly related to the economics of energy production and distribution, the current crisisin California is having profoundly important effects on public and private finance – from pressure onthe state budget as billions of dollars are expended to finance power costs to the budget problems ofmany struggling California businesses and households.But there are no financial fixes to the imbalance of supply and demand for power. Until new capacity isput in place or demand is constrained by higher prices, rationing, time-of-day metering, or voluntaryrestraint, electricity prices will remain unstable and ready availability of power will be uncertain. This isa worrisome situation for Californians, certainly; and because the state comprises one-eighth of ournational GDP, it should be a concern for the U.S. economic outlook as well. Fortunately, the overalleffects on the California economy, and on those of its neighboring states seems to have been modest,at least to date.The short-term energy problems we are experiencing for gasoline, natural gas, and electric power willbe resolved, one hopes, without any further adverse impact on our economy. Nonetheless, thedevelopments of the past couple of years have brought renewed attention to the longer-run prospectsfor energy markets in the United States.In making any assessment of those prospects it is important to recognize the extent to which marketmechanisms have helped to overcome earlier apparent limitations on resources. Largely in responseto past oil price increases, the energy intensity of the United States economy has been reduced byalmost half from the levels of the early 1970s. Much of the energy displacement was accomplished by1985, within a few years of the peak in the real price of oil. Progress in reducing energy intensity hasproceeded further since then but at a lessened pace. This more modest pace should not be surprising,given the generally lower level of real oil prices that has prevailed since 1985, and which carried overinto natural gas and electric power prices.What has changed dramatically in recent years is the production side of the oil and gas markets,where technological changes are taking place that are likely to make existing energy reserves stretchfurther while keeping long-term energy costs lower than they otherwise would have been. Thedevelopment of seismic techniques and satellite surveillance to discover promising new oil reservoirshas roughly doubled the drilling success rate for new-field wildcat wells during the past decade. Newtechniques facilitate far deeper drilling of promising pools, especially offshore. The newer recoveryinnovations reportedly have raised the proportion of oil reserves eventually brought to the surface fromone-third to nearly one-half in recent decades.One might expect that, as a consequence of what has been a dramatic shift away from the hit-or-misswildcat oil and gas exploration and development of the past to more advanced technologies, the costof developing new fields and, hence, the long-term marginal costs of new oil and gas would havedeclined.And, indeed, these costs have declined, but by less than might otherwise have been the case; muchof the innovation in oil development outside OPEC, for example, has been directed at overcoming anincreasingly inhospitable and costly exploratory environment, the consequence of more than a centuryof draining the more immediately accessible sources of crude oil.One measure of the decline in the marginal cost of additions to oil availability in recent years is thedowndrift in the prices of the most distant contracts for future delivery of Light Sweet crude oil. Spotprices have soared and plunged, but for the most distant futures contracts – which cover a time framelong enough to seek, discover, drill, and lift oil – prices generally have moved lower over the pastdecade. The most distant futures prices fell from a bit more than $20 per barrel just before the GulfWar to $17 to $18 a barrel a year ago.The current six-year futures contract has risen, on net, over the past year and has been a little above$20 per barrel in recent days. Arguably, however, this rise is related less to technology and thestructure of underlying marginal costs and more to uncertainties about how quickly the new practiceswill be exploited to expand OPEC's productive capacity. Going forward, there is concern that OPECmay choose not to expand capacity adequately from their large proven reserves.The long-term marginal cost of extraction presumably anchors the long-term equilibrium price and,thus, is critical to an evaluation of the magnitude and persistence of any current price disturbance.Over time, spot prices are inexorably drawn back to the long-term equilibrium price, as the balance
4BIS Review 60/2001between underlying supply and demand is restored. A premium over long-term marginal costsdoubtless exists for oil because so much of the world's crude oil reserves are in areas wheredisruptive turmoil is always a latent threat.The longer-term outlook for natural gas prices is less tied down by history or current practice. Unlikeoil, the natural gas consumed in the United States, as you know, is almost solely produced in theUnited States and in Canada, from which last year we imported 16 percent of our 23 trillion cubic feetof demand. The story of gas supply in the United States, in contrast to oil, is thus largely a domesticone.Compared to oil, the industry is relatively new. Natural gas is more difficult to transport in its gaseousform through pipelines and particularly challenging in its cryogenic form when transported as a liquid.It's the latter problem that has kept liquefied natural gas imports at negligible levels.Drilling technologies for natural gas have mirrored those for oil, and through much of its history youcould not tell whether a successful drilling hit would turn up valuable crude oil or natural gas, whichwas often flared for lack of transport facilities.But with many of the transportation hurdles surmounted, demand has surged over the past twodecades, reflecting the myriad new uses for natural gas in industry and as a clean-burning source ofelectric power.At times in recent years, supply has not kept pace with the growth of demand. The inventories ofnatural gas held in underground storage caverns were drawn down to record low levels late last year.As a consequence, spot prices of gas quadrupled, engendering a huge surge in domestic drilling.But the very technologies that have improved our drilling success rates have also enabled us to drainnewly discovered gas reservoirs at an increasingly faster pace. Data for Texas, for example, show thatin recent years more than 50 percent of recoverable reserves were extracted from wells in the firstyear of operation, compared with roughly 25 percent in the 1980s. As a consequence, to achieve arise in net marketed gas, gross new discoveries, and the drilling activity associated with them, havehad to accelerate.The combination of demand for environmentally superior gas in our power plants – virtually all newelectric power facilities now on the drawing board are gas fired or dual-fired – and continuedexpansion of household and industrial use is putting significant pressure on the reserve base. To meetthose needs, the always-present tradeoff between our energy requirements and environmentalconcerns will doubtless be heightened in the years ahead.Such inevitable tradeoffs have stimulated renewed interest in a greater expansion of coal, nuclearpower, and nonconventional sources of energy. For example, the nation has large reserves of coal,and, in terms of thermal equivalents, we produce more of it than either natural gas or petroleum.Moreover, rapid technological improvements in coal mining have resulted in productivity gains in thisindustry that have exceeded those for the economy as a whole by a wide margin and led to sizabledeclines in the relative price of coal.Still, the use of coal has been restrained by environmental concerns over emissions from coal-burningpower plants. Technology has already alleviated some of these concerns and, given the realistic rangeof alternatives, coal is likely to remain a significant factor in to our energy future.An obvious major alternative to coal in electric power generation is nuclear power. Low prices forcompeting fuels and concerns about safety have been a drag on this industry. Still, its share ofelectricity production in the United States has increased from less than 5 percent in 1973 to about 20percent in 2000. Given the steps that have been taken over the years to make nuclear energy saferand the obvious environmental advantages it has in terms of reducing emissions, the time may havecome to consider whether we can overcome the impediments to tapping its potential more fully. Upfront, of course, is the challenge of finding an acceptable way to store spent fuel and radioactivewaste. If this problem can be resolved and if some of the long-deferred research and developmentefforts to make nuclear power more economical were to bear fruit, the potential for nuclear powercould doubtless be enlarged.The remainder of our domestic energy production comes from a variety of renewable energy sources,the most prominent of which are hydroelectric power from dams and the energy generated through therecycling of waste and byproducts from industry and agriculture. Solar and wind power have provedeconomical in some small-scale and specialized uses, but together they account for only a tiny fractionof renewable energy.
BIS Review 60/20015More broadly, substantial experimentation and exploration is under way in the application of advancedtechnologies to alternative approaches to energy production and conservation. Improvements in fuelcell technology, for example, hold considerable promise in a wide variety of commercial applications.With rapid scientific advances, it is not inconceivable that technological breakthroughs will allownonconventional energy sources to play a larger role in meeting our demand for energy than iscurrently the case.In closing, I would like to stress again the importance of developments in energy markets for both thenear-term and longer-run health of our nation's economy. In the short run, energy markets must bemonitored closely for their potential effects on the cyclical behavior of the macroeconomy. Over thelonger haul, the experience of the past fifty years – and indeed much longer than that – suggests thecentral role that can be played by market forces in conserving scarce energy resources, directingthose resources to their highest valued uses, and ultimately ensuring adequate productive capacity forthe future.To be sure, energy issues present policymakers and citizens with difficult decisions and tradeoffs tomake outside the market process; as always, national security and environmental concerns need to beaddressed in setting policy. But those concerns should be addressed in a manner that, to the greatestextent possible, does not distort or stifle the meaningful functioning of our markets. We mustremember that the same price signals that are so critical for the allocative process in the short run alsosignal profit opportunities for long-term supply expansion. Moreover, they stimulate the research anddevelopment that will unlock new approaches to energy production and use that we can now onlyscarcely envision. I look forward to a future that is bright in more ways than one.
BIS Review 59/20011Juergen Stark: Reform propositions and the shaping of a new financialarchitectureRemarks by Mr Juergen Stark, Deputy Governor of the Deutsche Bundesbank, during a paneldiscussion at a conference, “International financial architecture: recent issues and alternatives ofreform”, organised by the Konrad Adenauer Stiftung and the Brazilian Institute of Economics-GetulioVargas Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, 26 June 2001.*      *      *ITo state my standpoint in advance: I myself do not believe a completely new financial architecture tobe necessary. I tend to be one of those people who do want to improve the free market economysystem, but who also want to preserve that which has stood the test of time. Much would already begained if free market and institutional rules were to be applied more consistently.IIThere cannot be any therapy without a preceding diagnosis. We have to find out what went wrong,and why, before discussing the remedies. The recent crises have undoubtedly revealed theshortcomings of the system. As I see it, in every case – despite all the individual differences – thesewere due to a mixture of economic policy errors and inadequate underlying conditions.In almost all the recent crises, the economic policy errors seem to have been the same:(cid:1) a long period of fixed exchange rates (followed by a loss of external competitiveness, a risein interest rates, a considerable set-back in growth rates, and a devaluation of currencies);(cid:1) an increase in inflation rates;(cid:1) and increasing budget deficits.This problem was addressed by the Bundesbank in a research study which it published in its April1999 Monthly Report. The Bundesbank based its research on econometric procedures, applied todevelopments in major emerging markets over the past 25 years. The main conclusions reached bythe study were(cid:1) that currency crises are not the result of pure chance or pure speculation;(cid:1) that economic fundamentals play an important role;(cid:1) and that, in particular, in the year preceding the outbreak of a crisis, the macroeconomicindicators deteriorated perceptibly;(cid:1) on the other hand, although there is a systematic link between fundamentals and crises, theindicators are not able to forecast a crisis in each and every case (there may be warningsignals not followed by a crisis, and there may be crises not preceded by signals).These conclusions are quite important for crisis prevention. Above and beyond that, whetherundesirable economic policy developments expand into a crisis or not hinges mainly on shortcomingsin the underlying conditions. These include(cid:1) weak financial sectors;(cid:1) tendencies towards nepotism, cronyism, and corruption;(cid:1) distorting bail-out expectations on the part of market participants, including moral hazard;(cid:1) insufficient information on current developments;(cid:1) insufficient surveillance by the IMF and contradicting actions by other institutions;(cid:1) a disregard of advice and agreements, accompanied by poor co-operation with theinternational organisations.
2BIS Review 59/2001IIIWhat are my reform proposals and how should the “financial architecture” be shaped? Let me startwith the design of economic policy. This is clearly a matter of the financial architecture as far as thefundamental characteristics are concerned.First of all: the exchange rates. The very interesting fixed-versus-floating rate debate is an issue onwhich there is no simple “yes” or “no” answer. The choice of an exchange-rate system can only bejudged with reference to a country’s state of development, its economic benchmarks and its politicalcircumstances.Experience suggests that stable exchange rates are generally desirable. In some special, well-definedcases, exchange rate pegging can be useful in getting domestic inflation under control and inmaintaining financial stability.In the long run, however, a country that has given priority to pegged rates must ascertain whether ornot it can keep its internal flexibility sufficiently high to enable it to make all the necessary adjustments.In particular, with priority given to fixed rates, monetary policy has to be completely subordinate to theexchange-rate target. Moreover, there is not much room for budgetary policy. It has to be conducted ina stability-oriented manner in order to keep up domestic and external confidence. Thus, a stableexchange rate is only sustainable if the corresponding fundamentals are adequately streamlined. Apegged currency alone cannot guarantee market confidence on a lasting basis.On the other hand, if the fundamentals of a country are fairly sound, and, in particular, if monetarypolicy can be conducted on the basis of an "own" nominal anchor (i.e. independently, with a strongsense of responsibility and a firm view of stability) a floating exchange rate may support the necessaryadjustments of a country that is emerging into an advanced economy. In general, with a floating rate,the room for manoeuvre will be larger. But be careful: flexible rates are not a panacea, they are not asubstitute for keeping your house in order.It may be asked at this point whether European monetary integration can be a model for an emergingregion. There is no simple answer to that. In my view, one has to be aware of mainly three points:Firstly, the decision to adopt a single currency is inevitably a political one. Secondly, a monetary unioncannot be a cure for otherwise deficient economies. And thirdly, a monetary region clearly requiresinternal openness and implies convergence and intense competition. Some radical adjustments maybe necessary.IVMy next point: the liberalisation of capital movements.In principle, the fact that the free movement of capital contributes to the optimum allocation ofresources is not open to question. But that must not imply liberalisation at all costs.One important conclusion from recent crises is that the focus on so-called “sequencing” has to bestrengthened. That means: further liberalisation only in those countries where the financial marketsand, in particular, the banking system have a sound structure and are in a healthy condition. Knowingthe risks, it would be irresponsible to take the second step before the first.On the other hand, there is no doubt, from my point of view, that capital controls are not a realisticalternative to open capital markets. The reintroduction or maintenance of administrative controls in anotherwise liberal environment poses fundamental problems.Firstly, market participants will always contrive to avoid such controls and, if anything, they are moreimaginative than the controlling authorities.Secondly, capital restrictions are very expensive to implement in most cases. To be effective, theymust be applied quite broadly and may therefore also hinder desirable capital movements. What ismore, they may also delay the necessary development of an efficient financial sector.However, this does not completely rule out the possibility of considering temporary restrictions inexceptional cases. Limited controls on capital inflows can help to prevent crises by confining potentialwithdrawals. Such controls, however, can only be efficient if they are clearly understood as an interimmeasure, and if they are complemented by sound policies and well-designed prudential regulations.
BIS Review 59/20013VAs far as the underlying conditions are concerned, allow me here to point out only those that continueto be critical or especially fraught with problems: standards and codes, transparency, conditionalityand ownership, private sector involvement, and institutional co-ordination.But first of all, let me come back to the topic of financial supervision. I think, adequate supervision isthe sine qua non of a robust system.(cid:1) If the rules for balancing the inherent risks in assets with the domestic and foreign resourcesare insufficient, they encourage an inappropriate allocation of assets and the banking systembecomes inefficient;(cid:1) foreign debt should be adequately structured to worst-case scenarios, which – sooner orlater – may occur in almost any country;(cid:1) the maturity structure of banks’ foreign liabilities should not be dangerously biased towardshort-term positions, and the denomination of liabilities in foreign currencies can be ratherrisky in the face of domestic currency assets (withdrawals can lead to collapse).Let me say this: With more prudent banking structures and more appropriate supervision, capitalinflows and investments are more realistic, and closer to an optimum. Actual crises could be mitigatedor even be avoided. By the way, I do not think that banking supervision has anything to do withrestrictions or over-regulation. On every highway we need a highway code, and in the cities we need acertain minimum number of traffic lights. Otherwise, movements could end up in disaster.VINow to “transparency”.This is the area in which there has probably been the greatest change over the past few years – notonly in the case of the international institutions, but also in the countries themselves. There has been asignificant expansion in the publication of surveillance reports and in the disclosure of information onlending.For improving financial market transparency, it is in fact important that comprehensive information bemade available and be analysed and evaluated thoroughly. Data contribute to stabilising the globalfinancial system. They strengthen the operational efficiency of the markets, investors are better able tomake appropriate risk assessments, and, hopefully, the contagion risk and the associated herd instinctwill be reduced.All this is clear. Again, however, let me signal some warnings:(cid:1) Transparency should not work counter-productively. It should have its limits whereconfidentiality and internal openness are indispensable to fruitful discussions and optimalresults.(cid:1) Moreover, as indicated above, one has to be very careful with detailed information that mayperhaps be evaluated carelessly. And the IMF should abstain from commenting on each andevery number. There is no guarantee that certain indicators always give the right signals,and a crisis could be triggered that would otherwise not have taken place.(cid:1) Too frequent information may favour short-termism, and interfere with the economic culture.Permanently looking at short-term profits, for instance, may be counter-productive in thelonger-run.(cid:1) Last but not least, I sometimes have the feeling that we do not have a lack of information butan abundance. In fact, staffs have to spend some time in sorting out useful from uselessinformation (and sometimes produce new papers with even more information).VIIOn “standards and codes” in general: This is a complicated matter.
4BIS Review 59/2001On the one hand, it is probably correct to say that the recent currency crises were due, at least in part,to careless or "immature" patterns of behaviour. In that respect, standards and codes set criteria andrequire the countries to "behave correctly". The basic idea of drawing up "rules" and of thus makingthe interaction on the internationally linked markets easier, predictable and perhaps also more "just", issurely not wrong either. I give my full support to such rules if they serve the efficiency of the markets(for instance: eliminating corruption and combating money laundering).On the other hand, there are problems which might hamper the desired success:(cid:1) There are now more than 60 standards and codes. Over 10,000 assessments would have tobe prepared in order to monitor them for all 183 IMF countries. This simply cannot bemanaged. Besides, the cost would be out of all reasonable proportion to the benefit.(cid:1) Not all standards and codes have a relation to economics. For that reason, too, prioritieshave to be set.(cid:1) Furthermore, there is not always a compelling reason for everything having to be done inaccordance with one given standard. Is that really an indispensable precondition for themarkets to function efficiently?(cid:1) It is also difficult to answer the question of whether there really have to be rules that may wellenhance efficiency but perhaps ignore cultural diversity as well.Thus, my conclusion at this point is: We have to be careful, we should not carry things too far, and notat all costs.VIIIAfter “standards and codes”, the logical next topic is “conditionality and ownership”. As we all know,the IMF has always been subject to criticism that it sets conditions for its lending that are toodemanding, that it "imposes" its programmes, even that it puts a "gag" on the borrowing countries andrestricts their sovereignty.Some of that criticism is justified. It is, in fact, counterproductive if the borrowing country is notsufficiently involved, if its priorities are not taken into account and if programmes are so detailed thatthe country in question no longer has any freedom of action. In that respect, the IMF was on the wrongpath. Things are changing at present, however. I fully support the strategy of focusing in future moreon the objectives of securing the borrowing country's ownership and of dispensing with detailedrequirements for implementation (technical assistance should continue however).But let us not deceive ourselves: The freedom of a patient is limited in any case. It may become evensmaller, if the IMF keeps out completely. The constraints of the facts may be overwhelming. Diseasesare likely to take their toll. On the other hand, there is certainly a realistic chance that healing powersare at work. These powers, however, have to be actively supported by the patient (with or without theIMF).IXMuch has been done with regard to “private sector involvement” (PSI). But we have not yet arrived atfinal conclusions. Sometimes it seems that this is only a matter of crisis solution. In fact, however, it isnot. It is, in my view, predominantly a matter of crisis prevention. That is because the manner ofoperating in the event of crisis has a crucial influence on expectations. These, in turn, determine theactions of investors at a very early stage and thus the scale of the risks and of susceptibility to crisis.Short-term financial assistance from the IMF in the event of crisis may be essential, both for thecountries directly affected and, as a result of contagion, for the rest of the world. A regular bail-out ofthe private sector, however, is likely to be counter-productive:(cid:1) It may have a detrimental effect on the risk-awareness of private investors and obscure theoptimal allocation of resources;(cid:1) large-scale financial packages may support unsustainable exchange rates;(cid:1) large-scale financing by the IMF brings about financial burdens that cannot be covered bythe Fund’s resources;
BIS Review 59/20015(cid:1) and, last but not least, endless financing may encourage resistance to the implementation ofreforms.My conclusion at this point: The role of the IMF should be predominantly a catalytic one. For thatpurpose, the Fund’s main instruments should be convincing advice and programmes, not money.Priority has to be given to the private market participants. The leitmotif of the Fund has to be “bail-in”,not “bail-out”.Admittedly, it is not easy to find the right balance between “bail-in” and the avoidance of contagion.Now, there are some fresh ideas from Lerrick and Meltzer. They propose, as I understand it, thatmarkets should more or less be left alone in the event of crisis (bail-in), but that, nevertheless, theFund should offer a minimum safety net to avoid panic (by purchasing private creditors’ assets at awell-defined discount). At first sight, this looks good. I suspect, however, that we partly shall have thesame deficiencies here as mentioned above – only in a new wrapping.XMy last point, although it is no less important, is “institutional co-ordination”. Activity by private marketparticipants is fine, but it is not sufficient. We need some public activity to organise the legislative basisand to provide other public goods in order to maximise global benefits.Let’s look at the IMF and the World Bank. There have been many suggestions for improving theireffectiveness, from merging these institutions to abolishing them altogether. I cannot say that Iparticularly like those extremes.Rather, in a changed global economic setting, the IMF needs a clear mandate. This applies as muchto crisis problems as its does to demarcating the IMF’s institutional role vis-à-vis the World Bank.The roles of the IMF and the World Bank need to be strengthened. They should act as advisers onmacroeconomic, structural and development policy issues, but their role as lenders should be limitedto that of a catalyst. These objectives are consistent with the Articles of Agreement of both the IMFand the World Bank and take due account of the changed environment since the Bretton Woodsinstitutions were set up: floating exchange rates, liberalisation of capital movements, globalisation ofmarkets, and heightened awareness of poverty problems.The IMF is designed as a monetary institution, whereas the World Bank is a developmentorganisation. A blurring of their responsibilities is just as undesirable as a merger of the two. Theimplications for lending have to logically follow from that division of responsibilities. The IMF shouldconfine its balance of payments funding to short-term liquidity assistance. The World Bank shouldfocus on project financing and sectoral loans. This would involve a redistribution of tasks between theIMF and the World Bank: the IMF should at least confine its long-term structural loans, and the WorldBank should avoid participating in crisis packages. Moreover, combating poverty is a developmentpolicy objective and therefore comes within the purview of the World Bank. The IMF plays its own partin combating poverty by fostering monetary stability and thereby contributing to non-inflationarysustainable growth.
BIS Review 59/20011David Dodge: Canada’s monetary policy approach: it works for CanadiansRemarks by Mr David Dodge, Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the Edmonton Chamber ofCommerce, Edmonton, Alberta, 26 June 2001.*      *      *I welcome this opportunity to talk to you today. In recent months, the debate over Canada's exchangerate system has heated up and calls for the adoption of a common currency with the United Stateshave attracted a lot of attention.Today, I would like to revisit the issue of the appropriate exchange rate regime for Canada and to setout as clearly as possible the Bank's position. I propose to frame my discussion in terms of Canada'sapproach to monetary policy. I will conclude with some comments on the current economic situation.The goal of monetary policy and how to achieve itThe Bank of Canada's commitment is to contribute to the economic well-being of Canadians. Thismeans conducting monetary policy so that it fosters sustained economic growth – by creatingconditions that favour rising output, employment, and incomes, and a stable macroeconomicenvironment.Low, stable, and predictable inflationExperience over time and across countries has taught us that the best contribution monetary policycan make to a sound economy is to preserve confidence in the value of money. Fundamentally, thismeans that Canadians should be able to count on their central bank to keep future inflation low,stable, and predictable. In this way, they can go confidently about their affairs, making soundeconomic decisions. This, in turn, should lead to better economic performance nationally.Seen in this light, the focus on low inflation is not an end in itself, but rather a means to an end – theend being the advancement of the economic well-being of Canadians.Of course, a low-inflation policy by itself is not sufficient to guarantee the best economic outcome forCanada. Fiscal prudence and other policies that aim to improve the structure and flexibility of theeconomy are also essential. But low inflation provides a crucial underpinning to a well-functioningeconomy.If the goal of monetary policy is to achieve and preserve low inflation, how would the central bank goabout it?Anchors for monetary policyWhen a central bank raises or lowers its key policy interest rate, it sets in motion a series of eventsthat starts with the financial markets, works through changes in spending, output, and employment,and ends with an effect on the rate of inflation. This series of events is known as the transmissionmechanism of monetary policy.The problem is that the transmission process is lengthy. So it takes time for monetary policy actions toaffect output and inflation. Some effects are felt relatively quickly. But the full effects are not felt forsome time – 3 to 6 quarters in the case of output and 6 to 8 quarters in the case of inflation. Thismeans that, as central bankers go about their day-to-day business of implementing monetary policy,they must look ahead and anticipate what is likely to happen down the road. They have to work withassumptions and make judgment calls about future economic developments and about the timing andfinal outcome of any monetary policy action they take. All of this involves considerable uncertainty.This being said, as we look around the world, there have been different ways to focus the conduct ofmonetary policy and to give people greater comfort that things are on track, thus helping to tie down or"anchor" inflation expectations.Most countries have now adopted some kind of explicit target or anchor for monetary policy. Themajor exception is the United States, where a statement of general intentions with respect to inflation
2BIS Review 59/2001has, in recent years, proven sufficient to anchor monetary policy, in light of the U.S. Federal Reserve'sstrong credibility.In terms of explicit anchors, there have been targets for monetary aggregates, fixed exchange rates,and inflation targets. . . . targeting monetary aggregatesMost industrialized countries, including Canada, have in the past tried to target the rate of moneygrowth.However, in both Canada and the United States, targets for money growth have not proven to be aneffective monetary anchor. Deregulation and financial innovation have weakened the reliability ofmoney measures, and the relationship between money growth and the rate of inflation has provenunstable. But we still look at money for its information content about current and future developmentsin output and inflation.For all practical purposes, then, there are only two options today in terms of explicit anchors formonetary policy: fixing the exchange rate or targeting inflation.. . . fixing the exchange rateFor many countries, especially smaller ones, tying their currency to that of a larger neighbour or majortrading partner with a history of low inflation is one way to achieve a low rate of inflation.There are, of course, different forms of fixed exchange rates. They can range from 'softer'systems – such as a peg – to 'harder' fixes that lie at the opposite extreme from a free floatingcurrency. These harder fixes can be a currency board, the outright use of another country's currency("dollarization"), or a full monetary union.Pegged exchange rates that can be adjusted (that is, revalued or devalued) have been the mostwidely used anchor since the Second World War. They were the prevailing order under the BrettonWoods system, which was established after the war and lasted until the early 1970s, when it finallycollapsed in the face of increasingly open financial markets, large capital flows, and U.S. expansionarypolicies.The problem with a fixed, but adjustable, exchange rate is that it does not guarantee that the value ofthe currency relative to other currencies, and thus its purchasing power, will not rise or fall. Forexample, the currency could come under downward pressure if it is pegged at a level that is out of linewith the country's economic situation (say, because of large and growing fiscal deficits and debts).Should the markets then begin to question the authorities' commitment to the peg, domestic andforeign investors would scramble to get out, triggering a currency crisis. There is no shortage of suchexamples in recent history: repeated episodes in Latin America since the 1980s, crises in Europe in1992 and 1993, and in Southeast Asia and Russia in 1997–98.Because pegs have proven problematic, a more realistic approach would involve adopting one of themore rigid fixes. I will have more to say about this later. But let me move on now to the third option foran explicit monetary policy anchor – inflation targets.. . . targeting inflationAmong a number of industrialized countries that, like Canada, are operating a floating currency, therehas been a tendency over the past decade to adopt explicit inflation targets as the anchor formonetary policy. The same tendency is now evident among a growing number of emerging-marketeconomies that have recently moved to flexible exchange rates following the collapse of their peggedrates. The objective is to consistently maintain low and stable inflation, while the flexible exchange ratehelps the economy to adjust to shocks.Why inflation targets and how do they work to guide monetary policy?In such a framework, the central bank targets the rate of inflation – say, 2 per cent – several quartersahead. Then, based on its judgment of the current and projected strength of demand relative to theeconomy's production capacity, as well as the implications for future inflation relative to the target, itwill take action now – because of the long lags involved – to ensure that the target is achieved downthe road.
BIS Review 59/20013The value of the inflation target as an anchor: the Canadian experienceIn Canada, explicit inflation targets were jointly introduced by the Government of Canada and theBank of Canada in 1991. Since 1995, the goal has been to keep the trend of inflation inside a targetrange of 1 to 3 per cent.In adopting the targets, the Bank expected that they would provide a useful framework within which toassure Canadians that inflation would remain low and stable, thus leading to less fluctuation in outputand employment. We also expected that the targets would provide a precise goal against which tomeasure the conduct of monetary policy, thus helping to increase the Bank's public accountability.After a decade of experience, it is clear that inflation targeting has proven to be an effective way ofkeeping inflation low, and that an inflation target provides an anchor for inflation expectations.Moreover, that target has supplied the Bank with a mechanism for assessing, and dealing with,demand pressures on future inflation in a way that helps to keep the economy on a more even keel.Indeed, there is already some evidence that the pronounced ups and downs in economic activity, sotypical of the past, have diminished.Here's how the target helps the Bank to ‘stabilize' the economy. When demand pushes against theeconomy's capacity to produce and seems likely to put upward pressure on future inflation relative tothe target, the Bank will raise interest rates. This will help to moderate demand and reduce inflationpressures. Equally importantly, when demand is weak and seems likely to put downward pressure onfuture inflation relative to the target, the Bank will lower interest rates, thus providing more room for theeconomy to expand.In short, the emphasis on inflation control allows the Bank to support growth when the economy isweak and to prevent overheating when the economy is strong and is pushing against capacityconstraints. Now, this goes back to what I was saying at the beginning – that monetary policycontributes to sound economic performance by means of its focus on low inflation.With a low-inflation climate encouraging further initiatives by Canadian businesses to improve costcontrol, efficiency, and productivity, and with marked fiscal progress by all levels of government, oureconomy has performed well over the past several years. And it has generated solid gains inemployment and incomes.In light of the important economic and social benefits that low inflation and inflation targets havedelivered, the federal government and the Bank of Canada recently agreed to retain the current targetof 1 to 3 per cent. To increase the chances that inflation stays inside that range, the Bank will now beaiming expressly at the 2 per cent midpoint. Moreover, the new agreement runs for five years, insteadof three, to the end of 2006. Both of these changes should help to increase predictability and toreassure Canadians that low inflation will be a continuing feature of the domestic economic scene.Now, let us see how the exchange rate fits in all this and why Canada needs a floating currency.Why do we need a floating exchange rate?If we want to set our own goal for inflation or, what's more relevant (since today all industrial countriespursue a similar low-inflation objective), if we want to run a monetary policy suited to our own distincteconomic circumstances, we need monetary independence. Monetary independence can exist onlywithin a flexible exchange rate system.The real value of a floating currency for Canada lies in helping our economy to absorb some of theimpact of external shocks. A classic example would be a sharp movement in the value of our exportsrelative to our imports, such as occurred in 1997–98, when world commodity prices plummeted in thewake of the Asian crisis. In that instance, a downward movement in the value of the Canadian dollarhelped offset some of the losses suffered by our commodity producers. More importantly, itstrengthened the competitiveness of Canadian manufacturers. They, in turn, were able to expandproduction and offset some of the downward pressure on output and incomes from the decline in thecommodity sector. In this way, our national economy was able to adjust more quickly, and with lessoverall fluctuation in output and employment, than if the exchange rate did not move.Consider what would have happened under a fixed exchange rate. With the exchange rate not allowedto move, domestic wages and prices would have had to decline to restore external competitiveness.
4BIS Review 59/2001And since neither wages nor prices are flexible enough to adjust quickly, much of that adjustmentwould have had to come through declines in output and employment.In a world where capital is free to move across national borders, a floating exchange rate can alsohelp to absorb some of the pressures stemming from large capital flows and to facilitate anynecessary economic adjustments. Indeed, I would remind you that the decision to float the Canadiandollar in 1950, and again in 1970, was taken in the context of large capital inflows (and risingcommodity prices) that were causing concerns about their inflationary effects on our economy andwere putting strong upward pressure on our currency.The key point in all this is that Canada cannot insulate itself from external shocks. Whether we are ona flexible or a fixed exchange rate, the reality is that those shocks require a domestic adjustment. And,in the end, that adjustment will be made – one way or another. But, without the flexibility a floatingcurrency can provide, it will take longer, be more difficult, and cost more overall in terms of lost outputand jobs.Now, when the exchange rate moves up or down, there has to be some way to anchor expectationsabout its value. Otherwise, the freedom of the currency to float could, in the context of a downwardmovement, undermine confidence in its value on world markets and at home. Under our approach tomonetary policy, the domestic inflation target serves as that all-important anchor for the exchangerate.The inflation target and a floating currency work well together – indeed, they reinforce each other. Andthey both have very significant economic benefits for Canada.These days, the advantages of a monetary policy approach based on inflation targets and supportedby a flexible exchange rate regime are being increasingly recognized by others around the world. AndCanada is often held up as a model. Why then the calls in this country to go back to pegging ourcurrency to the U.S. dollar or to enter into a currency union with the United States?Pegging would mean losing the macroeconomic benefits of a flexible exchange rate, without gainingthe assurance that the exchange rate will not move in the future. So what people are talking aboutnow is a currency union with the United States.On the face of it, the prospective gains from such an arrangement would seem to be attractive. Afterall, Canada is one of the most open economies in the world, exporting over 40 per cent of its outputand importing about as much. Moreover, 80 per cent of this trade is with the United States. So, yes, byadopting the U.S. dollar, Canadians could save on the transactions costs of converting nationalcurrencies and hedging against currency movements. There could also be some other advantageslinked to the improved efficiency that can result from reduced exchange rate uncertainty.The crucial question, however, is whether the savings from such an arrangement would compensatefor the loss of monetary policy independence and for the loss of the buffer that a flexible exchangerate provides against economic shocks.Research by the Bank of Canada and by many outside analysts confirms that Canada benefitssignificantly from having a separate currency and a floating exchange rate. It is true that Canada andthe United States share many characteristics. But when it comes to economic structure, there aremany important differences. Not only is our economy far more open than that of the United States, butCanada is also more dependent on raw materials. Moreover, while we are net exporters of primarycommodities, the Americans are net importers. Sharp swings in world commodity prices have a muchgreater impact on economic activity in Canada and, more importantly, they affect us differently thanour neighbours. It is very clear that the structure of our economy is sufficiently distinct from that of theUnited States that a flexible exchange rate can play a key role in facilitating the domestic economicadjustment to such shocks.From a strictly economic perspective, it is always possible that, at some future time, the structures ofour two economies could converge to a point that the benefits of a common currency could outweighthe macroeconomic costs of abandoning our flexible exchange rate. But it is also possible that thosestructures could diverge further (if more trade led to greater specialization). We simply do not know. Iwould emphasize, however, that the crucial factor here is not the extent of the integration betweenCanada and the United States, but rather how close or how far apart our economic structures are, orwill be.Former Bank of Canada Governor Thiessen put it well last December when he said that "as long aswe remain a major producer of primary commodities, and as long as we want to pursue separate
BIS Review 59/20015economic policies that are suited to our own circumstances and that require differing monetaryconditions, the shock-absorber element of a floating currency will serve us well."I fully associated myself with this view during my appearance last month before the House ofCommons Standing Committee on Finance. I said: "it's quite clear that at this stage in our evolution, afloating currency for Canada vis-à-vis the United States . . . is a great advantage because thestructures of our economies differ."Thus, one may not argue that, for all time and under all circumstances, a floating currency will be theright solution for Canada. But, what I can say is that, given the structure of our economy, for now andfor as far into the future as I can see, the advantages of a flexible exchange rate, anchored by adomestic inflation target, clearly outweigh the benefits of a currency union. And they will certainlyalways outweigh those of a peg.I hope that I have made it clear today that Canada's monetary policy approach of a flexible exchangerate, anchored by an inflation target, works. There is no need to fix it.Let me now conclude my presentation by giving you our latest reading of the economy.Recent economic developmentsSince late last year, the pace of economic expansion in Canada has slowed substantially, mainlybecause U.S. demand for our products has been much weaker than anticipated. Canadianmanufacturers, particularly of motor vehicles, electronic products, and telecommunications equipment,have had to make very significant adjustments. At the same time, final domestic demand in Canadahas remained firm, buttressed by underlying strength in the energy sector, retail sales, housing,non-residential construction, and most service industries. National accounts data to the end of Marchand more recent indicators show that our economy has been expanding at a moderate pace since thelast quarter of 2000.As we look ahead, we see domestic demand in Canada continuing to grow, supported by the easingthat has taken place in monetary conditions, the recent tax cuts that are boosting disposable incomes,gains in employment, and the projected completion of the current inventory adjustment.We also continue to see U.S. demand growth picking up in the second half of 2001, given substantialreductions in interest rates, relatively high levels of consumer spending, the expected end of theinventory correction, and recently announced tax cuts (which include rebates beginning in July). Butbecause of the ongoing weakness in U.S. capital investment, there is still uncertainty about the exacttiming and strength of the projected pickup in U.S. growth in the second half of the year.While that uncertainty poses some risks for Canada, we continue to expect that the pace of economicexpansion here will pick up in the second half of the year and strengthen somewhat further in thecourse of 2002.Total CPI inflation has recently been above the top of the Bank's 1 to 3 per cent target range becauseof rising energy prices, including higher electricity rates. Total CPI inflation will probably remain volatileover the next couple of months, before moving down to about 2 per cent by the end of the year, ifworld prices for crude oil and natural gas stabilize around current levels.The main risk to the Canadian economic outlook continues to be the possibility that the projectedpickup in U.S. growth may be delayed. At the same time, even though the prices of crude oil andnatural gas have eased from their recent peaks, the Bank will need to stay alert to any signs of energycosts spilling over into other consumer prices, and thus putting upward pressure on the trend ofinflation. In light of these risks, the Bank will have to continue to monitor the situation very carefully.In sum, the Bank remains positive about Canada's economic prospects. We continue to expect thatthe economy will grow by between 2 and 3 per cent this year and return to a somewhat higher growthpath in 2002. This judgment is based on recent evidence that is broadly in line with the Bank'sexpectations. And it is supported by the marked improvement in our economic fundamentals, whichgives Canada a very good chance to weather the current economic difficulties.
BIS Review 58/20011Mervyn King: A tale of two citiesSpeech by Mr Mervyn King, Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, at Cardiff Business School,Cardiff University, 18 June 2001.*      *      *Vice-chancellor, ladies and gentlemen,It was once said that economic forecasters are the unfathomable in pursuit of the unpredictable. As astudent I found this odd. Whenever England played Wales at rugby the result was wholly predictable.The reason was simple. My fellow-student, Gerald Davies, ran faster than Englishmen, even when hecarried the ball and they didn't. Economics is, unfortunately, less straightforward. Yet any decision thatinvolves an elapse of time between its implementation and its effects requires a forecast. Time lagsare the essence of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. And that is why the MonetaryPolicy Committee spends much time thinking about the likely future path of the economy.The severe limits on our ability to anticipate future events means that forecasts can be no more than adescription of the relative likelihood of a range of possible outcomes. Anyone who presents you with apoint forecast for the future path of the economy is either concealing the most interesting part of theiranalysis, or suffering from self-deception. So the Monetary Policy Committee presents forecasts interms of probabilities. And it is the balance of risks to the economy which determines monetary policy.So what are the balance of risks to the British economy at present? Overall, the past five years havebeen a period of remarkable stability for the UK. Annual GDP growth has averaged 2.8%, and therehave been 35 consecutive quarters of positive economic growth. Since the MPC was set up in May1997, inflation has averaged 2.4%, very close to our target of 2½%, and been in the remarkablynarrow range of 2%-3% in 43 out of the past 49 months. This degree of stability reflects well on thenew framework for monetary policy in this country. But if I focus today on the risks ahead, it is notsimply because as a central banker I know that to every silver lining is attached a cloud, but becausethe small deviations of inflation from the target over the past four years give a misleading impressionof the greater volatility of inflation that we might reasonably expect to see in future.There are two sources of uncertainty facing the UK at present, one domestic and the otherinternational. Both are related to imbalances. The correction of these imbalances will pose challengesfor policy over the next few years.To see the domestic imbalance look beneath the relative tranquillity of the aggregate data to thesignificant turbulence among different sectors of the economy. It is obvious that there is an imbalancebetween those sectors of the economy most exposed to international competition and those sectorsfacing predominantly domestic competition. To describe this as a difference between manufacturingand services is too simple, but the point is clear. For that part of the economy producing internationallytradable, not just traded, goods and services, output is falling while consumer spending is buoyant. Asa result, there is a "tale of two cities" in which some industries are experiencing the worst of times, withdeclining manufacturing output, and others the best of times, with the latest retail sales figuresshowing an increase in the volume of sales over the past twelve months of 6.4%.Such imbalances are not uncommon. Indeed, I first used the phrase "tale of two cities" in early 1995 todescribe the contrast between strong demand for manufacturing output and weak retail sales, theopposite of the position today. Since then the economic see-saw has lurched from external todomestic demand, partly as a result of the continuing weakness of the euro which has led to a largeand persistent rise in the sterling effective exchange rate.The scale of the imbalances at home can be seen in figures for domestic and external demand.Whereas aggregate demand and output have risen at a fairly steady rate of around 2¾% over the pastfive years, domestic demand, supported by rapid money and credit growth, has risen much morerapidly than net external demand. Indeed, private final domestic demand grew at an average rate ofnearly 5% over this period, and its growth was in excess of 4% a year in four of the last five years.This imbalance between domestic demand and output has resulted in a rising trade deficit. Netexternal demand, exports less imports, actually made a negative contribution to total economic growthin each of the past five years. This is the first time that the external contribution to growth has beennegative for a period of five consecutive years since the 1870s. And that negative contribution is likelyto continue for the foreseeable future.
2BIS Review 58/2001Imbalances on this scale are unsustainable, although it is far from obvious for how long they cancontinue. At some point, the weakening balance sheet positions of the private sector will lead to aslowing of consumption and investment as households and firms, respectively, reduce spending tolower the ratio of debt to prospective income. Household debt to income and corporate debt to profitratios are at historically high levels. Moreover, within the corporate sector the debt levels of the mosthighly indebted companies – those in the top decile of the distribution of debt to profits ratios – areeven higher than in the early 1980s and early 1990s. That holds true even when the telecoms sector isexcluded. Spending might, therefore, be expected to decelerate in response to these balance sheetpositions. But, for the time being, final domestic demand continues to grow at above trend rates,exacerbating the imbalances within the economy and adding to the risk of a large adjustment at somepoint in the future. The continuing shift of resources to meet the demand for better public servicesmeans that private demand must grow much more slowly over the next few years. In turn, that wouldenable the trade deficit to stabilise and eventually fall back.The second uncertainty facing the UK is the slowdown in the world economy, and, in particular, thedownturn in the United States. In 2000, the world economy grew by 4.7%, the highest rate for twelveyears. And, stimulated by an increase in productivity growth, the US growth rate had reached almost6% a year in the first half of 2000. Such a rate was unlikely to have proved sustainable.Over the past five years productivity growth in the United States has risen markedly. Labourproductivity growth rose by more than 1 percentage point a year to an average of 2½%-3% between1995 and 2000. Some of this rise was the impact of new technology on efficiency, and some was theresult of greater investment in IT – capital deepening – which added significantly to the amount ofcapital with which each employee was working. But demand rose even more rapidly than the supply ofoutput, leading to a large current account deficit. The external imbalance was the mirror image of theinternal imbalance.So a slowdown in the US was not only unsurprising, it was desirable. But the speed of the turn-roundin the US has taken most commentators by surprise. Investment in IT, which had been growing ataround 20% a year, actually fell in the first quarter. As a result, and as in the UK, the US hasexperienced a fall in manufacturing output while consumption and the housing market appear moreresilient. Prompt action by the Federal Reserve has so far limited the slowdown to a downturn ininventories and fixed investment. Whether the slowdown in the US will be more prolonged than isembodied in the current consensus view will depend critically upon personal consumption. And, inturn, that will depend upon expectations of future productivity and hence income growth in the US.If there were to be a reappraisal of the extent of the increase in productivity growth in the US, thenthere might be a further downward revision of asset prices and a lower path for consumptionspending. So far, the evidence, both from consumption directly, and financial markets indirectly,suggests that no major reappraisal has occurred. Share prices have fallen from their peaks of lastyear. But price to earnings ratios remain well above historical levels. The average P/E ratio in the USsince 1900 was around 14. The ratio peaked at over 30, falling back to current levels of well over 20.Interestingly, the divergence of valuation between hi-tech and other companies has virtuallydisappeared in recent months. There has also been a reduction in the perception of downside risks toequity returns. Returns on shares are usually negatively skewed; that is, there is a greater chance of areturn below rather than above its expected value. During the course of this year, the degree ofnegative skew has fallen in the US, suggesting that market expectations of further sharp falls is shareprices have diminished.Of course a reappraisal of the future growth of productivity could yet occur. The recent fall in ITspending will, at least in the short run, reduce the contribution to higher productivity growth fromcapital deepening. It is never easy to detect changes in underlying productivity growth because a largequantity of data is needed to distinguish clearly between changes in trend and cyclical movements.Nevertheless, there is no evidence to suggest that the rate at which computing processing power isincreasing – doubling every eighteen months according to Moore's Law – has diminished. Indeed,there have been suggestions that the pace of doubling of processing power is now closer to twelvemonths.But there is one reason for caution about estimates of higher future productivity growth, and that is theconventions used to measure output and hence productivity. It might seem obvious that a higher levelof gross domestic product, produced by the same number of person-hours, is an improvement inproductivity. But gross domestic product, GDP, is not value added. It is the latter which is the correctmeasure of output and it differs from the former by an appropriate allowance for depreciation of capital
BIS Review 58/20013goods. The proper measure of output is net domestic product, NDP. In normal circumstances, thegrowth rates of GDP and NDP are identical. But the two can differ when the average depreciation rateof the capital stock is changing, and that is exactly what has been happening recently. There has beena shift toward greater investment in short-lived assets, such as IT and computer software, and as aresult the average depreciation rate has risen. Part of the additional gross output is simply replacingthe higher proportion of capital that wears out each year. It makes no sense to include the higherdepreciation as part of increased output and hence higher productivity. A change in technology thatraises output today at the expense of output tomorrow is not an improvement in productivity. Usingestimates of growth rates of GDP will lead to an overestimate of the rise in productivity growth duringthe transition to higher depreciation rates. The rise in average depreciation rates in recent yearssuggests that the magnitude of this overestimation could be non-negligible, although more research isneeded. Moreover, as John Kay has pointed out, the measurement problem, and the overestimation ofoutput growth, is even more acute when the price of capital goods is falling relative to that of finalconsumption goods.What this argument suggests is that economists should be cautious about drawing strong conclusionsabout the future path of productivity growth. The changes in technology are real and evident in manyaspects of our home and business lives. But their implications for aggregate productivity growth aremuch more uncertain.The two uncertainties facing the UK economy at present, namely the imbalances both at home andoverseas, suggest that the Monetary Policy Committee may be in for a slightly bumpier ride over thenext four years than during its first four. So far, the Monetary Policy Committee has managed toachieve an overall balance in the economy despite the contrasting fortunes of the internationallyexposed and more sheltered sectors of the economy. But if these large imbalances are to unwind,then the Committee is likely to face a difficult challenge in trying to maintain a balance between totaldemand and supply. Controlling inflation in future may prove more difficult than over the past fouryears, and the longer the imbalances persist the greater the risk that the subsequent adjustments todemand, output and inflation are larger than those experienced recently.Any rebalancing of the economy is likely to be associated with a fall in the real exchange rate. But themagnitude and timing of that are not only uncertain, but also difficult for the MPC to influence. As SirSamuel Brittan wrote recently about expected changes in exchange rates: "These developments aremost likely to happen when they are least expected and least welcome". Although a sharp fall insterling has been the fervent wish of many manufacturers over the past four years, I recall the wordsof the person who told me: "think very carefully before you make a wish – it might come true". The onlyproblems worse than those of an excessively strong currency are those of an excessively weakcurrency.The existing imbalances pose risks also to the inflation outlook. Prices of services have tended to risefaster than those of goods – about 2% a year faster since 1990. But over the last twelve months thegap between the two inflation rates has exceeded three percentage points. Services inflation has beenin the 3-4% range for some time, but goods inflation declined steadily from over 3% in late 1995 toclose to zero in the spring. The strength of sterling was the main factor that lay behind this fall ingoods inflation. But there are now tentative signs of a pick up in goods prices and the retail salesdeflator. RPIY inflation has also risen during the course of this year from 1.5% to 2.8%. The MPC willmonitor the price data extremely carefully. But there is likely to be significant short-run volatility in theinflation figures over the coming months, and it would be unwise to read too much into the latestinflation figure because the rise from 2.0% to 2.4%, although the lar gest one-month increase sinceOctober 1996, was largely accounted for by jumps in the prices of seasonal food and petrol.There is, I believe, broad-based support for the objective of setting interest rates to meet the inflationtarget. Quarterly opinion polls since November 1999, commissioned by the Bank of England andpublished in our Quarterly Bulletin, provide support for this proposition. But it is clear that the MPC stillhas much work to do to explain how interest rates affect the economy. Building a constituency for lowinflation is a primary objective of the Bank, and one to which we attach great importance. Support forlow inflation, and stability more generally, cannot be taken for granted, nor based solely on fadingrecollections of boom and bust. There is a new generation with little memory of the high and unstableinflation rates of the past. The Bank has, therefore, started an annual competition for schools in whichstudents play the role of the Monetary Policy Committee. The first year's competition attracted over200 entries, and culminated in the national final at the Bank of England in March. Next year'scompetition has just been announced, and I would encourage as many schools as possible to enterthe competition and pit their wits against the MPC. I am delighted to report that Bassaleg
4BIS Review 58/2001Comprehensive School in Newport, who won last year's South Wales regional heat, were the firstteam in the UK to enter this year's competition.Success in explaining the objectives of monetary policy, building the constituency for low inflation, andsetting policy in order to meet the inflation target, are all key parts of the role of the Monetary PolicyCommittee. But the MPC cannot fine-tune the economy quarter by quarter. Its contribution to stabilityis to meet the symmetric inflation target of 2½%, looking beyond the immediate short-term fluctuationsin monthly inflation rates. The Committee will have to watch carefully developments in the economy asthey unfold, and be ready to act promptly in either direction. There will always be unpredictable eventsto which the MPC will need to respond. What is essential for monetary policy is the transparentframework for meeting the inflation target in the medium term, and, in so doing, helping to anchorinflation expectations as close as possible to the 2½% target. At the beginning of next month the MPCwill meet for the 50th time. Reaching our half-century has not been without incident. No doubt therewill be more surprises on the way to our century. But the symmetric and transparent inflation targetprovides the best defence against unexpected events.
BIS Review 57/20011Jaime Caruana: Key economic and financial developments in SpainAddress by Mr Jaime Caruana, Governor of the Banco de España, to the Governing Council of theBanco de España on the presentation of the Annual Report, Madrid, 15 June 2001.*      *      *Ladies and gentlemen:In July last year, Governor Luis Angel Rojo completed his six-year mandate, as envisaged under theLaw of Autonomy of the Banco de España. During his term of office and that of the Deputy Governor,Miguel Martín, the Banco de España experienced at first hand the far-reaching reform andmodernisation of our financial system, the process of economic convergence with Europe and themilestone of our accession to the Monetary Union. As this is the first time I am called upon to presentthe Annual Report to the Governing Council, I should like to begin by reiterating the gratitude of theDeputy Governor and myself for the legacy of independence, credibility and rigour bequeathed by ourpredecessors. The same values shall be our guiding principles in the coming years.It is customary to devote this type of address to an analysis of the past year. Allow me to break withthis tradition and begin by referring to the future, to the year 2002. With the physical introduction ofeuro notes and coins, that year will see the culmination of the transition to Monetary Union and maywell symbolise a new phase for the Spanish economy based on economic and financial stability,integration and reform. Such principles will likewise underpin the work of this Bank in the future.In the first part of this address, I shall highlight the key economic developments during the year 2000and the opening months of 2001. In the second part, focusing on the financial system, I shall broachmacroprudential issues, along with matters relating to the structure and the performance of the sector.Finally, I shall devote the third section to the role and activities of the Banco de España in this newstage.World economyGrowth in the world economy in the year 2000 was, at 4.8%, unusually high. The industrialisedeconomies, with the exception of Japan, and the emerging economies alike benefited from the boomclimate. At the same time, inflation rose in the industrialised countries, owing partly to the surge in oilprices, and fell overall in the emerging economies. But the year 2000 was also a turning point;economic activity progressively lost momentum, highlighting weaknesses that need to be tackled.As in previous years, the US economy was the driving force of this expansion. Nonetheless, althoughthe United States saw its highest annual average growth for the past 16 years in 2000, the year alsomarked the end of the recent exceptionally lengthy and intense upturn. Signs of a slowdown becameperceptible towards the summer and were confirmed as the second half of the year unfolded. As earlyas the second quarter the financial markets had signalled their concern at the first symptoms of a fallin corporate earnings. The decline in share prices was sharpest in securities linked to the neweconomy, and was accompanied by a rise in the risk premia on lower-rated bonds.The opening months of the year 2001 have seen a continuing slowdown in the US economy and itsextension to other areas, especially those with close trade links (Canada, Mexico and south-eastAsia).This sluggishness in the US economy is in contrast to the resilience shown to date by the dollar, notonly against the euro but also in effective terms. Its robustness, linked to the relatively morefavourable medium-term prospects for returns on investment in the United States, might well proveexcessive given the US current-account deficit and the fact that the financial markets mayoccasionally, even for protracted periods, keep exchange rates some way off what fundamentalswould appear to warrant.In any event, doubts prevail over the intensity, duration and timing of the current phase of economicadjustment in the United States. These doubts are tied to a series of imponderables, including mostnotably: first, the extent to which the productivity growth rates observed to mid-2000 will be restored;next, the depth of the decline in consumption which, even were it to restore potentially more balancedlevels of private saving in the long run, would also tend to heighten the loss of momentum of demand;
2BIS Review 57/2001and lastly, the intensity and duration of the correction of corporate earnings, especially in the newtechnology sector and, in connection with this, the extent of the correction of share prices. The scaleand duration of the slowdown in the United States will turn on the response to these questions.The immediate prospects for the world economy appear to be closely linked to the US outlook,whether because of its direct influence or because the other economies are exposed to the sameshocks. Before addressing the situation in Europe and Spain, I should briefly like to mention LatinAmerica.The influence of US economic developments on Latin America is through two channels: one real andone financial. The real channel, namely trade, is particularly marked in the case of Mexico, whosegrowth forecasts for 2001 have been revised downwards, while it is rather more tenuous in the case ofthe region's two other major economies, Argentina and Brazil. The financial channel partly offsets theadverse effect of the real channel by means of the feed-through to Latin America of US interest ratecuts, amounting to 2.5 points in the first five months of 2001. Overall, the slowdown in the USeconomy is expected to draw the cyclical positions of the main Latin American economies closertogether.Euro areaEconomic results in the euro area in the year 2000 were favourable both in terms of growth and jobcreation. The buoyancy of the US economy until mid-year and the greater competitiveness arisingfrom the depreciation of the euro contributed to this. On the negative side, the rise in oil prices hasadversely affected economic expansion in Europe.The euro area is not immune to heightening uncertainty on the international economic stage. Inparticular, the slowdown in the US economy may lead the diminishing growth path in Europe, initiatedat the end of last year, to be prolonged. That will hinge on the intensity and duration of thedeceleration in the United States and on the effect this may have on agents' confidence and on thefinancial markets. In any event, activity in the euro area may be expected to remain relatively buoyantinsofar as domestic demand is underpinned by favourable income and financial conditions.In the first half of 2000, monetary policy was progressively adapted to the deteriorating price outlook,against a backdrop of an improved economic situation. Gradual interest rate rises were implemented,though these did not prevent the monetary stance from being propitious to economic expansionacross the area. Indeed, monetary conditions were clearly generous in certain countries which, likeSpain, were ahead in the cycle and were experiencing greater price pressures.Due to essentially temporary factors, euro area inflation climbed to above 2%. But the slowdown in USeconomic growth and the subsequent deterioration in the world economic outlook temperedinflationary risks as from the third quarter, paving the way in October for a halt in the succession ofofficial interest rate rises. In its evaluation of inflationary risks, the European Central Bank (ECB) hassince adopted a prudent stance, gradually modifying its assessment of macroeconomic conditions inthe area on the basis of developments in its external environment and of the data available on theirimpact on the euro area. As a result, it trimmed its benchmark interest rate in May this year to 4.5%,estimating that the lower economic growth envisaged for the euro area should mitigate inflationarypressures in the medium run.The ECB nevertheless monitors inflation developments in the euro area attentively. While the lessexpansionary economic climate is tending to moderate price increases, risk factors – associatedmainly with uncertainty as to future wage restraint and to the feed-through to final prices of dearerenergy and other imported inputs – remain which could delay the forecast reduction in inflation rates inthe near future.Having discussed the salient international economic developments over the past year, I should like tohighlight two conclusions arising from such developments which merit special comment. The first isthat technological progress does not imply the disappearance of macroeconomic disequilibria. And thesecond is the differing position of the US and European economies, as regards both their cyclicalposition and their medium-term growth outlook.
BIS Review 57/20013Technological progress does not presuppose the absence of disequilibriaEconomic developments in the United States in recent years have been forcefully influenced bytechnological innovation. Their effect has been felt, primarily, in the new economy industries. But,gradually, they have also emerged in the more traditional industries as the latter have incorporatedtechnological advances into their production and distribution processes. As a result, not only has therebeen a considerably higher economic growth rate than in the past two decades, but there is alsoincreasingly firm empirical evidence that the rate of expansion of trend productivity may have beenstepped up.However, the fact that technical progress may provide a sustained boost to growth capacity does notmean, as the experience of recent years in the United States clearly shows, that macroeconomicdisequilibria concurrently disappear. On the contrary, the favourable economic expectations in thewake of technological progress prompted a strong rise in share prices and, by means of the low costof capital and the wealth effect, an expansion of domestic demand which, as from a certain point,outpaced the growth rate of potential output, even under the most optimistic scenario of the effects ofthe new economy.The results of these maladjustments have been the notable decline in US household net financialsaving (to -4% of disposable income), the significant increase in corporate debt and, for the economyas a whole, the widening of the already sizeable current-account deficit to 4.4% of GDP, albeit largelyfinanced by direct investment.This build-up in disequilibria, against a background in which signs of upward pressures on prices werealso beginning to emerge, made it not only inevitable but also desirable that there should be aslowdown in the pace of aggregate demand to rates compatible with the economy's growth potential.And that necessarily entailed a temporary decline in productivity. The conclusion may thus be drawnfrom recent experience that technical progress and the structural changes it entails do not mean thedisappearance or moderation of economic cycles. What technical progress does entail is an extensionto the limits of sustained non-inflationary growth capacity.Differences in the euro area economyAs indicated, the euro area economy has been affected by the deteriorating international economicclimate and, in particular, by the sharp slowdown in the US economy. This is a natural consequence ofthe growing interdependence of the various regional economic areas, brought about by the increase ininternational trade and financial flows. Nonetheless, it would be mistaken to draw excessive parallelsbetween economies which, with their differing cyclical positions and structural characteristics, do notshare the same growth prospects.In particular, many of the macroeconomic and financial disequilibria that have built up in the UnitedStates are not be found in the euro area. Although investment has remained buoyant in recent yearsin Europe, there is no sign of a surplus in capital goods being accumulated. Moreover, although theEuropean saving ratio has declined in recent years, it is still holding at appreciably higher levels thanin the United States. Finally, the private sector is in a less vulnerable wealth position, characterised bylower relative debt and by less exposure to fluctuations in financial asset prices.The sustained high private saving ratio and the fiscal consolidation drive undertaken by the euro areaMember States pursuant to the Stability and Growth Pact have helped the area as a whole achieve ahealthy external position. Foreseeably, these factors will mean that the euro area may sustain, in thenear future, a growth rate close to potential, albeit subject to the impact of developments on theinternational front.Against this background, it should come as no surprise that monetary policy has differed on each sideof the Atlantic. This discrepancy is, I believe, due not so much to differences in the statutory remit ofthe respective central banks but rather to economic situations departing from different bases andrequiring different measures.To meet the objective of increasing the economy's capacity for growth requires the contribution ofstrands of economic policy other than monetary policy. In this respect, the European governmentshave made headway in recent years in terms of fiscal consolidation, thereby increasing the room formanoeuvre available in public finances to withstand adverse cyclical circumstances. Likewise, mentionshould be made of the efforts to improve the workings of European product and factor markets, as part
4BIS Review 57/2001of the so-called Cardiff and Luxembourg processes. These have provided for significance advances inmarket integration and efficiency.Despite these achievements, the challenges facing the European economy in the medium term go farbeyond the scope of the economic policy measures and reforms applied to date.Thus, in a setting where public finances should be ready to withstand the foreseeable budgetaryconsequences of the ageing of the population, effective additional measures to contain expenditureare generally needed to exert a positive and durable influence on public finances. Likewise, budgetarypriorities must be established to favour those items, such as education or R+D, which can mostcontribute to increasing growth potential in the medium term. In many countries there is ample room toincrease the efficiency of current tax systems. That said, in order to maximise their effectiveness, themeasures aimed at improving the quality of public finances must not be at the expense of fiscalconsolidation.European structural policies must be pursued and deepened to achieve more integrated, flexible andcompetitive markets and to remove the obstacles to the development and use of new technologies.This is an important challenge requiring far-reaching reforms in widely differing areas such as theeducation system, the financial markets and the mechanisms regulating economic activity. Successhere is pivotal if Europe is to aspire to competing in the cutting-edge industries and to satisfactorilyincreasing the economy's overall productivity.Many of the factors indicated here are among the objectives set out by the European authorities inconclusions such as those of the extraordinary Lisbon summit last year. Notwithstanding, an air offatigue is palpable in some countries in respect of fiscal consolidation and structural reform. The scaleand significance of the challenges posed require that governments should not succumb to anexcessively short-termist vision that diminishes the momentum of the reforms needed and hampersoverall progress.Spanish economyFor the Spanish economy, the year 2000 saw the culmination of a prolonged growth phase in whichfurther headway was made in real convergence with the other European countries.The year closed with a real GDP growth rate of 4%, six-tenths of a point above that for the euro areaas a whole. Nonetheless, the growth rate of output moderated as the year unfolded as a result of theappreciable slowdown in national demand, which was offset only partly by the improved contribution ofnet external demand. The lesser momentum of demand was particularly evident in the capitalinvestment component, which reacted promptly to the change in expectations.Consumer spending also slowed amid the greater uncertainty, rising prices and the loss of financialwealth. But it is still holding at a sustained level as a result of the increase in employment. Lastly,exports of goods and services have remained highly buoyant, despite lower growth in foreign markets.This warrants reasonable optimism about the limited impact of the change in the international settingon our economy. But this will largely depend on the correction of certain incipient imbalances whichgradually became apparent last year.These imbalances have essentially been manifest in the price and cost differentials with the other euroarea countries, in the savings shortage, in the loss of steam of the investment process and in theincrease in the economy's borrowing requirements. As can be seen, all these imbalances are thosecharacteristic of an economy which, after several years of uninterrupted growth, is at an advancedstage in the cycle (ahead of most of our trading partners). Their correction will be assisted by theslowdown in demand already taking place. Indeed, the moderation of consumption has halted thedecline in the saving ratio and the slowdown in imports has lessened the deterioration in the externaldeficit.Despite their eminently cyclical nature, these tensions also highlight structural shortcomings whichcontinue to beset the workings of the economy. The risks arising from these imbalances should betackled through the economic policy instruments available, bearing in mind that monetary policy is nolonger available for domestic requirements.Euro area monetary conditions have proved excessively generous for the Spanish economy in thelight of the expansionary setting in which it was immersed and of the intensity of the external shock inthe form of oil price rises. True, the monetary stance of the Eurosystem was altered as the inflationary
BIS Review 57/20015outlook for the area as a whole changed. But real interest rates remained low and long-term ratesdeclined. Moreover, the euro only ceased to depreciate well into the year, though it has subsequentlyshown fresh signs of weakness.The foregoing factors translated into a high rate of expansion of bank lending to the resident privatesector. This rate increased again last year by around 20%, although it has begun to show signs ofeasing in the opening months of the year 2001. Growth was particularly marked in loans for thepurchase, construction and promotion of housing, against a backdrop of historically low real interestrates and stiff competition among institutions in this market segment. Hence, in addition to boostingdomestic demand, the behaviour of credit has contributed to shaping a framework propitious to pricerises in the property sector.These relaxed monetary conditions were only partly countered by fiscal policy, which adopted amoderately restrictive stance. Fiscal policy results were better than scheduled, which has enabled abalanced budget to be forecast for the year ahead. Balanced public finances, which are so favourablefor the economy, will tend to become entrenched with the disciplining procedures envisaged in thedraft law on budgetary stability. Under this legislation, any extra budgetary policy leeway should beused to improve the general government financial balance.Demand pressures contributed to inflationary tensions emerging. And these were accentuated by therise in oil prices. As a result, the 12-month growth rate of the consumer price index (CPI) stood at 4%at the end of last year. In the early months of this year, the rate of increase of the CPI has stabilised ataround this figure, as oil market pressures have yet to disappear. Adding to this have been thedistortions in the market for meat products. At issue here in both cases are largely transitory factorswhich should abate in the coming months. This, combined with the deceleration of the economy,entails a significant change in the inflation outlook towards lower rates closer to the definition of pricestability formulated by the ECB, a definition which should continue to be the medium-term referencefor economic agents. There is a danger, however, that the feed-through of price rises to wages, via theinflation adjustment clauses that do not exist in most European countries, will delay the expectedslowdown in consumer prices and, by exerting pressure on firms' costs, reduce the rate of growth andof job creation.The continuing inflation differential with the euro area average is a cause for concern insofar as it maybe indicative of problems of competitiveness. In the sectors (mainly manufacturing) most exposed toforeign competition, excessive cost increases lead, because they cannot be fed through to prices, tolosses in profitability relative to foreign competitors. The sectors (mostly services) most sheltered fromcompetition can, by contrast, pass through cost increases in full to prices and, indeed, harness thebuoyancy of demand to increase margins, thereby contributing to maintaining inflation differentials.This behaviour is harmful, above all, to the competitiveness of the economy as a whole, but also to thedevelopment of those industries which seek to draw short-term benefit from the market powerbestowed on them by restricted competition.The Spanish economy is in a position to continue posting a rate of expansion of around 3% in thecoming years, outpacing the euro area in this respect. But to achieve this it will be necessary to tackleappropriately the imbalances that have emerged after a long phase of rapid growth. Failing to do thiswould jeopardise the economy's competitiveness, which would be particularly worrying at a time offaltering world growth and heightening uncertainty.Social agents must adapt their behaviour accordingly to the patterns of nominal stability that haveinspired EMU, extending the moderation and stability that have presided over the initial years of theMonetary Union. It is thus a question of entrenching a new culture in which wage, rental and otherincome negotiations and price setting do not turn, as in the past, on a positive rate of inflation for theeconomy as a whole but rather on supply and demand in each specific case.The year 2001 is particularly important for embedding the possibilities of growth in the continuingstability that has made the current phase of expansion possible. The different strands of economicpolicy must thus strengthen the economy's flexibility and improve market workings.From this encouraging though not risk-free outlook, I believe two issues may be highlighted. First, thestrengths and weaknesses of the job creation-intensive growth pattern we are following. And second,the importance of fostering conditions appropriate to increasing medium- and long-term growthpotential.
6BIS Review 57/2001Employment-intensive growth patternThe growth pattern of the Spanish economy in recent years has been characterised by intense jobcreation and, consequently, by a moderate increase in apparent labour productivity. During the period1997-2000, real GDP ran at an average annual growth rate of 4.1%, and employment at 3.5%. Theincrease in labour productivity was thus 0.6%. These figures contrast with those of the previous phasefrom 1980 to 1996, in which the growth rates of output and employment were 2.5% and 0.6%,respectively, making the productivity increase 1.9%.For an economy such as Spain's, where the labour factor is still under-utilised, it seems advisable tofollow a job creation-intensive growth pattern, even though this involves a phase of scant apparentlabour productivity gains. This is provided that rates of investment and innovation are high and that thefoundations are laid for subsequent improvement. Indeed, this is what occurred in the US economy.The case of the US economy is illustrative in this respect. As will be recalled, the United Statesunderwent, until the mid-nineties, a period in which its growth was based on employment, postinglabour productivity rates of increase which scarcely exceeded 1% per annum. The flexibility of itslabour market provided for greater relative growth of its labour-intensive services sector, at theexpense of traditional manufacturing industry where labour requirements per unit of output are less.The substantial labour productivity gains, the outcome of the strong and persistent rate of investmentand the diffusion of technological innovation, only became clearly apparent when the US economyreached a situation of virtually full employment.If we compare this process with what has occurred in Europe in past decades, the greater rigidity ofEuropean labour markets can be seen to have led investment to be channelled towards relativelycapital-intensive industries, slowing the expansion of the services industry. In fact, the services sectoremploys 60% of European labour today compared with 76% in the United States. The lesser capacityof Europe to generate employment translated into high unemployment rates (double that of the UnitedStates, on average) and into a relatively higher increase in apparent labour productivity, at that time, ofover 1.5%. Consequently, the European economies, and Spain among them, are currently facing aphase that the United States has already left behind, and one that should be geared to reducing theprevailing high unemployment rate.The challenge consists, precisely, of squaring the current job creation-intensive processes withincreases in investment incorporating recent technological advances and providing for a better use ofproductive resources. The productivity gains arising from this process will become effective andmanifest, with increasing intensity, as current unemployment is absorbed. In turn, low productivitymakes the current growth phase particularly vulnerable to wage increases which, as they cannot beoffset, pass through to greater unit labour costs.Increasing growth potentialThe temporary advisability of following a job creation-intensive growth model should not lead to anunderestimation of the importance of boosting the factors underpinning the increase in the economy'sgrowth potential, in which connection the full and effective use of the resources available does notsuffice. It is also necessary to increase such resources quantitatively and qualitatively via investmentin human, productive and technological capital. In this process entrepreneurial innovation and theincorporation of the new communications and information technologies play a pivotal role.This will require flexible economic structures, whereby the policy of reforms in various areas must bepursued. The labour market is a case in point. Following the recent reforms, the focus should be on anefficient co-ordination of collective bargaining so that wages may grow in a differentiated manner andthus adapt to the specific conditions of firms. In turn, this differentiated wage growth will spur labourmobility across firms, industries and regions with different employment conditions. Likewise, policiesaimed at increasing labour market participation, especially of those groups traditionally outside themarket, should be reinforced. Reform in the market for land use, which is characterised by a lack ofcompetition and transparency, would also help lift obstacles to inter-regional labour mobility. Ineducation, investment in vocational training and in improving workers' skills must be stepped up. Inparticular, their adaptation to the new technologies is vital if the labour shortages in this area are to bereduced. Finally, the stock of both private and public productive capital must be increased throughmaintaining high rates of investment, equipping the country with the infrastructure and capital neededfor a sustained increase in productivity.
BIS Review 57/20017It is thus a matter of seeing through the policy of reforms and the guidelines recently approved bySpanish economic policymakers. This is of paramount importance for continuing the process ofconvergence with the per capita income levels of the euro area, a process supported to date mainly bythe robustness of employment. As we approach European rates of employment, continuing cuts in thedifferences will only be achieved if the rise in our productivity exceeds that of the euro area.In the medium run, we should seek to attain a mix of buoyant job creation and high productivity rates.That means sustaining a high growth rate in a durable manner without this giving rise to upwardpressures in costs, margins and prices. But this is only possible if we have an economy whose marketworkings and institutions are much more flexible than at present.Financial stabilityMoving on to financial stability issues, one of the salient phenomena of recent years is the growingsignificance of financial markets and their ever greater interrelatedness to the real economy.In Europe, the development of capital markets is leading to a more balanced banking-market model.Household share ownership in the European Union has increased in recent years: whereas in 1995they accounted for 26% of financial assets, this proportion had risen to 37% in 1999. And to this figurewe must add indirect holdings via mutual funds, pension funds and other forms of collectiveinvestment, the popularity of which has increased visibly.One immediate consequence of these changes has been to tighten the linkage between financialmarkets and the real sector. The fact that a growing portion of wealth is held in the form of securities,whose price can fluctuate 24 hours a day on the world markets, has evident implications for thedynamics of disposable income and consumption. In addition to this direct channel is that relating tothe cost of capital and its influence on investment by firms. Lastly, the securities markets also play akey role in the formation of consumer and entrepreneurial expectations. Thanks to the constantinformation flows from these markets, these agents continually adjust their assessment of theeconomic environment.The transmission channels from the financial sector to the real sector are, therefore, increasinglyflexible, rapid and complex. Two relevant and interrelated issues have arisen from discussions on thisarea: the first is the extent to which the volatility of financial markets is being transmitted, also moreintensely and rapidly, to the real economy; and the second questions whether financial marketsamplify fluctuations in the real economy. Expressed otherwise, considering both issues in conjunction,what is being discussed is the extent to which the behaviour of the financial markets exacerbates thevolatility and cyclicality of the real economy.Regarding the first issue, there are recent examples pointing in opposite directions. There have beenepisodes, such as the Asian crisis, involving the intense transmission of financial turbulence to the realsector. However, it should also be acknowledged that the developed economies have shown a notabledegree of resistance to certain financial disturbances. In this case, the stable course of real variablesagainst such a volatile financial background should largely be attributed to the following factors. First,to the existence of healthy financial systems with sufficient room for manoeuvre to absorb the impactof varying shocks. Next, to a greater diversification of holders of financial instruments and of financialoperators. And finally, to the prompt reaction of the authorities. Conversely, when these conditionswere not present, pressures in the financial sector have tended to be transmitted relatively intensely tothe real sector.The possible explanatory factors of this potential amplification of the cycle in the financial sector aremany-faceted and complex. These include most notably: heightened competition in the banking sectorand in financial markets, which in an upturn leads to riskier strategies that are only corrected when therise in bad debts highlights their consequences; a tendency of economic agents to over-react tochanges in their environment; herding, on occasions, which reinforces trends; and the use of commonassessment and risk management tools and a short-termist view of "shareholder value". All theforegoing induce sharper fluctuations in asset prices. Prudential regulations may also occasionallyhave proven conducive to an excessive emphasis on the short term when assessing risks.What can the authorities do to counter these tendencies? In an area still open to discussion, severaloptions present themselves. Firstly, it is essential to encourage within financial institutions a betterknowledge of the risks assumed, a long-term orientation to analyses and, consequently, more prudentmanagement. Secondly, it is advisable to promote greater heterogeneity among financial market
8BIS Review 57/2001players to avoid mimetic behaviour. Thirdly, a better understanding and evaluation of the behaviour ofliquidity on markets is called for, on the part of both market participants and supervisors. Finally, it isfor the regulatory authorities to introduce rules that do not promote short-termist strategies, butencourage counter-cyclical behaviour. This matter is particularly pertinent in the discussion of the newminimum capital regulation prepared by the Basel committee which, owing to its greater sensitivity torisk, is liable to introduce elements of cyclicality.The statistical provision, introduced for prudential reasons in the year 2000 by the Banco de España,is in keeping with the wish to subdue cyclical behaviour. This provision draws on the fundamentalprinciple that institutions should begin to recognise the expected losses associated with a loan as fromthe very moment it is extended, as there is a non-nil probability of default. A provision of this typeintroduces counter-cyclical elements in the behaviour of credit institutions by favouring a moreaccurate evaluation of loan portfolios.Before discussing developments on the financial markets last year, I wish to reiterate the idea that ahealthy and dynamic economy is only possible with solvent financial institutions and resilient financialmarkets. In Europe, in addition to the broad issues mentioned earlier, attaining this objectivenecessarily requires firm progress and resolve in integrating financial markets.Financial marketsThe introduction of the euro is a catalyst for market competition and integration in the euro area. Butthere are still obstacles preventing the process of integration of financial markets from moving at thedesired speed. Perhaps the two extreme examples are, on one hand, the money market, which isillustrative of an integrated European market; and, on the other, the retail banking market, as anexample of scant integration.Two initiatives have sought to tackle the limited headway made towards the single financial market.The first is the European Commission's Financial Services Action Plan, which has given politicalimpetus to legislative changes covering securities markets, pensions and investor safeguards, with theaim of providing a durable legislative underpinning for the single financial markets. The secondinitiative, derived from the difficulty encountered in implementing the aforementioned Action Plan, isthe so-called Lamfalussy report. Given how slow and costly the promulgation of directives is in thesecurities field, this report proposes a genuine regulatory revolution. This will involve promotingdirectives whose technical aspects can be amended by the European Commission on the basis ofrecommendations from a committee of European representatives, further to the opinion of securitiessupervisors. This outline, which could be used in the future for other financial areas, is considered asound means for achieving a truly integrated single financial market.With these matters pending, integration among the various European financial markets continued inthe year 2000. While the horizon was clouded by the odd failure such as the breakdown of the mergertalks between the London and Frankfurt stock exchanges, other European securities markets enteredinto alliances in the areas of both trading and of registration, clearing and settlement. In Spain, thesteps under way to integrate both the trading platform and the clearing and settlement systems may,in the near future, lead to a more efficient and better prepared unified market. With thesearrangements, Spain can successfully operate in an industry of great importance for our economy andone which, in the future, is destined to undergo far-reaching change internationally.The Banco de España has always encouraged moves towards the integration of the dispersedSpanish financial markets. Consequently, it supports and participates in such initiatives, which seek toinfuse our securities markets with greater competitiveness and to give a more prominent role, inmarket management, to the institutions with the most significant trading interests on such markets.Market integration in Spain is not only a means for ensuring a more efficient allocation of savings flowstowards more productive investment. In a single financial market it is not just banking institutions whichcompete but the markets themselves. The future of the markets will hinge on their understanding thedeep-seated changes in their operating environment and the competition facing them ahead.Before moving on to the Spanish banking system, let me briefly refer to banks in Europe. In clearcontrast to the integration of money and securities markets, European retail banking remainsfragmented. And in recent years the burdens imposed by regulatory environments and supervisors oninstitutions wishing to expand their activities have been apparent. This is a situation that runs counterto the undertaking to achieve a single financial market and one which must therefore be tackled.
BIS Review 57/20019Banking systemAs regards the banking system, Spanish institutions reaffirmed their maturity and performedfavourably in the year 2000 against a somewhat more uncertain international backdrop and with agrowing degree of competition. Nonetheless, the challenges ahead and the lower expectations ofgrowth called for a careful design of the most appropriate responses in the medium and long-term.Mention should first be made of the 13% growth of bank balance sheets, on consolidated data, withhighly different performances in business at home and that abroad. While the banking system grew byaround 6% in the domestic market, foreign business climbed strikingly by 48% as a result of foreignbank acquisitions. As earlier mentioned, there has been sharp growth in lending, offset in part by areduction in public sector indebtedness to banks. The remaining portion has been financed by anotable increase in deposits, in particular time deposits (thanks to the favourable impact of thepersonal income tax reform), by a 14% increase in capital and, finally, by resorting to euro-areainterbank market debt and to securities issues on international markets. Into the year 2001, the newState Treasury management system, jointly set up by the Directorate General of the Treasury andFinancial Policy and the Banco de España, has provided a new source of liquidity for Spanishinstitutions, enabling them to reduce their indebtedness on the European interbank market by around20%.The expansion in business has allowed adequate levels of profitability to be sustained. This has beenpossible thanks not only to entities shoring up their net interest income, after it had been narrowingsharply for years, but also to their growing resort to commission charges. Against this, the downwardstickiness of operating expenses has continued and remains the main weakness in our creditinstitutions' profit and loss account.The growth of business and the results on the profit and loss account have come about at a time ofcapital soundness at most institutions, with default rates at historical lows.That said, the forces for change in financial systems remain present, and that poses a challenge toinstitutions and supervisors alike. There are several points for consideration here.The first concerns the heightening competition characterising both the markets for deposits and forloans. In the face of this, institutions have sought to avoid pressure on margins through the search forhigher profitability or, what amounts to the same, through adopting riskier strategies.A second reflection relates to the heterogeneity of the various banks' steps to seek out higherprofitability. While some have opted to expand their balance sheet, albeit at the cost of narrowermargins, others have preferred to contain their activity and focus efforts on improving margins. In othercases, industrial holdings have been the preferred means in the search for higher returns. Reachingan optimum size via mergers and acquisitions has been another of the methods chosen. Lastly, theinternationalisation of activity has been one response geared not only to attaining greater size, butalso to gaining access to less mature financial environments, with more favourable net interest incomeprospects. The increase in risk and the diverse solutions adopted, according to the particular strategyinvolved, highlight the need for all institutions to make every effort to improve their management andrisk control systems.The third reflection refers to loan defaults. Lending in Spain has been growing at a very high rate inrecent years. A large portion of the lending portfolio is thus relatively recent and has been extended atthe top of the economic cycle. It is often and rightly said that default problems are generated during aneconomic upswing, when excessive optimism leads institutions to relax lending policies.The figures for actual defaults and for specific provisions do not reflect appropriately the risks arisingfrom latent defaults in lending portfolios, which have grown most rapidly in recent years. This is thereason for the introduction of the statistical provision, which seeks to encourage better riskmanagement and to approximate the average provision needed throughout a cycle on an adjustedhistorical basis. Its impact on profit and loss accounts, by reducing profits at times of plenty as atpresent, and restoring them at times of high loan losses, is significant.There are two further aspects of financial institutions' risk profile which merit discussion. The first iscredit risk concentration. Institutions must monitor exposures closely, both at the level of economicgroupings and at the sectoral level, and their managers should pay particular attention to appropriatediversification.The second is costs. If institutions are to have a healthy profit and loss account in the future, efforts torationalise and cut structural costs must remain a priority for managers. Such rationalisation is not only
10BIS Review 57/2001needed in costs associated with the network; it must also encompass a review of central servicescosts. These cuts are fully compatible with the ongoing reinforcement of such areas as riskmanagement, the adoption of new technologies, enhanced service quality, etc.The final reflection refers to the quality of capital. Spanish credit institutions have been issuingpreference shares with growing frequency. The resort to preference shares is logical and acceptable,provided that the levels involved do not impair the quality of capital and provided that, at the retaildistribution stage, factors such as the potential future costs in terms of reputation (which aresometimes so difficult to gauge) are taken into account.To conclude this section, I shall refer to how the ongoing change towards a more complex operatingenvironment for institutions is affecting the definition of the regulatory and accounting framework at theinternational level. There have recently been two major initiatives in this area, both with far-reachingimplications for bank management and strategy: the new Basel capital accord, and the process ofimplementation of International Accounting Standards in the European Union.The main features of the new proposal of the Basel Banking Supervision Committee on capitaladequacy, which replaces the 1988 capital accord that was in force in over one hundred countries, areas follows. First, to acknowledge a greater differentiation between the different levels of credit risk, toconsider a selection of alternative methods for calculating capital and to attribute greater importance tobanks' internal systems, introducing incentives for better risk management and control.Second, and thanks to greater sensitivity to the risks assumed, the new Basel proposal allows forreadier convergence between economic capital (the level of capital considered appropriate by bankmanagers and shareholders) and regulatory capital (that required by the supervisor).Finally, the aspect of the new Basel Accord I consider most important is the integration into a singlepackage of four basic elements: several capital calculation systems; quality of management, stressingthe need for sound internal risk management systems; system validation by the supervisor, beingrespectful of banks' responsibility for management; and lastly, transparency, so that the market takesinformed action.I believe the New Accord, currently at the consultative stage, marks a step forward. It merits oursupport, although work must continue so that the calibration of its parameters may result in meetingthe objectives set, namely to maintain an overall level of capital and to provide proper incentives.Adapting to the new accord is a demanding task for all credit institutions, in whatever country. But Ibelieve the soundness of Spanish institutions makes them among the best positioned for this change.The challenges posed by the new Basel agreement to supervisors are on no less a scale than thosefaced by banks. Their implementation, scheduled for 2004, entails a new regulatory capital frameworkfor supervisors which will be much more demanding than the current one in respect of humanresources and technical knowledge, making it necessary to objectify qualitative elements of banks andtheir systems.Given the range of regulations and supervisory practices at the international level, and the need for alevel playing field accommodating not only different countries and sizes but also investment andcommercial banks, the new accord requires a balanced design and increased internationalco-ordination among supervisors.As regards the introduction of the International Accounting Standards (IAS) in the European Union, theaim is to promote the convergence of accounting practices across the European countries. This iscertainly a desirable goal, which should pave the way for progress towards the creation of a singlefinancial market. The practical experience of banking supervision over the last twenty years in Spainhas demonstrated that accounting regulation has been a fundamental element in achieving a solid andstable financial system and efficient supervision. Moreover, accounting standards based on prudentialcriteria and conservative principles are not only essential for prudential supervision, but also forindividual investors, who thereby have a guarantee that the information they receive is well-founded.This is why it is considered extremely important that accounting principles be reconciled with goodbanking practices, with modern risk management techniques and with the nature and time horizon ofall types of banking operation.
BIS Review 57/200111The Banco de España in the new settingThe changes in the Spanish economy over the last 15 years have altered its position in the world. Thedata on the growing international presence of Spanish corporations, the increase in the financialresources flowing out of Spain, in particular towards Latin America, and Spain's greater presence ininternational economic institutions are revealing. All this is turning Spain into a leading player withincreasing weight in the globalisation process.The development of the role of the Banco de España in future will turn on the new institutionalframework deriving from Monetary Union (loss of monetary sovereignty and membership of theEurosystem) and also on the new position of the Spanish economy in the international setting.The objectives and responsibilities assigned by law to the Banco de España can be grouped into twomajor categories: those relating to economic stability and those relating to financial stability, to whichshould be added important additional functions such as the management of reserves, banknoteissuance, etc.Among the activities relating to economic stability are those arising from membership of theEurosystem, and the functions of monitoring, analysing and advising on the Spanish economy. Thelatter will continue to be a fundamental part of the tasks entrusted to the Bank.The monitoring and analysis of the Spanish economy traditionally carried out by the Banco theEspaña, as a basis for discharging its responsibilities, has acquired a new dimension with membershipof the Eurosystem. In the new setting, investigation and research have a twofold purpose. First, theyshould contribute to the consolidation of a solid analytical framework for monetary policydecision-making and to the constant improvement of the strategy, instruments and proceduresemployed by the Eurosystem to perform its functions. And second, they should inform the analysis ofthe implications for the Spanish economy of the single monetary policy.This has required new subjects to be tackled and traditional issues to be viewed from a freshperspective. Among the new concerns included on the research agenda I should like to highlight three.First, the relations between the national economies that make up the euro area, including theirsimilarities and divergences, the particularities of their monetary policy transmission mechanisms, andthe national authorities' room for manoeuvre.Second, the problems involved in adequately measuring inflation, a key variable both fordecision-taking and for the behaviour of agents, which may be distorted by an underestimation of theimprovements in quality incorporated into goods and services. This distortion may be particularlysignificant in the case of products subject to continuous technical improvements, such as IT products,capital equipment, means of transport, etc. In this respect, we are collaborating with the NationalInstitute of Statistics in an investigation of the techniques that could be used to correct this distortion incertain Spanish sectors.Third, the information relating to the financial stocks and flows of the Spanish economy and thebehaviour of the various institutional sectors is being continuously improved.In any event, although constant reflection is necessary in our daily work, we should not forget that themain objective of all analytical work is to improve the tools for dealing with risks and problems in themedium term. Examples of these are the conditions necessary to increase productivity and potentialgrowth, or the financial sustainability of pensions, which depends so heavily on productivity itself andon the efficiency of the labour market.The process of internationalisation that the Spanish economy has embarked upon in recent years hasgone beyond the European sphere to reach other areas including, in particular, Latin America. Thisincreasing international presence of Spain has made it all the more pressing and necessary to extendand raise the profile of the Banco de España's participation in the main international economic andfinancial fora. It is here that issues are regularly discussed and decided which, due to their significanceand their global repercussions, are so important to Spain's interests. This is why the functions andresponsibilities relating to the analysis of international economic and financial issues have beenstrengthened, as part of a determined strategy to develop the Banco de España's internationalrelations.A good example of this growing international presence is our membership of the Basel Committee onBanking Supervision, Here initiatives are being discussed that are of great importance for oursupervisory activity, which I have already mentioned and which tie in with the second group ofactivities of the Bank, which could be grouped under the general heading of financial stability. Included
12BIS Review 57/2001here are tasks relating to banking regulation and supervision and to the payment system, and powersin relation to securities markets, especially for public debt.The increasing complexity and diversity of new products, the constant evolution of the risks incurredby institutions, technological innovation, the opening of previously unknown distribution channels,concentration via mergers, acquisitions and alliances, international expansion and the changes in theinternational regulatory framework are factors contributing to the growing complexity andsophistication of banking business. These changes are obliging institutions to strive continuously toadapt and improve their management and control systems, and this naturally has to be reflected in thearea of supervision.In an increasingly complex and international operating environment, supervision should not be basedexclusively on traditional rules and circulars It must also be capable of incorporating more flexibleelements, including recommendations and codes of good practice. A good example is provided by theinstitutions' areas of corporate governance and risk control. The Banco de España is encouraging allcredit institutions, whether or not they are listed on securities markets, to establish and comply withcodes of good governance. It is also stimulating the adoption of modern risk management systemsthat have the support of top management and are understood and used integrally and rationally by thewhole organisation.As regards prudential supervision, in my opinion several features are necessary in order for it to beable to face the present challenges. First, I think that the regulatory and supervisory remit willincreasingly be geared towards stimulating the sound management of institutions, giving particularlyfavourable treatment to risk management structures, systems and culture. Second, it must be capableof combining traditional supervision techniques, based on the valuation of assets and examination ofaccounts, with new techniques of a more qualitative nature, based on the so-called risk approach.Third, and depending on the priorities arising from the risk profile of the institutions, it must continue tocombine the remote monitoring of institutions with on-site inspections. Fourth, it will be essential tomaintain a high degree of co-ordination with the supervisors of other financial sectors and of othercountries, both through bilateral relations and through multilateral fora. Fifth, it must provide incentivesfor a level of transparency sufficient for markets to be able to perform their scrutiny role. Finally,investment in technological resources and human capital will be fundamental. All this assumes thedevelopment of deeper collaboration and dialogue with the institutions since, respecting the autonomyof their responsibilities, supervisors and supervised share an interest in achieving stable and solidfinancial systems.This is the background against which the Banco de España has been striving to strengthen itssupervision techniques and to supplement the traditional methods with dynamic analysis of the qualityof management and of the mechanisms for the assumption, monitoring and control of risks by creditinstitutions. Without abandoning our style of supervision, based on close, direct and continuouscontact with institutions, we have embarked upon the task of deepening the analysis of qualitativeaspects and of control. Such analysis was already conducted, but it will now be more systematic andmore closely integrated into the supervisory process.In order to achieve this improvement in the supervisory approach, we are formulating, at the Banco deEspaña, a methodology that we have called "SABER". Besides being the Spanish acronym forsupervision of banking activity under the risk approach [Supervisión de la Actividad Bancaria bajo elEnfoque Riesgo], it indicates that the aim of the supervisor is not only to obtain the most completepicture possible of the current situation of each institution, but also to be able to make the bestpossible prediction of its future evolution.The Banco de España is also aware that the new circumstances require greater transparency on thepart of supervisors. In this respect, the Banco de España is setting up additional channels ofcommunication and dialogue on supervision procedures and on the currently effective and proposedregulatory and supervisory measures.As regards payment systems, following the setting up of TARGET, the Trans-European paymentsystem managed by the central banks of the European Union, of which our Settlement Service formspart, the Banco de España is focusing on other less operational aspects that are, notwithstanding, ofno less interest. I should like to mention specifically two: the oversight of payment systems, especiallyin relation to real-time settlement in the main currencies and to the new payment instruments basedon electronic media, and co-operation with other countries, basically in Latin America.
BIS Review 57/200113Replacement of national currencies by the euroThe introduction of the new euro notes and coins is an enormously important political project. For thefirst time since the advent of Monetary Union, the physical euro will reach all sectors of the Union'spopulation. It is also an unprecedented logistical task, which has required the constant attention of theEurosystem and the Banco de España in co-ordination with the Ministry of the Economy and the creditinstitutions and other sectors involved. Over the last twelve months a plan has been drawn up for thedistribution of euro notes and coins. Its ultimate purpose is to place the notes and coins close to theirultimate users (industry, shops and the general public), so that a large number of transactions can becarried out in euro from the beginning of January 2002 and the exchange process can be completedby the end of February, as planned.The production and distribution of notes and coins is proceeding satisfactorily and to schedule. TheNational Mint is complying scrupulously with its timetable and, to ensure smooth distribution, theBanco de España has already begun to move the thousands of tons of notes and coins from centraldepots to each of its branches in the provinces.The ultimate success of the process will depend upon the collaboration of everyone involved: theMinistry of Economy, the Banco de España and the financial system, each conducting effectively,within its sphere of responsibility, the logistical process; employers, especially in the distributive sector,assuming the importance of the historic moment and acting high-mindedly; and finally, consumers,endeavouring to adapt, being vigilant, and rewarding those firms and products that best perform thechange.The Banco de España, like the other banks belonging to the European System of Central Banks, isconducting a campaign explaining the new notes and coins in order to educate the public about theprocess of exchange and the technical and security aspects of the new notes. This campaign isconcentrating especially on the most vulnerable sectors of the population, such as the elderly andchildren.Throughout this – I fear already lengthy – speech, I have tried to stress certain features of the Spanisheconomy and some of the challenges it faces, as well as the important role to be played by economicagents. In the financial sphere, I have insisted that a healthy and dynamic economy is only possiblewith solvent financial institutions and strong financial markets. Let me finish by acknowledging ourcommitment to these ideas of economic and financial stability.When I took up my post in July last year, on behalf of the Deputy Governor and myself I asked – andgave thanks in advance – for the collaboration and dedication of all the staff of the Banco de España.The ensuing months have been an intense period during which the collaboration then requested hasbeen exemplary. Today I wish to repeat my request for collaboration and once more express mygratitude in advance. I think that we are all aware of the major task performed hitherto by the Bancode España and that, for this work to continue, it is necessary to adapt to the new circumstances. I amsure that between us all we shall manage to implement the necessary changes successfully.Finally, I wish to convey my gratitude and recognition to each and every one of the members of theGoverning Council for their valuable contributions to the continuity of the institution at the time ofchange of Governor and Deputy Governor, and for their collaboration and support during the initialmonths of my term of office.
BIS Review 56/20011Alan Greenspan: Condition of the US banking systemTestimony of Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem, before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, US Senate, 20 June 2001.*      *      *Mr Chairman and members of the Committee, I am pleased to be here this morning to discuss thecondition of the US banking system. In my presentation today, I would like to raise just a few issues. Ihave attached an appendix in which the Federal Reserve Board staff provides far more detail relevantto the purpose of these hearings.There are, I believe, two salient points to be made about the current state of the banking system. First,many of the traditional quantitative and qualitative indicators suggest that bank asset quality isdeteriorating and that supervisors therefore need to be more sensitive to problems at individual banks,both currently and in the months ahead. Some of the credits that were made in earlier periods ofoptimism – especially syndicated loans – are now under pressure and scrutiny. The softeningeconomy and/or special circumstances have especially affected borrowers in the retail, manufacturing,health care, and telecommunications industries. California utilities, as you know, have also been underparticular pressure. All of these, and no doubt other problem areas that are not now foreseeable,require that both bank management and supervisors remain particularly alert to developments.Second, we are fortunate that our banking system entered this period of weak economic performancein a strong position. After rebuilding capital and liquidity in the early 1990s, followed by several yearsof post-World War II record profits and very strong loan growth, our banks now have prudent capitaland reserve positions. In addition, asset quality was quite good by historical standards before thedeterioration began. Moreover, in the last decade, as I will discuss more fully in a moment, banks haveimproved their risk management and control systems, which we believe may have both strengthenedthe resultant asset quality and shortened banks' response time to changing economic events. Thispotential for an improved reaction to cyclical weakness, and better risk management, is being testedby the events of recent quarters and may well be tested further in coming quarters.We can generalize from these recent events to understand a bit better some relevant patterns inbanking, patterns that appear to be changing for the better. The recent weakening in loan qualitybears some characteristics typical of traditional relationships of loans to the business cycle – thepro-cyclicality of bank lending practices. The rapid increase in loans, though typical of a normalexpansion of the economy, was unusual in that it was associated with more than a decade ofuninterrupted economic growth.As our economy expanded, business and household financing needs increased and projections offuture outcomes turned increasingly optimistic. In such a context, the loan officers whose experiencecounsels that the vast majority of bad loans are made in the latter stages of a business expansion,have had the choice of (1) restraining lending, and presumably losing market share or (2) hoping forrepayment of new loans before conditions turn adverse. Given the limited ability to foresee turningpoints, the competitive pressures led, as has usually been the case, to a deterioration of underlyingloan quality as the peak in the economy approached.Supervisors have had comparable problems. In a rising economy buffeted by competitive bankingmarkets, it is difficult to evaluate the embedded risks in new loans or to be sure that adequate capitalis being held. Even if correctly diagnosed, making that supervisory case to bank management can bedifficult because, regrettably, incentives for loan officers and managers traditionally have rewardedloan growth, market share, and the profits that derive from booking interest income with, in retrospect,inadequate provisions for possible default. Moreover, credit-risk specialists at banks historically havehad difficulty making their case about risk because of their inability to measure and quantify it. At thesame time, with debt service current and market risk premiums cyclically low, coupled with the sameinability to quantify and measure risk, supervisory criticisms of standards traditionally have beendifficult to justify.When the economy begins to slow and the quality of some booked loans deteriorates, as in thecurrent cycle, loan standards belatedly tighten. New loan applications that earlier would have beenjudged creditworthy, especially since the applications are now being based on a more cautious
2BIS Review 56/2001economic outlook, are nonetheless rejected, when in retrospect it will doubtless be those loans thatwould have been the most profitable to the bank.Such policies are demonstrably not in the best interests of banks' shareholders or the economy. Theylead to an unnecessary degree of cyclical volatility in earnings and, as such, to a reduced long-termcapitalized value of the bank. More importantly, such policies contribute to increased economicinstability.The last few years have had some of the traditional characteristics I have just described: thesubstantial easing of terms as the economy improved, the rapid expansion of the loan book, thedeterioration of loan quality as the economy slowed, and the cumulative tightening of loan standards.But this interval has had some interesting characteristics not observed in earlier expansions. First, inthe mid-1990s, examiners began to focus on banks' risk-management systems and processes; at thesame time, supervisors' observations about softening loan standards came both unusually early in theexpansion and were taken more seriously than had often been the case. The turmoil in financialmarkets in 1998, associated with both the East Asian crisis and the Russian default, also focusedbankers' attention on loan quality during the continued expansion in this country. And there was afurther induced tightening of standards last year in response to early indications of deteriorating loanquality, months before aggregate growth slowed.All of this might have been the result of idiosyncratic events from which generalizations should not bemade. Perhaps. But at the same time another, more profound development of critical importance hadbegun: the creation at the larger, more sophisticated banks of an operational loan process with a moreor less formal procedure for recognizing, pricing, and managing risk. In these emerging systems, loansare classified by risk, internal profit centers are charged for equity allocations by risk category, and riskadjustments are explicitly made.In short, the formal measurement and quantification of risk has begun to occur and to be integratedinto the loan-making process. This is a sea change – or at least the beginning of one. Formal risk-management systems are designed to reduce the potential for the unintended acceptance of risk andhence should reduce the pro-cyclical behavior that has characterized banking history. But, again, theprocess has just begun.The federal banking agencies are trying to generalize and institutionalize this process in the currentefforts to reform the Basel Capital Accord. When operational, near the middle of this decade, therevised accord, Basel II, promises to promote not only better risk management over a wider group ofbanks but also less-intrusive supervision once the risk-management system is validated. It alsopromises less variability in loan policies over the cycle because of both bank and supervisory focus onformal techniques for managing risk.In recent years, we have incorporated innovative ideas and accommodated significant change inbanking and supervision. Institutions have more ways than ever to compete in providing financialservices. Financial innovation has improved the measurement and management of risk and holdssubstantial promise for much greater gains ahead.Building on bank practice, we are in the process of improving both lending and supervisory policiesthat we trust will foster better risk management; but these policies could also reduce the pro-cyclicalpattern of easing and tightening of bank lending and accordingly increase bank shareholder valuesand economic stability. It is not an easy road, but it seems that we are well along it.Appendix to testimony of Chairman Alan Greenspan, prepared by staff, Board of Governors ofthe Federal Reserve SystemThe US banking industry is well capitalized and highly profitable by historical standards and inreasonably good shape, although there are signs of erosion as problem loans have risen, especially inlarger syndicated credits. Moreover, some further erosion is likely as borrowers who have taken onheavy debt burdens experience less robust increases in profits and income than might have beenanticipated not too long ago. In many cases, problem loans are a hangover from loans made in themid-1990s when lenders evidently failed to exercise sufficient discipline. After about 1998, banks tooka number of steps to tighten lending standards and terms, which should help to limit furtherdeterioration. Nevertheless, with a weakening economy, problems could well worsen for some banksand some market segments, requiring vigilance by banks and their regulators. As always, the
BIS Review 56/20013underlying issue is how to adopt and price realistic assessments of likely credit risks under alternativescenarios, keeping credit flowing to worthy borrowers at reasonable prices.Today, banking organizations and their supervisors are taking a number of steps that will benecessary to ensure that our financial system continues to flourish and support long-term economicgrowth well into the future. Key elements of such actions are referenced in the last two sections of thisappendix.EarningsAlthough banking profitability has risen to historically high levels in terms of return on assets andreturn on equity over the past decade, in recent periods higher loan loss provision expenses andnarrowing net interest margins have placed pressures on bank profitability. Despite those emergingweaknesses, downside risks likely have been limited by the increasing diversity of noninterest andinterest sources of revenues. The continued push by banks to diversify their revenues by expandingbusiness lines devoted to asset management, servicing, securitization, investment banking, and otherfee-based activities should help stabilize earnings streams. In addition, in the wake of consolidationand interstate banking, many larger firms are less vulnerable to downturns in particular regions orspecialized business lines.Nonetheless, in the past few quarters, emerging earnings weaknesses have been pronounced atsome of the larger banking organizations, which have experienced sharp increases in loan lossprovision expenses, narrowing interest margins, and significant declines in venture capital revenues.During the first quarter of this year, those negative developments at large firms were somewhat offsetby record trading profits and better overhead cost efficiency. While the net effect was a decline inprofits at many larger banking organizations, the underlying strength in the profitability of regional andcommunity banks, coupled with nonrecurring securities gains, helped the industry as a whole achieverecord first quarter earnings of nearly $20 billion.Asset qualityThe rise in nonperforming assets at banking organizations has been pronounced over the past year,especially at larger banking organizations. Despite that rise, these problems generally remainmoderate in historical terms relative to earnings, assets and capital. Assets classified as substandard,doubtful or loss have also risen rapidly in recent periods, though again from a modest base. Much ofthat increase is attributable to larger syndicated credits, though there are some indications of softeningin the credit quality of middle-market borrowers. In response to this rise, banks have written downassets to estimated net realizable values and replenished reserves for expected problems throughloan loss provision expenses.A common theme for many of the problem credits has been significant leverage employed to expandbusinesses during times of ebullient economic and market conditions. Many of these credits wereoriginated during a period of relaxed lending standards that did not adequately account for thesusceptibility of the borrower to weakening sectoral or economic conditions. After the reminders in1998 from the Asian disruptions and the Russian default, lending standards were tightened. But, withthe advent of a softening economy, the embedded risks of weaker or more vulnerable borrowers arebecoming well recognized. Particularly hard hit have been certain borrowers in the retail,manufacturing, health care and telecommunications industries. In addition, unexpected developmentsin asbestos litigation as well as the difficulties faced by the California utilities have also addedconsiderably to the stock of classifications.The rapid deterioration of credit quality in certain segments of bank loan portfolios reflects thesignificant share of the growth in bank lending in recent years to borrowers on the borderline betweeninvestment and noninvestment grade creditworthiness. With the presence of active money and capitalmarkets in the United States, and their ease of access by the best quality borrowers, these creditgrades reflect the quality of those with which our banks now normally deal. They represent the typesof borrowers that tend to require the more customized analysis, underwriting and structuring offered bybanks that may not be as readily available or as cost-effective through the bond market. The highermagnitude and volatility of default rates in these types of borrowers is well documented from decadesof experience in the below-investment grade segment of the bond market. Consequently, asconditions have weakened and defaults have risen sharply in noninvestment grade bonds, a parallelincrease has occurred in troubled and nonperforming loans of bank portfolios. Forecasts for a
4BIS Review 56/2001continued rise in defaults for lower rated bonds by Moody's suggest that bank corporate asset qualityis also likely to deteriorate further before it improves.Although part of the deterioration may be a natural consequence of taking normal business risk in aweaker economy, part also reflects a lack of discipline by some banks, particularly in the 1995-1997interval. As banking organizations relaxed their standards and the rigor of their credit risk analysis inthis period, banking supervisors responded by issuing cautionary guidance and stepped up theintensity of reviews of lending operations at many banking firms. In particular, supervisors pointed outthe need for lenders to avoid the use of overly optimistic assumptions that presumed strong conditionswould prevail indefinitely. In addition, supervisors also noted the lack of downside risk analysis orstress testing as a weakness in risk management practices at many banks.Recent credit losses have highlighted the importance of following those sound lending and evaluationfundamentals and have clearly differentiated strong credit risk management systems from weak ones,prompting many organizations to take remedial action. For the past several years, the bankingagencies have shifted their supervisory approach to focus on risk management processes at bankingorganizations as a more effective means for promoting sound banking practices. While bank riskmanagement practices have improved, in part because of supervisory efforts, recent experience hasshown that more work needs to be done. More recently, to help facilitate improvements underway atbanks in response to current credit difficulties, the banking agencies issued guidance earlier this yearclarifying their expectations regarding sound practices for managing leveraged finance exposures.Even before recent weaknesses, banks had begun to reevaluate their strategic direction and, with theencouragement of supervisors, had become more deliberate about the need to implement formalprocedures for recognizing, pricing, and managing risk. Without these reforms, the recent deterioratingtrends would likely have been considerably worse. In these emerging systems, loans are classified byrisk, internal profit centers are charged for equity allocations by risk category, and risk adjustments areexplicitly made. In addition, more advanced systems provide the metrics that are necessary to supportactive portfolio management, including decisions on whether certain loans exhibiting emergingweaknesses should be sold and at what price. The active sale of troubled syndicated credits has beenan emerging trend among larger organizations. In particular, the increasing appetite for these loans bynonbank investors has helped deepen and liquefy the market, providing an outlet for banks withadequate capital and reserves to sell loans at a discount to par value and to rebalance their portfolios.Today risk management systems have also helped rationalize the pricing of risk through stricter termsand conditions for more vulnerable borrowers. Sophisticated risk management systems are alsohelping banks to reevaluate the profitability of bank lending by benchmarking loans against corporatehurdle rates. In many circumstances, banks are recognizing that without the ancillary cashmanagement or other revenue opportunities attached to the lending relationship, it is difficult to findstand-alone lending opportunities that meet these hurdle rates. By using these sophisticatedquantitative risk management tools to support their decision-making, banks are better able todistinguish profitable versus unprofitable relationships and determine whether a particular customer iscompatible with the bank's appetite for risk.At present, the tightening of terms and standards at banks and the bond market has not inhibited theflow of funding to sound borrowers, though borrowers appear to be increasingly tapping the bondmarket, and lenders and the bond market also are requiring higher spreads for marginal credits. Whiletightening can be over done, so far banks seem to be making balanced decisions on the tradeoffbetween risk and returns. This is a favorable outcome, because it assists in directing capital flows totheir highest and best use in the economy.Much focus has been placed on the dynamics within the corporate loan book, which is currentlyexperiencing the majority of problems, but banks and supervisors should continue to be vigilant forother potential risks. In particular, though retail credit quality has been fairly stable in recent years,consumers, like corporations, have also increased leverage, making their ability to perform understressful circumstances less reliable. In recent years, buoyant economic conditions raisedexpectations for continued growth in income and employment for consumers, which along with risinglevels of wealth, has led to growth in household debt that has outstripped growth in disposablepersonal income over the past five years. That expansion of debt has pushed consumer debt serviceburdens to new highs.With the recent slowdown in the economy, rising personal bankruptcies, an increasing unemploymentrate, and a modest deterioration in loan quality, lenders have tempered their outlook, tightening theirstandards somewhat for credit cards and installment loans. At the same time, while consumer
BIS Review 56/20015spending has leveled out as the economy has weakened, demand for credit has strengthened inrecent periods.Over the past decade, banking organizations have taken advantage of scoring models and othertechniques for efficiently advancing credit to a broader spectrum of consumers and small businessesthan ever before. In doing so, they have made credit available to segments of borrowers that are morehighly leveraged and that have less experience in managing their finances through difficult periods.For the most part, banks appear to have tailored their pricing and underwriting practices to varioussegments of their consumer portfolios to account for the unique risks related to each. Someinstitutions have also tailored lending towards segments with troubled credit histories, the so-calledsubprime market. Such lending can be favorable both to borrowers and lenders. Subprime borrowersbenefit by gaining access to credit and the opportunity to build a sound credit history that mayeventually allow them to achieve prime status. For lenders, subprime lending affords the opportunityfor higher returns provided the necessary infrastructure is in place to closely track and monitor the riskrelated to individual borrowers, which can be labor intensive and costly. Lenders must also recognizethe additional capital and reserve needs to support such lending, particularly if they haveconcentrations in subprime loans.Banks that have not understood the subprime market have had significant difficulties. To ensure thatbanks entering this business properly understand these risks, the agencies have encouraged banks toadopt strong risk management systems tailored to the challenges posed by these loan segments.Beyond poor risk management, there have also been instances in which certain lenders have chargedfees and structured loans designed not to protect against risk, but rather to deceptively extract aborrower's net worth. Such predatory lending practices, though rare, are a cause for concern andexaminers are watchful for programs that would violate the law in this regard.Another area of supervisory focus, of course, is commercial real estate. The exceptional demand foroffice and other commercial real estate in recent years has led to a rebound in the volumes of loanssecured by these properties. This time, however, as demand has grown, larger banking organizationshave managed to keep their holdings modest relative to their asset bases either throughsecuritizations, sales or by avoiding originations altogether. In contrast, many smaller commercialbanks have raised their commercial real estate concentrations relative to assets and capital. Whileunderwriting practices appear to be much healthier today than they were in the 1980s and standardshave tightened somewhat recently, supervisors are paying particular attention to community bankswith concentrations that make them materially vulnerable to a downturn in this market.While for the past several years there have been few real estate markets with material imbalances insupply and demand, emerging signs of weakness make the need for vigilance more pressing. In thefirst quarter of this year, there has been a pronounced increase in nationwide vacancies that hasresulted in a negative net absorption of office space in the United States. That poor performance, theworst in twenty years, has been attributed by some market observers to the abrupt return of officespace to the market by technology firms and to delays by prospective tenants hoping that softeningconditions will lower rents further. In this environment, noncurrent commercial real estate loans haveedged up somewhat in the first quarter. Whether the first quarter represents a temporary phenomenonor the beginning of a longer term trend remains to be seen, but the need for institutions to continue arealistic assessment of conditions and stress test their portfolios is paramount.In addition to real estate, agricultural lending is also facing challenges. Commodity price weakness,coupled with changes in the federal price support programs, has placed pressures on the ability offarmers to service their debt. This in turn has led to a rise in noncurrent farm loans. Banks arecontinuing to identify ways to work with their borrowers to navigate through this difficult period.FundingFor banks to remain in sound condition, they must not only pay attention to the quality of their assets,but also to the nature and quality of their funding. In recent years, large and small banks alike havecome to rely increasingly on large wholesale deposits and nontraditional sources of funds. They havedone so in part as the demand for loans and their own growth objectives have outstripped the growthin insured core deposits. It is true that retail core deposit growth has been quite meager over the pastdecade with higher returns in mutual funds and the stock market luring customers away from bankingdeposits. On the other hand, banks have also made the calculated decision to pay relatively lowinterest rates on some types of retail accounts and rely on higher-priced jumbo deposits or wholesaleborrowing to fund incremental asset growth.
6BIS Review 56/2001Despite competition for household funds, community banks have been relatively successful atmaintaining their core deposit bases. For example, a decade ago banks with less than $50 million inassets funded around 80 percent of their assets with core deposits. Over the course of the pastdecade, that figure eroded by 7 percentage points, but remains a fairly strong 73 percent of assets.That compares to core deposit holdings of only 39 percent for banks with more than $10 billion inassets.While community banks have experienced moderate erosion in the share of core deposits fundingassets, when that trend is coupled with rapid loan growth, pressures on bank liquidity have intensified.To replace core deposits, community banks have been fairly successful at attracting jumbo depositsand have made use of Federal Home Loan Bank advances. Community banks have also funded thegap between loan and deposit growth by liquidating securities holdings and accordingly raising thequantity of loans relative to assets. The combined deposit and loan trends have pushed liquiditybenchmark ratios such as loans-to-deposits to historic peaks. On the other hand, there are some signsof relief for bank liquidity. For one, the demand for loans by businesses and consumers appears to bemoderating, and there are some early indications that consumers are returning to bank retail depositsin the wake of disappointing stock and mutual fund results.Still, many of these liquidity pressures are likely to remain in one form or another, and banks are likelyto continue to explore non-deposit alternatives for managing their balance sheets. While the use ofnon-deposit liabilities to fund growth is not new to banks, the growing volume, variety and complexityof these funds creates new issues. To meet this challenge, banks must strive to fully understand theimplication of relying on these types of funds both from a liquidity and earnings perspective. TheFederal Reserve recently issued guidance on the use of complex wholesale borrowings and thebanking agencies recently issued guidance on rate sensitive deposits to highlight the importance ofadequate management techniques for ensuring stable and consistent funding.Capital and supervisory initiativesThe most stable funding source for bank balance sheets is shareholder equity. More significantly,shareholder equity's key feature is its ability to absorb losses. The need for banks to hold capitalcommensurate with the risk they undertake is highlighted by recent weaknesses in bank asset qualityand the uncertain economic environment. Today, by virtue of market pressures following thedifficulties of the late 1980s, minimum regulatory capital requirements and the ability of many bankingorganizations to measure and recognize their own needs for a cushion against more difficult times, theindustry capital base appears adequate to meet emerging challenges. From a regulatory capitalperspective, the vast majority of all banks meet the definition for well capitalized.The original Basel Accord that was adopted in 1988 has served supervisors and the industry fairly wellover the past decade as one of the primary tools for maintaining a sound banking system. Morerecently, the nature and complexity of risk undertaken by many larger organizations have made theblunt traditional measures of capital adequacy, whether equity-to-assets, leverage, or currentrisk-based capital ratios, less meaningful. In considering the likely continuation of innovations over thenext decade, supervisors must develop ways to improve their tools while reinforcing incentives forsound risk management.The new Basel risk-based proposal seeks to achieve the twin objectives of a more meaningful capitaladequacy measure and promoting sound risk management practices. The proposal by the BaselCommittee that was announced in January of this year calls for an international capital accord that isbased on three pillars: a minimum capital requirement that is more sensitive to risk, a supervisoryreview process, and market discipline. It is important to note that the Basel Committee is in theprocess of reviewing the public's comments on the proposal and there are still a myriad of importantissues and details to address and work out before it can be implemented.The proposal offers a menu of alternative frameworks for establishing minimum capital requirementsso that institutions can be matched with the approach that fits their particular degree of sophistication,risk profile and risk management capabilities. On one end of the spectrum, the proposed advancedapproach, designed for the most sophisticated and complex entities, relies on a bank's internal riskrating and loss estimates in the establishment of the minimum requirements for credit exposures. Atthe other end of the spectrum, the proposed standardized approach modifies the current framework tobe somewhat more risk sensitive but retains many of the simple features of the current accord.
BIS Review 56/20017The second pillar, the supervisory review process, requires supervisors to ensure that each bank hassound risk management processes in place. The emphasis in that review is both on the integrity of theprocess that produces the metrics used in calculating the supervisory minimum, as well as theadequacy of a bank's own analysis of its capital needs.The second pillar fits very well with the Federal Reserve's efforts in recent years to encourage larger,more complex banks to improve their internal risk rating systems while placing more emphasis on theirown internal analysis of capital adequacy. The new accord is much more than an effort to improve themeaningfulness of minimum regulatory capital ratios, although that clearly is an important aspect ofthe proposal. Embodied in the proposal are some important risk management principles and soundpractices that supervisors would expect all of the very largest and most complex US banks to befollowing or aspiring to, even those not electing to use one of the more advanced approaches. Asproposed, the capital standards should provide banking organizations in the United States and abroadwith strong incentives to accelerate their development and implementation of improved riskmanagement systems in order to qualify for a more risk-sensitive regulatory capital treatment.Moreover, the review necessary to ensure that bank risk measures are sound maintains the focus ofsupervisors on the key elements of control and risk management that govern safe and sound banking.The third pillar complements the first two by bolstering market discipline through enhanced disclosuresby banks. By their very nature, many banking risks are opaque. However, innovations in recent yearsthat have helped improve the management of risk have also led to the development of varioussummary statistics to meaningfully describe risks that were qualitatively described in the past. Whilechallenges remain in making such measures comparable or differences across institutions wellunderstood, such disclosures are a necessary complement to the other two pillars for the overallapproach to retain the necessary level of rigor and integrity. Disclosure of information that helpsstakeholders determine risk profiles is designed, of course, to increase, when necessary, the marketpressure and costs on bank lenders that they would otherwise receive as a matter of course if theywere not beneficiaries of the safety net. Market discipline can also provide useful signals tosupervisors.Significantly, the opportunity for enhanced market discipline through disclosure is substantial giventhat larger organizations fund about two thirds of their assets with uninsured funds. However,supplemental information will be irrelevant unless uninsured creditors believe that they are, in fact, atrisk. Uninsured creditors have little reason to engage in risk analysis, let alone act on such analysis, ifthey believe that they will always be made whole under a de facto too-big-to-fail policy. Recognizingthat dilemma, in 1991 the Congress placed in the Federal Deposit Insurance CorporationImprovement Act a requirement for a least-cost resolution of financial institutions. Although anexception clause exists, it does not require that all uninsured creditors be made whole. Conceptually,there are rare situations where events may require that the FDIC and other governmental resourcesbe used temporarily to sustain a failing institution pending its managed liquidation. But indefinitelypropping up insolvent intermediaries is the road to stagnation and substantial resource misallocation,as recent history attests.Indeed, if the government protects all creditors, or is generally believed to protect all creditors, theother efforts to reduce the costs of the safety net will be of little benefit. The implications are similar ifthe public does not, or cannot, distinguish a bank from its affiliates. As financial consolidationcontinues, and as banking organizations take advantage of a wider range of activities, the perceptionthat all creditors of large banks, let alone of their affiliates, are protected by the safety net is a recipefor a vast misallocation of resources and increasingly intrusive supervision.Financial holding companies and umbrella supervisionMindful of the potential for the federal safety net to extend beyond what Congress intended in itsenactment of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ("GLB Act"), the Federal Reserve has been careful todistinguish between insured depositories and uninsured holding company affiliates and parentorganizations in the supervision of financial holding companies ("FHCs"). Consequently, the FederalReserve's focus in FHC supervision has been to identify and evaluate, on a consolidated group-widebasis, the significant risks that exist in a diversified holding company with a view to evaluating howsuch risks might affect the safety and soundness of insured depository institution subsidiaries. Suchsupervision is not intended to impose bank-like supervision on FHCs, nor is it intended to duplicate orreplace supervision by the primary bank, thrift, or functional regulators of FHC subsidiaries. Rather, itseeks, on the one hand, to balance the objective of protecting the depository institution subsidiaries of
8BIS Review 56/2001increasingly complex organizations with significant inter-related activities and risks, against, on theother, the objective of not imposing an unduly duplicative or onerous burden on the subsidiaries of theorganization.To accomplish that objective we have relied on our long-standing relationships with primary bank,thrift, securities and foreign supervisors while forging new relationships with the functional regulatorsthat oversee activities that are newly permitted under the Act. These relationships respect theindividual statutory authorities and responsibilities of the respective supervisors, but at the same time,allow for enhanced information flows and coordination so that individual responsibilities can be carriedout effectively without creating duplication or excessive burden. The Federal Reserve placessubstantial reliance on internal management information maintained by FHCs and on reports filedwith, or prepared by, bank, thrift, and functional regulators, as well as on publicly available informationfor both regulated and non-regulated subsidiaries.Since enactment of the GLB Act, over 500 FHCs have been formed. The vast majority of those aresmall community holding companies that converted largely in an effort to take advantage of theinsurance agency provisions of the GLB Act or to be well positioned should opportunities forexercising new powers present themselves. Most of the larger holding companies have also convertedto FHCs, and appear to be taking advantage of the securities, merchant banking, and to a lesserextent, the insurance provisions of the Act. In addition to the conversion of existing bank holdingcompanies, there have been a few nonbank financial service companies that have applied for andreceived FHC status in connection with their acquisition of banking organizations.In general, banking organizations appear to be taking a cautious and incremental approach toexercising new powers under the GLB Act. In addition, the number of new, truly diversified financialholding companies across securities, insurance and banking has been few enough to let organizationsand supervisors gradually gain experience and comfort in their operations.
BIS Review 56/20011The Rt Hon Sir Edward George: Reflections on the UK’s economic performanceover the past year and future challengesSpeech by The Rt Hon Sir Edward George, Governor of the Bank of England, at the Lord Mayor'sDinner for Bankers and Merchants of the City of London, 20 June 2001.*      *      *My Lord Mayor, Mr Chancellor, my Lords, Aldermen, Mr Recorder, Sheriffs, Ladies and Gentlemen.It is always a privilege, my Lord Mayor, and a pleasure, to be invited to enjoy the splendour, and thegenerous hospitality, of the Mansion House on the occasion of this annual dinner for the Merchantsand Bankers of the City of London. You provide us with an opportunity – in an atmosphere of calm – toreflect upon the events of the year that has gone by and upon the challenges to come.And the past year certainly has been eventful – though it is notable that some of those events did notresult in particularly dramatic change.I think particularly of the Election and I congratulate the Government on the outcome, and you,Chancellor, on your own re-appointment. I very much look forward to continuing to work with you.But I think, too, of our relatively stable overall economic performance – despite the devastating effecton many farmers, and on rural communities more generally, of foot and mouth disease; despite theweather and the floods; despite the disruption on the railways; and despite, above all, the pressureson the internationally-exposed sectors of our economy as a result of developments abroad.In this last context, my Lord Mayor, I was struck by a recent newspaper comment to the effect that ifwe were living on an island we'd be in reasonably good shape. Now I have to confess that I'd alwaysbeen under the impression that we were living on an island, but I let that pass. What I think the writerwas drawing attention to is the fact that despite the recent global economic slowdown – notably in theUnited States, despite the continuing weakness of the euro, and despite the sharp rise in crude oilprices over the past year, we have in fact, in terms of our own overall economy, enjoyed another yearof steady progress.GDP growth in the year to the first quarter – at 2.6% – remained above our longer term trend rate, andwas above the rate of inflation, whether measured by the GDP deflator or our target measure of retailprice inflation (RPIX), for the sixth time in the past eight years. Since the economic expansion beganin 1992, annual output growth has averaged just less than 3% while the rate of inflation has averagedjust under 2 ½%. The number of people in employment last year(on the LFS measure) continued torise fairly steadily to an all-time high; the number of unemployed people fell to below one million (onthe claimant count measure) for the first time since December 1975, and the rate of unemployment fellto its lowest in more than 25 years in the United Kingdom as a whole, and to its lowest for more than20 years in every individual region.But, my Lord Mayor, even if – as I at least continue to believe – we are living on an island, that doesnot make us immune from developments abroad.In particular, we are bound to be affected by current developments in the United States, both directly,and indirectly, through the knock-on effects on third countries, with those effects on the Eurozoneparticularly important for us.By this time last year it had become clear that, even on the most optimistic view of improvingunderlying productivity – as the application of new information and communications technologiesspread through the American economy – the rate of growth in the US, of over 5%, was unsustainablein the light of increasing domestic and external imbalances. The pace of US domestic demand growthneeded to slow – as of course it has.The big questions now are about the extent of the slowdown and how long it will last.On an optimistic view we may be largely through the sharp downward stock adjustment, and withconsumption so far holding up better than generally expected, and with the possibility that investmentwill recover as the spread of ICT through the economy resumes, US activity may pick up as we move,say, into next year. But the pessimist can point to the weakness of private sector saving, which couldinduce more cautious consumer behaviour; he can point to a possible overhang of past investmentexcesses; and he can point to the US external deficit which will need to be corrected at some point.
2BIS Review 56/2001These adjustments might take place gradually over time, implying a more protracted period ofrelatively slow growth in the US Or, if you are really pessimistic, you might anticipate more abruptadjustment, implying a period of negative US growth and global financial instability.The recent somewhat erratic recovery of US financial markets from their earlier gloom suggests thatthey may have begun to side somewhat tentatively with the optimists; but some of the survey evidenceof consumer and business confidence, on the other hand, supports a more pessimistic view.The truth is that none of us knows with any great confidence just how the US situation will evolve. Forwhat it is worth I remain modestly optimistic, but I am very conscious of the downside risks. Theoutcome is obviously the major uncertainty affecting us all.The other major external influence on the economic situation in this country is the development of theexchange rate. Depending on who you speak to sterling is variously described as dangerously weak,at a 15-year low, against the dollar, or as unsustainably strong, close to its peak, against the euro. Thetruth is that sterling's effective exchange rate has been relatively stable for most of the past 2 ½ years– at about 105 on the standard index, plus or minus 5%. The bilateral rates that are frequently quotedin fact tell us very little about sterling: they are essentially a reflection of the persistent general strengthof the dollar on the one hand and the persistent general weakness of the euro on the other, resultingfrom sustained capital inflows to the United States in large part from the Eurozone.It was widely expected that, with the slowdown in the US economy, and associated weakening of USearnings expectations and stock prices, these capital flows would moderate, causing the dollar toweaken and a corresponding recovery in the euro. That clearly has not, yet, occurred,although – given the size of the US external imbalance – it is difficult to see how an exchange rateadjustment can ultimately be avoided.In the meantime, the stronger dollar – and higher oil prices – have added to inflationary pressureselsewhere. But in our own case this effect has been offset by the weakness of the euro – or bysterling's bilateral strength against the euro, if you prefer – which has dampened both externaldemand and our domestic price level.The result of these external developments – the global economic slowdown and the pattern ofexchange rates taken together – for us has been that, notwithstanding only a rather modest slowdownof our overall economy, we have continued to see a growing imbalance between theinternationally-exposed (particularly the euro-exposed) sectors, which have been having a rather torridtime, and the more heavily domestically-oriented sectors, which have been doing rather better. Theweakness of manufacturing alongside continuing growth in the services sectors is a crude reflection ofthis imbalance.With inflation running somewhat below the Chancellor's symmetrical 2½% target, and with developinguncertainties about the continuing strength of domestic demand, the MPC was in a position to respondto these developments by reducing interest rates earlier this year.In fact we cut rates by ¾%, while the Federal Reserve cut much more aggressively, by 2½% overmuch the same period, and the European Central Bank by just ¼% – reflecting the different overallmonetary conditions as they saw them in their respective currency areas. You might suppose thatthese relative interest rate movements would have encouraged the dollar to weaken against sterlingand by more against the euro – and given the pattern of international imbalances it would have beenhelpful if they had. But, in the event exchange rates moved in the wrong direction, illustrating theunpredictable – even perverse – relationship between relative interest rate and exchange ratemovements at least in the short term. That ought to be a salutary lesson to those who imply thatmonetary policy can be directed to controlling both inflation and the exchange rate at the same time!So there is not much that we can do directly, through monetary policy, to affect the various externalinfluences weighing upon our economy. But we can attempt to offset their effects, by encouraging thegrowth of private sector domestic demand to try to keep overall demand in the economy growing inline with potential supply. And that in effect is what we have done through our recent interest rate cuts.This approach is not, however, without risks. It involves accepting – at least while the dampeningexternal influences persist – a growing imbalance between the internationally-exposed and thedomestically-oriented sectors. If we did not accept that, then overall demand and output would belower, and inflation would tend to fall further below target. But the imbalance cannot continue to growindefinitely. At some point the elastic is likely to break – quite possibly through a sharp exchange rate
BIS Review 56/20013adjustment. And at that point, having deliberately stimulated domestic demand growth, we would needto rein it back. But we could then find its momentum hard to stop.I am not suggesting that we are necessarily approaching that point. Domestic inflationary pressures,including wage pressures, have so far remained reasonably subdued and it is crucially important thatthat should continue. But it does explain our caution in moving interest rates down.Somewhat similar concerns explain my reaction to recent speculation that the Government would nowmake a strong push for early entry to the euro. I take no position on the five economic tests which area matter for the Chancellor. But I do see the present external environment – and in particular, as I saidelsewhere last week, the euro's present weakness – as a potentially serious obstacle to early entry.So I very much welcome the considered and cautious approach to making the assessment of the fivetests, which the Chancellor set out this evening.Most people agree that sterling's exchange rate on entry to the euro would need to be substantiallylower than our present rate, which few would regard as sustainable in the medium and longer term.Given the euro's present general weakness, that could come about in either of two ways.If, achieving what was considered to be an appropriate entry rate against the euro – whatever that wasprecisely – involved a substantial depreciation of sterling's overall, effective, exchange rate (that's tosay sterling's rate against other currencies generally), that would be bound to put strong upwardpressure on our domestic rate of inflation. That would not only destabilise our domestic economy, itwould also cause the intended euro-entry rate to appreciate in real terms, with adverse implications forour competitiveness within the Eurozone. These effects would clearly be difficult to contain given theconstraints on both our interest rate and the exchange rate as we moved towards entry, and verydifficult to reverse once we were inside the single currency area.This obstacle would diminish to the extent that the euro itself recovers against other currenciesgenerally – as at some point it surely must. In that case sterling might weaken bilaterally against theeuro, but it might be expected to strengthen against the dollar and other currencies, leaving ouroverall, effective, exchange rate closer to where it currently is. That would have less impact on ourdomestic rate of inflation.There's no question, my Lord Mayor, that what we would like to see, both in the context of our currentmonetary management and if we are to join the euro, is a combination of a pick-up in the globaleconomy and a recovery in the euro exchange rate. That would be in all our interests. But it is not atall clear what we can do to bring it about.In the meantime, as we sail out from our island haven, through conflicting offshore currents andvariable onshore winds, we may not find it easy to remain on the course set for us by Gordon theNavigator. We risk either being blown onto the Scylla of excessive domestic exuberance or suckeddown by the Charybdis of external weakness. But we remain on watch, ready to tack as conditionschange.My Lord Mayor, yours is a great office with a great tradition. You – and the Lady Mayoress – havemaintained that tradition this evening by entertaining us in such splendid style. And you havemaintained that tradition, too, in your tireless promotion of the City of London – in its civic affairs, in itsbusiness activity, and in its engagement with our surrounding communities. In this last connection Ilook forward to joining with you and Howard Davies next Wednesday at the Heart of the City Carnivalto celebrate, and encourage, the City's community and charitable involvement; and I hope that someof your guests this evening might care to join us at the Guildhall for that occasion.But in the meantime I thank you for your gracious hospitality and I would ask all your guests to riseand to join me in a toast to your good health.My Lords, Ladies and Gentlemen, the Toast is"The Lord Mayor and the Lady Mayoress, David and Val Howard".
BIS Review 55/20011Joseph Yam: Consumer protection and the banking industrySpeech by Mr Joseph Yam, JP, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, at the HongKong Association of Banks’ Half-Yearly Dinner, Hong Kong, 19 June 2001.*      *      *Thank you very much for asking me to give the speech this evening. The last time I was invited tospeak at an HKAB dinner was almost exactly two years ago, and the time before that was nearly nineyears ago. Although I am not quite sure whether I could manage the pace if this rate of accelerationwere to continue, it is a pleasure to be getting together with you more frequently. It is also mostappropriate. The banking industry in Hong Kong is going through a period of rapid transformation. Theregulatory system is in the middle of a programme of intensive reform. And the Hong KongAssociation of Banks, now in its 20th year, is currently reviewing its role and aims in the light of thesechanges. As the banking sector’s main representative body, HKAB has an important role to play: Ishall suggest later on, that indeed it has an increasingly important role to play as the banking sectorcontinues to evolve and adapt to changing conditions. Before I turn to that subject, I should like toaddress, very briefly, two broad interconnected subjects: first, the theme of competition, particularly inthe context of the current programme of banking sector reform; and secondly, the question ofconsumer protection, in the light of increasing competition and other trends.Competition and banking sector reformWe are now two years into our programme of extensive banking sector reform. In fact, the firstmeasure under that programme was my clarification, at your dinner in June 1999, of the HKMA’spolicy on the question of Lender of Last Resort. It was a pretty heavy-going speech for an after-dinneroccasion, and I still recall the drooping eyelids and stifled yawns. But at least those of you who satthrough it can take satisfaction in the fact that you were witnessing a minor historical event.Since then, the reform programme has made a great deal of progress. In 1999 we relaxed the “onebuilding” condition on foreign banks licensed since 1978. Last year we expanded access to Real TimeGross Settlement and implemented the first phase in the deregulation of the remaining Interest RateRules. We also completed a study and a public consultation on the case for establishing a commercialcredit reference agency. Earlier this year, a similar public consultation was completed on the case fora deposit insurance scheme. The general view in these consultations was that the two schemesshould be pursued, although we fully recognise that there are dissenting opinions on the question ofdeposit insurance. We are now working out the details for both schemes, and we look forward tofurther consultations with HKAB and other bodies as the proposals progress.The theme of the reform programme is facilitating greater competition in the banking sector whilestrengthening safety and soundness. Perhaps the single most important measure to remove barriersto competition will be the abolition early next month of the last remaining Interest Rate Rules, whichinvolves removing the interest rate cap on savings accounts and ending the prohibition on interest oncurrent accounts. There is, of course, much speculation about the immediate impact of this event:whether it will be a big bang that will change the face of banking services, or merely a quiet change ofgear. Given the plentiful liquidity in the banking system, it is likely that it will be the latter. But thereshould be no doubt about its significance in bringing to an end restrictions that have been in existencefor more than a third of a century. The restrictions, some of you may recall, were introduced in 1964 asa measure to prevent cut-throat competition among banks. They served their purpose, but they havenow outlived their usefulness.Why do we place so much stress on facilitating competition through regulatory reform? I use the term“facilitate” because it is not within the power of a government – and it is certainly not the policy of ourgovernment – to create competition, or to force competition to happen. Competition is a part of HongKong’s free market ethos. It is already strong in the banking sector here. We have witnessed it inparticular – and occasionally with some concern – in the mortgage war and in the provision of creditcard and other consumer services. Competition is being sharpened and stimulated by globalisation,which opens up hitherto restricted markets to businesses that are able to export their strengths, andby technological advance, which puts a premium on innovation and ingenuity.
2BIS Review 55/2001For the economy as a whole, competition promotes efficiency in the allocation of resources andstrength and flexibility in the face of change or crisis. In the banking sector, greater competitionstrengthens both individual banks, by forcing them to focus on their own core competence, and thebanking system as a whole, by weeding out inefficiencies. For the consumer, competition promoteschoice, quality and efficiency in products and services, and more reasonable costs. But competition,by its very nature, produces winners and losers. It also complicates the relationship between banksand customers, as services and fee structures become more complex and more sophisticatedproducts proliferate.The general government policy on competition in Hong Kong is to adopt a sector-specific approach.We are not disposed to the idea of a general, overarching competition authority, since each sector ofthe economy has its own special needs and concerns. The banking sector, which has its own uniquehistory, and which, for obvious reasons, is subject to more supervision than perhaps any other sectorof the economy, requires a particularly focused approach. The approach here is a simple but proactiveone. The main policy objectives are to remove barriers to competition, such as the Interest Rate Rules,and to maintain a level playing field, particularly with regard to access to infrastructure.In addition to this proactive policy approach, there are two main subsidiary concerns. One of these isto watch out for signs of collusion or anti-competitive behaviour in the industry and to address thesewhen they occur. I should note here that we do not see such signs at present, though we remainvigilant. The other is a general concern that the adjustments to fees and services, which form anecessary part of the competition and reallocation of resources resulting from deregulation, should notlead to the exclusion of certain groups in society from a basic level of banking services, and that theyshould be introduced in a transparent way. Again, I should make it clear that, despite the concernsexpressed by a number of groups over the last few months, we believe that, in general, the banks areaddressing this point. I should also add, for the avoidance of any doubt, that it is not the HKMA’spolicy to regulate fees and charges. This is something that is left to the market. It would hardly beconsistent for us on the one hand to be promoting greater competition and on the other to seek todetermine or influence fees and charges. However, the public concern about the effects ofderegulation, coupled with the recognition of the importance of banking services to people’s daily lives,suggest that we should be paying more attention than we have in the past to the question of consumerissues. This is the subject to which I should now like to turn.Consumer protectionFirst, I think it needs to be understood that the changes now going on in banking services, includingthe restructuring of fees and charges, are not solely the result of interest rate deregulation. There area number of factors – global as much as local – that are driving banks into refocusing their business.These include: increased competition from both within and outside the banking industry; pressure toincrease shareholder value; the need to develop new income streams amid a shortage of conventionallending opportunities; and globalisation, which is inducing banks to specialise in forms of business inwhich they have a competitive advantage. These various factors are forcing banks to innovate(cid:1) through new products and new technologies – in order to diversify their income. They are alsoforcing banks to become more cost-efficient: to scrutinise the profitability of their various services, andto rationalise cost structures. The result in many cases has been substantial changes in retail bankingservices: for example, the selling off of business units, the closing down of branches, the expansioninto fee-based business, such as MPF and insurance services, the development of more cost-effectivemodes of service delivery, such as the ATM network and the Internet, and the imposition of specificfees and charges on services that did not incur fees and charges in the past.Consumers also need to react to the changing environment – for example, through making use ofdelivery channels such as ATMs, telephone banking or the internet that reduce the cost of usingbanking services. Cost minimisation also provides the incentive for consumers to shop around, andnew technology in the form of the Internet enhances the means of doing so. With the shopping aroundcomes awareness of what else is on offer, and greater expectations on the part of the consumer. Lesspositively, there has been disruption and anxiety, which has been reflected in the steadily growingnumber of complaints and protests, and in the greater political attention being paid to this subject.What is the stance of the HKMA? We do not, as I have already said, regulate fees and charges. Butwe seek to ensure that there is transparency in the provision of services, particularly in the setting outof fees and charges. The Code of Banking Practice, which is a non-statutory code issued jointly byHKAB and the DTC Association with our endorsement, is the main tool for achieving this end, and, as
BIS Review 55/20013you all know, the Code is currently being subjected to extensive revision and strengthening. Thisprocess is almost at an end and we believe that it will make the Code an even more effective tool. Inaddition to transparency, we hope that the banks, in making their decisions on fees and charges, willshow some sensitivity to the needs of the more vulnerable members of society. We believe that, sofar, banks are displaying such sensitivity. We also wish to ensure that there continues to be choice forcustomers. Again, we believe that there is choice, and that deregulation, new technology, newproducts are indeed combining with competition to provide a greater choice than ever before. We shallcontinue to monitor.This is a reasonably healthy picture. But it is time also, I think, to look at the current arrangements forconsumer protection in the banking industry, to see whether improvements are needed, and if so,what they should be. The HKMA already plays an informal role in addressing consumer complaints,though we have no powers to settle disputes. Should we – or should someone else – be given suchpowers? Should there be sanctions for banks that fail to comply with codes of practice? How doesHong Kong compare with other jurisdictions in this area?It was with the intention of clarifying some of the issues surrounding banking consumer protection thatwe recently undertook a comparative study of the practices in the UK, Australia and Hong Kong. Thereport on this study has been presented to the LegCo Panel on Financial Affairs and has been madeavailable to the general public, and, of course, to the banking sector. The study examines the differentapproaches to this subject in Australia and the UK, but it notes that, in contrast to Hong Kong, theregulators in both places have been given a specific mandate in relation to the protection ofconsumers of financial and banking services. Two further major differences between Hong Kong andthe overseas regimes are highlighted: first, in the setting, monitoring and enforcement of standards ofbusiness practice; and, secondly, in the investigation, resolution, and arbitration of customercomplaints. With regard to the former, Australia and the UK both, like Hong Kong, have anon-statutory Code of Banking Practice, which sets the standards. But both Australia and the UK takethis a stage further, with the formal monitoring of compliance by a specialist agency, which, in the UKcase at least, has the power to impose sanctions against institutions that breach the Code. For theresolution of customer complaints, both the UK and Australia have a formalised Ombudsman scheme,with powers to arbitrate in disputes.These two key features of the British and Australian systems illustrate how the arrangements in HongKong do not go as far as, or are less formalised than, those in other jurisdictions. This may havesomething to do with different philosophical approaches: in Hong Kong the tradition has been a free-market one, which entails a very low level of government involvement in business relationships. But asthe Hong Kong market becomes more sophisticated and more competitive, and as consumer issuesare coming more to the fore, it may be useful to consider whether Hong Kong should follow the path ofother jurisdictions.At this early stage of discussion, there seem to be three broad options, which are not necessarilymutually exclusive. The first is some form of self-regulation by the banking industry. The second is toprovide a specific mandate to the regulator, that is the HKMA. The third is to place the responsibility inthe hands of an Ombudsman. There are a number of issues – some philosophical, some practical –that will need to be taken into account in deciding in the fullness of time where the responsibility wouldlie. As far as the HKMA is concerned, the arguments for and against are, I suggest, finely balanced.One argument holds that a more formal role for the HKMA in this area might create a conflict ofinterest between our prudential regulation and consumer protection roles. The other point of view isthat the two roles can co-exist if there are sufficiently high and thick Chinese walls between them, andthat, furthermore, there are synergies between the two roles, and cost benefits to be achieved. TheHKMA has an open mind on this issue, and we are hoping to receive views on the way forward, fromthe industry, from Legislative Councillors, and from the community at large. And I should stress, beforethe charge of empire building is raised, that this is not necessarily one of the functions that the HKMAwould wish to add to its already onerous responsibilities.There is, of course, the parallel question of whether HKAB, as the main industry organisation, and asthe traditional vehicle for self-regulation, should play a role in consumer protection. Here again thearguments seem to be evenly balanced. On the one hand, the knowledge and proximity to the industrywould place HKAB at an advantage in handling complaints. On the other hand, there could be theperception of a conflict of interest. I note that it is not HKAB’s wish to take on the formal role ofconsumer protection, and I respect that. But, whichever organisation takes on the formal role, HKABwill almost certainly have a part to play in shaping policies and practices in this area.
4BIS Review 55/2001The future role of HKABQuite apart from consumer protection, the larger question remains of what the industry, the HKMA,and not least the community might expect from HKAB in the future, after one of its principalresponsibilities – the weekly setting of interest rates – has been taken away. It is this subject that Ishould like briefly to address in the final section of this speech.It is, perhaps, something of an irony that, at a time when HKAB’s formal powers are diminishing, itspublic profile has never been higher. We know from the television and the press that it has becomealmost a weekly tradition for your Chairman to appear down in Statue Square to receive petitions,banners, and all kinds of symbolic objects from concern groups. I think this says something about thereputation that HKAB has established as the industry body. It also says something about publicexpectations of its role. It is therefore timely, during a period of deregulation and rising expectations,that there should be a reconsideration of how HKAB’s role could be developed.I should stress that the decision on how that role should be developed is ultimately a matter for HKABitself. HKAB has, in fact, already commissioned a consultant to examine this subject, and you havenow published the Report for consultation with member banks. The HKMA has read the Report, andfrom our point of view the recommendations in it are sensible and realistic. Taking into account theReport, and how we see the banking sector developing, we see scope for developing HKAB’s role infour broad areas.First, and perhaps most important, the Report recommends that HKAB could take further its functionas the voice of the industry. We support this recommendation. HKAB already fulfils this role to a greatextent, particularly in its submissions on policy proposals and in its regular meetings with us on avariety of operational issues. But this role could be deepened, particularly in developing a more unifiedposition on major policy issues, and in achieving a position that broadly reflects the views of the wholeof the banking industry. I would even suggest that there is scope for HKAB to become not just thespokesperson for the banking industry, but also a lobbyist for the industry. This is not an easy task,because the banking industry in Hong Kong is diverse and not always able to come to a single view onissues that affect it. Nor is there any reason why it should do so on every issue. However, HKAB coulddevelop its profile and gain strength as a representative organisation if it were to work on developingits role as the clear industry voice.The second main recommendation in the Report concerns HKAB’s role in the development of theCode of Banking Practice. The Code, which sets the standards for banking services, is jointly issuedby HKAB and the DTC Association, with the endorsement of, and involvement of, the HKMA. It is anon-statutory code, although compliance with it is expected of all AIs. It is monitored by the HKMA aspart of its regular supervision, although, as I mentioned earlier, we have no formal, statutory mandatein this project. There is, I think, scope, as the Report advocates, for HKAB to take greater ownership ofthis code, particularly in the setting of standards – and in ensuring that these are high standards – andin monitoring and enforcing compliance. This would be consistent with the practice of bankingassociations in other jurisdictions, and it would be a logical development of HKAB’s role.A third area highlighted in the Consultant’s Report is consumer education in the field of bankingservices. This is a neglected subject in Hong Kong. The question of which organisation should takethe lead in this is, of course, tied to the question of who should take on consumer protection. But,whatever the answer to the second question, it seems clear that HKAB would need to be involved insome form or another. This, in fact, reflects the practice among industry organisations in otherjurisdictions, many of which have a strong tradition of producing plain-language factsheets, webpagesand other resources on running personal finances, protecting one’s financial interests, and making themost of new forms of financial services.Moving away from the recommendations in the Consultant’s Report, there is, I think, a fourth area inwhich HKAB could become more involved. This is in the development of Hong Kong’s financialinfrastructure. This is one of the HKMA’s key policy objectives, but it is also an area in which HKABhas a keen and constructive interest. In particular, HKAB, together with the HKMA, is joint owner ofHong Kong Interbank Clearing Ltd, which operates one of the key features of Hong Kong’s financialinfrastructure, the Real Time Gross Settlement System. One other project on which HKAB can workclosely with the HKMA is in the development of a Commercial Credit Reference Agency. Some of yourmembers are already participating in the Working Group that is now engaged in thrashing out thedetails of how the CCRA would work. An issue which has been raised in the deliberations of theWorking Group is whether HKAB should participate in the ownership of the CCRA, as it does inHKICL. This was not an idea that found much favour when we consulted the industry on the CCRA
BIS Review 55/20015scheme last year. But perhaps, now that it seems likely that such a scheme will go ahead, it is an ideawhich should be revisited at some stage in the future. That is a matter for HKAB and it is one that Ileave you to think about. Even if you were to confirm the earlier view not to participate directly in thisparticular project, it would not undermine the general principle that the HKMA and HKAB should,wherever feasible, work hand in hand in developing important pieces of the financial infrastructure.ConclusionTo summarise, deregulation will bring greater competition to the banking industry, which shouldenable banks to exercise a great deal more freedom in the nature of business they pursue and in theform of services they offer. Ideally, this freedom should also provide greater choice for the consumer,greater efficiency in the delivery of services, and better value for money. In practice, however, thetransitional period in which we now find ourselves will also give rise to misunderstandings, disputes,and dissatisfaction among many consumers that will need to be resolved. To approach theseproblems and to find practical ways of resolving them, we need to develop a more sophisticated andbetter organised system of consumer protection. We have now placed the subject on the table fordiscussion. I hope that the community and its representatives, and the industry, through yourorganisation, will take up the debate and help shape an effective solution.
BIS Review 55/20011Bank of Japan’s June report of recent economic and financial developments1Bank of Japan, 18 June 2001* * *The Bank’s view2Adjustments in economic activities are gradually intensifying, as production is declining substantiallyreflecting a fall in exports.With regard to final demand, the recovery in private consumption continues to be weak as a whole, butthere are somewhat positive signs in some indicators. Housing investment is declining. Publicinvestment is increasing. On the other hand, net exports (real exports minus real imports) continue todecrease, reflecting not only a slowdown in overseas economies such as those of the United Statesand East Asia but also sluggish demand for information technology (IT) related goods. Business fixedinvestment is starting to decrease while exporting conditions continue to deteriorate.Industrial production continues to decline sharply, reflecting such developments in final demand and afurther buildup of excess inventories of electronic parts and some materials. The environmentsurrounding corporate profits is becoming more severe in line with the substantial decline in exportsand production, and business sentiment is worsening particularly in manufacturing. Income conditionsof households have not yet deteriorated, but the decline in production is starting to affect thehousehold sector mainly through the decrease in hours worked.As for the outlook, public investment is likely to continue increasing for the time being but is expectedto start declining in the near future. Net exports, however, are likely to continue decreasing for a whileamid the deceleration in overseas economies and ongoing inventory adjustments in IT-related goodsworldwide. Judged from leading indicators and investment plans of firms, business fixed investment isprojected to follow a downward trend. In addition, inventory adjustments in goods such as electronicparts and materials will continue for the time being. Industrial production is, therefore, expected tofollow a declining trend. In these circumstances, corporate profits are likely to start decreasing andthus household income is expected to weaken gradually.Overall, the adjustments, mainly in production, are likely to continue for some time. Among factorsaffecting exports, it is generally thought that inventory adjustments in IT-related goods are expected tofinish by early fall and overseas economies, particularly the United States, will follow a gradualrecovery trend from around the end of this year. In this case, exports are expected to underpin theeconomy once again. However, a prolonged deceleration of overseas economies could yield the riskof economic adjustments spreading further. Also, attention should be paid to the risk of a negativeimpact on the economy induced by developments in foreign and domestic capital markets viacorporate and household confidence.With regard to prices, import prices are rising, mainly reflecting the rebound in crude oil prices inaddition to the prior depreciation of the yen. Domestic wholesale prices are declining mainly due to thedecrease in prices of electrical machinery. Consumer prices continue to be somewhat weak owing tothe decline in prices of imported products and their substitutes. Corporate service prices continue todecrease.As for the conditions surrounding price developments, the prior yen depreciation is exerting upwardpressure on prices. However, with the ongoing adjustments in economic activities, the balancebetween supply and demand in the domestic market is likely to exert downward pressure on prices.Furthermore, in addition to the declining trend of machinery prices caused by technologicalinnovations, the decreases in the prices of goods and services reflecting deregulation and thestreamlining of distribution channels will continue to restrain price developments. Overall, prices areexpected to be weak for the time being. Moreover, given the high degree of uncertainty regardingfuture economic developments, the possibility that weak demand will intensify downward pressure onprices warrants careful monitoring.                                                     1This report is based on data and information available at the time of the Bank of Japan Monetary Policy Meeting held onJune 14 and 15, 2001.2The Bank’s view of recent economic and financial developments, determined by the Policy Board at the Monetary PolicyMeeting held on June 14 and 15 as the basis for monetary policy decisions.
2BIS Review 55/2001In the financial market, the overnight call rate is basically moving at about 0.01 percent under theguideline for money market operations to maintain the current-account balance at the Bank of Japanat around 5 trillion yen.Interest rates on term instruments are level on the whole. The Japan premium remains negligible.Yields on long-term government bonds recently decreased to 1.1-1.2 percent after remaining flat at1.2-1.3 percent. The yield spreads between private bonds (bank debentures and corporate bonds) andgovernment bonds are mostly unchanged or contracting somewhat.Stock prices continue to be weak, reflecting the somewhat more cautious views of market participantstoward future corporate profits.In the foreign exchange market, the yen appreciated against the U.S. dollar toward early June, but hasweakened thereafter and is currently being traded in the range of 120-123 yen to the U.S. dollar.With regard to corporate finance, private banks continue to be more active in extending loans, mainlyto blue-chip companies, while carefully evaluating the credit risks involved. However, there are somesigns indicating that the lending attitude of financial institutions perceived by small firms is becomingslightly more cautious. Meanwhile, the fund-raising conditions of firms in the markets for suchinstruments as corporate bonds and CP are improving further owing to the decline in market interestrates and the more active stance of investors to take credit risks.On the other hand, credit demand of private firms continues to lack momentum as the level ofcorporate expenditures such as business fixed investment remains below firms’ cash flow. Moreover,firms continue to reduce their debts as part of their balance-sheet restructuring measures. As a result,credit demand in the private sector has continued to be basically stagnant.In view of this, the underlying tone of private banks’ lending remains sluggish. The growth rate ofamount outstanding of corporate bonds issued is slightly below 2 percent year-on-year. The amountoutstanding of CP issued is well above that of the previous year and marking the highest level to date,reflecting the favorable environment for issuing CP.The growth rate of money stock (M2 + CDs) in May was higher than that of the previous month duemainly to the inflow from postal savings.Funding costs for firms are on a declining trend reflecting developments in market interest rates.In this financial environment, the lending attitude of financial institutions and corporate financingconditions remain easy as a whole. For the time being, attention should be paid to the effects of themonetary easing measures taken by the Bank, while careful monitoring is required for the effects ofstock price developments and corporate profit conditions on the behavior of financial institutions andthe fund-raising conditions of firms.
BIS Review 54/20011Ernst Welteke: Cross effects between monetary policy and financial marketsLecture by Mr Ernst Welteke, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, held at the Belgian FinancialForum in Brussels, 14 June 2001.*      *      *Ladies and gentleman,It is a pleasure for me to speak today on “Cross effects between monetary policy and financialmarkets” to such a distinguished audience here at the Belgian Financial Forum in Brussels.The heading looks like an obvious choice for a central banker. The issue of cross effects is of ongoinginterest for policymakers and market participants alike. The introduction of the single currency andconcomitant changes in integrating European financial markets have brought these cross effects evenmore into the spotlight. Not least, the BIS has – in its latest annual report – devoted considerablespace to these issues. Furthermore, – I trust you will grant me the quote – “irrational exuberance” inmajor stock markets has reinvigorated the debate about financial market prices and their appropriaterole in monetary policy.IThe European Central Bank (ECB) has been given a clear mandate to keep inflation in check. Inchoosing the monetary policy framework for the euro area, the Governing Council has kept thisconcept to the fore. Open market operations and the standing facilities play a prominent role. Thus, interms of monetary policy in the euro area, the European Central Bank makes ready use of financialmarkets to get its policy across into the real economy – just as any other modern central bank does.Monetary transmission is a complicated and permanently changing process. It is not yet fullyunderstood and is therefore always a field of fruitful research. Conceptually, the transmission processcan be broken down into two stages. Changes in official interest rates first affect financial markets.Those markets react fast. In the next stage, a policy move makes itself felt in the broader economy,thereby exerting the desired influence on consumer prices. That is by no means a straightforwardprocess. And it takes time. These time lags explain why the Eurosystem adopts a medium-termperspective when shaping monetary policy.Those parts of the European financial markets that are crucial for the transmission of the Eurosystem’smonetary policy are already integrated to our satisfaction. The wholesale market for interbank liquidityin the euro area is now a single European money market.Any change in official interest rates first affects the money market. Then rates along the entire yieldcurve adapt. In addition, equities are repriced after a policy move due to two factors:(cid:1) First, a change in the discount factor(cid:1) and, second, revised earnings expectations stemming from changes in firms’ financing costsand prospective sales.The adjustments in financial markets then translate into the broader economy via cost, income andwealth effects. The speed and the relative weight of the transmission channels identified depend onthe structural conditions in the economy. Habits in finance and investment among businesses andprivate households are important. As is overall flexibility of the economy. As the euro area as a wholeis a relatively closed economy – about 17 % of GDP is generated by exports –, the exchange ratechannel is of minor importance for monetary transmission.IIFinancial markets are dynamic and innovative; structural change is everyday business. Recently, theintroduction of the single currency in Europe has been seen to coincide with changes in investmentand financing habits. As central bankers, we in the European System of Central Banks monitor thesedevelopments closely for their potential impact on monetary transmission.The relative importance of banking systems vis-à-vis financial markets as a source of corporatefinance still varies in the euro area economies. So, consequently, does monetary transmission,although not to a degree that would hamper the single monetary policy.
2BIS Review 54/2001On the contrary, we see euro-area-wide disintermediation generating further convergence towards atruly European monetary transmission mechanism. Companies are now tapping capital markets moreintensively. In other words, firms have begun to rely less on banks for corporate finance.Capital markets are gaining importance as a means of obtaining corporate finance, as opposed tobank credit. The amount outstanding of (domestic currency denominated) corporate bonds byeuro-area residents rose one-fifth last year; for short-term paper the figure is even two-fifths. Banksare increasingly adapting to this trend. More and more they are providing corporate clients withaccess to capital markets. The banks themselves profit from securitisation. It helps them to make moreefficient use of their capital and to generate the desired fee income. The role of banks in monetarytransmission is therefore changing.Faced with competition from firms directly tapping capital markets, banks are now setting their interestrates for lending more closely in line with prevailing market rates. Shrinking interest rate margins arethe result. Any change in official interest rates will therefore translate faster into adjusted spendingplans of the economic agents in the non-financial sector. Thus, there is an acceleration of monetarypolicy transmission.However, there is also a factor that potentially works towards slower transmission. Those countries inthe euro area with a history of higher inflation rates tend to rely more heavily on short-term lending andon variable rates. In those countries, monetary policy stimulus affects the non-financial sectorconsiderably faster. As these countries are now experiencing a higher degree of price stability, marketparticipants will feel secure about shifting towards longer-term contracts and fixed rates. This will resultin monetary transmission being slowed down.The ultimate effect of those two opposite trends is still uncertain. I tend to lean towards expectingmonetary transmission to accelerate. Capital markets are dynamic; they are innovative and theypermanently create new instruments that increase flexibility in terms of finance. In flexible financialmarkets, however, monetary impulses should be passed through at a faster rather than a slower pace.Disintermediation in corporate finance coincides with the institutionalisation of savings. Privatehouseholds shift funds from bank accounts into pension funds and mutual fund shares. Shareownership – direct and indirect – is on the increase. As the value of equities tends to be more volatilethan that of other financial assets, changes in financial wealth may impinge on consumption decisionswith greater frequency. However, the wealth effect for the euro area is considered to be rather small.In Germany we estimate the marginal propensity to consume out of financial wealth to be about 1%.That is, an increase in financial wealth of 100 euros would spark additional demand of 1 euro.Given this change in investor attitude, should central banks actively target asset prices? The potentialinfluence of asset prices on the economy and concerns about financial market stability lie behind suchconsiderations. However, objections against targeting asset prices by far outweigh any potentialbenefits.(cid:1) First, there is the issue of knowing the appropriate asset price level. There is no way for acentral bank to know that better than the market.(cid:1) Second, stabilising consumer prices and stabilising asset prices may call for diverging policypaths. Central banks may well find themselves faced with the dilemma of having to decide towhich goal to give priority.(cid:1) Third, targeting asset prices creates “moral hazard”.Therefore, it would be unwise for monetary policy to even try to target asset prices.Nonetheless, monetary policy contributes to a sound development of asset prices. The ECB’smonetary policy strategy emphasises money supply in the first pillar of its strategy. An adequatemoney supply – that is, money supply which is in line with potential output growth – is a necessarycondition for preventing the emergence of speculative bubbles. In addition, a low inflation rate of itselffosters long-term investment and helps to stabilise asset prices.IIIFinancial markets naturally play a part in shaping monetary policy. In the second pillar of the ECB’smonetary policy strategy, a broad set of indicators for the medium-term outlook for price stability andfor economic growth are observed.
BIS Review 54/20013It is in three respects that financial market prices are particularly valuable for monetary policymakers.First, they provide us early on with leading indicators as to market expectations about macroeconomicdevelopments. For example, changes in the term structure of interest rates relate to future economicgrowth. A steepening of the yield curve typically forecasts stronger economic growth.Such an increase in the term spread would, however, not convey unambiguous information. Higherlong-term rates could also reflect expectations of higher future inflation or a change in risk premia.Additional information from asset and money markets may therefore be necessary to interpret marketexpectations in this regard.Second, measuring the expected volatility of future financial market prices shows us the degree ofuncertainty attached to expectations. Implied volatility derived from options on long-term bonds is anexample. However, there is no consensus on how to read volatility exactly. We do not know for surewhich particular component of the long-term bond yield – the real interest rate, expected inflation orrisk premia – determines volatility. Thus, the informational value of these measurements is limited.Third, financial market prices give us insights into the expectations of market participants with regardto monetary policy action. EURIBOR rates are especially helpful in this respect. They allow us toconstruct a yield curve for the money market. Additional information can be derived from three-monthfutures. Thus, we havea pretty good picture of anticipations prevailing in the market with regard tomonetary policy moves. All in all, financial markets provide central bankers with helpful information.The use of market information is, however, subject to some caveats. Financial market prices are opento a whole host of influences – including distortions by institutional features, irrational behaviour andherding behaviour, for instance.Market expectations can therefore never be a substitute for the central bank’s own independentassessment of the economic situation and of future developments. We use financial market prices tocomplement and cross-check our own economic assessments.While we try to figure out what the markets think, the markets are busy trying to figure out what wethink. We watch them – and they watch us. If the central bank always met market expectations,destabilising circularity could occur. Monetary policy decisions have to be based mainly onfundamental economic data.Reducing uncertainty as far as possible is clearly one of the aims of the Eurosystem. The Eurosystemtherefore communicates extensively with the markets. Which is why, for example, we decided topublish our staff economic projections.The increased role of communication and transparency reflects a change in the relationship betweenmonetary policy and financial markets. Monetary policy today makes use of financial markets a lotmore actively and openly than it did in earlier times.IVLadies and gentlemen, having presented you some general remarks on monetary policy let me nowget down to the specifics of the current situation of monetary policy in the euro area.The Governing Council of the ECB is, at present, taking its decisions in a climate of considerableglobal economic uncertainty. In a situation like this it is particularly important to pursue a clear andconsistent rule-based policy. The monetary policy strategy developed by the Governing Council of theECB meets precisely that need. The public is right to expect the Governing Council of the ECB to stickto its strategy and to present its own interest rate assessments.Let’s start with the money supply. It plays a prominent role as the “first pillar” of monetary policy, theunderlying perception being that inflation is, in the long term, essentially a monetary phenomenon. Themoney supply in the euro area increased by 4.6 % from February to April, compared with the samemonths one year previously. This increase is roughly in line with the 4½ % reference value – in otherwords, the level which is in keeping with price stability and trend economic growth.Monetary growth has been tending to slow down since the spring of 2000. Because of some statisticaldistortions, even more, in fact, than was initially expected. There are two main causes of thesedistortions.First, non-euro-area residents have considerable holdings of money market fund units. However, themoney supply concept relates to euro-area residents, mainly because the amount of cash residentshold in the euro area is relevant in terms of expenditure. The latest figures from the ECB currently put
4BIS Review 54/2001this distortion at 0.5 percentage point. The money growth rate figure I mentioned a moment ago hasalready been adjusted.Second, other short-term money market instruments, which are likewise held by non-euro-arearesidents, also exaggerate the extent of monetary growth. Precise statistical data for this category ofinstrument are still being collected by the ECB and will be published at the end of the year.If all these facets are taken into account, monetary growth is well below the quoted figure and cannottherefore be described as expansionary. From a medium-term perspective, there is no indication ofprice risks.In connection with the second pillar of the ECB’s strategy, the data point to decreasing pressure onprices. This would appear to be at odds with the current unsatisfactory price trend; euro-area inflationwas 3.0 % in April. However, this was largely due to special factors, the effect of which is likely tosubside in the coming months. Basically, these factors are the higher prices of crude oil and, as aresult, of fuel, together with the effect on prices produced by the crisis in the food sector.Wage negotiators have been right to assume that the inflationary effects are temporary, as there havebeen no second-round effects so far. In stating that, I refer to the most recent wage settlement in theGerman banking sector. Negotiators have agreed on a wage increase of slightly less than 3 %. Nowthat economic risks can no longer be ignored, it is extremely important to negotiate moderate wagesettlements.The rise in the cost of energy is currently driving overall prices up, while at the same time putting thebrake on the economy. The outlook and forecasts in the euro area for this year have had to beadjusted. Industrial output and capacity utilisation have already declined somewhat. Surveys showthat industrial sentiment, in particular, has become far more gloomy. Viewed from this angle, this couldalso entail limited price risks for the period ahead.While the economic outlook is running counter to inflationary pressures, the euro exchange rate mustbe watched very closely for possible risks to price stability. Let me again stress our utmost interest in astrong currency. The external value of the euro is an important indicator in the second pillar of theECB’s monetary policy strategy.Financial markets share our medium-term expectations for price developments. Capital market ratesare still at a low level – a reflection of the expectation that possible inflationary pressure will be undercontrol over the longer term. Interest rates, at least, are not an impediment to an economic upturn.After weighing up all the factors and taking account of the medium-term orientation of monetary policy,I have reached the conclusion that the current monetary policy stance is appropriate at the presentjuncture.VLadies and gentlemen,Let me now try to summarise the main features of the interdependence between monetary policy andfinancial markets:(cid:1) Central banks need well-functioning financial markets. They work as the crucial link betweenmonetary policy-setting and its ultimate goal, price stability. Disintermediation furtherheightens the importance of financial markets in the transmission mechanism of monetarypolicy. Therefore, monetary policymakers need to analyse structural changes in financialmarkets thoroughly.(cid:1) Central banks acquire information about the expectations of financial market participants bymonitoring financial market prices. They cross-check their own forecasts against these data.(cid:1) Finally, in order to avoid misperceptions of the policy stance in the markets, there has to be aconsistent communication policy.With capital markets integrating and habits in the fields of finance and investment changing, as centralbankers in the euro area we have now entered a period of heightened uncertainty. The ECB has optedfor a monetary policy strategy that anchors the markets’ expectations of future price stability. The two-pillar approach to assessing the outlook for prices is appropriate in times of structural change, as it isnot only credible, but also highly flexible. Financial markets therefore have a reliable partner in theEurosystem – one that is well equipped to meet current and future challenges.
BIS Review 53/20011Carlos Massad: New economy, old cycle?Remarks by Mr Carlos Massad, Governor of the Central Bank of Chile, in a panel discussionorganised by the Bank for International Settlements, Basel, Switzerland, 10 June 2001.*      *      *1.IntroductionThe new economy involves changes: faster and cheaper communications, higher labor productivity,savings in the supply chain in the business to business sector, and improvements in inventory control.It also involves growing integration of world markets. As a counterpart, we are experiencing increasedvolatility in stock prices and terms of trade. Krugman has gone even further, to assert that “growingintegration does predispose the world economy to more crisis”1. What are the consequences of thesechanges on emerging market economies? Furthermore, we Central Bankers have faced manychanges, and must be prepared for changes, whatever their source. How should these economiesrespond to those changes? These are critical issues today for almost every emerging economy.2.Any impact on the real economy?Globalization of international financial markets over the last decade, a by-product of cheaper andfaster communications, has led to an increase in asset return correlation around the world. Swings inthe Dow Jones, NASDAQ and in fixed rate instruments lead to adjustments in portfolio decisions theworld over that have implications for the real economy. The higher the correlation of returns, the lower,on this ground, the incentive for short-term capital movements.However other, well-known transmission channels from portfolio adjustments to the real economy arewealth effects on consumption and Tobin´s q on investment.Evidence in industrial countries suggests that the semielasticity of consumption to a permanentincrease in stock prices is of the order to 0.04 after two years2. In emerging economies, where only alimited number of households own stocks in asset markets, the effect of changes in stock prices onconsumption is substantially lower than in the developed world. In addition, as asset prices becomemore volatile it becomes more difficult to differentiate between permanent and transitory components.There is another channel through which the new economy may affect real activity levels, and that isproductivity3. Several academic studies have examined the factors behind the spur in U.S. productivityduring the last decade, assigning particular attention to the new economy and the effects of thecomputer revolution. This issue is still under debate4.The fact is that the internet revolution has increased the speed of information transmission, makinginformation cheaper and more widely available. This acceleration is quickly changing the businessenvironment, leading to significant savings in the business-to-business supply chain. One of theimplications of this increase in the availability of information is a great improvement in inventorymanagement. The optimal level of inventories is becoming smaller, so that the real economy reactsfaster to demand and/or supply shocks, reducing both the length and the width of the cycle. Andshorter cycles make for a more effective monetary policy.                                                     1 Krugman, P. “Crisis: the price of globalization?” Paper presented at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, 2000.2 World Economic Outlook, May 2001, Chapter III: “Three Current Policy Issues: Impact of the Global Technology Correctionon the Real Economy”, page. 57-66.3 Brookings Institution (2001): “The Economic Payoff from the Internet”. www.brook.edu/es/research/areas/it/ipi-bisummary.htm.

2BIS Review 53/2001Optimal inventory management in an increasingly open international economy will not only implyshorter, but also, most probably, more synchronic cycles. A by-product of this development is anexpansion of the geographical limits of optimum currency areas à la Mundell.3.Terms of trade shocks and emerging economiesThe synchronization of the cycle increases volatility in commodity markets, an important source ofinternational transmission of the cycle to a good number of emerging economies. The synchronizationand shortening of cycles will probably also increase the volatility of international interest rates.Economies with liquidity constraints and limited access to international financial markets will suffer themost. The policy prescription here is to strengthen fundamentals and open and deepen the integrationof both product and capital markets with the rest of the world.The effect of synchronization and shortening of the cycle on international interest rates will probablyalso be an increase in the volatility of those rates. Coverage against interest rate volatility is anadditional argument in favor of integrating the emerging country economies with that of the world.4.Monetary policyAnother by-product of the new information technology is the blurring of the traditional definitions ofmoney. It is now clearly possibly for the non-banking private sector to create money substitutes ondemand. This development will tend to render inefficient the regulation of limited definitions of moneyas a tool to influence economic activity and prices. If this is so, interest rates will reign unchallenged asa monetary policy tool, while inflation targeting will be in the forefront as a nominal anchor for theeconomy. By the way, under these conditions it will become extremely difficult to differentiate betweenfinancial and non-financial firms.Until a greater synchronization of the cycle becomes evident, the need for an independent monetarypolicy will necessarily lead to floating exchange rates. As the cycle, or perhaps I should say if thecycle, becomes synchronized all over the world, the need for independent monetary policies may fadeaway. Gradually, the number of currencies in the world will decrease through time. This is noteconomic fiction: a tendency in this direction is already present among smaller countries in LatinAmerica with large trade and investment relationships with the United States.However, a world tendency to a significant decrease in the number of currencies is probably a verylong run one, where Keynes’ dictum on the long run comes to mind. In any case, I am convinced that,as Rogoff argues in a recent paper5, it may not be desirable to pursue currency consolidation all theway.Meanwhile, in the short and medium run, the increase in productivity provides more room for monetarypolicy to maneuver. Productivity growth alleviate inflationary pressures providing more room formonetary policy to exert its short run influence on the real economy.5.FlexibilityThe key word for an emerging economy in a changing world is flexibility: in exchange rates andinterest rates, to accommodate shocks without concentrating their effects in one particular market; infactor markets, both labor and capital, to minimize the cost of transition from one state of the economyto another.The task before us, in an emerging economy like Chile, is to increase flexibility in all markets. We havebeen working on that in recent years following a careful, gradual approach, to make sure that we put inplace the necessary prerequisites to introduce additional flexibility with minimum costs. An example ofthis approach is the way in which we moved first from limited exchange rate flexibility to a wider bandand then to a full, clean float, at a time of our own choosing, September 1999. This was done onlyafter the Central Bank had put in place hedging instruments in the market, had stimulated banks to dolikewise, and had established currency mismatch regulations in the financial sector. Also incentiveswere provided to the financial sector to take into consideration currency mismatches of their clientwhen evaluating their risks. The Central Bank has not intervened at all in the forex market since                                                     5 Rogoff, K “On Why not a global currency”, paper presented to the American Economic Association, January 5, 2001.
BIS Review 53/20013floating, and interest rate policy has not been based on an exchange rate target consideration butrather on the achievement of the inflation target. The volatility of the peso-dollar exchange rateincreased after floating, but it is the second most stable among floaters, after Canada6.A clean float, once settled, makes removing exchange restrictions easier and less risky, and theremaining restrictions in Chile were eliminated last April.We are convinced that flexibility is the key policy approach to face a rapidly changing world. However,flexibility can be made fully operational only on the basis of strong fundamentals. In fact, exchangerate flexibility implies taxing the capacity of the financial system to adapt, as well as that of privateenterprise to adjust. Moving towards exchange rate flexibility implies a structural change, as the costsof exchange rate risk coverage fall upon the private sector, rather than the Central Bank or thegovernment. To be successful, a change of this magnitude requires strong fundamentals.The role of fiscal policy must be emphasized in this context. Predictability of public sector reactions toshocks is a must for the appropriate functioning of all markets. Chile has recently moved to a fiscalpolicy guided by rules. The budget is planned in such a way that, under conditions of a long-term rateof growth of the economy and long-term prices for copper, a surplus of 1% of GDP is achieved. Thelevel of expenditures is maintained through the cycle while government reserve moves with it,generating larger surpluses during booms and smaller surpluses, or deficits, in a slowdown.Today, Chilean macroeconomic policy is defined by a monetary policy based on inflation targeting, thefree float of the Chilean peso and a fiscal policy guided by rules. We expect that this policy set-up,together with well-established strong institutions in all areas will help us ride the waves of a rapidlychanging world. A particularity of the Chilean macroeconomic policy is the fact that the Central Bankuses a real interest rate as its policy instrument, but this is a subject that require more time fordiscussion than is available today.Pending tasks: further flexibility in factor markets and further integration with the world economy.My conclusion: the new economy will eventually bring with it a new cycle, more synchronic all over theworld. Preparations for such an environment include additional flexibility in all markets.                                                     6  Implied Currency Volatilities.

BIS Review 53/20011Roger W Ferguson, Jr: Statement on renomination to the Board of Governorsof the Federal Reserve SystemTestimony of Mr Roger W Ferguson Jr, Vice-Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US FederalReserve System, before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, US Senate, 13 June2001.*      *      *Chairman Sarbanes, Senator Gramm, and members of the Committee, I am pleased to appear beforeyou today as President Bush's nominee to serve on the Board of Governors of the Federal ReserveSystem. I am honored that the President has nominated me to serve a full term as a member of theBoard.As a Governor, I am particularly mindful that the policy decisions of the Federal Reserve influence theeconomic well-being of all Americans. It has been my privilege to serve our fellow citizens in thiscapacity since 1997, giving this role my undivided attention, and I hope to be able to continue in thatservice.During my tenure we have faced a rapidly changing environment in many of our areas ofresponsibility, and I would like to review briefly some of those developments and our responses tothem.Congress has given the Federal Reserve three monetary policy objectives: maximum employment,stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates. We have viewed these objectives as congruentwith a goal of maximum sustainable growth, which can occur only in the context of long-run pricestability. Fostering financial conditions in which Americans can realize the full productive potential ofour economy has presented a number of challenges in recent years. The most importantdevelopments have been a step-up in the advance of technology – both in terms of the production ofnew goods and the more effective harnessing of past innovations – and a rapid accumulation ofphysical capital. These developments have made workers increasingly more productive. But fasterproductivity growth fed back on the demand for goods and services in ways that complicated thecalibration of monetary policy. Faster growth in productivity and the reactions of businesses andhouseholds to this acceleration of productivity have combined with other forces-particularly thoseassociated with the growing interconnectedness of the global economy- to require substantialadjustments in the Federal Reserve's policy interest rate in recent years. But those adjustments in ourpolicy instrument have been in the service of our objective of promoting maximum sustainable growth.Making monetary policy has been only part of the challenge. During my tenure at the Federal Reservewe have also worked diligently to communicate to the public what we are doing with policy and why.Transparency in policy making is a key part of the democratic process, as well as being helpful infostering efficient decision making in the private sector. Becoming more transparent has been a goalof the central bank in recent years, keeping in mind that we must balance the need to be open andaccountable with the need to maintain an effective process of decision making by the Federal OpenMarket Committee. Transparency requires that we periodically review our procedures, as we did in1999, to ensure that they appropriately balance these considerations. I do not know what futurechanges, if any, might be called for in how we communicate, but I am confident that the FederalReserve will continue to look for ways to communicate clearly our policies and our supportingrationales.While macroeconomic conditions are of overriding importance, the role of the Federal Reserve isbroader than monetary policy. Financial stability is an essential precondition for maintaining a strongeconomy, and the Federal Reserve has important supervisory and regulatory responsibilities for ournation's banking system. The Federal Reserve, and other regulators, must continue to foster acompetitive environment that will benefit the users of financial services, while also promoting safetyand soundness. I believe that we must achieve these goals with a minimum of regulatory burden andwithout leaving the impression that any institution is too big to fail. To minimize regulatory burden andachieve our other objectives, we should encourage what to my mind are the best regulators, namelymarket discipline and management accountability. Of late, our challenge has been to meet these goalsas we implement the financial modernization law. In my opinion, Congress wisely removed severalantiquated barriers to a modern financial structure in the United States, and now we need to design
2BIS Review 53/2001regulatory and supervisory policies that reflect the will of Congress and deal effectively with achanging financial services industry.Technology and deregulation, forces for change that I have just mentioned, have encouragedconsolidation in the financial sector. With central bank and treasury officials from twelve other majorindustrial economies, I have reviewed the likely effect of the global trend toward consolidation and itsimplication for central banks and regulators. Because financial systems will continue to consolidate, asthe forces that motivate that evolution are unabated, the regulatory community needs to monitordevelopments closely. But our study also found that existing policies appear adequate to allowregulators to maintain safe and sound financial industries now and in the intermediate term and formonetary policy to work through many of the same mechanisms as in the past.More than the structure of the financial services industry has changed of late. That sector has founduses for consumer information and created an array of financial products and services unimaginedeven a few years ago. These developments, in turn, raise some new concerns, and have re-ignitedsome existing ones, among consumers and legislators. Congress grappled with one of these issues,privacy, in the financial modernization law. Concerns about abusive lending practices have alsore-emerged of late. In all areas, but particularly in areas as sensitive as these, regulators shouldfaithfully administer consumer protection laws as written. Any necessary regulations shouldadequately inform consumers and protect them against abusive practices while also not discouraginglegitimate extensions of credit, especially to those who might previously have been denied access tosuch credit. Financial literacy will certainly play an important role in avoiding the growth of abusive ordeceptive financial practices and in allowing consumers to protect their interests. I believe thatlegislation, careful regulation and education are all components of the response to these emergingconsumer concerns. I also hope, however, that businesses recognize that it is in their long-terminterest to maintain the confidence of consumers by avoiding deceptive and abusive practices and byrespecting the privacy of their customers.Finally, our payment system affects every consumer and business. This system too has been, and willcontinue to be, changed greatly by emerging technologies. From the time of its very founding, theFederal Reserve has had the responsibility to foster an efficient, safe and accessible payment system.During much of 1998 and 1999, our primary objective in this regard was to help banks and otherparticipants in the payment system maintain smooth operations as the century date change passed.Domestically, we achieved this goal by working directly with the banking sector. Internationally, I wasprivileged to work through multilateral groups to raise the awareness of the international regulatorycommunity of the nature of the Y2K challenge. Now, we can take a longer-term perspective andconsider how we might facilitate innovation in the payment system.As an overseer and regulator, the Federal Reserve needs to approach payment system innovationswith an open mind and a willingness to adapt. In a dynamic economy, markets need to play a key rolein guiding the development of infrastructure. This means that innovation and competition will becentral to the future development of the payment system – as they are in other areas of the economy.Regulators should strive to remove barriers to innovations when we can do so without sacrificingimportant public policies. We should take every opportunity to foster competition and maintain theintegrity of the payment system, but public policy should not be built on a single vision or prediction ofthe future. Ultimately, consumers and businesses as well as service providers will determine the rangeof payment services that best meet their needs.Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, during my years on the Board of Governors, I havedone my best to contribute positively to all aspects of the Federal Reserve's many responsibilities. Ilook forward to the opportunity to continue to work with you and serve the nation as a member of theBoard of Governors. Thank you for your attention and for considering my nomination. I would bepleased to respond to questions.
BIS Review51/20011Svein Gjedrem: Monetary policy, forecasts and market communicationSpeech by Mr Svein Gjedrem, Governor of the Norges Bank, at the Norwegian School ofManagement’s Centre for Monetary Economics, Norsk Hydro, Lysaker, 7 June 2001.*      *      *The long-term objective of monetary policy is to contribute to low and stable inflation. Price stability isthe best contribution monetary policy can make to economic growth and prosperity. A nominal anchoris also a necessary precondition for stable financial markets and property markets. We cannot achievehigher employment in the long run by accepting higher inflation. On the contrary, the experience of ourcountry and that of others in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s is that periods of high inflation are followedby downturns with high unemployment. High and variable inflation also leads to an arbitraryredistribution of wealth and income.This spring, the Government assigned a new operational mandate for monetary policy to NorgesBank. Norges Bank shall set the key rate with a view to maintaining low and stable inflation. Theinflation target is set at 2½ per cent. I will use this occasion to elaborate on our interpretation of themandate and to discuss how it will affect the conduct of monetary policy.The inflation outlook is presented three times a year in Norges Bank’s Inflation Reports, and forms abasis for the Bank’s interest rate decisions. Further assessments are presented every six weeks inconnection with the Executive Board's monetary policy meetings.Mandate, interpretation and implementationNew Zealand was the first country to introduce an inflation target in 1989.1 Chile followed in 1990,Canada in 1991, the UK in 1992, Sweden, Finland and Australia in 1993 (Finland until 1998), Spain in1994 (until 1998) and Iceland and Norway in 2001. A number of emerging market economies like theCzech Republic and Poland, as well as Israel, South Africa and Brazil, have introduced inflationtargets in the last few years.2 The ECB shall direct its monetary policy instruments towards pricestability, which the bank has defined as inflation of less than 2 per cent. The target of the Swiss centralbank has a similar formulation. In the US, price and employment stability are equally important.Experience with inflation targets has generally been good. Low and stable inflation has underpinnedeconomic growth and employment. The fact that conditions were favourable for low inflation andrenewed growth in many countries following the downturn and high unemployment in the early 1990smay also have contributed positively.Norway introduced an inflation target during a different phase of the economic cycle. We haveexperienced a prolonged upturn. The labour market is tight. High labour force participation anddemographic conditions indicate that the possibility for further growth in the labour supply is limited. Inaddition, reforms that reduce the supply of labour were implemented. At the same time, because ofour large petroleum revenues, the Norwegian authorities do not face the same budget constraints ontheir fiscal policy as other countries faced when they introduced inflation targets. Several of the OECDcountries have substantial budget surpluses now, however. Finland expects a budget surplus of 5.3per cent of GDP this year.3 New Zealand and Ireland have introduced fund schemes where they investtheir budget surpluses in anticipation of higher pension disbursements later in this century.The new Regulation on Monetary Policy was adopted on 29 March 2001.Section 1: Monetary policy shall be aimed at stability in the Norwegian krone’s national andinternational value, contributing to stable expectations concerning exchange rate developments.At the same time, monetary policy shall underpin fiscal policy by contributing to stabledevelopments in output and employment. Norges Bank is responsible for the implementation ofmonetary policy. Norges Bank's implementation of monetary policy shall, in accordance with the                                                     1 From 1931-1933 Sweden had a regime defined as "and with all existing means to preserve the domestic purchasing powerof the Swedish krona" (my translation). This must be interpreted as an inflation target.2 A. Schaechter, M. R. Stone og M. Zelmer: "Adopting Inflastion Targeting: Practical Issues for Emerging Market Countries".IMF Occasional Paper 202. Washington 2000.3 OECD Economic Outlook no. 69 - table "General government financial balances"
2BIS Review 51/2001first paragraph, be oriented towards low and stable inflation. The operational target of monetarypolicy shall be annual consumer price inflation of approximately 2½ per cent over time. Ingeneral, the direct effects on consumer prices resulting from changes in interest rates, taxes,excise duties and extraordinary temporary disturbances shall not be taken into account.Storting Report no. 29 of 2001, "Guidelines for economic policy" states:"Consumer price inflation is expected to remain within an interval of +/-1 percentage pointaround the target."The inflation target of 2½ per cent over time is slightly higher than the targets in Sweden, Canada andthe euro area, but corresponds to targets in the United Kingdom and Australia. In the US, consumerprice inflation has been somewhat higher the last ten years. The target is approximately in line with theaverage inflation rate in Norway in the 1990s.In our view, with its change in monetary policy, the Government has recognised low inflation as abenefit in itself. History has shown that high inflation does not result in either sustained economicgrowth or lower unemployment rates. A track record of low inflation since 1990 has provided NorgesBank with a good basis for implementing monetary policy even though, as I mentioned, the inflationtarget was introduced during an upturn.Higher interest rates curb demand for goods and services and reduce inflation. Lower interest rateshave the opposite effect. If evidence suggests that inflation will be higher than 2½ per cent withunchanged interest rates, the interest rate will be increased. If it appears that inflation will be lowerthan 2½ per cent with unchanged interest rates, the interest rate will be reduced. There is symmetryhere. It is equally important to avoid an inflation rate that is too low, or deflation, as it is to avoid aninflation rate that is too high. When the annual use of petroleum revenues is managed according to along-term action plan, a policy for which there is currently fairly general political consensus, we shouldnormally be able to use the interest rate as a policy instrument to prevent high inflation. Normally,monetary policy should also be a fairly effective means of countering a deflationary recession.Stagflation, ie stagnating output and rising unemployment combined with rapid inflation, whichcharacterised economic developments in many countries in the 1970s and 1980s, originates in thesupply and output side of the economy or in income determination. If the Norwegian economy shouldever be threatened by stagflation tendencies, monetary policy must be directed towards maintaininglow and stable inflation. At the same time, structural policy and incomes policy should contribute toimproving the functioning of the economy, allowing economic growth and employment to pick up.A change in interest rates is not expected to have an immediate effect on inflation. Our analysesindicate that a substantial share of the effects of an interest rate change occurs within two years. Twoyears is thus a reasonable time horizon for achieving the inflation target of 2½ per cent. Therefore, theinflation outlook in two years may be viewed as a derived objective in monetary policy.In some situations, where unexpected events lead to an inflation rate that is too high, it may beappropriate to apply a longer time horizon than two years. For example, reducing inflation to 2½ percent within this time horizon may be associated with unnecessary real economic costs. A preconditionfor applying a longer time horizon is that there is clear evidence of strong confidence in low and stableinflation over time on the part of economic agents. Gradually, as we gain experience with settinginterest rates according to an inflation target, the possibilities for placing emphasis on stability in thereal economy will probably increase.Low and stable inflation is a necessary precondition for stability in the foreign exchange and financialmarket and the property market. However, there have also been episodes where bubbles haveaccumulated in these markets, in the form of sharp increases in asset prices, while inflation has beenlow. Price increases in property and financial markets may have a considerable impact on wagegrowth and consumer price inflation after a period. When the bubbles burst, the result may be aneconomic downturn. In this way, developments in financial and property markets may be a source of amore unstable inflation environment. In principle, it would be appropriate to use the interest rate tocounter this. In practice, however, it is difficult to assess whether price trends in property and financialmarkets are sustainable.When Norges Bank concludes that the key rate should be changed, the change will in most cases bemade gradually. This is because there is normally uncertainty about the situation in the economy,potential disturbances to the economy and how fast an interest rate change will affect price inflation.But we will not always take a gradualist approach. A rapid and pronounced change in the interest rateis appropriate if, for example, heightening turbulence in financial markets or a cost-push shock
BIS Review51/20013resulting from negotiations indicates that confidence in monetary policy is in jeopardy. And shouldthere be prospects of a deflationary recession, it would be appropriate to apply our instruments morefirmly.If special circumstances prompt Norges Bank to apply a different time horizon than two years, theBank will provide an assessment of this. The same applies if special emphasis is placed ondevelopments in financial markets or property markets.In the long run, inflation is determined by developments in domestic costs, productivity growth andimported inflation. A special feature of wage formation in Norway has been that conditions for exposedindustries have received considerable emphasis in the wage negotiations, including the negotiationsfor industries that do not face international competition. During the last few years, the sheltered sectorhas had greater influence on overall wage developments.The centralised income settlements in Norway have been an arena of coordination, wheremacroeconomic considerations have at times received considerable emphasis. This has contributed tomaintaining low unemployment. But we have also experienced that the income settlements may be asource of economic disturbances. The income settlements in the mid-1970s and 1986 had thestrongest negative impact. The settlements in 1998 and 2000 also fuelled high cost inflation.Retrospective evaluation of monetary policyToday's inflation rate is partly the result of the interest rate that was set one to two years ago.Therefore, today’s consumer price index figures provide a basis for assessing the results of themonetary policy conducted some years ago.Monthly figures for the consumer price index are influenced by random or temporary factors that havelittle impact on developments in inflation over time. Electricity prices are affected by precipitationlevels. Changes in indirect taxes have an immediate impact on the consumer price index. The directeffects of these factors on inflation will be non-existent after a year. Hence, they will not have anysignificance for the interest rate, which is normally set with a view to maintaining inflation at 2½ percent two years ahead.However, it is still interesting to adjust monthly inflation figures for temporary effects to determinewhether developments are broadly in line with our projections. Norges Bank analyses and presentsfigures for consumer price inflation where the effects of some temporary factors are excluded. In April,the year-on-year rise in the consumer price index was 3.8 per cent. Figures were affected by sharpincreases in both electricity and petrol prices and by higher indirect taxes. Excluding electricity andpetrol prices and adjusting for changes in indirect taxes, price inflation was approximately 2½ per cent,which is in line with the current inflation target.It should be pointed out, however, that our adjustment of the figures may overestimate these effects.We assume, for example, that increases in indirect taxes are passed on in their entirety to theconsumer. In practice, changes in indirect taxes are often shared by manufacturers and consumersbased on the intensity of the supply-and-demand reaction to price increases. In addition, increases inelectricity prices are not only the result of last year’s low precipitation levels in Western Norway and
4BIS Review 51/2001higher electricity taxes. Other, more permanent conditions may also have contributed. The increase inpetrol prices leads to higher prices on other goods such as transport services and we have notadjusted for this. However, adjusting inflation figures for direct effects of one-off factors can also beassociated with pitfalls. Higher indirect taxes and an increase in petrol and electricity prices may be asource of accelerating inflation, via spillover effects on other prices and wages.Other countries with inflation targets adjust the consumer price index for temporary and randomfactors in a variety of ways. In the UK, changes in interest rates have a strong, direct impact on theconsumer price index. The Bank of England aims at an inflation target that is adjusted for such effects.In New Zealand, the inflation target is formulated as growth in the consumer price index, but themandate specifies factors for which adjustments may be made. These factors include price changesdue to substantial changes in commodity prices, changes in indirect taxes, considerable changes ineconomic policy which directly impact prices, as well as natural disasters. There are no continuous,fixed indicators that make adjustments for these factors, but adjustments are made if the effects aresubstantial.In Sweden and Canada, the inflation target is formulated as growth in the consumer price indexwithout special exclusions. However, in practice, indices for underlying inflation are used in theimplementation and assessment of monetary policy. Sweden’s Riksbank often refers to an indicatorthat adjusts for the direct effects of interest rates and net indirect taxes. The Bank of Canada has nowdefined a new indicator as the operational target of monetary policy. This indicator is the consumerprice index excluding the eight most volatile components: fruit, vegetables, petrol, heating oil, naturalgas, domestic air travel, tobacco products and interest rate costs. Adjustments are also made for theeffect of indirect taxes.The consumer price index is compiled to show developments in the cost of living. To some degree, theconsumer price index overestimates developments in the cost of living. This is partly related to the factthat the measurement method does not adequately capture quality changes in the service industry.The Boskin Report (1996) discovered that the US CPI overestimated the actual cost of living increaseby 0.8-1.6 percentage points annually. Statistics Norway has assessed the measurement error in theNorwegian consumer price index.4 The conclusion is that the Norwegian index also overestimatesdevelopments in the cost of living but that the deviation is probably well below one percentage pointannually.National consumer price indices are constructed in various ways. For example, there are differences inthe goods and services included, the relative weights assigned to the goods and services included andthe frequency with which the weights are adjusted. In addition, the method of weighting the varioussub-indices – ie whether the arithmetic or geometric average is used – may also affect the growth rate.Eurostat’s Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) represents a standard that facilitates thecomparison of countries.                                                     4 B. Koth and L. Sandberg: "Kilder til målefeil i konsumprisindeksen" (Sources of measurement errors in the consumer priceindex) Økonomiske analyser 5/97. Statistics Norway Oslo 1997
BIS Review51/20015The national index in the UK is calculated by using arithmetic averages, whereas geometric averagesare used in the harmonised index. Several items in the national index are not included in theharmonised index, for example costs related to housing (house depreciation, council tax and buildinginsurance). In contrast, air fares, university accommodation fees, foreign students’ university tuitionfees and payments by residents of nursing and retirement homes are excluded from the national indexbut included in the harmonised index. Year-on-year growth figures in April showed a difference ofnearly one percentage point between the Bank of England’s index (RIPX) and the HICP. This indextied to the inflation target showed 2 per cent growth in the last 12 months, whereas the harmonisedindex showed an increase of 1.1 percentage point. Different treatment of housing costs pushed thenational index up by more than ½ percentage point compared with the harmonised index. Differentweighting methods accounted for a similar proportion of the increase. Different weights reducedgrowth in the national index by nearly ¼ percentage point compared with the harmonised index.5Predictability, transparency and communicationCentral banks control the volume of central bank liquidity or the interest rate on this liquidity. Mostcentral banks use the interest rate on intra-day liquidity. In Norway, this is the interest rate on banks’sight deposits with Norges Bank, the sight deposit rate. Banks’ net position vis-a-vis Norges Bankfluctuates around zero. By comparison, household and private sector domestic gross debt amounts toroughly NOK 1500 billion, whereas the total money supply is approximately NOK 750 billion. Our keyrate has a direct influence on a very small portion of the total money and credit market. Monetarypolicy would not affect price inflation if our key rate only influenced the interest rate on the amountoutstanding between the central bank and the banks. We are dependent on a spillover effect oninterest rates on debt in the household and enterprise sectors.The link between these variables and the key rate runs through market expectations and the yieldcurve. Long-term interest rates that are determined by the market reflect expected future short-termrates, uncertainty and risk premiums. Interest rates on money market investments with maturities ofmore than one day will be influenced by expectations about changes in Norges Bank’s rates in thefuture. Interest on investments that mature in one week will be a weighted average of expectedinterest on one-day investments in the days up to maturity. Similarly, three-month rates reflect bothprevailing and expected future overnight rates. If economic agents believe that Norges Bank willreduce interest rates in the next few weeks, three-month-rates will be lower than interest on krone-denominated assets with shorter maturities. Similarly, if economic agents believe that Norges Bank willraise interest rates in the next few weeks, three-month-rates will be higher than rates on krone-denominated assets with shorter maturities.If there is confidence in monetary policy, changes in Norges Bank’s rates will have little effect on long-term interest rates. These rates will then primarily be determined by the demand for real return oncapital that originates in the international capital market. If confidence in economic policy deteriorates,for example because Norges Bank sets interest rates so low that inflation and unstable exchangerates are expected, long-term interest rates will rise. The cost of low confidence is thus high risk                                                     5 http://www.statistics.gov.uk/pdfdir/cpi0501.pdf
6BIS Review 51/2001premiums and unnecessarily high long-term interest rates.Transparency in our intentions, strategies and implementation of monetary policy may contribute toreducing uncertainty among economic agents. If monetary policy is predictable, an important source ofrisk is diminished. Thus, all else being equal, the interest rate that is necessary to achieve the inflationtarget will be lower. There will then be a better chance of achieving the inflation target without frequentand abrupt changes in the key rate. Predictability may contribute to ensuring more stabledevelopments in demand and output.Thus, a predictable monetary policy may contribute to improving the efficiency and impact of monetarypolicy. Predictability and transparency are often equated. However, increased transparency does notnecessarily imply a higher degree of predictability. Many cite the Bank of England as a verytransparent central bank, because it presents its assessments of the economic outlook in its inflationreports and publishes the minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meetings. A report6 prepared byDr. Sushil Wadhwani, a member of the MPC, indicates, however, that the Bank of England’s interestrate changes in the period 3 June 1997 –18 April 2001 have come as more of a surprise to marketparticipants than interest rate changes in continental Europe and the US during the same period. Thesame study indicates that the element of surprise has waned over time.In Norway, it appears that transparency in Norges Bank’s interpretation of the mandate and in theimplementation of monetary policy has contributed to making monetary policy somewhat morepredictable. The chart shows that Norges Bank’s changes in the key rate have less impact on moneymarket rates now than earlier.The academic literature on transparency and monetary policy is voluminous and growing. "How DoCentral Banks Talk?"7, a report prepared by a number of well-known academics and presentedrecently at the Center for Economic Policy Research, specifies the objectives that central banksshould bear in mind when developing their strategy on transparency. The report says the following:"Transparency should allow the public to understand, and possibly anticipate, the central bank’sdecisions, to see each of them as the logical conclusion of a chain of past and future decisions aimedat a clear set of targets,…")This view of transparency and predictability contrasts sharply with the earlier practice of playing on theelement of surprise. In monetary policy, this was associated especially with control of the exchangerate. Gradually, the economic policy met distrust and high premiums for uncertainty. The effects ofchanges in monetary policy instruments became increasingly uncertain. Nevertheless, a desire forpredictability must not precede the demand for an interest rate setting that the central bank deems tobe correct. The expectations of other economic agents must not control the setting of interest rates.There are a number of examples from countries with "transparent" monetary policies where interestrate changes have come as a surprise. This may be partly due to the fact that the central bank had a                                                     6 Wadhwani, S.B: "Some Reflections on the MPC".

In the Inflation Report 4/2000, we presentedour view of how interest rates affect price inflation in Norway.In principle, the more discretion and flexibility the monetary policy objective implies, the more complexand subtle communication must be. Monetary policy requires the continuous exercise of discretion.The exercise of this discretion is limited, however, by Norges Bank's mandate and our interpretation ofit. Furthermore, we have contributed to restricting the exercise of discretion by being transparent in ourresponse pattern, our analyses of economic developments and our assessment of the results of themonetary policy that has been conducted.Central bank communication varies from one country to another. The various solutions reflect differentobjectives and institutional parameters as well as different histories and cultures. Therefore, in myview, we should be cautious about recommending a specific country’s choices and solutions as anorm.The Reserve Bank of New Zealand is required by law to submit a Monetary Policy Statement at leasttwice a year, and these reports are published quarterly in the form of inflation reports. The reportsinclude an account of an interest rate path that will contribute to keeping inflation consistent with thetarget. The official Cash Rate, New Zealand’s key interest rate, is reviewed once between reports, at apre-announced time. Decisions regarding the Cash Rate are published immediately, accompanied bya commentary. The Reserve Bank Governor is responsible for achieving the target, and for makingdecisions.
8BIS Review 51/2001In the Bank of England, interest rate decisions are made by the Monetary Policy Committee, whichhas nine members. Four of the members are external economists appointed by the Chancellor of theExchequer. In practice, they work full time for the central bank, but they are not part of linemanagement. The Bank of England presents an inflation report four times a year. The report isprepared by the Bank’s administration, but the work is directed by the Committee. The report providesprojections of economic growth and inflation. The Bank of England has developed a method thatillustrates the Committee’s subjective view of the uncertainty associated with forecasts for GDP growthand inflation. Uncertainty increases with the time horizon, so that the illustration of uncertainty takesthe form of a fan. This fan has gradually acquired a central role. The introduction to the report states:"Although not every member will agree with every assumption on which our projections are based, thefan charts represent the MPC’s best collective judgement about the most likely paths for inflation andoutput and the uncertainties surrounding those central projections." The Bank’s view of the outlook forthe interest rate is not stated directly, but is implicit in the discussion of the fan around the inflationprojection and an associated table. Twelve monetary policy meetings are held each year. Decisionstaken are made public immediately, but without an explanation, and meetings are not followed bypress conferences. Two weeks after each meeting, the Bank publishes minutes, which make it clearwhether there was a lack of consensus in the Committee. Publication of the minutes is required bylaw. An account of the implementation of monetary policy is provided in the Annual Report. Allcommittee members are free to express their personal views on economic issues and monetary policy.In Sweden, too, interest rate decisions are made by a board of experts – the Executive Board. Themembers work full time, and participate in the daily operations of the central bank. An inflation reportexpressing the Executive Board’s collective view of the inflation outlook is published four times a year.As in the UK, special emphasis is placed on the individual responsibility of the Executive Boardmembers. The individual members’ voting and assessments are disclosed. Any lack of consensusregarding the inflation outlook and setting of interest rates emerges from the minutes that arepublished from two to four weeks after each monetary policy meeting. Grounds are given for decisionson interest rates, but no press conference is held immediately after monetary policy meetings. TheExecutive Board does not directly announce its stance regarding interest rate movements in the periodahead, but this is implicit from the uncertainty associated with the projection, which Sweden’sRiksbank also illustrates by means of a fan surrounding the inflation projection. The Executive Boardreports twice a year to the Swedish parliament, the Riksdagen. Sweden’s Riksbank has chosen to usetwo of its four quarterly inflation reports for this purpose. Members of the Executive Board give lecturesand express their personal views on economic questions and monetary policy.In its December 2000 Bulletin, the ECB presented for the first time price inflation projections in theform of a broad range. Bank staff prepare the projections. In the ECB’s two-pillar system,developments in the first pillar, the money supply (M3), and the second pillar, which comprises otherfactors that may influence price inflation, are equally important. According to the Maastricht Treaty, theGoverning Council shall meet at least ten times a year. Since the implementation of a single monetary
BIS Review51/20019policy in January 1999, monetary policy meetings have been held fortnightly. Press conferences areheld after every second meeting, but no explicit expression is given of the Bank’s stance regardinginterest rate movements in the future and the minutes of monetary policy meetings are not published.Members of the Governing Council make individual statements about monetary policy, but the actualinterest rate decision is presented as a collective one.In the US, the Federal Open Market Committee determines the interest rate. The Committee holdseight pre-announced meetings a year, but has also occasionally changed the interest rate betweenmeetings. Decisions are announced after interest rate meetings. The future policy bias is expressedimplicitly through the discussion of the balance of risks with respect to the economic outlook. In aseparate press release, the committee explains how the formulations may be interpreted. The FederalReserve does not publish a traditional inflation report like the Bank of England’s with projections offuture developments. However, in connection with the Chairman’s semi-annual testimony to Congress,estimates are given of probable ranges for GDP growth, consumer price inflation and unemployment.The minutes of Committee meetings are published after six weeks, and disclose the way individualmembers have voted. A complete transcript of proceedings is released after five years. Membersexpress individual views on monetary policy.Norges Bank analyses the inflation outlook in separate inflation reports which are published threetimes a year. Further assessments regarding the inflation outlook are presented every six weeks inconnection with the monetary policy meetings at which the Executive Board sets interest rates. Centralaspects of the modelling tools and our view of the functioning of the economy are examined in detail inthe Inflation Report and in articles in the journal Penger og Kreditt and its English counterpartEconomic Bulletin. The minutes of monetary policy meetings are not published. The Executive Boardfunctions as a unified group in relation to the public.In Canada and New Zealand, responsibility lies with the central bank governor, and therefore only oneview is expressed. In the ECB, Australia, Switzerland and Norway, the decision-making body speaksto the public with one voice. Like Norway, Australia includes external members in the body that makesdecisions regarding the interest rate.Forecasts as communicationSection 2 of the Monetary Policy Regulation states: "Norges Bank shall regularly publish theassessments that form the basis for the implementation of monetary policy." The projections andanalyses in the Inflation Report, together with continuous assessment of the outlook for price and costinflation and conditions in money and foreign exchange markets, provide a basis for interest ratedecisions.The Inflation Report contains analyses and projections for a number of macroeconomic variables. Thishas been the practice since the first report was published in December 1994. Most other central banksrestrict themselves to forecasting price inflation and the output trend. Some also provide estimates ofthe main components of demand and of the labour market. Different practices reflect different historiesand cultures. Some central banks place emphasis on the uncertainty of economic estimates, pointingout that this may make them more misleading than instructive. Institutional framework conditions alsoinfluence the forecasts at a detailed level. In countries where a decision-making body presentsforecasts, each member may have his/her own individual forecast for both developments in the realeconomy and inflation. At the same time, the body must present a single estimate for priceinflation - and developments in the real economy - based on the members’ best collective evaluation.Such is the case with the Bank of England. If the members have very different views regardingeconomic developments, projections for economic variables will lose much of their informationalcontent. Under framework conditions of this nature, it will not be very fruitful to provide detailedestimates of the various demand components in the economy. In some cases, the inflation projectionitself may lose some of its informational value. In the UK, there is at times greater interest for theuncertainty surrounding the projection, illustrated by the fan charts, and in the minutes of the monetarypolicy meetings, than in the inflation report and the actual inflation projection.Detailed projections may increase the possibility of checking the consistency of projections over time.They also provide a basis for evaluating whether short-term indicators are in line with thedevelopments expected by the central bank. On the other hand, very detailed projections may suggestthat the central bank is more certain about developments than there is actually reason to be. Norway
10BIS Review 51/2001has a long tradition of making detailed forecasts. Economic agents know from experience that pointforecasts are very uncertain and presumably regard them with a healthy scepticism.The analysis and projections in the Inflation Report are conditional on a number of economic variablessuch as fiscal policy, exchange rates and the interest rate. A different trend in these variables couldalso result in a different course for both the real economy and nominal developments. Theassumptions on which the inflation forecast is based must be reasonable and fairly realistic if theforecasts are to function as a basis for decision-making.The central bank directly influences the sight deposit rate, and thus faces an important questionalready at the stage of making projections: what interest rate scenario should provide the basis forinflation projections? Practice varies. Generally, more than one interest rate scenario may result in thesame inflation projection. The Central Bank of New Zealand is the only central bank that presents itsassessment of the optimal interest rate path and uses this as the basis for its inflation projections. Thecentral banks of other countries base their projections on a stylised assumption about the interest rate.Thus, these interest rate scenarios are not necessarily consistent with the interest rate trendenvisaged by the central bank. The Bank of England and Sweden’s Riksbank base their estimates inthe baseline scenario on the assumption that interest rates remain unchanged. Alternative projectionsbased on market expectations regarding future interest rates are also shown.A number of academics8 have argued for making the optimal interest rate scenario the basis forinflation projections. Their argument is as follows: If the central bank itself does not regard anunchanged interest rate during the forecast period as the most probable scenario, the price inflationprojection will not be the most probable one either. Thus, the projection does not provide guidance asto what inflation the central bank actually expects.                                                     8 See e.g. Alesina, A., O. Blanchard, J. Garli, F. Giavazzi and H. Uhlig: "Defining a macroeconomic Framework for the EuroArea. Monitoring the European Central Bank 3 ". CEPR London 2001 and Lars E. O. Svensson: Independent Review of theOperation of Monetary Policy in New Zealand: Report to the Minister of Finance. February 2001.
BIS Review51/200111In Norges Bank, we have used both an unchanged interest rate and an interest rate scenario basedon market expectations in our inflation reports. If Norges Bank projects price inflation as higher orlower than 2½ per cent, it is an indication that the Bank envisages an interest rate path that is higheror lower than the path on which the projection is based.There is uncertainty associated with all forecasts. This very uncertainty and the central bank’sassessment of the various risk factors constitute important supplementary information. In our InflationReports, the uncertainty associated with the projections is discussed explicitly. An account is given ofwhich variables Norges Bank regards as particularly uncertain, which way this uncertainty points, andhow a different scenario could influence price projections. In addition, a fan chart illustrating theuncertainty of the projections is presented.Calculations based on alternative assumptions are presented regularly. This illustrates the isolatedeffect on price inflation of changes in assumptions. It provides insight into the effect on price inflationof potential disturbances to the economy.We base our analyses and assessments of the inflation outlook and balance of risks on models. TheRIMINI macroeconomic model, developed in Norges Bank’s Research Department, has been animportant tool for the Bank’s analyses since 1994. The model seeks to take account of many of theimportant relationships in the Norwegian economy. The model combines and takes account ofempirical and theoretical knowledge of these relationships as they have functioned in the past, andcontributes to a more consistent analysis of the interaction between them. It takes time for structuralchanges to be captured in the model. It may therefore be useful to analyse the effects of any structuralchanges in previously existing relationships. For example, it may be useful to ask whether the effectson consumer prices of changes in the exchange rate are different now that the exchange ratefluctuates more than it did in the past.In our experience it is not possible to make forecasts that prove to be accurate in all respects. Byrevealing errors, we provide a basis for improving the analysis. Our projections are thereforeevaluated regularly. Analyses of forecast errors have been presented four times in the journalEconomic Bulletin. Excerpts from these evaluation articles are also presented in the Inflation Reportonce a year.Concluding remarksIn all countries with which it is natural to compare Norway, the setting of interest rates, the mostimportant monetary policy instrument, is delegated to the central bank. A number of factors help toexplain why the exercise of this authority is delegated.
12BIS Review 51/2001First, monetary policy can well be delegated, because over time there is no real conflict between theobjectives of price stability, on the one hand, and economic growth and equitable distribution, on theother. The formulation of objectives and subsequent evaluation of practice make adequate provisionfor the more short-term considerations.Second, it is possible to formulate fairly precise objectives for monetary policy and establish reportingroutines that ensure that those who delegate authority can subsequently evaluate the implementation.Norges Bank provides an account of its actions in the Bank’s Annual Report, and the evaluation of theMinistry of Finance, the Government and the Storting appears in and is based on annual reports to theStorting.Finally, the need for transparency and communication argue in favour of delegation. As previouslymentioned, each monetary policy decision must be consistent with previous and future decisions, andbe directed towards a clearly defined target.Thank you for your attention.
BIS Review51/20011Lars Heikensten: Reforming a central bankSpeech by Mr Lars Heikensten, First Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, to the CEPR/SNSRoundtable, Stockholm, 8 June 2001.*      *      *Thank you for inviting me this evening and for the opportunity of addressing you all. I should like tobegin by stressing how much we value the cooperation with CEPR. Creating arenas for an exchangeof ideas in Europe is an important task to which CEPR is making a valuable contribution.Today you have been considering a variety of issues and this evening I want to raise yet another,namely how a central bank can be reformed. I do so against the background of the major changes thatare currently taking place in our national economies and financial markets. These changes clearlyhave consequences for the work at central banks. The challenges we in Europe face are particularlygreat, above all now that EMU is a reality and the single currency imposes new requirements.Work on changes at the Riksbank has been very intensive in recent years and I should like to tell yousomething about it. What I have to say will no doubt be familiar to many of you in managerial positionsin either the private or the public domain. The operations of central banks are really not all thatdifferent from those of other enterprises.Issues recur but methods have changed a lotSveriges Riksbank is the world's oldest central bank. Threadneedle Street's Old Lady is our youngersister.When I last addressed a similar assembly I mentioned that we take great pride in our Bank's history. Inoted that we are answerable to the Swedish Parliament, which took charge of our operations for fearthat otherwise the king would be too profligate. He was in fact spending too much by waging war onthe Continent. So besides being a time-honoured institution, the Riksbank is an early example ofindependence.My account was immediately challenged, however. Perhaps my English opponent was piqued by theRiksbank's seniority; in any event, according to him we were not taken over by Parliament andnationalised in order to gain control over the monarch. It was a question instead of the nobles inparliament redeeming their pledges and getting the Treasury to carry the future losses they wereotherwise likely to incur.So there's truly no new thing under the sun. Many of our problems recur, though today we solve themdifferently, with other methods.Studies show that in recent decades the work of reforming central banks has tended to follow a clearpattern. A report from BIS, the central bank of the central banks, notes the following characteristics.(cid:1) The move to greater independence and the commitment to price stability entail a desire tofocus on core operations and a deeper analysis. There is also a greater need to operate andcommunicate in ways that are effective and enhance confidence.(cid:1) Internationalisation also has effects, not least financial integration. For Sweden there is alsomembership of the European Union and possibly of EMU.(cid:1) Analytical requirements are heightened in general. Matters are becoming increasinglycomplex. Another factor here is the new technologies with electronic payment systems, forexample.(cid:1) In our case there is also the crisis in the early 1990s and the lessons we have tried to learnfrom it.I shall now say something about the work we have done in recent years in three respects:Concentrating on cores activities; Strength and security; and Management with an executive board.
2BIS Review 51/2001Concentrating on core activitiesA good performance presupposes that we concentrate our resources to what is really important. Thestarting-point here is, of course, our main statutory functions, namely to maintain price stability andpromote a safe and efficient payment system.For three hundred years the Riksbank has owned a paper mill and a note-printing works in Tumba anda mint in Eskilstuna. These are largely manufacturing operations. Through the Tumba works, in thepast decade the Riksbank has been active in export markets and produced banknotes on behalf of anumber of countries. Besides manufacturing notes and coins, we distribute them. Like McDonalds andthe food chains, we send our products, wrapped in plastic though not deep-frozen, to everywhere inSweden. In our case the security requirements are, of course, considerably higher.But is this really something we should be doing? At the Riksbank we decided it was not. Our job is toconcentrate in the first place on monetary policy and the difficult systemic questions in the financialworld. We have therefore decided to sell the Tumba works. In our opinion, the enterprise deservesowners that are more professional than the Riksbank. Moreover, our distribution system has beentransformed into a limited company, Pengar i Sverige AB (PSAB), literally, Money in Sweden Limited.A major reconstruction has been completed and we now count on being able to sell the company at agood price.All in all, the focus on our core activities has enabled us to cut the number of employees, which atpresent is about 450. This can be compared with a figure between 15,000 and 16,000 for theBundesbank or the Banque de France. In relation to the population, the corresponding number for theRiksbank would be almost 2,500. Bear in mind, too, that many of our functions have little or nothing todo with the size of the population.Strength and securityAs a newcomer I found that in certain respects the Riksbank resembled a traditional Swedishindustrial estate. Those establishments were stable and often highly professional in their field, whichmight be high-grade steel or paper; but they also tended to be run autocratically and resist change.Central banks have also lived a closed existence, with a corporate spirit that was both good and bad.This is something that has to be renounced to enable us to perform our tasks properly and both attractand retain the best university graduates. An open internal dialogue with management is needed topromote an informal exchange of ideas. Taking responsibility and meeting deadlines must also berewarded. It is easy to say that some mistakes are acceptable provided things get done but thatattitude is by no means customary in a central bank. Last but not least, we must have an open attitudeto the outside world, accept impulses and explain what we are doing.So what have we done in recent years to make the Riksbank a more modern place to work in? Hereare some examples:(cid:1) We have aimed for a better organisation by making it flatter and delegating more to heads ofdepartment and division. That in turn means that general objectives and tasks must beformulated clearly for all concerned so that everyone is aware they are not just piling stoneson top of each other but actually helping to build a cathedral.(cid:1) We have accentuated the analytical and academic profile. Our advisers are world-classacademics and members of the staff have access to further education in Sweden as well asabroad. We have also made the basic operations more efficient.(cid:1) Another aim has been to give staff a more flexible working life. Working from home shouldbe simple and everything should function properly even when a senior official is at homelooking after children. Staffing therefore has to be arranged with this in mind. We are alsohaving a drive for more women in managerial posts. Last year we started a mentorprogramme for female administrators with a view to broadening the base for the recruitmentof new managers.(cid:1) Besides altering the ways in which we communicate monetary policy in order to reach awider public, during these years we have run an educational programme for uppersecondary teachers and developed an Internet game called Stargold. At present we areworking on an idea for a competition in civics between classes in Sweden's upper secondaryschools.
BIS Review51/20013Evaluating all this is not an easy matter, particularly when one is fully engaged in it. I believe, however,that our efforts to make the Riksbank more transparent have worked well. To use the terminology ofthe BIS report, we have certainly become more "outward-looking". It has been more difficult to breakwhat the same terminology refers to as "upward-looking". It is not so easy to build up an efficientcooperation and sense of responsibility, unencumbered by prestige, throughout our organisation.It is gratifying that among students in our subject, we are the most popular workplace in the publicsector. In the league of all workplaces in Sweden, we rose seven pinholes last year to fourteenthplace.  But we are not content with this and aim for a further improvement. The tasks as such, theproximity to economic policy and the international dimension should be sufficiently attractive. If, inaddition, we can create an environment in which people can grow and feel they are an important partof the organisation, then I believe we can do still better.There are many connections between an open, clear relationship with the outside world on the onehand and our internal work on the other. Distinct goals have helped to focus internal operations andtighten the analysis. By making things less hush-hush we have also made it possible to include morepeople in a realistic discussion of monetary policy, for example. We are now open to criticism of asharper and more specific nature and that has been good for us. The Riksbank's motto, Hinc robur etsecuritas (Hence strength and security), which used to allude to our earlier functions as the producerof notes and coins, for example, now refers at least as much to our analytical competence, theaccuracy of our analyses and our efficiency as an authority.Management with an executive boardOne consequence of the new Riksbank Act, effective from the beginning of 1999, was that a newExecutive Board, consisting of six members, is collectively responsible for all the Bank's operations.This was a clear break with the earlier arrangement where the management was closer to that of aconventional company with a managing director and a board that exercised control and took theoverriding decisions. I should like to conclude with some remarks on the challenges this changeinvolved.As regards monetary policy, it was not all that difficult. In the light of experience from the German,British and American central banks, for example, we had drawn up proposals for working procedureswhich we have largely adhered to. Our internal process is very open and the staff are deeply involved.The minutes of the Executive Board's monetary policy discussions are published, which dispels anysense of mystery. At the same time, a better foundation is hopefully provided for a discussion ofmonetary policy in society in general.The matter of internal control has been trickier. One alternative would be to treat the Executive Boardas a board of directors; that, however, would have meant working with as many as 18 chief executivesin the form of the heads of department. Another possibility would be to see ourselves as chiefexecutives but that, too, has its pros and cons; few organisations have six chief executives,presumably for very good reasons. Perhaps the closest parallel is the board of a group with a numberof subsidiaries.In practice we have adopted a variety of approaches. We have tried to delegate more matters morespecifically to the heads of department, leaving them to run the operations and provide continuity andcompetence. At the same time, the number of departments has been reduced so as to have anorganisation that is less top-heavy. The Executive Board's responsibilities have been shared outamong the members. That does not mean that we are to manage day-to-day operations, which is amatter for the department heads. Our task is to act instead as a source of support and dialogue.The internal management and the way we handle monetary policy are interconnected. Anarrangement with reservations and so on could lead to a polarised picture in the media and that in turncould have repercussions on the internal work. Even though we do not see any differences of opinionas something unnatural, others may do so and that might make it difficult to avoid splits in theorganisation. In this respect I think we have been broadly successful. At times the media havepresented a dramatic scene with major differences of opinion but with the passage of time we seem tohave become less and less newsworthy. At the same time, we have handled the system rathercarefully and abstained from arguing with each other. That I thing is wise because the system is ratherfragile.
4BIS Review 51/2001Let me conclude by referring back to my opening remarks. The financial markets are becomingincreasingly integrated, banks are crossing more and more boundaries and so on. All this is affectingthe Riksbank to a high degree. The same is true of the rapid technical innovations, with increasinglycomplex payment systems. Add to this the possibility of EMU and you can see the future does not lackchallenges.Apropos of what I have been talking about today, a while ago one of my American colleagues, BillMcDonough, said something to this effect: we should be pleased if we are better today than we wereyesterday at the same time as we are not yet as capable as we will be tomorrow. I think that's aboutright.
BIS Review 50/20011Laurence H Meyer: What happened to the new economy?Remarks by Mr Laurence H Meyer, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem, before the New York Association for Business Economics and The Downtown Economists,New York, 6 June 2001. Mr Meyer’s references have been omitted; please see the Federal ReserveBoard’s website (www.federalreserve.gov) for these.*      *      *In 1995, the growth rate of the gross domestic product was close to the prevailing estimate of trend,the unemployment rate was close to the prevailing estimate of the non-accelerating inflation rate ofunemployment (NAIRU), and inflation was modest. I am reviewing this bit of recent history just to setthe stage for my arrival on the Board of Governors in mid-1996. What did the challenges facingmonetary policy look like, and what did they turn out to be? The contrast is remarkable.When I joined the Board, the statement I made at my very first Federal Open Market Committee(FOMC) meeting was that, although economic performance had been very good – perhaps the first-ever soft landing – it would be a challenge to sustain that performance, and we certainly shouldn'texpect it to get any better. Without a doubt, that was my worst forecast.In fact, as you all know well, the economy's performance did improve, dramatically, over the next fouryears. I have often described the ensuing reaction of the FOMC. First, we celebrated. Second, wegracefully accepted a share of the credit. Third – and in terms of time expended, this swamped all theothers – we struggled to understand why performance had turned out to be so exceptional and whatthis explanation implied for the appropriate conduct of monetary policy. In the private sector, I learnedthat if you made a bad forecast, clients were more forgiving if, as a result, they ended up richer thanthey expected rather than poorer. So we struggled to understand the unexpected performance at thesame time that we were accepting accolades for our contribution to the outcome, if not for ourforecasting acumen.In my view, monetary policy played a modest but nevertheless important role. First, we contributed toa very good set of initial conditions as the economy entered 1996 – the soft landing I mentioned. Low,stable inflation and steady growth facilitated good private decisionmaking and minimized economicdistortions. Second, during the unexpected performance that followed, we adapted policy along theway, essentially accommodating, or at least not interfering with, the dynamism associated with a waveof innovation and entrepreneurial activity.One reason that I am beginning with this nostalgia is to focus on the exceptional performance of 1996through mid-2000 and take your minds off the more recent travails of the economy. But I certainlyunderstood that the time would come when monetary policymakers would find it challenging to keepthe economy on a favorable course – as we had been briefly challenged in 1998. Indeed, last October,I said a transition to slower growth was likely already under way. When I first drafted that talk, Ifocused on the two sides of the economy's adjustment to a dramatic acceleration of productivity. Thefirst I called the bright side. This side pertained to the period when households and businesses werejust waking up to the new, more pleasant range of macroeconomic possibilities. This phase wasdominated by above-trend growth, rising utilization rates, and steady-to-declining inflation. My focus inOctober was on what I called the transition to the other side. This is the side that arrives whenproductivity growth stabilizes and the temporary demand and disinflationary effects that flowed fromthe rising rate of productivity growth begin to dissipate. This period would be characterized by below-trend growth, rising unemployment, and, I suspected, some rise in inflation. My editors chided me for alack of elegance as well as a lack of symmetry. If I characterized the first side as "bright," they noted, Ishould describe the other as "dark." I said, thanks, but no thanks. Fed governors don't talk about darksides. In addition, while I saw the risk of a sharper-than-anticipated slowdown, I didn't view the otherside as inevitably "dark." In any case, I wanted to note the positive possibilities – specifically, a benignoutcome.So I focused on the possibility of another soft landing – though one different from the earlier one. Thesoft landing in this case – what I have called a reverse soft landing – would have to be one engineeredby slowing the economy to modestly below trend growth for a period, returning to its potential level ofoutput from above rather than below. The evidence available at the time simply did not foreshadow therapid and dramatic swing from the earlier exceptional performance to flirtation with recession, which
2BIS Review 50/2001has been accompanied by an equally dramatic change in the national mood – from extraordinaryoptimism, indeed exuberance, to the current degree of concern.Much of the earlier optimism was linked to perceived fundamental changes in the economy, oftensummed up by the term "new economy." So the dramatic reversal in at least near-term prospects, andin the prevailing mood, raises the question: What happened to the new economy? I have chosen thisas the theme for my remarks this afternoon.As I often do, I will organize my remarks as responses to several questions. First, do we, or did we,have a new economy? Second, is there is a historical precedent for the recent experience – a boomassociated with a bunching of innovations followed by a period of adjustment in both financial marketsand real investment? Third, returning to the specifics of the current episode, why did the economymake such an abrupt transition from exceptional performance to sharply lower growth? Fourth,assuming we were in one to begin with, what happened to the new economy? And, finally, what canwe learn from this experience to help us in meeting the challenges facing monetary policy today?Let me also remind you, before proceeding further, that the views I am presenting this afternoon onthe economic outlook and challenges facing monetary policy are my own and I am not speaking forthe Board of Governors or the FOMC.I.Is there, or was there, a new economy?Is there a "new economy"? I always told my students to answer such questions decisively. I said, "Donot leave the grader in doubt about whether the answer is (as is the apparent choice here) yes or no."Indeed, the answer to the question "Is there a new economy?" is (or at least was) very clear: Itdepends! It depends on how you define new economy and where you live.If you use the narrow definition that I prefer and you live in the United States, the answer, I believe is,yes, we are in a new economy. The narrow definition identifies the new economy with the dramaticacceleration in productivity tied, to an important degree, to innovations in information technology.Productivity refers to output per hour, and it is perhaps the single most important determinant ofeconomic well-being, closely related to real income per capita. But perhaps we should say, we are in anew economy again – that is, another period, like others over the long span of American economichistory, during which a bunching of innovations has propelled the economy to a higher rate of growthfor a while.The acceleration in productivity set off complex dynamics. First, it encouraged an investment boom totake advantage of new profit opportunities provided by technological advances and a consumptionboom in response both to expectations of more-rapid growth of labor income and to the surge in equityvalues that reflected optimism about higher earnings growth. Growth soared, not just by an amountthat paralleled the faster growth in supply, but for a while by more, thanks to the simultaneousconsumption and investment booms. As a result, the unemployment rate moved progressively lower.At the same time, the higher rate of productivity growth meant a lower cost of production for a givenlevel of wages. That initially boosted profits. But this was quickly followed by a disinflationary virtuouscycle that allowed the economy to accommodate a progressively tighter labor market without anincrease in inflation.As income and capital gains soared, tax revenues did too, reinforcing the effects of the 1990 and 1993tax increases and the restraint on federal spending. In the end, tax revenues increased by more thancould be explained by the higher income growth and the high level of capital gains, but thosedevelopments still played an important role in the dramatic swing from large deficits to burgeoningsurpluses. The swing from deficit to surplus, in turn, kept interest rates lower than they otherwisewould have been by freeing up real resources to sustain the investment boom.The United States was the only major country in which the dramatic surge in productivity was evident,so foreign capital flowed in to take advantage of profit opportunities here. The result was a steadyappreciation of the dollar. Again we cannot fully explain the exchange-rate movements with thechanges in the rates of return on bonds and physical capital, but these developments at least playedan important role in the exchange-rate movements. The stronger dollar, in turn, helped containinflation and, along with faster growth here than in other industrial countries, contributed to a risingtrade and current account deficit.
BIS Review 50/20013II.A new economy againOne of my themes today is that we are in the new economy again. That is, instead of viewing thecurrent experience as unique, it is probably better understood as a replay of earlier historical episodesin which a bunching of technological innovations ushered in periods of high productivity growth. Myfirst task in developing support for this interpretation was to see whether the economic history of theUnited States can be viewed as a series of what I will call productivity cycles – meaning relatively longperiods of higher and then lower productivity growth. If this is possible, then I can examine thesecycles for regularities related to investment booms and equity price surges, followed by retrenchmentsin investment and corrections in equity values. I should note that whenever I come up with difficultassignments like this, I immediately turn to our staff to do the heavy lifting and, as usual, they didn'tdisappoint.I have to begin with some disclaimers. First, the pre-World War II data are not as good and not asdetailed as the postwar data, and different researchers put forward competing sets of historical data.So uncertainty is greater when it comes to dating episodes, comparing amplitudes from one episodeto another, and, especially, going beneath the surface to look at other details of the experience.Second, the results of the historical tour are intriguing but not definitive. I don't want to oversell, but Ido think some earlier experiences help put recent developments in perspective.Chart 1 plots the level of labor productivity from 1889 to 2000 and chart 2 presents a summary ofproductivity growth over some interesting sub-periods that were judgmentally identified.1 Averagelabor productivity growth over the entire period was 2 percent. So we have, of course, periods ofabove and below "average" productivity growth. From 1889 to 1995, the duration of the periods shownin the figures is ten to twenty-eight years, averaging about twenty-one years; leaving out the one shortperiod, 1917 to 1927, the average duration of the other periods is twenty-four years. Labor productivitygrowth during the high-growth periods averaged just about 3 percent a year, compared to just over1-1/2 percent per year during the slower-growth periods. This is interesting since we have transitionedfrom a long period of 1-1/2 percent growth, from 1973 to 1995, to high-end estimates of 3 percenttoday. Of course, high-growth periods need not necessarily have similar growth rates; and the samewith low-growth periods. Each episode depends on the character of the innovations in play.To my eye, the charts suggest a sequence of waves in labor productivity, periods of rapid growthfollowed by periods of more sluggish growth. Also looking at a long period of U.S. history, but stoppingbefore the acceleration in productivity in the second half of the 1990s, and focusing on growth inmultifactor productivity, Professor Robert Gordon of Northwestern University has offered a differentinterpretation. He emphasized the "one big wave" of improvement in productivity growth that began inabout 1913 and extended to about 1972, with especially rapid growth during the golden age between1950 to 1972. He links this rapid growth in this period to the string of important innovations in the latenineteenth and early twentieth centuries. However one parses the history of productivity growth, thecharts for labor productivity and Gordon's analysis of multifactor productivity suggest that periods ofmore rapid productivity growth can be linked, at least loosely, to the pace of innovation.Although Gordon has, at least in his most recent analysis, reached a similar conclusion about thedimension and source of the recent productivity acceleration as many others, he has argued that thecomputer does not measure up to the great inventions of the past, including electricity, internalcombustion engines, petrochemicals, plastics, pharmaceuticals, and communications. But that seemsto be a more philosophical question – more about the welfare effects of innovations – than one aboutthe contribution of innovations to measured productivity growth, investment booms and asset bubbles.In addition, the information technology boom importantly involves improvements to the productionprocess. Thus, as Paul David and others have noted, the closest parallel to the information technologyrevolution might be the introduction of electrical machinery. And, with both the electric motor andinformation technology, there was a delay between the time of the innovation and the increase inproductivity growth, as Paul David has documented. At any rate, even if twenty-five years in the future,we look back on recent developments and conclude that they were not as important as the innovationsearlier in the twentieth century, the recent innovations would still have played a significant role inboosting measured productivity.Given the productivity resurgence of the late 1990s – and the patterns evident in the historical data – Ibelieve that the recent data should be interpreted as part of another high-growth wave following a                                                     1 1 Through 1947, the data in charts 1and 2 are from Kendrick (1961). From 1947 forward, the data are from the Bureau ofLabor Statistics.
4BIS Review 50/2001low-productivity-growth period. If I am right, then the critical question is, what forces underlie thehigh- and low-productivity periods? I don't want to exaggerate my ability to provide a definitive answer,but the story may be, as Gordon describes for the period of his one big wave, a "happy coincidence ofinnovations." That is, high-productivity periods reflect the influence of a bunching of technologicalinnovations. Low-growth periods reflect the productivity performance in the absence of bunching orwith considerably less of it.What are the regularities associated with periods of higher productivity growth? Not surprisingly,investment in the sectors in which the innovations are taking place surges, and the stock prices offirms in these industries soar. Also excesses tend to emerge, at least in these industries, followed bycorrections. The excesses and corrections generally involve both valuations of firms and investment inthe innovating industry. After the initial frenzy of investment spending to take advantage of the newopportunities, the industries sometimes become overcrowded, or at least profitability is significantlydiminished for a while, resulting in failures of many firms and a retrenchment in investment.Several examples of important innovations provide some concrete illustrations of this adjustment tohigher productivity growth.2 The first example is the development of the motor vehicle industry and itscontribution to productivity after the First World War. Investment in motor vehicle production surged inthe 1910s and early 1920s. Share prices soared. General Motors' share price, for example, increased5,500 percent from 1914 to 1920. By the early 1920s the industry had become overcrowded. Itappeared clear at this point that the auto companies would be unlikely to meet the overblown profitexpectations that had prompted both the pace of investment in the industry and the surge in equityvaluations for auto firms. Share prices plummeted, with GM losing two-thirds of its value.Radio is a very interesting case study. It took a long time to develop a successful business model forthis innovation. The early innovators focused on point-to-point communication, and it tookconsiderable time to move to a business model in which the advertisers would pay for programming.This pattern seems analogous to the struggle for a viable business model for the Internet. Broadcastradio developed in the early 1920s, but many innovators did not survive. Of the forty-eight stations thatwere the first in their states, twenty-seven were out of business by 1924. Later in the decade theindustry grew and stock prices surged, with RCA jumping nearly twenty-fold from 1923 to 1929. Shareprices fell during the Depression, but, unlike stock prices in many other industries, RCA's share pricedid not return to its pre-Depression peak for about three decades, suggesting that its earlier pricerepresented a bubble.Other examples also illustrate excesses associated with new technologies. The development ofelectric utilities was another important source of productivity gains in the 1920s. Expansion andconsolidation considerably boosted efficiencies in the industry during that decade, although signs ofexcess capacity were not evident. On the other hand, share prices of these firms soared, with astunning run-up late in the decade. Share prices collapsed in the Great Depression, but again did notreturn to the pre-Depression peaks until the mid-1960s, suggesting again the possibility that a bubblehad developed in the earlier period.3Finally, we consider the airline industry. After Lindbergh's 1927 transatlantic flight, airline stockssoared, and many companies rushed into the business. Stock in a company called Seaboard Air Linestook off even though it was just a railway company, a phenomenon analogous to that of adding a dot-com suffix to company names in the late 1990s.Interestingly, none of our examples overlaps with the golden age. That period seems to becharacterized by a broader range of smaller innovations and perhaps, therefore, did not appear to giverise to the same frenzy of investment activity or euphoria with respect to valuations.In the examples above, innovations generally resulted in investment booms in the innovating sectorbut not always in the broader economy. The innovations often seemed to result in bubbles invaluations in the innovating sector, but this did not necessarily dominate the equity valuations for theentire economy. After a period, the innovating sector often experienced a shakeout or retrenchment,though that didn't always dominate the macrodynamics of the entire economy. Nevertheless, in theexamples in which booms were followed by retrenchments, the sector in question made importantcontributions to productivity long after the shakeout.                                                     2 These historical examples draw heavily from Frank and Browning (2001), Gould (1946), Wessel (2001), and White(1990).3 See White (1990).
BIS Review 50/20015III.Sustainability and the new economyLet me now return to the present day and turn to the task of understanding the sharp slowdown underway and the particular features of recent experience that seem so central to understanding the forcesat work. I refer here to the correction in equity prices and the retrenchment of investment, both ofwhich are centered on the high-tech area.As we begin to ask the question, what happened to the new economy, many of you, I expect, maybelieve that the answer stands right in front of you. I mean, of course, the view that monetary policykilled the new economy. So let me begin the story of the slowdown where it started – that is, withmonetary policy.An important question about the economic performance over the period from 1996 to mid-2000 – anda question of key importance to monetary policymakers – was whether it was sustainable. To be sure,if the higher rate of productivity growth continued, growth could remain elevated compared to itsaverage rate over the previous two decades. But even if the new, higher rate of structural productivitygrowth were to persist, could aggregate demand grow faster than the upward-revised rate of increasein supply, and could the unemployment rate fall indefinitely, without the economy overheating andinflation rising? In other words, did new-economy forces eliminate the risks of overheating and higherinflation that were so much a part of the "old" economy? My unambiguous answer was "no." And thatanswer was shared by the FOMC, motivating the monetary policy tightening that began in the middleof 1999.Given the uncertainties about a sustainable configuration of unemployment, output growth andinflation, we lacked a precise roadmap of where we needed to go. While we didn't know precisely whattrend growth was, we knew for certain that growth had been persistently above trend – given thecontinuing decline in the unemployment rate from 1996 though mid-1999. So it seemed prudent toslow growth in an attempt to move toward trend and that, I believe, was the intent as monetary policybegan to tighten in mid-1999.Some, at least, worried about a second set of concerns related to sustainability. Were prevailing equityvaluations sustainable? If not, a correction could occur. Was the high and rising current account deficitsustainable? If not, the dollar could decline sharply. Was the increase in the ratio of debt service toincome and the low, even negative, personal saving rate sustainable? If not, consumer spending couldslow sharply.The late Herb Stein, a very wise economist, once said that if something isn't sustainable, it won'tcontinue! But it is often the case that unsustainable developments do not spontaneously unwind.Instead, they often reverse or correct only when a change in behavior is triggered by some externalevent – for example, a global financial crisis, an unexpected policy development, or an unforeseendeterioration in broader conditions.IV.Why such a sharp slowdown?Why did growth fall more sharply than anticipated and what does this tell us about the new economy?Sharp slowdowns are often the result of three inter-related and reinforcing developments: acoincidence of adverse shocks, an unwinding of pre-existing imbalances triggered by the deteriorationin broader macroeconomic conditions, and a collapse in consumer and business confidence.The economy slowed in part, as I have noted, because monetary policy was committed to such anoutcome. By mid-2000, it appeared that the economy, in response to the cumulative tightening overthe previous year, was slowing toward trend. The Fed stopped tightening and private forecasters wereprojecting a "soft landing." By October and November, it appeared that the slowdown was takinggrowth modestly below trend. Given the supply-side uncertainties I noted earlier, this outcome alsoseemed acceptable. But late in the year, the economy decelerated more sharply and we now knowthat growth fell to about 1 percent in the fourth and first quarters and it appears to have remainedsluggish into the second quarter. We did not, however, have the data in hand at the time of theDecember meeting to confirm the degree or persistence of the slowdown. The Blue Chip consensusforecast in December, for example, still projected 3 percent growth over 2001.The sharper slowdown reflected, in part, the contribution of several additional shocks that reinforcedthe effect of the monetary policy tightening. Energy prices rose throughout 1999 and 2000. Oil pricesshot up in the fall and natural gas prices soared late last year just as oil prices began to recede. Thehigher energy prices undermined consumers' purchasing power.
6BIS Review 50/2001As interest rates rose and the economy slowed, lenders became more discriminating about thecreditworthiness of borrowers, reflecting concern about borrowers' ability to service all the debt thatthey had accumulated during the earlier period of exceptional performance. The result was increasedinterest rates for lower-rated borrowers and tighter underwriting standards at banks. The decline inequity valuations for high-tech firms, the virtual closing of opportunities for initial public offerings, andthe higher quality spreads for low-rated borrowers naturally hit start-up and new technology firmsespecially hard.Also, equity prices fell sharply, particularly technology stocks – with the NASDAQ now having declinednearly 60 percent and Internet stocks about 70 percent from their peaks. This is a perfect example ofan unwinding of a pre-existing imbalance – in this case an unsustainable rise in equity values in thetechnology sector.The correction of equity prices presumably reflected, at least in part, a reevaluation of the profitabilityof owning and producing high-tech capital and software, a deterioration in the expected earnings oftelecommunications firms, and a reappraisal of the earnings prospects of dot-com firms. Thesereassessments of the value of these firms had much to do with earlier developments in the industryand little to do with monetary policy or the overall slowdown in growth. The frenzy of investmentspending undertaken to take advantage of the investment opportunities arising from advances intechnology resulted in some investments that were successful and others that were not. This is asecond example – one that was perhaps less noticed earlier – of the unwinding of an unsustainabletrend. At any rate, a shakeout in the high-technology area and retrenchment of investment spendingfollowed.As demand weakened, inventories accumulated, and firms moved to cut production – not just to alevel supported by the slowdown in demand, but even lower to shed the excess inventories. Inventorycorrections are typically central to the swings in activity that occur during recessions or sharpslowdowns. The current correction does, however, seem to have a new-economy flavor. Becauseinformation technology provided firms with a more rapid flow of information about current sales andinventories, they may have responded more quickly to developments. The result might be a sharperinitial decline in production, but with less persistence than otherwise.Finally, even as forecasters did their best to identify the coincidence of adverse events that wasslowing growth, the economy weakened more than expected. This is also a fairly typical development– a coincidence of forecast errors in the same direction across many spending categories – duringperiods of unusually strong or weak growth. It is often related to sharp swings in business andconsumer confidence – swings that are larger than would have been predicted from thecontemporaneous changes in employment, income, interest rates, and so forth.V.What happened to the new economy?So what happened to the new economy? The answer, I believe, is that we are still in the new economy(again). The shape of the slowdown has the new economy written all over it, just as the shape of theearlier expansion did. We could say that the new economy has suffered an old economy disease – ifnot a full-fledged recession, at least a close relative, a growth recession – as a result of thedevelopments I just described. A growth recession refers to a period of below-trend growth duringwhich the unemployment rate rises. But that misses the distinctive features of the current slowdown.So I think the story is that we turned from a period in which all the forces operating on the economywere lined up to produce exceptionally favorable performance to a period when the economy mustadjust to some of the imbalances that built up in the earlier period. Our job as monetary policymakersis to try to ensure that the adjustment is not too jarring. But there has been pain. Many investors areunderstandably unhappy at their loss of wealth. So much of what had been accumulated in a fewyears has quickly disappeared, almost as mysteriously. In addition, many firms have gone bankruptand others will, especially some of the riskier ventures in the technology sector. But these patternsseem to have historical precedent in the corrections of both equity values and investment that follow,after a lag, the transition to a period of higher productivity growth.Some might expect that new-economy developments would make recessions less likely. That is not anentirely unreasonable presumption. The experience among faster-growing European economies in theearlier postwar period was that these economies tended to have fewer quarters of decliningoutput – the sine qua non of a recession as defined in the United States – than was the case in theslower-growing United States. Now that the United States had become a higher-growth economy
BIS Review 50/20017(again), it might be that cyclical episodes would be more likely to be growth recessions and less likelyto be outright recessions. However, in the United States in the 1950s and 1960s – when averagegrowth rates were about as high as today – the chance of negative-growth quarters was about equalto the chance in the 1970s and 1980s, when average growth was only half as large.In addition, to the extent that the high-tech revolution increased the ability of firms to recognize andrespond to changes in demand and quickly remedy unwanted inventory accumulation, the response ofoutput to demand shocks might be less persistent. On the other hand, it appears that the high-techrevolution didn't help firms or other forecasters anticipate changes in demand.There is no guarantee that a higher-growth economy is less vulnerable to recessions. Indeed, I believethat the new-economy developments that have raised sustainable growth might also, at least initially,have made economic performance more volatile. First, I noted that the adjustment to a higher rate ofproductivity growth might bring a temporary surge in output, on top of the higher average growth rates,while at the same time lowering the rate of inflation. Such a remarkable performance, while bound tobe temporary, nevertheless could easily encourage unsustainable expectations. Hence, the attempt totake advantage of new-economy forces prompted such a frenzy of investment activity that many bad,as well as good, investment decisions were made. Bad investments result in some firms going out ofbusiness and others suffering temporarily depressed profitability and therefore curtailing furtherexpansion for a while. And, in part because the profit opportunities of new technology firms were sodifficult to gauge, exuberance took valuations to levels that proved to be unsustainable.VI.ProspectsTwo sets of new-economy forces are likely to be especially important in determining the severity of theslowdown. The first is the length of the adjustment period required to complete the shakeout andabsorb any excess capacity resulting from the high-technology investment boom. The second is thetime it takes for the accumulation of investment opportunities arising from the continued flow ofinnovations to lead to a revival of investment spending.With respect to households, it appears inevitable that the decline in equity valuations will result in anegative wealth effect; as a result, growth in consumer spending is likely to remain below the pace ofincrease in income for a while. This will, over time, partially reverse the earlier decline in the savingrate. The other related key will be the degree to which declines in consumer confidence, perhapsunder the influence of a softer labor market, undermine consumer spending.The consensus forecast remains quite optimistic. It calls for a weak first half – but no recession – andsome improvement in the second half, on the way to trend growth next year. One reason for arelatively optimistic assessment of recovery is that monetary policy has eased promptly andaggressively to support aggregate demand. To date, this easing has had only a little effect onaggregate demand. That is not a statement about the lack of potency of monetary policy, only aboutthe well-know lag in the response of aggregate demand to monetary policy action. Given this lag,monetary policy could provide limited support for the economy during the period when weakness wasdeveloping. But the response to the cumulative easing to date should begin to mount in the secondhalf, and continue to build in 2002. Moreover, if expectations in futures markets are borne out, energyprices should be moving lower. In addition, fiscal stimulus is on the way. But the key to the strengthand rapidity of the recovery will be the balance between the working off of excesses associated withnew-economy forces that built up in 1999 and early 2000 and the renewal of investment asnew-economy opportunities continue to accumulate.While a recovery along the lines of the consensus forecast is reasonable, I see some downside risksto that outlook. There are no signs yet that the economy is strengthening relative to its first-quarterperformance and growth is likely to remain sluggish into the third quarter. In addition, it is unlikely thatwe will see a repeat of the exceptional performance from 1996 through mid-2000 on the other side ofthe slowdown. First, the temporary demand and disinflation that accrued during the initial adjustmentto an acceleration in productivity – and that contributed to the exceptional performance earlier – maynow be behind us. Second, we are unlikely to see a repeat of the unsustainable rise in equity prices orfrenzied pace of investment, at least for a time. The events of the past year are likely to linger in theminds of many.
8BIS Review 50/2001VII.Challenges facing monetary policyLearning from experience is the key to good forecasting and good policymaking. Movements from lowto high (or high to low) productivity growth set off complex dynamics that typically dominatemacroeconomic experience for a period. We have relatively few historical examples, so policymakershave had to learn as they confronted the most recent productivity acceleration. Let me identify some ofthe lessons, or at least identify some of the questions, that we might be asking about the appropriateconduct of monetary policy.Monetary policy can become an especially blunt instrument during a period of a productivityacceleration, at least once imbalances and vulnerabilities build, as they seemed to have. Any attemptto slow growth in such an environment – necessary as it may be – can produce a discontinuousresponse after some point by triggering an abrupt unwinding of financial and other imbalances.Monetary policy has to be alert to the possibility of such a discontinuous change and be prepared toreverse course, as we have done.Some, including myself, may have over-weighted our concerns over resource utilization rates duringthe high-growth period but underestimated the dangers from growing imbalances in other areas. Theproductivity shock appears to have lowered the short-run NAIRU, allowing a period of above-trendgrowth to be accompanied by stable-to-declining inflation. But the absence of the emergence ofinflationary pressures, and therefore of a rise in real interest rates to contain them, may havecontributed to an environment in which asset bubbles and real investment excesses could develop.This is obviously an area that should and will receive attention by researchers in the years ahead.Other lessons, closely related to the point I just made, are some insights about the strategy formonetary policy from the Taylor rule. Three components guide the Taylor rule prescription: theequilibrium real rate, the output gap, and the deviation of inflation from its target. Recent experienceteaches us that the Taylor rule is simple in principle but complex in practice. For example, measuringthe output gap has been difficult. I believe it is the short-run rather than the long-run value of theNAIRU that should underpin the unemployment gap (a relative of the output gap used in this rule), butthere are a wide range of estimates of the short-run NAIRU. Equally important, the assumption of aconstant equilibrium real rate seems untenable, especially during a transition from low to higherproductivity growth and during a time when the equity premium seems to have moved around somuch.Finally, there may be a challenge on the other side of the coming rebound in growth that has to betaken into account in setting monetary policy. The slowdown began at a point when output may havebeen above potential, and output growth was clearly above the rate of growth in potential supply. Inthe consensus forecast, the economy converges in 2002 to something very close to trend growth atfull employment. This aftermath is very different from the usual pattern of weakness in the economy,during which slack opens up, resulting in a prospect for continuing disinflation during the early years ofthe ensuing expansion. Because the slowdown started from a relatively low level of inflation, thedesirability of a significant decrease in inflation rates is not as great as it has often been in the past.Still, given the initial conditions, we have to be concerned that as we ease to mitigate the risks of apersistent slowdown or recession we do not at the same time create conditions that would lead tohigher inflation as the expansion gathers momentum.VIII.ConclusionAs I noted earlier, it is always important to learn or relearn valuable lessons from experience. Recentdevelopments have taught or re-taught us a number of such lessons. Equity prices can go down aswell as up. Firms need profits to survive. Business cycles happen. And although we cannot alwaysanticipate or counter these developments perfectly, monetary policy remains a potent tool to aideconomic stabilization and maintain low inflation and thereby to promote long-term sustainable growth.
BIS Review 49/20011Jean-Claude Trichet: Views on recent economic developments in the euro areaand international financial architectureAddress by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, Governor of the Banque de France, at the Institute ofInternational Finance Spring Membership Meeting held in Hong Kong on 1 June 2001.*      *      *Ladies and Gentlemen,It’s a great pleasure for me to share some views with such a distinguished audience on two topics ofgreat importance: the first one deals with recent economic developments in the euro area and themotivations of the last 25bps rate cut by the ECB on its 10 May’s meeting. The second point dealswith the very important question of international financial architecture.Let me start with the first topic.The global outlook for 2001 continues to be characterised by sizeable uncertainties, amid thereadjustments taking place in the American and Japanese economies, and their impact on the rest ofthe world. In the United States, however, while the GDP growth estimate for the first quarter of 2001indicates that the slowdown has been substantial, the economy is still driven so far by firm consumerexpenditure.Economic activity in the euro area in 2000 expanded at an annualised rate of 3.4%, the strongestgrowth since 1990, driven by buoyant domestic and foreign demand. The general outlook for this yearand next one remains positive, even if, clearly, some impact of the American slowdown is alreadyvisible. Private investment and consumption are expected to continue growing at a sustained pace,whereas the impact of slower world economic growth is expected to weigh on exports, with also atransitory impact on inventories. Indeed, economic activity in the euro area is largely determined bydomestic factors such as long-term financing costs and disposable income developments, which haveremained favourable. Furthermore, the still high rates of capacity utilisation in the manufacturingsector, the ongoing growth in employment and continued declines in unemployment should helpmaintain positive growth in private investment and consumption.Employment in the euro area is estimated to have increased by 0.6% in the first quarter of 2001,compared with the previous quarter, confirming continued solid job growth creation over the recentmonths.Notwithstanding sustained reductions in the aggregate unemployment rate and relatively rapidemployment growth, wage increases in the euro area have so far remained moderate. Per capitanominal compensation of employees grew by 2.0% in 1999 and by 2.4% in 2000, while unit labourcosts increased by 1.3% and 0.9%, respectively. There are a number of factors that help to explainwhy the increases in oil prices and their impact on inflation have not influenced wage developments ina period of falling unemployment. They include the employers and the general public’s confidence inthe capacity of the ECB to ensure price stability. It is crucial that social partners continue the processof wage moderation seen in the past. This will not only facilitate the task of monetary policy, but willcontribute to the continued reduction of unemployment in the euro area. It is the best recipe forsustainable robust growth.In addition, long-term growth perspectives for the euro area will be strengthened if Member Statesintensify fiscal consolidation. All in all, looking ahead, GDP for the euro area is expected to growapproximately close to trend potential growth.In a context of moderate but still substantial economic growth and of inflationary pressures, which areexpected to weaken over the medium run, the Governing Council of the ECB decided on its Thursday10 May’s meeting to adjust the key ECB rates by 25 basis points. More precisely, as our PresidentWim Duisenberg explained on behalf of the Governing Council, the decision was grounded on thefollowing key monetary, financial and economical developments:On the monetary side, which constitutes as you may know the first pillar of the ECB monetary policystrategy, M3 growth no longer poses a risk to price stability. Such a statement results from thefollowing considerations:
2BIS Review 49/2001(cid:1) M3 growth has been on a gradual downward trend since the beginning of last year, reflectingthe tightening of the ECB monetary policy, which started in November 1999. In the periodfrom February to April 2001, the three-months average of the annual growth rates of M3adjusted for holdings by residents outside the euro area of money market fund shares was4.6%, which roughly corresponds to the reference value of 4.5%. Although credit aggregatefigures remained dynamic, some slowdown has also been observed in their case.(cid:1) in addition, there is now clear evidence that M3 figures are distorted upwards by non-euroarea residents’ purchases of negotiable paper included in M3. This distortion has becomemore sizeable recently and can roughly be estimated to around half a percentage point.All in all, information gathered from the first pillar pointed out that there were less risks to price stabilityover the medium-term emanating from monetary developments.As regards the second pillar of the ECB monetary policy strategy, upward risks to price stability overthe medium-term also have diminished somewhat.Still, HICP growth rate has accelerated on a year-on-year basis in April to 2.9% and possibly the figurefor May will not be very good. But these developments mainly seem to be generated by temporaryfactors that should substantially diminish over next 12 months to permit inflation to go back below thelevel of 2% which is our ceiling for the definition of price stability.However, evidence as well as global uncertainties regarding the international context also requirecontinuous monitoring of growth trends and wage developments.Temporary factors could still affect price developments for some months to come: health concernsrelated to meat consumption and the consequences of the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease couldcontinue to affect unprocessed food prices. Furthermore, pass trough of past rises in oil prices and thedepreciation of the euro are likely to affect price developments for some months.Let me now turn to the question of International Financial Architecture.Impressive progress has been achieved in the recent years to reinforce international financial stabilityand to enhance prevention. We must continue our efforts toward further progress as regards thereform of the financial architecture. I also think that fruitful lessons can be drawn from the assessmentof the new characteristics of financial markets and their impact on financial stability.1.We must pursue and reinforce our efforts towards a renewed international financialarchitecture.These efforts should tend to improve prevention and management of financial crises.1.1Strengthening preventionStrengthening prevention calls for parallel efforts from all actors, international financial institutions,investors and public authorities. Prevention lays on appropriate surveillance and adequate macro-economic policies.1.1.1As regards surveillance, much progress has already been achieved:(cid:1) In the institutional field, important changes have recently occurred: let me mention theimpressive work carried out by the Financial Stability Forum in 1999 (e.g. reports on HighlyLeverage Institutions, Capital flows, Incentives to Foster Implementation of Standards). Icould also quote the work of the G20 or the International Monetary and Financial Committee.Together with the existing institutions such as the IMF, the World Bank and the BIS at theinternational level, we have probably now an efficient structure to cope with current andfuture international financial challenges.(cid:1) The implementation of internationally acknowledged standards will contribute to reduceemerging market economies’ financial vulnerabilities and, together with enhancedtransparency, improve market discipline and market participants’ ability to better assess therisks of their investment decisions.(cid:2) Many efforts have already been achieved with the design of 65 internationally agreedstandards and codes; the Financial Stability Forum identified 12 out of them as key for
BIS Review 49/20013the international financial stability and suggested incentives to implement them. Theimplementation of these standards is in the self interest of all partners in the processof economic and financial globalisation. The commitment of countries to implementCodes and Standards is likely to be reinforced if market participants actually reflectinformation on observance of Codes and Standards in differentiated credit ratings.(cid:2) International Financial Institutions have also continued to proceed toward greatertransparency, in particular the participation of 60 countries on a voluntary basis in thepilot initiative for the release of IMF article IV reports.(cid:2) As regards the private sector, progress may take the form of voluntary improveddisclosure, more demanding statistical reporting and extended requirements for non-transparent segments of the financial markets.1.1.2Prevention also lays on sound economic conditions.A sound macro-economic framework and appropriate macro-economic policies are essential as theycondition the resilience of any economy to external shocks. Three issues are worth being addressed inthat respect:(cid:1) As far as the choice of an exchange rate regime is concerned, the sustainability of anyregime depends crucially on its consistency with a country’s domestic macroeconomic andstructural policy framework. As a consequence, the so called “corner solutions” are notnecessarily the only available options; “intermediate solutions” remain relevant options,particularly for open economies with close links to a partner country (or a single currencyarea) that maintains price stability, or for countries experiencing high inflation anchoring thecurrency provides a simple and credible rule for monetary policy; in that regard, intermediatesolutions might be particularly appropriate for countries which apply to join the EuropeanUnion.(cid:1) The soundness of domestic financial systems is a core element in the ability of an economyto resist external shocks; furthermore, it is clear that weaknesses in the financial system canlead to financial instability and therefore trigger capital outflows, as experienced in thecontext of recent financial crises. As a consequence, emerging market economies shouldestablish an appropriate institutional, supervisory and regulatory framework, building oninternational standards, such as the Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision issuedby the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision.(cid:1) The implementation of sound macro-economic policies is also key as regards crisisprevention. In that respect, let me just say a few words on reserve and debt management.To mitigate the volatility of capital flows and especially short term flows and reap the benefitsof capital account liberalization, one should adopt a risk management strategy that involvesa system for monitoring and assessing the risks and liquidity of the economy as a whole,including at a sector level. The international community may assist in developing bestpractices related to reserve and debt management: let me quote for example the morestringent publishing obligations on net foreign exchange reserves adopted within the contextof the IMF Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) or the IMF and the World Bankinitiative to promote good practices in reserve and sovereign liability management.1.2Clarify the principles governing crisis resolution and the distribution of roles amongactorsI would like to give you my views on two issues at stake which are of great importance andstrongly inter-related, i.e. the role of the IMF and the involvement of the private sector.1.2.1The IMF should remain at the centre of the process for crisis resolutionWhatever the prevention features, crises will still occur in the future. In that respect, I would like tofocus on the roles of the IMF as regards both international lending and crisis management.(cid:1) As regards its lending role, in my view, the IMF cannot act as an international lender of lastresort. First, it has only limited resources that can not match private capital flows; second,the perception of such a role would increase moral hazard. The IMF should not thus provideunlimited and unconditional financial support, its catalytic role remaining a core element of
4BIS Review 49/2001financial crisis resolution. As a consequence, IMF financial assistance should be ex antelimited in terms of quotas. Access above these regular limits should be exceptional andallowed only in cases of systemic risks. However, if short-term financing is the bulk of IMFlending role, the IMF should also promote macro-stability, including structural mattersrelevant for macro-economic policies. As a consequence, the IMF needs a medium and longterm surveillance and medium and long term facilities for adjustments to take hold.(cid:1) As regards its role in crisis management, the IMF could concentrate on agreeing with thecrisis country a program which ensures adjustment and financing over the short andmedium-term:(cid:2) This means, for example, that IMF conditionality should cover short and medium andlong term issues. The Asian crisis has led to an extension of IMF conditionality tostructural areas, mainly as regards financial systems restructuring issues. Thisextension was somewhat criticised but I do not share such views: including structuralmatters in the IMF conditionality is clearly in line with IMF missions as regardsfinancial stability and should reinforce its efficiency. In that respect, the review of IMFconditionality under process should not mean, in my opinion, that it should necessarilybe weakened, by focusing only on short term macroeconomic variables.(cid:2) While facing a financial crisis, the IMF could indicate the relative contributions ofofficial finance and private sector finance as well as the domestic economicadjustments required to fill the gap. Before disbursing its share of financing, it shouldreview and assess the country’s efforts to secure the contributions from privatecreditors required to ensure medium-term sustainability; failing to secure the neededcontribution from private creditors could lead to a revision of the program to requireadditional domestic adjustment.2.Changes in the functioning of financial markets in the recent years also raiseimportant issues that the international community may have to address.There is no need to underscore how much financial markets have changed in the last two decadesunder the combined impact of factors such as financial deregulation, technological and financialinnovation, intensifying competition among financial institutions and increasing demands for moretransparency and greater profitability. These changes have enhanced the overall efficiency of financialmarkets and, by extension, that of the developed economies:(cid:1) Markets have become more transparent and competitive.(cid:1) Financial innovations have made it easier for both governments and the corporate sector toraise capital or hedge risks.(cid:1) Economic agents with funds to invest, in particular households, can choose from a widerrange of investment vehicles offering better returns.(cid:1) Growing disintermediation has contributed to less inflationary financing of economies.Despite all these achievements, there have been some surprising developments on financial assetmarkets. While the rapid emergence of the "new economy" bubble in 1999 and early 2000, followed bya series of sharp corrections, illustrated once again the potential of modern financial markets, e.g. tofinance technological innovation, it also demonstrated their tendency to over-react, moving fromexcessive optimism to disproportionate pessimism, with the ensuing negative consequences for thebehaviour of firms and households.We should be very attentive to these boom-bust episodes on financial asset markets, since they canaffect the monetary and financial stability of the world economy. I would like to discuss two issueshere:(cid:1) First, some factors encouraging excessively homogeneous market behaviour may hinder asmooth and efficient functioning of the markets, and(cid:1) Second, ways of fostering more diverse behaviour on the markets should be considered.
BIS Review 49/200152.1Some factors encouraging excessively homogeneous market behaviour may hinder asmooth and efficient functioning of the marketsFinancial asset prices fluctuate widely and sometimes deviate from economic fundamentals for longperiods of time. Several factors are in play when this happens. I shall give a few examples.(cid:1) Some market participants have become more inclined to engage in "short-termism", that is,they are too preoccupied with their short-term results. This trend might result, in particular,from growing pressure to yield immediate financial results that are not necessarilysustainable.(cid:1) Mimetic behaviour is by no means a new phenomenon on financial markets. However,technological developments on markets may have gradually reinforced this type ofbehaviour. The spread of benchmarking, which allows fund managers and clients tomeasure performance against that of other funds, together with the growing competitionwithin the sector, appear to have increased such mimetic behaviour. Some operators havecome to the conclusion that it is better to be wrong along with everybody else, rather thantake the risk of being wrong alone.(cid:1) The spread of certain fund management techniques, in particular index management, whichhas proven very popular on equity markets, may have contributed to amplifying movementsin financial asset prices. This technique endeavours to match as accurately as possibledevelopments in stock market benchmark indices. It therefore mechanistically leadsmanagers to accentuate current price trends by buying stocks that are on the rise and sellingthose that are falling.(cid:1) The impact of risk management techniques on market dynamics is particularly enlighteningwith regard to the question of asset price overshooting. Of course, central banks andfinancial institutions should continue to encourage the use of these instruments. But, in timesof financial turmoil, the growing use of sophisticated risk management techniques byfinancial intermediaries has had the paradoxical effect of amplifying the initial shock and thespill-over effect. Regardless of the intrinsic qualities of these risk management tools, theirgrowing use may have produced pernicious effects. When market players rely on convergingrisk evaluations, they tend to take the same decisions at the same time, thus amplifying theinitial shock to prices and trading volumes.All these factors have one consequence in common: they encourage homogenous behaviour andreactions to the detriment of the diversity that is conducive to the smooth functioning of financialmarkets.2.2For this reason, we could reflect on some ways – together with the financial industry –on possible ways to foster behavioural diversity in global markets.To safeguard the smooth functioning of the markets, and in particular an efficient pricing mechanism, itwould be opportune to protect, and even reinforce, the diversity of behaviour on the markets. Thisnecessary diversity is merely the echo of the different time horizons, strategies and reaction functionsof market players. On this point, I would like to explore with you a few possible avenues.2.2.1First and overall strengthen the continuing efforts aiming at market transparency:(cid:1) Experience shows that uncertainty and incomplete information are determining factors inmimetic behaviour. These shortfalls in market transparency make herd behaviour seemrational to agents, who prefer to follow bigger participants, who are thought to be betterinformed, rather than develop their own analysis. Strengthening transparency therefore is,more than ever, a priority.(cid:1) One of the objectives of transparency is to enable better differentiation of borrowercreditworthiness. A key feature of mimetic behaviour is that all borrowers are "tarred with thesame brush". So when one emerging economy encounters difficulties, all neighbouringcountries, or countries that share common characteristics, are treated in the same way –regardless of their actual economic and financial situation. The same applies to businessesoperating in the same economic sector. Transparency has substantially increased since theAsian crisis thanks to a solid global consensus – let us continue and reinforce these efforts-
6BIS Review 49/20012.2.2Take into account the medium and long-term perspective of some market participants:(cid:1) Some investors, such as pension funds and insurance companies, have to invest funds inorder to enable their customers to build up wealth over the medium and long term, notably inpreparation for retirement. Consequently, this type of investor are supposed to behavedifferently from traders and short-term investors, who are working on a very different timehorizon. But at times it seems that they are all pushed to behave in much the same way, onthe basis of an overwhelmingly dominant very short-term horizon.(cid:1) To preserve, and even restore, their specific investment approach, these particular investorsmight be more shielded from excessive short-term pressures. This objective raisesconsiderable difficulties, because it touches on the way in which the performances ofmedium and long-term funds (including pension funds) and life insurance companies areassessed.2.2.3 Diversify the risk management tools of financial institutions:(cid:1) As I mentioned earlier, even the best techniques can have adverse effects. To some degree,this is perhaps what has happened to value-at-risk based techniques, which have beenmassively adopted by the financial industry. Because they use more or less similarparameters and have the same features – for example, they took inadequate account ofmarket liquidity at the time of the 1998 crisis –, such tools tend to give converging signals tothose that use them. They thus encourage the herd behaviour that I discussed previously.(cid:1) Of course, the fact that some market participants are more sophisticated than the average isa guarantee that standardisation will remain limited, since they will develop techniques thatare little used by others.(cid:1) However, supervisors are helping to spread the idea that financial institutions should roundout their current range of risk management tools to include extensive use of stress testing.This technique offers a better reflection of the varying situations of institutions and of thediverse perceptions that institutions have of exceptional events. The application of stresstesting techniques and their results are thus inherently more diversified than those resultingfrom methods based on the value-at-risk approach.These are only examples of options to help improve the functioning of markets.Indisputable progress has already been made: the generalisation of concepts of appropriatetransparency since the Asian crisis and the comprehensive use of stress testing are two significantexamples. However, I would like to stress one point. There is probably some merit in an overall reviewof regulatory, accounting and tax rules and regulations, as well as of codes of good conduct and goodpractices, and of structural developments of market themselves, to identify possible amendments andimprovements that could help protect and enhance the behavioural and conceptual diversity ofmodern financial markets.
BIS Review 49/20011Andrew Crockett: Issues in global financial supervisionRemarks by Mr Andrew Crockett, General Manager of the Bank for International Settlements andChairman of the Financial Stability Forum, at the 36th SEACEN Governors’ Conference held inSingapore, 1 June 2001.*      *      *The maintenance of financial stability used to be relatively straightforward in the days when banks andother financial institutions earned protected rents and supervisors and managers could focus onsimple risk measures. Over the last decades, the world has become far more complicated. Firms arerunning more complex risks, sectoral distinctions are blurring and markets are integrating globally.This has made the tasks of authorities responsible for financial stability more difficult to define andexecute: there are more parameters to be considered, shocks come from many more corners, and themanner in which supervisory actions affect supervised institutions is far more complex.So how should supervisors and other authorities with responsibility for financial stability adjust? Thereare substantive and procedural issues to be considered. One substantive issue is how the authoritiesshould respond to a more complex environment. In principle, there may be two options: to adjust tothe existing complexity, or to try and shape the environment so that it is compatible with existingregulatory frameworks and prudential approaches. But the latter has costs and brings risks on its own.Moreover, it may not be feasible given the international dimension of financial intermediation.Another challenge, involving both substantive and procedural issues, and domestic and as well asinternational dimensions, is to devise rules that are consistent across sectors, leave no gaps, and areimplemented effectively and fairly. What supervisory and regulatory approaches are workable in morecomplex environment? And how, procedurally, should the rules be drawn up and enforced? Oneresponse to the latter can be to integrate regulatory and supervisory rule making and enforcementfunctions in a single body. The other is for the various authorities involved to deepen co-operation. Atthe international level, a global super-regulator seems neither a realistic nor a desirable option relativeto an enhanced co-operative approach seeking consistency with adequate recognition of differences.To provide some background to these issues, I will begin my remarks by describing some of thecharacteristics that have resulted from the evolution of the financial sector in recent years and withwhich the authorities now have to contend. I will then group the remainder of my remarks under twoheadings: the implications for supervisory and other authorities; and the procedural issues that arise inorganizing supervisory oversight.I.Nature of change in financial systemsThe most basic forces affecting the financial sector are: the quickening pace of technologicalinnovation, especially in data processing and communication; and the growing acceptance of marketprocesses as the basic determinant of resource allocation. The impact of technical innovation andderegulation on banking and the rest of the financial sector has been profound. The range of productsand services have widened markedly. Intermediation costs have declined enormously. Financialtransactions have grown rapidly in relation to GDP. All of this has brought considerable benefitsthrough more efficient origination and allocation of capital, greater availability of capital for investment,greater efficiency in the management of risks, etc.Let me note six characteristics of this transformation that have important implications for supervisionand regulation. These characteristics have many common strands and channels of interaction.First, firms are running more complex (and sometimes opaque) risks. Advances in the processingof information and in finance theory have permitted the independent pricing of risk factors that werepreviously bundled together in the same instrument. At the same time, the intensification of financialintermediation has given rise to an explosion in the demand for hedging (and position-taking)instruments. The good news is that the new financial instruments have enormously improved thetechnology of risk-management. The downside is that these same instruments, if not properlyunderstood and used, increase the potential for loss, whether resulting from inadequate understandingor deliberate leveraged bets.
2BIS Review 49/2001Second, sectoral distinctions are becoming blurred. To a degree, this reflects the greaterwillingness to accept a free market philosophy. But more importantly, the ability to deconstruct and re-combine risks has enabled financial intermediaries to expand and compete effectively in sectorsbeyond their own. And they can do so under the regulatory umbrella or framework that provides thegreatest benefit and flexibility. To be sure, this can helpfully expose regulatory and economicinefficiencies. But where it is motivated principally by regulatory arbitrage, the authorities need toguard against it leading to a system wide reduction in capital adequacy or undue risk concentration.A third related characteristic is greatly enhanced competition. This has been a prime objective ofmuch of the deregulation and privatisation that has taken place in the financial industry. But thecompetitive climate has been sharpened by other developments, too. A greater focus on shareholdervalue has induced banks' managements to pay more attention to the rate of return on equity. This isgood news in that the financial industry is induced to use its capital more efficiently and financialservices have become cheaper to end-users. But it also means that the cushion against bad luck orbad judgement is thinner. Franchise values are much smaller, so that an erosion of capital morequickly leads to the threat of failure (and the temptation to take unwarranted risks to stay in business).Fourth, the source of financial disturbances has become more become more unpredictable.One cause is capital market integration, which affects a country’s financial markets and institutionswhether or not the economy is entirely integrated. We have seen that capital flows can be volatile andunpredictable. Contagion means that the problems of neighbouring or more distant economies canrapidly become one’s own. Another aspect is the much greater diversity of actors in the financialmarkets. In the 1970s and 80s, most financial intermediation was conducted through banks, withinsurance companies and investment vehicles having well defined roles. But many different types ofinstitution, including non-financial firms are now involved in both wholesale and retail markets. Andfinancial institutions based outside the major centres have come to play a more important role ininternational markets.A fifth characteristic is that financial systems appear to have become more pro-cyclical thanbefore, capable of amplifying credit growth and leveraging market positions more intensely thanbefore. In essence, the “marginal” risk that financial actors willingly engage is greater than before. Toa degree, this is a result of innovations in financial technology, including the process of securitisation,which allow risks to be better distributed and managed. The more widespread use and trading ofcollateral is also a factor. But it also reflects the intensification of competition, and perhaps a viewamong firms that they will be able to get out of risky engagements before they sour. Of course, pro-cyclicality works in both directions: once the downturn sets in, the financial system seems more proneto liquidity erosions and reduced credit supply than in previous episodes of stress.The final characteristic to which I would like to draw attention is the greatly increased speed ofdevelopments in the financial sector. The speed of transmission of news in the financial sector hasalways been high relative to other sectors. Nowadays, market communication and execution can bealmost instantaneous. But what is also speeding up is financial sector actors’ judgement of strategicopportunities in their environment and their moves to take advantage of them. New and cheapertechnology, as well as deregulation, has greatly helped this. Business models get adopted anddiscarded more quickly. This will test regulators and supervisors, for whom the challenge will be tocreate rules of the game that are robust to fad, fashions and arbitrage.There are several consequences of the characteristics I have mentioned and to which will I return.However, one, consolidation, has itself become a characteristic of the present environment. I believeconsolidation has much further to run in many countries. So far, it has mainly taken place withinnational markets, and within particular sectors. Looking ahead, however, cross-border and cross-functional mergers and alliances seem increasingly likely.II.Implications for the authoritiesAs I noted at the outset, a substantive issue raised by the foregoing is how the authorities shouldrespond to the more complex environment that now prevails. In principle, there may be two options: toadjust supervision and regulation to a more challenging environment, or to try and shape theenvironment so that it is compatible with a more slowly evolving regulatory framework and prudentialapparatus.The latter may be possible, within limits, in economies whose financial markets remain relativelyheavily regulated and closed off from other markets. But one cannot ignore the difficulty, the costs and
BIS Review 49/20013risks of deliberately preventing adjustment when the world outside is changing at an ever more rapidpace. A gap that is created – as against one that is being slowly eroded – is one that may later bemuch more difficult to close.In Asia, as elsewhere, countries are following different reform strategies. Given the wide range ofinitial conditions, there can be no single prescription. All the same, two key lessons of the past crisesare by now widely recognised. The first is the need to liberalise financial activities and flows in amanner that is consistent with supervisory and infrastructural capacity. Firms, supervisors and theinfrastructure all need time to adapt to a more demanding and complex market environment.The second lesson is that a comprehensive approach is needed. The financial sector does not existin a vacuum. Its efficiency and stability depend, not only on the prudential standards applied tofinancial institutions, but on the robustness of the financial infrastructure that underpins transactions.Weaknesses in the financial infrastructure can render useless the most careful supervisoryoversight. Weak accounting and auditing practices are a major source of problems. Improvedinsolvency arrangements are also critical: the absence of fully satisfactory bankruptcy arrangementsthat permit the orderly restructuring of distressed corporate debt has been an important factorretarding market development, and intensifying financial crises in many South East Asian economies.One area in which change is needed almost everywhere is corporate governance practices. Wheredemands for reform and infrastructural improvements are made by professionally operating boardsand management in anticipation of expanded business opportunities, the authorities should have fewqualms about embracing them.While a sound infrastructure and strong corporate governance, including effective bank management,are crucial elements in an overall adjustment strategy, equally important are adjustments in regulationand supervision. Let me review the major changes that have taken place in this area.An important trend has been to strengthen the risk sensitivity of the prudential framework.Banking supervisors have focused intensively in recent years on detailed aspects of sound riskmanagement practices in financial institutions: first, the accurate measurement and monitoring of risk;second, controlling and pricing exposures; and third, the holding of adequate capital and reserves tomeet unexpected losses. This work is very apparent in the proposed revision of the Basel CapitalAccord. In the revised standardised approach, risk-weights will be more reflective of actual risk. And inthe internal ratings based approach, subject to safeguards, banks will be able to use their own creditassessments. This is intended both to strengthen internal firm discipline and to reduce the “gaming”that became rampant under the old Accord. But, as supervisors know well, the parameters ofincreased risk sensitivity must be calibrated and implemented carefully so as to avoid increasing thepotential for discontinuities in adverse market circumstances.A complementary trend has been, and continues to be, the strengthening of supervisory oversight.This has implied a move away from direct control-type regulation on types of activities and financialflows, and towards supervision – a move, in other words, away from compliance with portfolioconstraints, and toward an assessment of whether the overall management of a financial firm'sbusiness is being prudently conducted. There are several reasons for this shift (which is reflected inpillar two of the revised Basel Accord). First, the rapid development of new instruments and methodsof risk management make mechanical application of balance sheet ratios inappropriate. Second,regulation inevitably creates incentives for financial engineers to find a way around the rules. Moregenerally, regulation is too blunt an instrument to capture the technicalities and the sophisticationrequired to control risk in a complex financial organisation.To be effective, increased reliance on supervisory oversight requires an upgrading of supervisorycapacity, both in terms of staffing and skills. An effective supervisor must understand all aspects of afinancial firm's business, and can foresee the multiple sources of risk it is likely to confront. Thismeans that supervision is becoming a more demanding profession, and the skills required ofsupervisors are becoming greater and more diverse. Accounting and legal training, while important,are no longer enough. Supervisory authorities are going have to seek also staff with backgrounds ineconomics and business management. Supervisors are becoming more like consultants, whose taskis to understand the bank's business and draw management's attention to underappreciated sourcesof risk.A third trend has been increased reliance on market discipline. Disclosure and transparency are animportant part of a more robust financial architecture, as the third pillar of the new Accord recognises.There is still much to do, in Asia and elsewhere, to raise disclosure standards and to allow the market
4BIS Review 49/2001to provide the necessary discipline. Asia’s crises were a stark lesson that sweeping problems underthe carpet did not solve them. At the same time, supervisors need to take a balanced view of the utilityof market forces as an aid to stabilising behaviour. Market participants may be subject to collectivemisperceptions of risk, such as reflected in the underpricing of risk in upswings. And even if risk iscorrectly perceived, private responses may not be appropriate from the viewpoint of systemic stability.Private behaviour can be affected by expectations of official action (moral hazard); by short termhorizons induced by the nature of contracts; by differing interests as between principals and agents;and more generally by the combined effect of forces that make for what we commonly term “herdbehaviour”.Finally, central bankers and supervisors are increasingly aware that generalised financial instabilityusually has its roots in macroeconomic factors. Banks do not often get into serious difficulties all bythemselves. And if they do, we usually have remedies at hand. Crises typically occur because banksare jointly exposed to a common macroeconomic shock. This realisation has spurred a search fortechniques that will make banking systems more resilient to the financial version of theeconomic cycle. Banks need to be encouraged to build up capital cushions in good times so that theyare available to protect their lending when the cycle turns down. By the same token, they would alsolessen the risk that the credit cycle would unnecessarily exacerbate the economic cycle and hence therisk of financial distress. Among such techniques are stress-testing, pre-provisioning, cyclicallyvariable loan to value ratios, and so on. The strengthening of the supervisory review process (Pillar 2)envisaged in the new Accord could provide a sounder basis for promoting these practices.Monetary authorities, too, are beginning to recognise the complex two-way relationship betweenmonetary and financial stability. The seeds of future financial instability are usually sown byexcessive credit expansion. This facilitates the build up of leverage in the financial system andexposes institutions to losses when the credit cycle turns. Monetary policy will have to be moreconscious in future of the risk of accommodating excessive credit expansion and the unsustainablerise in asset prices that often accompanies it.III.The organisation of supervisory functionsAs I noted at the outset, there are also procedural issues to be considered in adjusting to a morecomplex environment. The blurring of distinction between institutions makes it increasingly importantto have consistency in the supervisory rules and enforcement methods that apply across differentsectors. In its absence, there would be the twin dangers of regulatory arbitrage or competition in laxity.This is an issue for an individual economy as much as for an increasingly integrated global financialsystem. Hence, there is a national and an international dimension to the question of how thesupervisory function should best be organised.At the national level, two quite different approaches are being pursued: to bring all regulatory,supervisory, and oversight functions together in a single entity, as the Scandinavians first did in thelate 1980s and others (e.g. Japan, the UK) have copied since; or, to keep the entities separate, butcreate mechanisms that ensure appropriate co-ordination among the relevant authorities. Each hasadvantages and disadvantages.At one level, the single entity solution seems attractive. It would certainly seem preferable if thepreponderance of domestic institutions were themselves integrated financial conglomerates. (But eventhen – as in Netherlands – the authorities can come to different conclusions). And integration might bean attractive option where a history of supervisory or regulatory failure calls for adjustments that areunlikely to obtain within an existing diversified structure.But even if these conditions are met, it is not immediately clear which are the regulatory activities thatit makes sense to bring together and which to keep on a stand-alone basis. Should for example theprudential supervision of banks and other financial institutions be integrated, but market regulation,including customer and investor protection, be kept separate? Experience with how well integratedregulators handle potentially conflicting objectives during episodes of significant turmoil might tell.A single all embracing financial authority naturally prompts the question of where that authority shouldreside. This is now the subject of intense debate in quite a number of countries. And where suchentities have been created, they mostly exist outside the central bank. This can be seen to have anumber of advantages: Given the blurring of distinctions between different types of financialinstitutions, the retention of supervisory responsibilities within the central bank may give rise toperceptions that the lender of last resort function is being extended, with consequent risks of moral
BIS Review 49/20015hazard. There could also be a conflict of interest with monetary policy, if central banks were induced tobe excessively expansionary in order to head off weaknesses at individual financial institutions. Thereis also the issue of reputational risk. Finally, the central bank may be perceived as too powerful if it isboth independent and endowed with a broad range of functions.There are, however, arguments for retaining at least some supervisory functions within the centralbank. The central bank will have easier access to market information in the case of a crisis, and it willbe easier to co-ordinate monetary and prudential policy actions. It will be easier to assess andrespond to the build-up of systemic risk if the supervisory authority also has responsibilities, andhence specific know-how, in other areas of the financial system (e.g. market functioning and theoperation of clearing and settlement systems), as do central banks. And, access to supervisoryinformation can help the central bank better calibrate monetary policy (e.g. the case of the“headwinds” that confronted the US economy during the recovery of the early 1990s).In these terms, there is no obviously “right” answer to this debate. Individual observers may have theirown preferences, but at the end of the day, the answer probably depends on country-specificcircumstances. For example, how independent from political and industry pressure can a separatesupervisor be? How scarce are the relevant skills? And how blurred have the distinctions betweendifferent types of financial intermediary become? Some, such as Charles Goodhart*, have argued thatthese considerations lead to the conclusion that the case for combining supervisory and monetarypolicy responsibilities in the central bank will generally be stronger in emerging markets.But whatever is the answer to the question “Who should supervise?”, it is necessary to define tasksclearly and in such a way that the tools are available to discharge them. One risk in the present trendto remove supervision from the tasks of central banks is that central banks could be left with aresponsibility for overall financial stability that is neither clearly defined nor supported with thenecessary powers or access to information to discharge it. So where separate supervisory authoritiesare being established, it is important to set up a structure that promotes the necessary exchange ofinformation and permits the central bank to influence the design of prudential rules. Much attention isbeing given to this subject in the countries where new supervisory structures are being put in place.Equally, however, where supervisory responsibility remains with the central bank, it is important that ittoo develops close co-ordination with other relevant authorities.A global super-regulator?Of course, the issues to which the single regulator is a possible response at the national level exist atthe global level as well. How to ensure a level playing field internationally, both in terms ofregulatory/prudential policy and enforcement? An approach sometimes discussed has been to set upa world financial authority, with powers to set and enforce regulations world-wide. I do not believesuch an approach would be either feasible or desirable. It is not feasible, since there is very littlechance of sovereign legislatures ceding powers in the regulatory area to a supranational body. And itwould not necessarily be desirable. A single regulator could well be too monolithic, disinclined toexperiment with new regulatory approaches. The rules it would create might not take adequateaccount of the particularities of the financial sector in different jurisdictions. And insofar as all countrieshad to agree on regulatory initiatives, there would be a risk of converging on the lowest commondenominator.In my view, the most promising approach is that adopted by the Basel Committee and followed bymost other standard-setting bodies. It is to draw up a set of standards that can be agreed bysupervisors in the most advanced jurisdictions, whose broader adoption is encouraged by peerpressure and market forces. It is remarkable to note that, while the Basel rules are backed by noformal legislation, nor has the Basel Committee any law-making mandate, its recommendations havegreater acceptance and force than many treaty-based agreements.Of course many issues remain. One is to ensure that rules made by a restricted group are adequatelyresponsive to the circumstances of countries that are not members of the standard-setting group. Thiscan be achieved by a process of consultation and review, in which a much wider range of countries isinvolved. Another issue is implementation. How can countries be encouraged to adopt the measuresthat will strengthen their financial systems? Here part of the answer seems to be to seek greater                                                     *CAE Goodhart “The Organisational Structure of Financial Supervision” FSI Occasional Paper No 1, BIS, Basel, 2000.
6BIS Review 49/2001support from the market. If markets reward high standards by easier access to funds at lower costs,there is little doubt that strong internal pressures would be created to improve standards.Perhaps it is appropriate here to say a word about the Financial Stability Forum. The Forum wascreated in 1999, and includes senior representatives of ministries of finance, central banks andregulatory authorities in the major financial markets, as well as representatives of the maininternational organisations and standard setting bodies. A key reason for setting up the Forum was therealisation that there are many bodies whose activities contribute to financial stability and who have astake in its preservation.The Forum, in other words, is a tangible recognition of the fact that financial stability requires vigilancein a number of dimensions. Individual financial institutions have to be run on prudent lines, marketshave to be open and transparent, and the financial infrastructure has to be robust. All of theseobjectives have to be pursued at a global level, since the financial industry is global and capitalmarkets are increasingly integrated. Yet there is no global authority that can act in all the areas thatare required. The Forum helps to fill this gap, by facilitating the co-ordination of efforts by thenumerous separate authorities having responsibilities in the field of financial stability.IV.ConclusionIn summary, prudential regulation is becoming more complex and demanding, as well as moreimportant and fascinating. It is demanding a more comprehensive approach than hitherto. It is bringingtogether multiple disciplines in an attempt to harness the forces of the market to improve the market’sstability. It stresses greater risk sensitivity, flexible supervision, and more reliance on market discipline.This is, of course, no more than a further important step along the road to a more efficient and resilientfinancial system. But it is an important step. And it will work to the benefit of us all.
BIS Review 48/20011Willem F Duisenberg: The role of financial markets for economic growthSpeech delivered by Dr Willem F Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, at theEconomics Conference "The Single Financial Market: Two Years into EMU”, organised by theOesterreichische Nationalbank and held in Vienna, on 31 May 2001.*      *      *IntroductionIt is a great pleasure and honour for me to join the Oesterreichische Nationalbank for its 2001Economics Conference on "The Single Financial Market: Two Years into EMU". I would like to take theopportunity today to talk about the role of financial markets for economic growth. I shall first considerwhether the design of the financial system matters for economic growth. Secondly, I shall say a fewwords about where the euro area financial system is heading, two years after the introduction of theeuro. After this I shall discuss the role of monetary policy in the interplay between financial marketsand economic growth. Towards the end, I shall address, as just mentioned by Governor Liebscher, therole of central banks in prudential supervision.Does the financial system matter for economic growth?In the financial system funds flow from those who have surplus funds to those who have a shortage offunds, either by direct, market-based financing or by indirect, bank-based finance. The former BritishPrime Minister William Gladstone expressed the importance of finance for the economy in 1858 asfollows: "Finance is, as it were, the stomach of the country, from which all the other organs take theirtone."The financial system comprises all financial markets, instruments and institutions. Today I would like toaddress the issue of whether the design of the financial system matters for economic growth. My viewis that the answer to this question is yes. According to cross-country comparisons, individual countrystudies as well as industry and firm level analyses, a positive link exists between the sophistication ofthe financial system and economic growth. While some gaps remain, I would say that the financialsystem is vitally linked to economic performance. Nevertheless, economists still hold conflicting viewsregarding the underlying mechanisms that explain the positive relation between the degree ofdevelopment of the financial system and economic development.Some economists just do not believe that the finance-growth relationship is important. For instance,Robert Lucas asserted in 1988 that economists badly over-stress the role of financial factors ineconomic growth. Moreover, Joan Robertson declared in 1952 that "where enterprise leads, financefollows". According to this view, economic development creates demands for particular types offinancial arrangements, and the financial system responds automatically to these demands.Other economists strongly believe in the importance of the financial system for economic growth. Theyaddress the issue of what the optimal financial system should look like. Overall, the notion seems todevelop that the optimal financial system, in combination with a well-developed legal system, shouldincorporate elements of both direct, market and indirect, bank-based finance. A well-developedfinancial system should improve the efficiency of financing decisions, favouring a better allocation ofresources and thereby economic growth.Both market and bank-based financial systems have their own comparative advantages. For someindustries at certain times of their development, market-based financing is advantageous. Forexample, financing through stock markets is optimal for industries where there are continuoustechnological advances and where there is little consensus on how firms should be managed. Thestock market checks whether the manager's view of the firm's production is a sensible one. For otherindustries, bank-based financing is preferable. This holds in particular for industries which face stronginformation asymmetries. Financing through financial intermediaries is an effective solution to adverseselection and moral hazard problems that exist between lenders and borrowers. Banks in particularhave developed expertise to distinguish between good and bad borrowers. Economies that have bothwell-developed banking sectors and capital markets thus have an advantage. Furthermore, in times ofcrisis in either system, the other system can perform the function of the famous spare wheel.
2BIS Review 48/2001The financial system is also particularly important in reallocating capital and thus providing the basisfor the continuous restructuring of the economy that is needed to support growth. In countries with ahighly developed financial system, we observe that a greater share of investment is allocated torelatively fast growing sectors. When we look back more than one century ago, during the IndustrialRevolution, we see that England's financial system did a better job in identifying and funding profitableventures than other countries in the mid-1800s. This helped England enjoy comparatively greatereconomic success. The banker and former editor of "The Economist" Walter Bagehot expressed thisin 1873 as follows. "In England, however, ... capital runs as surely and instantly where it is mostwanted, and where there is most to be made of it, as water runs to find its level".Nowadays, the lack of a well-developed stock market would be a particularly serious disadvantage forany economy. Equity is essential for the emergence and growth of innovative firms. Today's younginnovative high-technology firms will be the main drivers of future structural change essential formaintaining a country's long-term growth potential. The contribution of financial markets in this area isa necessity for maintaining the competitiveness of an economy today given the strongly increasedinternational competition, rapid technological progress and the increased role of innovation for growthperformance.In recent years, "new markets", for stocks of young and growing companies, have become a growingmarket segment in the euro area. Equity financing is particularly advantageous for these companiesand their investors given the uncertainties of the economic return. As the term "shares" suggests, withequity financing you get your share of the outcome, whether it is positive or negative. Banks, on theother hand, may be reluctant to provide loans owing to the risk profile of these firms, and the greaterexposure to a negative result in a loan contract.Total market capitalisation of the new markets in five euro area countries grew from EUR 7 billion atthe beginning of 1998 to EUR 167 billion in December 2000. While some of this increase can beattributed to the overall rise in share prices during this period, it is important to note that the number oflisted companies continued to increase in almost every month. The total number of companies listedon these new markets in the euro area increased from 63 at the beginning of January 1998 to 564 atthe end of 2000. Developments over the last year have admittedly been dismal. However, it is thenature of new markets, given the uncertainties attached to future developments for the companieslisted on these markets, to exhibit more volatility than established markets.Bank-based finance has a special role to play for many companies in need of funds, and thus helps toensure a well-balanced growth process. The economic literature on "relationship banking" hasdemonstrated that banks can contribute to alleviating the impact of sudden economic shocks on theirclients. Banks stand ready to provide many customers with funds even in adverse circumstances, e.g.when the liquidity of financial markets dries up.The banking sector also has an essential role to play with respect to the allocation of funds to the mostprofitable investment opportunities. Banks are, as mentioned before, financial intermediaries that bynature add cost to the allocation of capital. Thus in order for banks to survive in a market economythey need to provide added benefits. It is difficult to compete with the debt securities market, if a bankloan is of a size where the fixed costs of accessing debt markets become negligible. However,securities markets are not always sufficiently liquid and some, especially small and medium,enterprises cannot cover their liquidity needs via securities markets owing to significant fixed costs ofaccess. An additional benefit of bank-based finance relates to the intrinsic nature of the bankingbusiness: some projects cannot be financed directly by the market on account of significantinformation asymmetries between the borrowers and potential lenders. Banks can bridge this gapthanks to their comparative advantages in the assessment and monitoring of investment projects,which contributes to overcoming information asymmetries.The financial system of the euro area after two years with the euroLet me now turn to the major changes of the financial system in the euro area after two years with theeuro.Financial market integrationThe launch of the euro on 1 January 1999 was a historic event. Eleven national currencies wereconverted into one single currency overnight. Greece became the twelfth EU Member State to adopt
BIS Review 48/20013the single currency on 1 January 2001. The newly created currency area of the twelve participatingEuropean Union Member States has a considerable weight in the world economy. It accounts foraround 20% of world GDP and world exports. The successful launch of the euro, which is a keyelement in the creation of a stable and prosperous Europe, has boosted the integration of financialmarkets in the euro area. This process of integration in European financial markets coincided with thetrends towards globalisation and securitisation. Other factors, among a wide range, which shape thefinancial system are historically determined characteristics, technological innovations, monetary andfiscal policies and specific legal and accounting systems that differ from country to country.Evidence of integration can be found, to varying degrees, in all parts of the financial system. The euroarea money market is among the most integrated parts of the financial system. The conduct of onecommon monetary policy in the euro area brought about immediate integration of the unsecuredsegments of the money market, mainly the interbank market and the short-term derivatives market.The secured segments of the money market, that is the repo market and the markets for short-termsecurities, are also increasingly integrated, but they still suffer from underlying problems with themanagement of collateral. Nonetheless, the outlook is promising. The euro area bond market has alsodeveloped rapidly. Notably, the private segments of the euro area bond market have flourished sincethe introduction of the euro. The amount outstanding of long-term debt securities issued by the privatesector was 22% higher at the end of 2000 compared with the end of 1998. Probably the mostsignificant development has been the rapid growth in the euro-denominated corporate bond market,which has increased several-fold in size since the launch of the euro and is now characterised byissues of above EUR 1 billion. EMU has also stimulated integration in the stock markets in the euroarea, where structural developments have been dominated by a series of high-profile mergers andattempted mergers.Regulatory frameworkThe rapid growth achieved by European securities markets has taken place notwithstanding remainingregulatory obstacles to their integration. The European authorities are fully aware of the need toaddress this problem. Several obstacles have been identified in the recent Report of the Committee ofWise Men, chaired by Alexandre Lamfalussy. The Committee proposes to speed up the removal ofimpediments through the institutionalisation of two new regulatory committees for securities markets,which should allow for an increased harmonisation of securities regulation and less burdensomeprocedures for adapting Community rules to rapidly changing financial markets.Another essential European initiative was the adoption by the Commission, in May 1999, of aprogramme for the completion of the Single Market for financial services. This programme, theFinancial Services Action Plan, lists a series of measures with indicative priorities and timetables. Theproject considered as a whole and its inherent philosophy are capable of enhancing economic growth.In this perspective, a handful of specific initiatives deserve a particular mention. A first initiative is theadoption of the European Company Statutes, which is essential to enhance the level-playing fieldbetween European firms and to provide a suitable legal framework for transnational conglomerates. Asecond important aspect is the Risk Capital Action Plan, which would help redirect financial flowstowards fast-growing small and medium-sized enterprises. Let me also mention the last four initiatives,namely the e-commerce policy for financial services; the harmonisation of rules on the accountingrequirements for European companies; the takeover bids Directive; and finally the removal ofaccounting, legal and fiscal discrepancies hindering the cross-border use of collateral. A EuropeanDirective on this subject should be adopted in 2003.Many of these initiatives may appear to be unimportant and somewhat "esoteric" regulatory changes.However, they can provide a real boost to the smooth operation of markets and, therefore, toeconomic growth. For example, obstacles to the cross-border use of collateral prevent the furthercross-border integration and consolidation of clearing and settlement infrastructures, thus hinderingthe integration of European money, bond and equity markets. A smooth electronic integration oftrading, clearing and settlement operations would help reduce transaction costs substantially. Thegradual dismantling of regulatory obstacles to remaining market integration in Europe will contribute toenhancing their depth and efficiency, in turn contributing to an improved allocation of funds to the mostprofitable investment opportunities, and thus supporting economic growth.
4BIS Review 48/2001What is the role of monetary policy and central banks?Price stabilityThe interaction between financial markets, economic growth and monetary policy is by no means anew issue for central bankers. However, financial market developments have brought the question tothe forefront of the policy debate. The continued integration and deepening of financial markets is asignificant issue for policy-makers, and particularly for central bankers, since smoothly functioning andefficient financial markets are crucial in ensuring a smooth transmission of monetary impulses.The best contribution that monetary policy can make to the smooth functioning and integration ofEuropean financial markets and to economic growth is to maintain a steady medium-term pricestability orientation. Such a policy will be beneficial, as it will minimise the adverse effects of inflationand high inflation uncertainty. As we all know, price stability is beneficial in numerous ways. It not onlycreates a climate for higher economic activity over the medium term, but also reduces the economicand social inequalities caused by the asymmetric distribution of the costs of inflation among thevarious economic agents. In addition, in an environment of low inflationary expectations, inflation riskpremia become relatively less important as a determinant of financial prices. As a result, other factorssuch as credit risk can play a larger role in the price formation mechanism. Ultimately, this results in amore efficient allocation of financial resources.The approach of focusing on price stability is by now the conventional wisdom in industrialisedcountries. In the case of Europe, this consensus on the contribution of price stability in the mediumterm to promoting long-term growth is explicitly enshrined in the Statute of the ESCB, which statesunambiguously that "the primary objective of the ESCB shall be to maintain price stability in themedium term." The ECB is convinced that by rigorously fulfilling this mandate, monetary policy ismaking its most effective contribution to the realisation of strong output growth and satisfactoryemployment prospects.Financial stability and the role of central banks in banking supervisionAlso the design of prudential regulation plays an important role from a growth perspective. Supervisionis the guardian of financial stability, which in turn crucially determines the capability of the financialsystem to allocate resources efficiently and absorb liquidity shocks. Financial crises can have a deepand protracted impact on economic growth, as illustrated by several episodes of financial instabilitythat occurred in many countries. The contribution of prudential supervision to economic growthproceeds along two dimensions. From a preventive perspective, supervision has to ensure acontinuous and comprehensive monitoring of all the potential threats to financial stability. The role ofsupervision is also crucial after the emergence of a crisis, in order to provide for a swift and orderedresolution. Supervisors can only be effective in these two respects if they are able to pay sufficientattention to systemic issues, namely the risk of contagion effects. In order to address this issue in aneffective way, they should be able to bridge the gap between information of a micro-prudential nature,namely information on the safety and soundness of individual institutions, and macro-prudentialanalysis, which encompasses all activities aimed at monitoring the exposure to systemic risk and atidentifying potential threats to financial stability arising from macroeconomic or financial developments.This line of argument would support a large role for central banks in supervision, since they havetraditionally played a large role in macro-prudential analysis and the preservation of financial stabilityand they have acquired a strong expertise in this field. Furthermore, smooth access of central banksto micro-prudential information would also be profitable from the perspective of another traditionalcentral banking task, namely the oversight of payment systems.In spite of these arguments supporting a large role of central banks in supervision, the debate hasremained broadly inconclusive in the economic literature so far, owing to the existence of oppositeconsiderations. The first important argument against a large role for central banks is the so-called"conglomeration argument", which crucially relies on the idea of a blurring of distinction betweenbanking, insurance and securities firms. In order to preserve the level-playing field, all segments of thefinancial industry would have to be supervised under the aegis of a common supervisor. According tothis line of reasoning, this "umbrella" could not be the central bank, since the latter is traditionally incharge of supervising monetary organisations. I will not embark upon a thorough analysis of this issuenow. Let me just say that I am convinced that this argument has lost relevance in the current context
BIS Review 48/20015characterised by a more market-based conduct of supervision – which alleviates the level-playing fieldconcern - and by an increased relevance of systemic risk issues.The second major argument against a large involvement of central banks in supervision is the allegedconflict of interest between monetary policy and prudential supervision. Many authors have arguedthat the institution in charge of monetary policy cannot be entrusted with supervision, because themonetary policy stance would be "contaminated" by supervisory issues, for instance the need tosafeguard the liquidity of individual banks.The advent of the euro, however, has shifted the balance of arguments decisively in favour of a largeinvolvement of national central banks (NCBs) in supervision, for two main reasons. First, the argumentof a conflict of interest between monetary policy and prudential supervision becomes irrelevant withinthe euro area, where supervisory responsibilities are at the national level. Since the geographicaljurisdictions of monetary policy and prudential supervision no longer coincide, NCBs in charge ofprudential supervision are shielded from the traditional conflict of interest.The second key factor is the increased relevance of systemic risk since the advent of the euro. Thenature and scope of systemic risk have changed in a decisive way. A first decisive evolution is thegrowing integration of European financial markets in the euro area. As I have already mentioned, theinterbank market, especially the unsecured segment, is already fully unified across the area owing tothe disappearance of the currency risk and the connection of national real-time gross settlementsystems via TARGET, the large-value cross-border payment system of the Eurosystem. A second keyevolution from the perspective of systemic risk is the growing merger and acquisition activity and thetrend towards the emergence of financial conglomerates in Europe, which has, for instance, beenidentified in a recent G10 report on consolidation in the financial sector. In this new environment,financial institutions are increasingly involved in intricate networks of counterparties in the interbankmarket and via payment and settlement systems, and the impact an unwinding of their positions couldhave on asset prices becomes even more ambiguous. These interrelations have a more internationalcharacter than before the advent of the euro, which implies that supervision has to pay much moreattention to euro area-wide developments. The national central banks of the euro area have acomparative advantage in this field owing to their responsibilities over payment and settlementsystems, their traditional focus on systemic risk and their role as components of the Eurosystem.My conclusion is that the successful pursuance of financial stability in Europe, which is a prerequisitefor economic growth, could benefit considerably if NCBs maintain and even reinforce their role inprudential supervision. The debate on the organisation of banking supervision seems to be taking adifferent course for the moment at least in a few euro area countries. Institutional arrangements basedon a single supervisory authority for the financial systems as a whole seem to have gained momentumover the past months in some euro area countries like Ireland and Finland, and also in your country,Austria, where a single supervisor for banking, insurance, securities and staff pension funds(Pensionskassen) should be established early 2002 according to the recent draft Financial MarketSupervisory Authority Act ("Finanzmarktaufsichtgesetz").At first sight, this evolution runs counter to the need for a larger involvement of NCBs in prudentialsupervision. However, in this field implementation details are crucial. In particular, it is crucial thateffective provisions for a close co-operation and a smooth exchange of information between theseparate supervisory authority and the NCB are laid down. NCBs should in any case be entrusted withthe task of safeguarding financial stability of the system as a whole and endowed with the instrumentsneeded to pursue such an objective effectively. In this respect, an extensive operational involvementof NCBs in the conduct of prudential supervision is a key factor.ConclusionsIn concluding, I believe it is fair to say that EMU has already had a profound impact on the process ofEU financial integration. The impact of the introduction of the euro as a single currency of twelveMember States has created the potential for large, deep and liquid euro-denominated financialmarkets, which should help to deliver high rates of output and employment growth in the euro areaeconomy. This transformation in the financial and economic landscape entails certain potential risks,but it will provide many opportunities for enhanced efficiency and growth in the financial markets andeconomies in the euro area. I am convinced that the latter will prevail.

BIS Review 47/20011The Rt Hon Sir Edward George: The economic prospectSpeech by The Rt Hon Sir Edward George, Governor of the Bank of England, at the JiJi Press LondonTop Seminar, London, 30 May 2001.*      *      *Mr Chairman, I am delighted to join you today for this Jiji Top Seminar and to have this opportunity tomeet with so many senior representatives of the Japanese business – and financial–community herein the UK.I have chosen to speak in my opening remarks on "The Economic Prospect", which today more thanever means the international economic prospect. But before I come to the immediate situation, let mesay just a few words about what it is that we are all trying to achieve through our overall approach toeconomic management, which can perhaps best be summed up as "macro-economic stability andsupply-side flexibility" – though that characterisation needs elaboration.On the macro-economic side we have learned – and it has taken some countries longer thanothers – that you cannot achieve what we are all trying to achieve – sustained growth, high levels ofemployment and rising living standards – simply by pumping up demand in our economies throughexpansionary monetary and fiscal policies without proper regard to the underlying supply-side capacityof our economies to meet that demand. Short-term demand management through monetary policy toooften led instead to accelerating inflation, and increasing external deficits, which had then eventually tobe brought under control through recession – an absolute recipe for short-termism in both financialand business behaviour. Equally, excessive public expenditure – which had ultimately to be financedthrough higher taxation – imposed burdens on the private sector which weakened its capacity togenerate employment and income and wealth.So the emphasis now, throughout the industrial world but increasingly too in the developing, emergingand transition economies, is on effective price stability as the immediate objective of macro-economicpolicy – not simply as an end in itself but as a measure of the balance between aggregate demandand underlying supply in the economy as a whole. In effect the aim of monetary policy in particular isto moderate, rather than aggravate, the economic cycle, and so to provide the basis for sustainablegrowth at around the underlying rate of growth of productive, supply-side, potential. And the emphasisnow in relation to fiscal policy is to limit public sector borrowing, and the outstanding level of publicsector debt, to levels that can be sustained into the medium and longer term without the need forincreasing tax burdens or the imposition of rising real interest rates on the private sector.Of course on occasion the flesh proves to be weaker than the spirit – and achieving thesemacro-economic objectives is not easy in practice even as a technical matter. But the intention – theinternational commitment to macro-economic stability – is clear.Acceptance of the aim of macro-economic stability served to bring into sharper focus the structural,supply side, of the economy – that is the whole raft of influences that can affect the underlying growthrate of capacity and thus the growth rate of aggregate demand that can be sustained.And here, too, there has been a strengthening international presumption in favour of open marketsand free competition – both domestically and internationally – with a continuing strong presumptionagainst predatory trade or exchange rate manipulation. The justification is that undistorted competitioncontributes to potential global economic growth through increased efficiency and the more effectiveallocation of productive resources. Faster growth in turn provides a more favourable context foraddressing social concerns, including the issue of poverty.The international presumption in favour of free markets in itself is somewhat remarkable, given that, atthe micro-economic level, increased competition invariably constitutes a threat to establishedproducers – and their employees – who might well be tempted to urge protection in one form oranother on their national governments. Consumers, who benefit from such competition, tend to be lessvocal or well organised. The threat of protectionism is never, therefore, far away. But in fact thepresumption in favour of competition has proved encouragingly robust. And that is not just in relationto international trade. There is a parallel presumption in favour of freedom of capital movements, andmuch greater openness around the world to foreign investment.
2BIS Review 47/2001Among other things on the supply-side, there is a shared emphasis on the need to direct publicspending to developing human resources through education and training, to effective health care, andaffordable social safety nets. There has been a global trend to privatisation through whichgovernments have increasingly returned essentially commercial activities, in which they have nonecessary comparative advantage, to market disciplines. And there is a common recognition of theneed for reforms in labour and product markets designed to remove unnecessary regulation, and toreduce distortions, which impede the efficient allocation of resources.But broad agreement on the principles, does not make them any easier to apply in practice. This isevident from the imbalances which have built up within and between the major industrial countries inrecent years. It is uncertainty as to how those imbalances are likely to be corrected that underliesmuch of the current concern about the prospects for the global economy.The major uncertainty relates to the situation in the United States which has experienced a period ofexceptionally strong economic growth with relatively low inflation until quite recently. Briefly – and nodoubt oversimply – this very strong performance is widely seen as driven largely by exceptionalproductivity gains, as the application of new information and communications technologies spreadthrough the economy. This development promised a higher sustainable rate of growth in the USeconomy and higher corporate earnings growth. That expectation contributed to a rapid rise in equityprices, especially in the "high tech" sectors, which in turn helped stimulate both business investment inthe US and consumer demand causing the private sector to move into financial deficit. It also attractedmassive direct and portfolio investment inflows from abroad which over-financed an increasing currentaccount deficit in the US and caused the dollar to strengthen against other currencies. By the first halfof last year the US economy was expanding at a rate of over 5%, which even on the most optimisticview of underlying productivity growth was clearly unsustainable. The pace of demand growth in theUS needed to slowdown – as of course it has.The big questions now are about the extent of the slowdown and how long it will last. And the reality isthat no one can be confident that they know the answers.What we do know is that the US data on the whole have not so far been as weak as manycommentators predicted. Consumer spending in particular has held up reasonably well, though therehas been a fall-off in investment growth, as well as a sharp downwards stocks adjustment and anassociated decline in US imports. On an optimistic view, if consumption continues to hold up, andassuming that the recent underlying productivity gains can be maintained, investment spending willrecover as the spread of ICT through the economy resumes, and the downward stock adjustment willcome to an end.On this view we can look forward to a pick up in US activity as we move, say, into next year. But thepessimist is inclined to point to the weakness of private sector saving, which could induce morecautious consumer behaviour especially if unemployment continues to rise; he points to a possibleoverhang of past investment excesses; and he points to the US external deficit which will at somepoint need to be corrected. These adjustments might take place gradually over time, in which case theUS might face a more protracted period of relatively slow growth; or, if you are really pessimistic, theadjustments might be more abrupt implying a possible period of negative growth and global financialinstability. The recent somewhat erratic recovery of US stock markets from their earlier gloomsuggests that they are beginning to side with the optimists; some of the survey evidence of consumerand business confidence on the other hand still supports a rather more pessimistic view. For what it isworth, and given the strong policy response in the US, I am modestly optimistic, but I recognise thedownside risks. The outcome is obviously the major uncertainty surrounding the global economicprospect, and policymakers elsewhere can only monitor, continuously and very closely, the emergingevidence and react to that in the light of its likely impact on their own situation.The US slowdown comes at a particularly bad time for Japan which is already suffering from acombination of weak domestic demand – particularly consumer demand – and supply-side constraintsreflecting pressures on the banking system, heavily burdened with non-performing loans, and anacknowledged need for restructuring parts of the non-financial sector. Japan has pretty well exhaustedthe scope for macro-economic stimulus. Successive fiscal packages focussed on public works, and asustained period of attempted monetary expansion, at near-zero interest rates in the face of deflation,have failed to overcome a high rate of precautionary saving by an ageing population facing anuncertain economic future. The policy emphasis of the new Japanese administration appears to beshifting towards firmer action to bring about supply-side reform in the belief that this will help toengender greater confidence. The danger is that, to the extent that more aggressive restructuring
BIS Review 47/20013results in bank ruptcies and higher unemployment in the short term, that in itself might tend to weakenconsumer demand for a time before the benefits of the restructuring come through. I make nojudgement about the prospects in Japan. You certainly are better placed to do that than I am!Closer to home in this country, the Euro area economy is a good deal better placed to withstand theUS slowdown, although we are all bound to be affected to some degree. For most of last year theEuro area economy performed relatively strongly, with overall output growth well above trend, andunemployment in the area as a whole continuing to fall from its earlier chronically high level.A problem, of course, was the persistent weakness of the Euro in foreign exchange markets, despitestrong "fundamentals" in terms of conventional analysis. This was largely the result of an outflow ofcapital, much of it drawn into the US by the magnetic attraction of prospective corporate earningsgrowth – and apparently continuing despite the US slowdown.The euro's weakness gave rise to widespread – but in my view unjustified – criticism of the ECB. Thetask of a central bank operating an independent monetary policy is necessarily a limited task, not leastbecause it effectively has only one instrument – its control over short-term interest rates. Its role – as Isaid earlier – is essentially, to use that instrument to influence aggregate demand in the economy, withthe aim of keeping demand broadly in line with the supply-side capacity of the economy. The measureof its success is consistently low inflation. Against that criterion the ECB has been relativelysuccessful. The Euro area economy has grown, above trend, with core inflation neverthelessremaining within the tolerance range of 0-2%, even though on the headline measure, influenced byrising oil prices and the weaker exchange rate, inflation has for the time being moved above the top ofthat range. The ECB would have put that internal stability of the Euro area as a who le at risk if it hadattempted at the same time to use monetary policy to target the euro's exchange rate, which is whatimplicitly many of its critics were effectively suggesting that it should do.The more recent criticism has been that the ECB has been slow to respond to the weakening of theUS economy. Implicit in that criticism is no doubt a judgement about the extent and duration of the USslowdown and its likely impact on the euro area. As I have said there is a great deal of uncertaintyabout that.But the ECB has to take account, too, of domestic demand pressures in the euro area, and of the factthat even on the core measure Euro area inflation has been moving up gradually towards the top ofthe ECB's 0-2% range. Frankly I don't see how anyone can be confident whether the ECB has itprecisely right or wrong – it is perfectly normal for even the best-informed people to disagree on thesejudgements, as anyone who reads our own Monetary Policy Committee meeting minutes will tell you.But, as it showed just recently in making a modest reduction in interest rates, the ECB is sensitive tochanges in the balance of risks around those judgements.So, too, are we in the United Kingdom. In our case we have been fortunate, since being driven out ofthe ERM in 1992 and moving to a symmetrical inflation target, in enjoying a sustained period ofrelatively stable economic growth. In fact we've experienced the longest period of continuous quarterby quarter growth since quarterly records began, with average annual growth at around 3% over thewhole period compared with our long term trend rate of 2¼-2½%. Employment has steadily increased,and unemployment has fallen to its lowest level for 25 years. Meanwhile the rate of inflation has beenconsistently relatively close either side of the Government's 2½% target – the lowest and most stablerate of inflation that most of us in this country can remember. Domestic demand growth in the UK hasremained relatively robust into this year, but we too are affected by the US slowdown and by theassociated weakening of equity prices. And we have had a new problem of our own in the form of Footand Mouth Disease, the effects of which have gone a good deal wider than just the agricultural sector.These new developments were likely to have a dampening effect on overall demand pressure withinthe economy, both through their direct impact and through possible damaging effects on confidence.Given the fact that we started from a position in which inflation was below target (and expected toremain so for some period ahead); and given only modest upward pressure – at least so far – onwages and earnings growth, despite the continuing tightness in the labour market; we have judged, onthe information so far available to us, that we needed to reduce interest rates by ¾% in order tocushion the impact of the global slowdown and meet the inflation target further ahead.Of course I am well aware that a stable overall macro-economy does not – and cannot – mean equallystable economic conditions for every individual sector or individual business. A particular complicationover the past few years has been the surprisingly persistent strength of sterling's exchange rateagainst the euro, itself a reflection of the puzzling more general weakness of the European currency.This has contributed to an uncomfortable imbalance within the UK economy primarily between the
4BIS Review 47/2001euro-exposed sectors, which have been under consistent pressure, and the domestically-orientedsectors, which have by and large been doing relatively well. Understandably the suffering sectors andbusinesses – and I know that they include some Japanese companies operating in this country – tendto complain that monetary policy takes too little account of their position, often pointing out thatinflation has for the past two years fallen somewhat below the target. The implication is that monetarypolicy has been tighter – interest rates have been higher – than was necessary, which, they say, inturn at least helps to explain the behaviour of the exchange rate.I have genuine sympathy with their concerns, and I very much admire the huge efforts that many ofthe adversely affected businesses have made to overcome the disadvantage coming from the strongexchange rate. If it's any comfort, I can assure you, that the resulting imbalance within the economyhas been a persistent pre-occupation also for us on the MPC.We necessarily, of course, take account of the exchange rate in trying to predict the future course ofthe economy. Its strength against the euro has been a factor which has dampened both externaldemand and the rate of inflation, so that interest rates have certainly been lower than they would havebeen if the exchange rate had been weaker. It is nevertheless true that, in common with most otheranalysts, we have not fully anticipated the persistence of euro weakness.We don't of course have a crystal ball – but even if we had, it is important to recognise that the linkbetween relative interest rates and exchange rates is much more complicated – and indeed moreunpredictable – than is often suggested. Our own exchange rate against the euro today, for example,is stronger than it was before our reductions in interest rates this year; and the dollar, too, issubstantially stronger against the euro than it was before the much larger cuts in US interest rates. So,in setting interest rates, we can – and do – make allowance in our projections for what has happened,and, on a best guess, for what is likely to happen, to the exchange rate, and that may cause theexchange rate to soften or it may cause domestic demand growth to strengthen, thereby offsetting theexchange rate's dampening effect on the economy. But what we cannot do – any more than theECB – is to target the exchange rate, without putting the stability of the economy as a whole at risk ofre-emerging inflation. That would not be in the interests even of the internationally-exposed sectors ofthe economy except possibly in the short term. They operate in the same labour market as moredomestically-oriented businesses; and what matters to them is the real, rather than the nominalexchange rate, and it is not at all clear how that would be affected.Mr Chairman, given the uncertainties, I am reluctant to speculate as to how, precisely, the presentimbalances within and between the major industrial economies will work themselves out, as theynecessarily will over time. But, notwithstanding the current difficulties, I am convinced that the bestprospect for a relatively happy ending is for all of us to persist in our attempts to achieve the macro-economic stability and supply-side flexibility which I identified as our common goal at the outset of myremarks.I am very happy now to take your questions.
BIS Review 46/20011Ernst Welteke: The effect of the euro on the German economy – A view fromthe Deutsche BundesbankSpeech by Mr Ernst Welteke, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, to the German-British Chamberof Industry and Commerce in London on 29 May 2001.*      *      *Ladies and Gentleman,It is a pleasure for me to speak to such a distinguished audience today here in London. You may wishto hear about the effects of the euro on the German economy, and I very much appreciate theopportunity to present my views on this.Economic relations between the not-yet-euro zone country United Kingdom and the already-euro zonecountry Germany are strong. Thus, you may be glad to hear that, judging from today’s perspective, theeuro project is a success (story) for Germany on the whole. There is, however, no denying somework-in-progress aspects to the European Monetary Union itself and to Germany’s role therein. I shalltry to provide you with a balanced picture of Germany in the year three of the euro era.Melting eleven local currencies into a single currency is a once-in-a-century project. Thanks toextensive preparations by the European Central Bank, its predecessor organisation the EuropeanMonetary Institute and eleven National Central Banks, there were no major technical glitches. Thus,technically the changeover was a non-event for the general public. The smooth transition then gaveway to a successful start of a true European monetary policy.In the ECB Governing Council, we cherish what we call the “Spirit of the Governing Council”. This is tosay, my colleagues and I feel and decide as Europeans. We do not regard ourselves as nationaldelegates. Rather, we unequivocally pursue the interests of the euro area as a whole. I don’t mindadmitting that we are proud of this spirit. What makes us all the more proud is that monetary policy isup to now the only area in European politics where European interests clearly predominate overnational interests.The European Central Bank is unique in many respects. The ECB is independent, and has itsindependence guaranteed in the EU Treaty. The Treaty also stipulated the maintenance of pricestability as the primary goal of monetary policy. The European System of Central Banks defines pricestability as a change in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices of less than 2 %. In 1999, with aninflation rate of 1.1 %, that objective was met with ease. Today, the European Central Bank – morethan 300 years younger than the Bank of England – has already successfully established a reputationfor guaranteeing price stability in the euro zone. The three-year-period from 1998 to 2000 saw anaverage rate of inflation of 1.1 %. This early euro-period is remarkable: it was one of the three mostoutstanding periods of price stability performance in Germany since the 1950s.Since last summer high energy costs, in part linked to the external value of the euro, and demandshifts due to the European food crisis have taken their toll. Thus, from today’s point of view, it looksprobable that in 2001 we will not be able to meet our target of holding inflation below the 2 % ceiling.However, on May 10, the Governing Council decided to lower official interest rates by 25 basis points.The interest rate for the main refinancing operation is now 4.5 %. This decision was based on the two-pillar strategy, i.e. monetary growth in the first pillar and the broader assessment of the outlook forprice developments in the second pillar.In the period since last spring, monetary growth came ever closer to the reference value of 4.5 %.Furthermore, indications that monetary growth is somewhat overstated have been confirmed recently.Non-euro area residents’ purchases of negotiable paper included in M3 – that is money market fundunits and other marketable paper – are sizeable as well as rising. However, the relevant concept ofM3 is residents’ holdings. Once these distortions are accounted for, the first pillar indicates no furtherrisks for price stability.The second pillar also points in the direction of receding upward risks for price stability. Externaldevelopments are dampening the prospects for euro-area growth. Wages are rising, but onlymoderately.
2BIS Review 46/2001On balance, both pillars of the ECB’s monetary strategy paint a rather favourable picture for themedium-term outlook for price stability. Thus, we are confident that the HICP will drop below the 2 %threshold during the course of the next year.In the run-up to European Monetary Union, prices in those European countries with a history of higherinflation rates had been remarkably stable. All countries met the inflation criterion with ease. Recently,the sustainability of this monetary convergence process has been questioned. The spread betweenthe lowest and the highest inflation rates in the euro area is now wider than it was at the outset ofmonetary union. In January 1998, this difference reached a low of 0.7 %. By the year 2000, the gaphad widened to 3.5 %. France, at 1.8 %, and Ireland, at 5.3 %, showed the lowest and the highestoutcome, respectively. However, this method of measuring convergence is somewhat simplistic, as itdoes not take the economic weight of individual countries into account.Even more importantly, it may well be necessary to allow for significant gaps in individual inflationrates in a process in which some euro-area countries are catching up on living standards. As thesecountries typically enjoy high rates of productivity increases in the tradeable goods sector due tohigher competition, enterprises are able to pay higher wages, which also lifts wage demands in thenon-tradeables sector. Thus, the general price level is rising faster than in more advanced memberstates of the euro area. This so-called Balassa-Samuelson-Effect indicates real convergence. Inferringincreasing divergence in the euro area would be to misinterpret the facts.From the very beginning, the ESCB has successfully built its reputation as a defender of price stability.Hence, inflation expectations converged at the low end of the range during the run-up to EMU.Consequently, the gap in capital market interest rates shrank enormously. In 1995, the yielddifferential in government bonds was 550 basis points. Now it is 55 basis points. Expectations of lowfuture inflation make for a low cost of capital. Today the remaining spreads in long-term rates reflectdifferences in liquidity of the issues and in creditworthiness of issuers. In such an environmentinvestment activity, that is growth, can thrive.There is a convergence dividend that comes in various forms. First, think of countries with a history ofhigh long-term interest rates and high government debt. Falling costs for servicing their public debt isthe main benefit for those countries. Then, think of countries like Germany, that have long beenprofiting from a stability culture. For us, the benefit is less obvious. Our convergence dividend comesin the form of increased macroeconomic stability in our neighbouring countries, which are our mostimportant trading partners.So the euro triggered important and beneficial developments even before it was a usable currency.Now, in the year three of the euro era, the process of getting used to the new currency is welladvanced at the enterprise level. In terms of value, euro-area enterprises denominate 40 % of theirinternational non-cash-transactions in euro. In Germany, the figure is even higher, at 45 % ofinternational transactions. As for domestic transactions, companies’ euro-denominated paymentsaccount for nearly one-fifth in terms of value. If the payments in terms of value are compared to themuch lower figure in terms of volume, then we see that the euro still tends to be a currency forwholesale payments. We expect this to change during the course of this year.In contrast to enterprises, the consumer tends to be a little bit of a laggard when it comes to using theeuro for payments – which comes as no surprise. The advent of euro coins and notes in 216 days willbring a tremendous change in consumers’ attitude towards the euro. Consumers will be able to pay fora taxi ride in their domestic currency in many European capitals and they will be able to compareprices quoted in their home currency all over the euro area. They will hold euros and cents in their ownhands on January 1st.Let me give you some figures on the logistical challenge of the euro changeover. 2.6 billionDeutschmark notes have to be retired. They could be stacked up to a pile about 180 miles high.Once the changeover has been accomplished, the euro will finally become reality for the man in thestreet. People will then experience the stable new currency as equal or even better in domestic useand undoubtedly as superior in international use. We expect this to boost confidence rapidly.The international financial community already makes ready use of the euro as a store of value. Todayone-third of all international debt securities are euro-denominated. This constitutes a ten-percentagepoint gain over the aggregated share of the predecessor currencies at the start of Stage Three. Thesituation is similar with regard to international bank assets, of which 22 % are now denominated ineuro, implying a six-percentage point gain over the situation at the outset of EMU.
BIS Review 46/20013The increasing international use of the euro owes much to the integration of major parts of theEuropean financial markets. The wholesale market for interbank liquidity is now actually one singleEuropean money market. The same holds true for the bond market. Increased size of average issuesand elevated activity of private issuers indicate gains in efficiency in allocating capital all over Europe.Those parts of the financial markets that are crucial for the transmission of the Eurosystem’s monetarypolicy are already working to our satisfaction.However, some segments of the financial markets still have a long way to go until they can beregarded as fully integrated. Securitised money markets and stock markets are among them.Differences in legal frameworks as well as in clearing and settlement systems are the usual suspectsand, indeed, these are the major actors in the impediment play.The process of translating European legislation into national law, making securities market lawscompatible among the members of the European Union, is currently progressing in slow motion.Fortunately, progress towards integrated securities markets is in the offing. The “Committee of WiseMan” chaired by Monsieur Lamfalussy has drafted an ambitious plan to speed up the legislativeprocess of the EU Commission’s “Financial Services Action Plan”. This plan aims to create a fullyintegrated financial market in Europe by 2005. Priorities set in the Lamfalussy plan will bring us anintegrated and competitive European securities market as early as 2003.Private sector action is called for as well. Efficient transnational clearing and settlement systems forsecurities are a precondition for fully overcoming the fragmentation of European securities markets.Currency segmentation is no longer an obstacle, and investor behaviour is adapting to a trulyEuropean financial market. In this environment the process of consolidation in clearing and settlementsystems should accelerate in the very near term. Recent cooperation and merger activities are anencouraging step in this direction.What has all this got to do with Germany? The introduction of the euro and the concomitantdevelopments in financial markets opened several windows of opportunity for our economy.Admittedly, not everything that has evolved and improved in the financial sphere in Germany duringthe last couple of years is directly linked to the introduction of the euro. But try to get a feeling of whatit is like for the financial industry to have a new common currency in Europe.We have seen an “equity culture” evolving in Germany that nobody would have deemed possible in1995. One in five Germans today owns shares, in 1995 the ratio was one in ten. Thus, ordinary peopletoday take an interest in the discussion of business and economic topics. Would this really be the caseif it weren’t for the euro?We have seen vigorous cross-border merger and acquisitions activity in recent years. M & A within theeuro area is no longer an issue of correctly assessing long-term exchange-rate developments. Thereis an expectation that product markets – at least for big-ticket items – will integrate further once theeuro is legal tender. German enterprises are setting out to compete in the European market byrealising economies of both scale and scope together with European partners.We have seen a euro-denominated corporate bond market developing quickly since the outset ofEMU. German enterprises actively play this market. From the perspective of a German corporation,the number of people who may wish to buy a corporate bond in their home currency has risenthreefold.The volume of outstanding corporate bonds of domestic issuers set out from a rather low level. Itincreased by 53 % in 1999 and, with an increase of 116 %, more than doubled in 2000. The hugeissues of the telecom sector following the UMTS licence auctions lie behind part of last year’sexpansion.Liquidity in this segment of the capital market is clearly on the rise, making it more attractive for bothpotential issuers and potential creditors. We are seeing the emergence of a kind of new “credit culture”besides the new “equity culture”. Investors are complementing their fixed-income portfolios ofgovernment bonds and bank obligations by buying corporate bonds.The flip side of this coin is called “disintermediation”. Germany, as you all know, is well known for itsbank-centred system of corporate finance. With corporations taking advantage of the opportunity toraise funds directly in a larger market due to the new single currency, we are now moving towards abetter balanced two-pillar-system.At the same time, we have seen advances in the consolidation of the German banking sector. This isboth a notable and an important development. While the wholesale market in banking today is a rather
4BIS Review 46/2001integrated European market, the retail market is still fragmented. You all know about the Germanbanking system with its three pillars of commercial banks, local savings banks and regional creditco-operatives. Merger activity in the latter two groups has continued to be vigorous, reducing thenumber of institutions last year by 8%. The number of branches, however, was down only 3 %.In Germany, we have a ratio of residents to outlets of 1,777, which – I admit – is rather high, at least ifcompared to Great Britain, where one branch theoretically serves twice as many customers. Thesenumbers somewhat overstate the efficiency gains to be had from further consolidation. If we look atbank employment, we see a different picture. The ratio of employees per 1,000 residents is morecomparable in our two countries. In Germany, 9.2 bank employees serve 1,000 residents, while inGreat Britain, you have to content yourselves with 8.3 employees. Size and business strategies of thebanks lie behind these differences.Information and communication technologies are advancing rapidly. Internet banking is on the rise, inpart replacing traditional outlets in an environment in which all major banks are pursuing a multi-channel sales strategy. Ten million bank accounts in Germany are now held with online banks. That isan increase of 45 % over the year before and makes for a share of 12 %. This trend is continuingunabated, and at the same time demand is shifting away from bricks-and-mortar outlets. Consolidationin banks’ branch networks will accelerate further. Technology and the quest for economies of scaleare also behind many of the mergers among smaller financial institutions.At the European level, merger activity in the banking sector picked up markedly in 1998, the very yearpreceding the introduction of the euro. It may well take some time until we reach the point where wewill have one single integrated financial market in Europe. But there can be no doubt that the euro is apowerful instrument for getting us there – be it sooner or a little later. Large financial institutions arepreparing for this situation by trying to find suitable partners in the euro area.So you see, the introduction of the euro has entailed important developments in the financial sector inGermany. Our model of stakeholder capitalism is being enhanced by elements of the Anglo-Saxonmodel of financial markets. This is good news for our economy, insofar as incentives are beingadjusted.Now, what about the impact of the euro on the real economy in Germany? Admittedly, it is notpossible to isolate the effects of the single currency on one national economy in Europe from thediverse and permanently changing influences to which any economy is exposed. However, we arepretty sure about the direction in which the euro is leading us – and we welcome this trend.When Germany became a co-founder of European Monetary Union, it did so from a very particularsituation. In contrast to many of today’s euro-area states, we enjoyed a high degree of price stability.We had, however, a weak spot in not fully meeting the fiscal convergence criteria due to the high costsof German reunification.When east and west reunited in 1990, a high priority had been given to bridging gaps in income andwelfare. On the whole, these efforts were successful. If the east German states were still lagging atthe outset of EMU, this was in terms of output and productivity rather than in terms of living standards.In 1999, absorption in eastern Germany was about 50 % higher than domestic output. This gapbetween productive capacity and consumption was made possible by huge transfer payments. Hencethe costs.Now that the east German states have been integrated, we are redirecting efforts towards structuralreforms in order to lift potential growth. With a single currency, there is no dodging intensifiedcompetition in Europe. Transparency is higher and will take another leap once the euro is legal tenderand all over the euro area prices are quoted in the home currency of more than 300 million people.The rapid proliferation and application of new information technology will reinforce transparency.Effects are already visible. The auto industry is best known as an example of huge price differences ineuro-area member states for almost identical products. German carmakers are currently discussingthe introduction of a one-price policy for the entire euro-area. Price discrimination is no longer a viableoption for sellers of big-ticket items. Consumers are benefiting directly from this development.Intensified competition is a situation that not only enterprises are facing. The same holds true forgovernments as they seek to position their countries as an attractive business location in an integratedeuro zone. And this brings us back to the issue of structural reform, in which we are pleased that theeuro is playing a role as a catalyst.
BIS Review 46/20015The single currency framework, together with the Stability and Growth Pact, is giving our 6 billion euroeconomy a degree of macroeconomic stability which many countries had never previouslyexperienced. For the majority of the euro-area countries, the main benefit lies in the achievement ofprice stability. Germany is taking advantage of the push towards fiscal consolidation. It is true that lastyear’s general government budget surplus was made possible by one-off proceeds from the UMTSlicence auction amounting to 2.5 % of GDP. But the underlying deficit of 1 % of GDP constitutes aremarkable improvement over the average of the nineties, which were plagued by the post-reunification costs.Today the decision as to where to set up a business in the euro area can be made without having todevote massive attention to exchange-rate considerations. We are now a large economic area, wehave the single market and we have a common currency. Hence other criteria now play a moreprominent role in the choice of business location. Most of them revolve around structural issues. Thisis clearly the economic area in which Germany stands to gain most from the introduction of the euro.And we have already made our first gains. Let me point out three areas, beginning with reforms in theproduct markets. The single market was a major project in the preparations for EMU. An important partof this project was the deregulation of the network industries. The telecom sector, the electricity marketand the gas industry were all freed from regulations which were no longer in keeping with the times.Government monopolies fell, competition arose, prices fell, and consumers now happily enjoy theburden of choice. Especially the telecom deregulation was a major success, not least in terms ofemployment.The second specific field relevant to being an attractive business location is tax policy. As you know,Germany has launched a major reform of income and business taxation, the first stage of which cameinto effect at the beginning of this year. With this reform we made a big leap from the high-tax groupright into the middle field in a ranking by tax rates. Overall efficiency of the economy has beenremarkably improved as the combination of a broader base along with lower rates decreasesdistortions. By contrast, efforts aimed at minimising the individual tax burden are less rewarding.The third field is our pay-as-you-go pension system. We are currently in the process of undertaking amajor overhaul of the public pension system. In this field the single currency is less of a driving forcethan it is a lubricant. Some fifteen minutes ago I told you about the favourable turn European andespecially German financial markets took once the euro was in the offing. The now wider, deeper andmore competitive capital markets provide the perfect environment for the strengthening of the pensionsystem through a new capital funded pillar that recently became law.The area in which the euro still has to work its magic as a catalyst is for a more flexible labour market.This field is lagging other reform projects. Adjusting incentives, reducing regulation and eliminatingrigidities are the instruments of choice for two imminent tasks. First, to lower the employment thresholdof growth, and, second, to lift the growth potential. Thus, labour market reforms will help us to fullyreap the benefits of the integration of our euro area, with its one-sixth share of world GDP.As I have explained, the introduction of the euro has had many healthy effects on the Germaneconomy. On the one hand, Germany is profiting to a considerable extent from the integration offinancial markets. Enterprises now have access to a broader and deeper capital market in theirdomestic currency. Transaction costs are lower and – of course – hedging costs have to be incurredmuch less often.And, on the other hand, the introduction of the euro has considerably heightened what we call“Reformbereitschaft”, that is not exactly reforming zeal, but at least the readiness to carry out reforms.Thus, under the euro framework Germany has become more attractive as a business location. Thesame holds true for our fellow euro countries that adopted the euro.Now, what about the United Kingdom? Are there gains to be had from joining the euro area? Yes,there certainly are. The United Kingdom’s economy is closely linked to the continental economies inEurope in terms of trade, in terms of foreign direct investment and in terms of portfolio investment.The UK and the euro area are the most important trading partners for each other. More than half of UKtrade in goods and services is done with the euro area. Thus, integrating financial markets andproduct markets further by having a common currency makes sense to me. It makes sense for bothsides, so the UK’s joining the euro looks like a mutually beneficial deal. In terms of geography, GreatBritain may well be an island. In terms of economics, it is not.
6BIS Review 46/2001I am in no position to provide the UK with advice in the area of adopting whichever currency scheme.However, in my opinion, due consideration should be given first and foremost to the advantages to behad from joining the European Monetary Union. In Germany we already enjoy those advantages.Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attention..
BIS Review 60/20011Roderick Carr: Banking on capital punishmentSpeech by Dr Roderick M Carr, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, to the NewZealand Association of Economists, Christchurch, New Zealand, 27 June 2001.*      *      *IntroductionIt gives me great pleasure to address the annual gathering of the best and the brightest economists inthe country. Today I am not going to talk to you about the state of the economy or its immediateprospects; these are matters on which you are well informed. Indeed the transparency whichsurrounds the conduct of monetary policy in this country leaves little private information in the hands ofthe central bank. Further, with both a single decision-maker structure and long serving incumbentGovernor, there is little new information to reveal about how the Bank goes about managing monetarypolicy. In fact as the Bank has served as training ground for many commentators and marketeconomists, not only are we transparent but reassuringly predictable. I want to take my time today tostimulate your minds with a different set of issues.At the heart of capitalism lies capital. Limited liability corporations have facilitated the accumulationand mobilisation of capital to rival church and state but as we will see the asymmetry of payoffsinherent in limited liability may induce excessive risk-taking. The provision of financial intermediationservices, particularly banking, has given rise to an extensive theoretical and empirical literature ineconomics. By banking I mean the provision of two particular services, liquidity transformation andcredit origination. The efficient provision of these services is essential to the growth and prosperity ofmarket-based economies. Virtually all banking services are now provided through limited liabilitycorporations and the question of how much capital should be held has become the subject ofinternational debate.Of all the interesting topics we could discuss, today I want to focus on the issue of bank regulation ingeneral and, in particular, bank capital. I want to update you on recent international initiativesconcerning bank regulation and outline both the case for capital regulation and the risks we take whenregulators go too far. I want to highlight why it is essential to the efficient allocation of resources thatproviders of bank capital and even bank creditors must stand ready to take their punishment whenthings go wrong and the unexpected happens. I want to highlight the distinction between economiccapital, rating capital and regulatory capital. I want to promote an antidote to the moral hazard createdby asymmetric payoffs, implicit or explicit deposit insurance and regulatory capture. Finally I want tosummarise recent policy initiatives we have taken to enhance the value of disclosure and underpinmarket discipline.The New Zealand regime in briefLet me briefly remind you of New Zealand's approach to banking supervision. Our regime relies on selfdiscipline, market discipline, and regulatory discipline. Any organisation wishing to call itself a bankwhile carrying on business in New Zealand must obtain a registration from the Reserve Bank. Ourconditions of registration prescribe minimum levels of capital in line with international standards knownas the Basel Accord. We also require mandatory levels of public disclosure. Directors are required toprovide regular public attestations as to the soundness of the bank, the robustness of its systems andits exposure to risk. We monitor these disclosures and meet with all registered banks annually todiscuss strategy and any emerging issues. We rely on external auditors to verify financial statements.By year-end, all registered banks will be required to have and publish a credit rating from an approvedrating agency. Where we depart somewhat from traditional supervisory approaches is in ourreluctance to validate what the directors of the bank are accountable for. We weigh more heavily thanmost the moral hazard arising from the regulator approving specific actions of the board andmanagement of the bank. It is the role of the board and depositors to be satisfied as to the conditionand conduct of the bank, not to rely on the supervisor's ability to constrain bank risk-taking. But let mebe clear – New Zealand does not deny there is a case for bank regulation. But as they say – thedevil's in the detail.
2BIS Review 60/2001Global trends in bank regulationThe draft proposals for the regulation of bank capital recently released by the Basel Committee onBanking Supervision, often referred to as Basel 2, run to nearly 800 pages. These must be one of themost extensive, most prescriptive, transnational regulatory proposals ever conceived. Yet in a recentextensive review of the academic literature Joao Santos of New York University's Solomon Centerconcluded:"The justification for any regulation usually stems from a market failure such as externalities, marketpower or asymmetry of information between buyers and sellers. In the case of banking, there is still noconsensus on whether banks need to be regulated and if so, how they should be regulated."While this conclusion would not go unchallenged, not least by the tens of thousands of peopleemployed as bank regulators around the world, it serves to highlight the wide range of views whichexist about the issue of bank regulation and the extent to which current problems are the result of pastpoor regulation. Let me explain.The 1988 Basel Accord and the new proposalsIn 1988, G10 countries reached a consensus on minimum capital standards for internationally activebanks. The Accord can be summarised in a couple of pages. In essence, it states that for every $100of loans, a bank should have at least $8 of capital, of which at least $4 must be permanent equity.Because loans secured over residential property were seen to be less risky than other loans, they onlyhad to have 50% as much capital. Loans to banks from OECD countries were seen to be less riskystill, so they only had to have 20% as much capital, and loans to governments denominated in theirlocal currency 0%. There were several other categories and treatment for off-balance-sheetexposures.In my view, the 1988 Basel Accord arose mainly from a desire to promote competitive neutrality and toavoid arbitrage between differing national capital requirements for banks, as it did not seek todetermine a socially optimal level of bank capital. In the 1980s, highly leveraged Japanese banks hadbeen aggressive participants in the previously lucrative US municipal bond underwriting market. USbanks responded to what they saw as unfair competition by pressing for an internationally agreeddefinition of capital standards for credit risk and a uniform methodology for the measurement ofcapital. While the 1988 agreement addressed the issue of minimum bank capital, it created a wholenew industry in arbitraging between bank and non-bank capital requirements. Widespreadsecuritisation of bank assets is perhaps the best example. Today the case is made that the 1988Accord promotes regulatory arbitrage of this type, rewarding risk-shifting which may undermine thesoundness of financial systems around the world. The solution, Basel 2, proposes to more closelyalign bank capital with the riskiness of the bank's assets and operations. Subject to signoff by bankregulators, banks may adopt their own models for determining how much capital to hold. In theabsence of approval, a standardised, but more flexible than Basel 1, model is proposed. Marketdiscipline is to be enlisted by requiring greater disclosure of risks facing a bank. While Basel 1 was aCapital Accord, Basel 2 is an accord having three pillars – capital requirements, regulatory validationand market discipline. The real question remains unanswered. Is the closer alignment of regulatorycapital with economic capital good public policy? In validating a particular capital allocation model, doregulators let bank management, bank directors and bank creditors off the hook by, in essence,providing a warrant of fitness for the model and the bank? In order to evaluate the proposals, weshould go back to first principles.The case for regulating bank capitalIs there a case for a country to specify minimum levels of capital which banks should hold? No suchrequirements exist for pharmaceutical companies, software vendors or telecommunications providers,where failure might impose externalities which would actually be life threatening. The fact that banksare risky ventures that go bust from time to time does not alone justify that minimum capital standardsshould be imposed.The traditional case for regulating banks in order to reduce the probability that they might bust is thatwhen depositors see a bank go bust they act in fear and ignorance as to the true condition of all otherbanks. They run to their own bank to be first in line to withdraw deposits and in so doing may force aperfectly sound bank to run out of liquid assets, sell sound assets at a discount and so become
BIS Review 60/20013insolvent. The combination of asymmetric information about the credits created (depositors can notknow the state of the bank's borrowers), the sequential service constraint (all on demand deposits canbe withdrawn in full), and the liquidity transformation services provided by banks (short term depositsfinance long term loans) makes banks inherently vulnerable to a loss of confidence. Further, banksoften borrow from and lend to each other both in the short-term money markets and through thepayment system. Thus, the failure of one bank may indeed pose a threat to the solvency of another,even absent a run by depositors.Banks will hold liquid assets and capital at levels high enough to meet some subjective assessment ofthe probability of runs and counterparty failures.An alternative argument used to justify bank regulation is that in a system where central banks arecalled on to provide lender of last resort facilities to solvent but illiquid banks, in order to distinguishsolvent from insolvent banks the central bank should undertake on-site examinations to establish thestate of each institution. The prospect of system-wide contagion, in which society is denied the liquiditytransformation and credit origination services of the banking industry, provides the soundest basis forregulating banks and socialising the costs of individual bank failures. The objective in socialisinglosses is to preserve services for future savers, borrowers and transactors, but the consequence is toprotect current depositors from facing losses and to allow bank shareholders to earn excess returns ifthe bank holds less than the socially-optimum level of capital.So the model of public policy for banking in many countries is something like this. Protect thedepositors to stop the run. Stop the run to stop the contagion. Stop the contagion to ensure societycontinues to get banking services.However, once the probability of bank runs has been reduced, banks will hold less liquid assets andless capital than would otherwise be the case. Indeed capital ratios have been declining relentlesslyduring the past 150 years, from 35% in the 1860s to 4% by the mid 1980s. The banks became more‘efficient’ intermediaries but, to the extent the risk of failure has increased because of lack of depositordiscipline on the banks and risk has been moved elsewhere (to taxpayers or deposit insurance funds),efficiency gains are more apparent than real. The predisposition of governments to bail-out thecreditors of failed banks makes all the difference to both the sign and magnitude of the impact ofregulation on the efficiency of liquidity transformation and credit origination in the economy.Bailing out banksPerhaps the earliest recorded example of a government bail-out of bankers was the action by theRoman Emperor Tiberius Caesar who in 33 AD provided support to "reliable bankers" after fraud,defaults on foreign debt, liquidity draining government policies, sinking of uninsured cargoes, and aslave revolt precipitated a banking crisis. However, government safety nets were rare before thetwentieth century.In the era of free banking, market forces prevailed. Bank failures in the nineteenth century wererelatively frequent but smaller in scale, and self-correcting in comparison to the experience in thetwentieth century.Banks today are playing a larger role in the economy than a century ago. Bank assets in New Zealandrepresent 180% of GDP. Payments made every day via the banking system amount to 35% of GDP.Virtually every adult member of society has a bank account, a credit card, and a debit card to facilitatenon-cash payments. Many households rely on credit services to smooth consumption. Banks alsoprovide working capital to small and medium size enterprises and facilitate payments bothdomestically and internationally. Arguably, the externalities associated with the failure of a single bankhave increased in the last quarter century.In the last quarter of the 20th century around the world there have been over 100 separate incidents ofbanking systems facing a crisis. In some cases, losses have exceeded 40% of annual GDP (Thailand)and losses of 10-20% of GDP have been common. It has been very rare for bank creditors to bearlosses and in some cases even shareholders have been saved with public money. So what is goingon?Has the market failed or simply not been allowed to operate? The international consensus, not withoutdissenters, is that markets have failed or could be expected to fail, that oversight by regulators andprescribed minimum levels of capital are essential if banking systems are to be sound. Some countrieshave concluded that, because depositors rightly perceive that banks will still fail and therefore
4BIS Review 60/2001depositors might run from solvent banks, deposit insurance is necessary to prevent runs. However,given the focus of deposit insurance on small deposits, and the extent of wholesale (uninsured)deposits in many banks today, deposit insurance is now often justified on the grounds it makes itpolitically acceptable to fail banks which should be failed and to limit the extent of taxpayer liability toinsured deposits only.The contemporary case for bank regulation runs something like this. Once the state is exposed to theunderwriting risk and moral hazard of a deposit insurance scheme (implicit or explicit), it must monitorthe banks to reduce the probability of failure. With an implicit guarantee or explicit deposit insurancescheme in place and the regulator deeply implicated with any bank failure, markets assess theprobability of loss given default to be lower than otherwise, making them more willing to take risks withbanks. This reduced risk aversion translates into holdings of lower levels of bank capital than wouldotherwise be required to underpin a portfolio of risky loans. In this, our current world, the privatelyoptimal level of capital in banks could well diverge from the socially optimal level. I say "could"because we cannot rule out the possibility that at some very low probability of failure it may be efficientfor society to underwrite banks rather than have them each carry the higher capital and liquidity levelsnecessary to withstand a once in a 500 year incident of general loss of confidence.While some regulators agree there is a role for market discipline, many believe the market may notknow what information to ask for, or banks may be reluctant to supply it. Consequently evenadvocates of market discipline agree there is a role for the regulator in prescribing what informationshould be provided. Proponents of market discipline believe it is then more efficient for bank creditors,through their agents, to monitor the bank rather than to rely on the judgement of a bureaucrat.Determining the optimal level of bank capitalLet us set aside the issues facing the solvent but illiquid bank by assuming a central bank has thecapacity to act as lender of last resort. This presumes the central bank will be able to distinguish anilliquid but solvent bank from an illiquid and insolvent one.  Let us focus on:(cid:1) how banks might determine the privately optimal amount of capital to hold;(cid:1) some factors which might cause the socially optimal amount of bank capital to diverge fromthe private optimum; and(cid:1) strategies to cause convergence between the socially and the privately optimal level ofcapital.Because bank management might have misjudged the quality of its borrowers, because economiccircumstances may cause once sound borrowers to fail and because depositors might withdraw fundsearlier than expected, necessitating asset liquidations at discount rates above expected yield tomaturity, bank management (wishing to preserve their jobs) and bank shareholders (wishing topreserve the franchise value of their business), will find it optimal to hold some capital. That is, toretain within the bank assets with an expected net present value in excess of the net present value ofliabilities. But by how much?If too little capital is held, the probability of failure is too high; if too much capital is held, the rate ofreturn on equity is less than it might be. Surely this is an equilibrating mechanism where depositors'interests are protected by shareholder and management incentives to preserve the bank? Those whoadvocate a return to free banking would argue so. And did not Modigliani and Miller show nearly 50years ago that debt/equity ratios do not influence the value of the firm? Well at least in frictionlessmarkets with complete information and no taxes.Let us set aside the traditional argument in favour of bank regulation – that banks are opaque,depositors need agents to monitor the bank on their behalf, and regulators can do this cost effectively.Let us set aside the strongest argument for regulation – the prospect of contagion. Let us assumecomplete markets and symmetric information and that depositors, shareholders and bankmanagement seek to maximise the expected value of their interests. In this world, let us assume thereis an unnatural person with full contractual capacity and limited liability. That is, payoffs areasymmetric. This unnatural person is a bank and I contend it will seek to hold less than the sociallyoptimal level of capital.Depositors earn high rates of interest, shareholders earn high dividends and management takes highsalaries in the good times when the net present value of claims owned by the bank exceeds the net
BIS Review 60/20015present value of the obligations of the bank. In the bad times, depositors do not expect to face losses,shareholders liability is limited to the capital invested and management can withdraw and retire onprior period earnings or exit the industry.Of course, this is a highly simplified model. To ensure its investment in people, processes andproprietary information is protected and because of the costs of bank failure in terms of reputation andpotential litigation, owners and managers will choose to hold some capital.The ability of the shareholders to put the bank to the bank's creditors arises from limited liability. Theability of the creditors to put the bank to the government (taxpayers) arises if the externalitiesassociated with failing the bank are expected to exceed the cost of recapitalising the bank. This ismost likely if the bank is assessed to be systemically or politically important. Each of the major banksoperating in New Zealand has a significant share of system assets and hundreds of thousands ofpersonal customers. They would seem to meet any reasonable threshold of systemic or politicalimportance. While failing a bank might mean liquidation, it is almost certain to involve loss of creditorigination capacity and disruption to the payment system."Too big to fail" (not failing a bank because of its size) need not mean all bank creditors should escapewithout loss. I would be the first to concede that our large banks are too big to liquidate or toindefinitely suspend withdrawals, but it would be foolish for bank creditors, including depositors, toassume that they will necessarily be made whole. Of course, bank shareholders would have lost alltheir investment before creditors suffer any loss.Yes, this is another one of those occasions when the Reserve Bank takes the opportunity to state onthe public record that neither the Bank, nor the government, guarantees any of the deposits of anyregistered bank.Nevertheless, limited liability, systemic impact, and political voice underpin expectations of asymmetricpayoffs for shareholders and bank creditors, and together these suggest that the privately optimallevel of bank capital to cover expected losses might lie below the socially optimal level of capitalrequired to meet both expected and unexpected losses. Let us call the former "economic capital" andthe latter "regulatory capital".Economic capital is optimal for shareholders; regulatory capital is optimal for taxpayers. There is alsoa level of capital necessary to sustain a given credit rating from an independent rating agent. Let uscall "optimal rating capital" that level of capital optimal for depositors, given the premium over therisk-free rate paid by the bank to attract deposits allowing for the value of the option debt holderspresume they have to put their deposits to the government.Bank management has an interesting role. On the one hand, they want the shareholders to assesstheir expected rate of return to be high so the bank can access additional capital at the lowestmarginal cost. On the other hand, bank management, on behalf of shareholders, want to convince therating agency that their risks are well controlled so that they may be able to access deposits at thelowest possible cost for a given level of capital. Bank management face an incentive to convinceregulators that the level of capital consistent with that demanded by depositors to protect them (ratingcapital) is also the socially optimal level of capital. Enter the so-called hybrid or innovative capitalinstruments that the market prices as debt and regulators often count as capital. This device seeks toprovide regulatory capital at levels above economic capital. What makes capital "capital" is somethingwe will come to shortly.Let us return to consider the gap which, if it exists, should be of interest. That is, the gap betweenoptimal economic (private) and optimal regulatory (social) capital.The draft Basel 2 Accord is based on the assumption that under the 1988 Accord there was such agap and that it was material. The implication in the draft Pillar one of the Basel 2 Accord concerningbank capital is that the total amount of regulatory capital should remain unchanged and that economiccapital was being eroded and should be augmented. More closely tying capital to the probability ofdefault on loans and the expected loss given default, together with an explicit charge for operationalrisk and the retention of a charge for market risk on the trading book, are the essential elements ofPillar one of Basel 2, which seeks to better align economic and regulatory capital. The alignment ofregulatory capital is seen as good and the complexity of the proposed calculation of regulatory capitalis in part justified as a way of making regulatory capital mimic economic capital, which is presumed tobe the level of capital the market would demand.
6BIS Review 60/2001Optimal economic capital may fall short of optimal social capitalAsymmetric payoffs to shareholders and depositors mean the privately optimal level of capital liesbelow the socially optimal level of capital given the full distribution of returns to all stakeholders fromthe portfolio of risky loans originated by the bank's management but underwritten by shareholders,depositors and ultimately taxpayers in the case of systemically significant banks. In my view,alignment of economic and regulatory capital leads to an inherently undercapitalised privately ownedbanking system. In the absence of market discipline, it would be a mistake for the regulator to goalong with whatever capital banks determine to be privately optimal. But recall it may still be efficient tosocially insure, rather than capitalise the banks to absorb the most extreme unexpected losses.However, most safety nets have been slung to underwrite much more common events yet fail toensure the preservation of the credit origination, liquidity transformation, and payment servicecapability of the institution. The analysis is made more complicated if the shareholders, depositors andtaxpayers come from different nation states. Any idea of a utility maximising objective function todetermine socially optimal bank capital needs to recognise the segmentation which occurs when thethree sets of stakeholders cannot be presumed to be in a continuing relationship after a bank failure.But that is not the full extent of the gap. Economic capital is calculated on the basis of expectedlosses. To the extent minimum capital requirements are set consistent with economic capital,unexpected losses will not be borne by bank shareholders. Unexpected losses must be borne by bankcreditors, a deposit insurance fund, an ex post levy on surviving banks or socialised via taxpayersupport arising from implicit deposit insurance. Losses which are unexpected to an individual bank arenot necessarily unexpected to a banking system. The question is to what extent should banks'shareholders put up capital to underpin not only each institution but also the banking system? Doesnot deposit insurance seek to do just that?Deposit insurance, moral hazard and undercapitalised banksThe arguments against deposit insurance (whether explicit or implicit) are well rehearsed. Depositorsand banks take more risk (incur moral hazard). Banks make more risky loans, which crowd out safeloans. Small scale and inefficient banks are protected. Regulatory capture and regulatory forbearanceincrease the loss given default. Credible deposit insurance may reduce the probability of bank runs asa cause of bank failure and increase the political acceptability of failing insolvent banks, but it does soat the risk of increasing the probability of failure, risks increasing losses given failure and appears toincrease fragmentation and inefficiency in the intermediation process. Increased competition may beassociated with more participants and industry profitability may be reduced. However, it is more likelythat profits are reduced because costs are higher than because fees and margins are lower. A lessprofitable banking industry may simply reflect a less efficient one.To mitigate the moral hazard of insured depositors tolerating excessive risk-taking by bankmanagement on behalf of shareholders, advocates of deposit insurance promote schemes with: (a)caps (only a small limited amount of deposits are insured for each depositor); (b) co-insurance (onlypay a percentage of losses); and (c) deposit insurance premiums based on the riskiness of the bank.However, experience is that coverage provided by deposit insurance is extended over time and bycircumstances. To the extent that deposit insurance makes credible the threat that some depositorsmay face some losses by making it clear that small retail depositors with political voice will beprotected, but no others will be, the case is made that deposit insurance adds to market discipline. Ofcourse, that presumes that the uninsured depositors will discipline the bank but what of the bank thatraises only insured deposits, or of the systemically important bank with material externalities? Theremay be little market discipline on such banks and the deposit insurer or regulator must constrain therationally excessive risk appetite of the bank. As the regulator becomes ever more prescriptive andfixed with knowledge (or blamed for the lack of it), so the chances of a bail-out increase, marketdiscipline weakens further and regulators get drawn in further. In my opinion, public sectorbureaucracies find risk management extremely difficult. Rarely are the payoffs for taking more riskcommensurate with the incentives facing individual decision makers. Consequently bureaucrats aretoo risk averse most of the time and not risk averse enough when confronted with the high probabilityof a bad outcome becoming even worse.Is there a better model – one in which there is a realistic prospect that shareholders, having put upsomething close to the socially optimal amount of capital, are at risk, and depositors, facing a crediblethreat of loss, insist on that level of capital being sustained? Capital needs to stand ready to take itspunishment for being associated with risky ventures that go bad, whether expected or not.
BIS Review 60/20017For capital to be punished, it needs to be:(cid:1) permanent;(cid:1) available at the time of insolvency;(cid:1) accessible in the jurisdiction of the obligations of the bank; and(cid:1) under no obligations to its holders that rank ahead of any other obligations.To constitute bank capital, rights accorded to owners must be capable of being irrevocably,completely, unilaterally, and immediately cancelled in the event all other obligations are not expectedto be settled in full.An antidote to moral hazardFor bank creditors (all senior unsecured creditors) to have incentives to monitor the soundness of thebank, they must face the prospect of a loss of some or all of their investment. Such a loss must be:(cid:1) reasonably expected even if extremely improbable;(cid:1) politically acceptable;(cid:1) quickly determined; and(cid:1) promptly administered.A "haircut" is a process involving a reduction in the face value of an obligation of the bank. Theamount of the reduction may reflect the negative equity of an insolvent bank which has been liquidated(a dead haircut), or the amount necessary to recapitalise a bank in order for it to continue in business.It is the latter case I wish to focus on. It is the case where bank creditors recapitalise the bank. Thecreditor recapitalisation option is far from a done deal but we continue to explore the feasibility ofadding it to the options for managing a bank crisis. In the bank creditor recapitalisation case, creditorsmay recover some or all of their haircut from the subsequent sale of the bank. To the extent bankcreditors have become the shareholders of the recapitalised bank, they might have all the rights ofordinary shareholders and indeed might sell their shares at a profit. Of course, by taking more of thecreditors' money than is necessary to cover losses, creditors are being required to meet a social policyobjective but they are the primary beneficiaries of that policy – gaining immediate access to asubstantial proportion of their deposits, avoiding costly and drawn out liquidation proceedings andpreserving access to the payment system. The alternative is most often the nationalisation of the bankat the expense of taxpayers.In most parts of the world, regulators faced with a failing bank with a large number of depositors areconfronted with advising governments to nationalise or liquidate the bank.Confronted with this choice, liquidation is likely to be an unacceptable option for all but the smallest ofbanks. A credible regime to recapitalise the bank using depositors' and other creditors' money possiblyoffers a policy option that might be preferable to nationalisation.The key features of a bank creditor recapitalisation might include the rapid assessment of the roughorder of magnitude of the negative equity, placing the bank into statutory management, freezingwithdrawals for a short period, deduction of a proportion of all obligations of an immediate nature andrecording deductions against the name of the obligatee in a memorandum account, guaranteeing theresidual obligations of the institution, if not the entire institution, and reopening the institution. Overtime, the application of partial equity conversions to other time obligations as they fall due and theconversion of creditor obligations into equity could take place. While avoiding the complexity, costsand moral hazard of deposit insurance, ex ante the prospect of bank creditor recapitalisations mayprovide creditors with an incentive to monitor their bank and insist on levels of capital closer to thesocially optimal level. A credible creditor recapitalisation option may avoid the need for and inefficiencyinduced by a deposit insurance regime. It may avoid the need for intrusive regulatory oversight. Itseeks to protect the taxpayers interest. It may significantly reduce the public subsidy to depositors andother bank creditors arising from the put option they have not paid for and reduce the excess returnsto bank shareholders from running an undercapitalised bank. It would appear to impose fewadministrative costs on banks to counter what is perceived to be a very low probability event. Ofcourse, it is possible to consider a world of deposit insurance for small depositors and haircuts forother bank creditors or for a bank creditor recapitalisation scheme that distinguished between small
8BIS Review 60/2001and large creditors. Of course, a deposit insurance scheme does not provide a solution to the questionof how a systemically important bank should be recapitalised.What is envisaged is a regime that requires pre-positioning of creditor recapitalisation capability withinregistered banks, and thereby offers the prospect of preserving the credit origination, liquiditytransformation, and payment facilitation services while avoiding the worst liquidity impacts of a bankfailure. By ‘pre-positioning' I mean that as part of their Business Continuity Plans banks might berequired to confirm they had the systems capability to implement a creditor recapitalisation within aspecified number of business days and banks could confirm their ability to ‘reconnect' with a bankwhich had been recapitalised with bank creditors' funds.Politicians and regulators would no doubt wish to retain the flexibility to nationalise, recapitalise, orliquidate a failing bank.Crisis management and organisational formFor creditor recapitalisation to be a viable alternative to nationalisation or liquidation, it is essential thata bank's assets can quickly be identified. That requires legal certainty as to the owner of the claim tofuture cash flows. Such legal certainty does not exist if there is doubt as to the jurisdiction in whichassets are located. In the absence of a global insolvency regime, at the point of failure of atransnational bank the world is destined to have a rerun of the BCCI fiasco when national regulatorslaid claim to assets in their jurisdiction. Years passed in some cases before rightful ownership wasdetermined.As the world moves to embrace first transnational and ultimately global retail banking, as banks seekefficiency from cross-border outsourcing, as competitive pressures drive aggregation and morecountries play host to foreign banks which are systemically important, the more apparent it willbecome that not all depositors in a bank are equal. The location of assets is far from certain andoutcomes on failure are unpredictable, arbitrary and potentially unfair. Predatory national regulatorypractices, such as preferring home country depositors over foreign depositors within the samecorporate entity or designing deposit insurance regimes as barriers to competition or as a device forunfair competition, may become a source of increasing friction. Both the USA and Australia havedepositor preferences and the European Union is confronting potentially competitive national depositinsurance regimes given the flexibility allowed under the EU directive.New Zealand bank regulation and organisational formSome of you may be aware that starting about eighteen months ago the Reserve Bank began to focuson managing a bank failure in a system dominated by foreign owned banks. To date, we have beenagnostic about the matter of organisational form. We were relatively indifferent to whether a foreignbank branched into New Zealand or operated via a locally incorporated entity. In a banking regime inwhich public disclosure and market discipline play a central role, along with the accountability of bankdirectors for the sound operation of the bank, we became concerned about some aspects of theunincorporated or branch form of organisation.Firstly, the notion of ‘branch capital' in a world where assets can be moved cross border quickly and atlow cost, where the very notion of a ‘New Zealand' asset is losing definition and foreign depositorsmay be given priority in the event of liquidation, made the branch balance sheet increasinglymeaningless as a guide to assets and liabilities which were likely to exist at a point of failure. In aregime based on disclosure, unexpected, unpredictable and arbitrary outcomes would not be seen asa ‘fair game'. Further, the more we looked at the issues the more we, the regulator, became fixed withknowledge as to the inadequacies of branch-based disclosure.Secondly, disclosure regimes differ markedly between countries. In some cases, the level of publicdisclosure by banks branching into New Zealand would be inadequate to found a presumption thatdepositors could be informed as to the condition of the bank. Indeed branch accounts built on thenotion of branch capital can be inherently misleading.Thirdly, the lack of local directors mitigates against the incentive effects of the full force of legalsanctions.Finally, placing a branch into statutory management is inherently more complex, slower, and moreuncertain than taking action against a locally incorporated entity.
BIS Review 60/20019For these reasons, the Reserve Bank concluded that in certain cases it was likely to require that retailbanking business above NZ$200 million of deposits should be conducted via a locally incorporatedsubsidiary. Where the bank is systemically important, or comes from a jurisdiction which prefers homecountry depositors or from a jurisdiction where the level of public disclosure is inadequate, localincorporation of retail deposit-taking may be required. We continue to discuss the implementation ofthe policy with the banks directly affected. It is worth noting that our concerns about organisationalform were aroused well before our thinking on creditor recapitalisation as a means of resolving a failedbank had been developed. The case for local incorporation stands irrespective of whether a failedbank is nationalised, recapitalised, or liquidated.It is implausible to believe that New Zealand will never again face the prospect of a major bank indistress. Our banking system is presently one of the soundest in the world. On the basis of theweighted average credit rating of the banks operating in New Zealand today, Moody's InvestorServices rates New Zealand as the third soundest banking system in the world. We also have one ofthe highest levels of foreign ownership and, among privately owned systems, one of the mostconcentrated. By their nature, banks are exposed to risks which they seek to manage. It is byabsorbing and managing those risks that banks contribute to our economic growth and prosperity.They transform short-term liquid deposits into long term, difficult to monitor assets. Liquiditytransformation and credit origination services have volatile expected future cash flows and changingdiscount rates. Bank capital is the buffer that enables a bank to meet its obligations to others evenwhen its claims on others fail to materialise as expected. Bank management does not seek to breakthe bank but neither do motor vehicle drivers usually seek to have accidents.New Zealand's position in respect of banking supervisionSo where does that leave New Zealand in terms of banking supervision? There is a case for regulatingbanks given the prospect of contagion. However, bank regulation and supervision taken too far, bywhich I mean supervision which displaces the paramount role of directors and depositors in monitoringthe bank, run major risks of weakening market discipline by reducing the incentives for sound riskmanagement, including the holding of liquid assets and adequate capital.It is my belief that part of the reason why we have seen a fall in bank capital ratios over the lastcentury has been because of a weakening of market discipline. While some reduction may have beena true gain in welfare to the community through more efficient risk transfer, carried too far, inadequatecapital simply allows bank shareholders and depositors to earn excess rates of return at the expenseof future taxpayers.So what?It is therefore important to take all reasonable steps to strengthen self discipline and market disciplineon the banking sector, including by:(cid:1) applying high standards of corporate governance;(cid:1) ensuring high standards of public disclosure;(cid:1) defining and applying accounting and auditing standards;(cid:1) having a credible crisis management strategy;(cid:1) avoiding deposit insurance if at all possible and in particular avoiding unlimited andinappropriately priced schemes;(cid:1) minimising the extent to which depositors, perceiving banks to be too big to fail, concludethey are not at risk at all; and  minimising the amount of private information regulators hold orare believed to hold so as to limit the extent to which regulators and taxpayers are implicatedin practices which are found to be unsound leading to taxpayer bail-outs.Creditor recapitalisation is one possible mechanism for making credible a non-zero probability thatbank creditors, even at the biggest banks, might not be made whole in the event of a bank failure.We are currently working on the bank creditor recapitalisation proposal and would encourage othersupervisors to do so. However, we acknowledge there may be circumstances where creditorrecapitalisation is not feasible and, even if feasible, may not be optimal. So our case is one for
10BIS Review 60/2001exploring alternatives to ever more intrusive and prescriptive regulation of the risk managementprocess which lies at the heart of financial intermediation.The socially optimal level of capital in a national banking system will exceed the privately optimal level,being the aggregate of individual bank's assessed economic capital, if taxpayers in each nationaljurisdiction are expected to bear losses which, although unexpected to each bank, are ‘expected'across a portfolio of banks. This is because the expectation of the socialisation of losses changes thebehaviour of banks ex ante. Whether taxpayers should in fact bear losses, given a failure, is a differentissue. That is determined by the costs of the bail-out and future costs of moral hazard, including thecost to future taxpayers. These costs to future taxpayers include the dead-weight costs of theadditional tax burden to finance future bail-outs. These expected costs must be weighed against thepotential costs and losses taxpayers face from the loss of liquidity transformation and credit originationservices that may accompany the loss of confidence associated with depositors taking losses.ConclusionBy making credible the policy option that the bank creditors in the national jurisdiction will bear losses,the expectation of a bail-out is reduced and the privately optimal level of bank capital held in thejurisdiction converges toward the level of capital which is socially optimal.If banks operate in widely diverse international markets, if significant numbers of depositors areexpected to bear losses and are treated pari passu, there is reason to hope that the privately optimallevel of bank capital globally will converge to the socially optimal level. In such a world, shareholdersbear expected losses while bank creditors bear unexpected losses. In such a world, the role of theregulator is to protect taxpayers, current and future, from being exploited by bank shareholders anddepositors. This is a role not dissimilar to the role independent central banks have in protecting saversfrom unexpected losses arising from unexpected inflation. Time inconsistency, which explainspoliticians' predisposition to excessively easy monetary policy, also explains their readiness to bail-outfailing financial institutions. Anchoring inflation expectations contributes greatly to the efficientallocation of resources, so does managing expectations about who bears the risks of associating withrisky banking ventures.The Reserve Bank is continuing its policy research and consultation on bank crisis management. Ourbanking supervision regime is based on the three disciplines – self-discipline, market discipline, andregulatory discipline. The credibility of our regime hinges in no small part on having a credible range ofoptions as to how we would deal with a banking crisis. We are reluctant to engage in forms ofregulation and supervision that undermine incentives for banks and markets to deliver socially optimaloutcomes.In summary, what we support is a regime in which banks face incentives to hold sufficient capital toensure the probability of failure is reduced because bank management and shareholders are awarethat imprudence by them will mean at-risk depositors might run. The capital willingly held by the bankshould be sufficient to align incentives of shareholders with those of regulators by ensuring the putoption depositors perceive they hold is a long way out of the money. The level of bank capital needs togo beyond that necessary merely to absorb expected losses. Bank capital needs to be sufficient toabsorb all but the most improbable unexpected losses.In my view, incentive-compatible regulation does not mean setting regulatory capital equal toeconomic capital. Even when depositors and shareholders bear all the costs of a bank failure via risk-based premiums paid to a deposit insurance scheme, unless there is agreement on when it is optimalto socialise the cost of systemic failure, economic capital and regulatory capital will diverge. This iseven more likely to be the case when shareholders and taxpayers are in different nationalcommunities. It is my contention that bank shareholders and bank creditors should bear a very largeproportion of the systemic risk currently laid at the feet of future taxpayers. To shift this risk requiresnew instruments such as local incorporation and plans to recapitalise failing banks with creditors'money. It is necessary to ensure that capital is really available to absorb losses, and is of sufficientquality and held in sufficient quantity. Banks should face incentives to hold closer to the sociallyoptimal level of capital.
BIS Review 59/20011Tony Latter: Banking and developmentAddress by Mr Tony Latter, Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, at the 2001APEC Economic Outlook Symposium held in Hong Kong, 28 June 2001.*      *      *I should like this morning to address three particular aspects of the broad topic of banking anddevelopment. One is the contribution of banking – or the financial sector more generally – to theeconomy in terms of activity. The second is the role of banks as providers of cross-border finance fordevelopment. The third is the implications of the internet revolution for the development of bankingitself.Contribution of banking to the economyOur very distant ancestors survived without money, let alone banks. With the passage of centuriesand the growing complexity of barter, physical money emerged as a useful unit of account, a mediumof exchange and a store of value. Still later, banks emerged as intermediators between, on the onehand, those with holdings of money surplus to immediate need and attracted by the prospect ofearning interest, and, on the other, those willing to pay interest in order to be able to accelerate theirspending. With the further passage of time various other means of intermediation, such as marketablesecurities, also developed.A key point here is that banks only emerged because of the evident utility in the service they provided.Throughout the world we can now see examples of how banks and other financial institutions havefacilitated the funding of the development of the rest of the economy, and how at the same time theyhave enabled savers to obtain returns on their savings and to allocate desired expenditure efficientlybetween the present and the future. Of course, there have been shortcomings, mistakes and disastersalong the way, where market failures have impaired efficiency or where banks have collapsed as aresult of poor judgement or of circumstances beyond their reasonable anticipation or control; but suchexperiences are found in all areas of economic activity.Despite, however, the evident benefit from having an active and efficient financial sector, there haveremained people at different times in history who have been sceptical of the intrinsic worth of bankingas an economic activity contributing to aggregate welfare. This attitude has often reflected apresumption that activity only has merit if it delivers tangible output – food, clothing, cars, clearlyconsumable services such as television programmes, and so on. But this belief contradicts theevidence of the contribution which efficient finance makes to the economy, and the necessary rolewhich it plays. Even the strictest communist regimes of the twentieth century found it impossible todispense entirely with banks, even if, as a result of fantastic accounting and rotten economic policiesin general, the banks mostly ended up bankrupt and depositors penniless.The essential raison d'être of banking is that an economically advancing society needs effectiveintermediation between savers and borrowers, and mechanisms for making payments efficiently. Asalready noted, the initial basic intermediary function of providing deposits and loans expandedsubsequently into the organisation of alternative channels of intermediation such as bonds andequities (these activities may be conducted in some jurisdictions outside the narrowly defined bankingsector, but the distinction is not material in the present context). Although it is human nature for saversto complain that the returns are inadequate, and borrowers that costs are extortionate, in the market-oriented economies competition in financial intermediation has mostly been quite intense, and most ofus would probably agree that this has worked to the increasing benefit of customers on both sides ofthe balance sheet.Meanwhile, the provision of payment services has developed markedly at both the wholesale andretail levels. Banks are at the centre of this activity, typically supported by the central bank as ultimateprovider of liquidity. In fact, whereas many other types of institution may nowadays be involved inlending money or providing avenues for savings, banks themselves remain firmly at the core of thepayments system. A sound and efficient payments system is acknowledged to be a prerequisite if aneconomy is to realise fully its potential.
2BIS Review 59/2001Banking facilities have become so much an accepted and necessary part of life that access to them issometimes regarded as an absolute and unconditional right, in the same way as is argued foruniversal education or health services. This has been a topic of debate in Hong Kong recently, in thecontext of likely changes to savings rates and to fees and charges in the light of the final deregulationof interest rates next week. As a general rule, however, businesses such as banks should be allowedto determine their own strategies in the light of market forces, although the authorities may claim alegitimate interest in ensuring that those market forces do indeed function competitively. One bankmay decide that the provision and encouragement of the widest possible access to its services fits wellinto its business plan; another may decide otherwise. In the rather unlikely event that insufficient basicbanking services are available to some section of society, the case may be argued for officialintervention. But one must distinguish between different aspects of the situation – commercial,competitive and social. If, other things being equal, banks are to be pressed into assisting with thedelivery of social policies, then the precise terms of that obligation, including responsibility for fundingit, should be made clear – whether by law or in suitable agreements or codes.In Hong Kong, banking, in a rather narrow definition, is estimated to contribute about 7.5% to grossdomestic product and about 3.5% to employment. Despite the withdrawal of a number of individualbanks, particularly Japanese, from Hong Kong in the late 1990s, the share of banking in GDP appearsto have remained roughly stable for a number of years now. However, the share in employment hasdeclined somewhat of late – as has also been evident in, for example, the USA and UK over a slightlylonger period. This implies that there have been significant productivity gains, including no doubt thosearising from the process of consolidation, which has been evident among international banks withpresences in Hong Kong for some time and has now been spreading to the local banks.Permit me one further historical reflection, related partly to my earlier comment about attitudes towardsbanking. When I first studied economics, there was a respected body of literature which argued thatproductivity growth in manufacturing would always outstrip that in other sectors becausemanufacturing was more amenable to the application of new technologies and economies of scale. Inservices, output was regarded as too firmly dependent on the specific input of labour for there to bemuch scope for productivity gains. This reasoning even led some governments to adopt policies with abias to promote manufacturing in the belief that this would be the route to more rapid overall growth,although this seemed to ignore the demand side – that the public would become saturated with goodsand increasingly desire to consume services. I don't know whether any of the protagonists of thatschool of thought are still alive today. If they are, and even if they could still identify some serviceswhere productivity has not advanced very much (hairdressers and taxis are among the usually quotedexamples), they would be astonished at the productivity growth which has been apparent in bankingand certain other service sectors around the world in recent years, as a result of the forces ofglobalised competition and the opportunities presented by technological advances.It is clear, therefore, that banking and other financial services not only provide essential support todevelopment but also make their own contribution to national income. I am often asked questions suchas what is the long-term growth prospect for this sector or how will the mix of activities within thesector evolve. The simple and honest answer is that I don't know. Plainly, there are limits to the likelydomestic demand for these services. But that demand may be supplemented if overseas customersare attracted to use our local services, or, of course, diminished if local customers choose to satisfysome of their needs from overseas. At the end of the day the pattern will depend on efficiency and thelaws of comparative advantage. From the official side, we in Hong Kong are anxious to provide aninfrastructure and business environment on a level playing field within which such activities canflourish, but we are not capable of determining the outcome.The role of cross-border bank finance in economic developmentIn the absence of an adequately developed financial sector, sound enough to enjoy the trust of thelocal community and offering sufficiently attractive products, it may prove difficult to channel domesticsavings into domestic investment. This is a problem which confronts many less developed andemerging economies. The result is often that, despite a quite strong disposition of households to save,the preference is to exploit all means, legal or otherwise, to hold those savings offshore. Inconsequence, domestic enterprises and government may become more dependent than otherwise onattracting funds from abroad to fulfil their funding needs. This may have the salutary advantage ofexposing the borrowers to the discipline of the international market place, but it may also saddle them
BIS Review 59/20013with higher costs and currency risk. Moreover, historically, the lending institutions have not alwayspossessed sufficient local knowledge to enable them to make sound credit judgements.This role of banks as providers of cross-border funding for development is the second topic on my listtoday.The subject is perhaps topical for not the happiest of reasons. For the past couple of years the banks,along with international bodies and fast-food chains, have become the main target for anti-globalisation and anti-capitalist protests. I leave others to muse on the motivation and justification forsuch actions, but I do note that bank finance for developing countries, and more particularly thequestion of debt forgiveness, are prominent items on the protest agenda. I also note that this is asubject which has for several years been keenly debated, more soberly, by governments, internationalorganisations such as the IMF and World Bank, and banks themselves.It is a complex issue. One must never lose sight of the fact that bank lending involves a contractbetween the bank and the borrower, and the parties should be expected to honour that contract. If it istreated otherwise, then the basis for all future relationships crumbles. But in practice the situation ishugely complicated if there is a syndicate of lenders, giving rise to problems of co-ordination andpotential free riding, or if the World Bank or IMF are involved, which typically expect to be at the frontof the queue for repayments. At the end of the day, commercial banks may decide that a degree ofdebt forgiveness (possibly disguised as a generous rescheduling) is advisable as the best means ofminimising overall losses and, perhaps, preserving longer-term business opportunities with the countryor customer in question. But this should be a commercial decision. If governments wish, for political orhumanitarian reasons, to ease further the contractual debt burden of an indebted country, this shouldbe carried forward as a conscious and transparent policy decision, which would surely involve usageof taxpayers' money unless it was reliant on coercion of banks.In practice, there are many developing countries which are effectively cut off from commercial bankfinance because of a track record of default, political instability, economic mismanagement, corruptionand so on. Banks generally need certain minimum assurances, relating to the political climate, thelegal system, transparency, corporate governance, etc, over and above the narrower assessment ofthe servicing capacity of the borrower. Fortunately, most economies in the APEC fold can be classifiedas open for bank finance. But there are many other countries in the world which are passed over bythe international banking community because of the lack of the basic essential attributes, or becausethey are simply too poor to afford credit on commercial terms, in which case they become dependenton concessional finance from the international institutions as the only reasonably accessible source ofexternal funding.Banks have to abide by prudent standards. Regulators, depositors and shareholders all expect asmuch. Most banks would leap at the chance to lend more to assist development, if such lending wasassessed to be commercially viable. But as a general rule banks should not be prevailed upon againsttheir better judgement to be providers of economic aid or social services, whether domestically orinternationally, unless there is the political consensus that taxpayers are willing to fund them in thatrole.The internetTurning now to the internet, I believe that this has some relevance to the overall theme of thissymposium, not so much because of questions about the availability of banking services to those whoneed them, but rather because of possible implications for the location and structure of bankingactivity.Let me begin by observing that, ever since the telecommunications and IT revolutions begansubstantially to impact on banking – and that, depending on how exactly one defines the terms, was atleast two or three decades ago – some commentators have been forecasting the imminent demise offinancial centres as such. The argument is that all the humdrum work will be carried out in computercentres and call centres in low wage countries, while the high value adding executives can locatewhere they wish – depending on their preferences for recreation, culture, climate and so on – andtele-conference one another when necessary. The former – the migration of routine operations to low-cost places – has happened to a degree, but the latter has not. Even if colleagues within a bank cansometimes substitute a conference call for a meeting, their customers have been less eager. Althoughfor basic banking services little personal contact may be necessary, deals in such fields as corporatefinance and investment banking appear to require interaction between a number of parties
4BIS Review 59/2001face-to-face. Indeed, in recent years the world's major financial centres may, if anything, have becomemore rather than less dominant as a result of the demonstrable benefits of co-location and criticalmass particularly in the context of the higher value-added activities.How does the internet fit into this picture. The new dimension which the internet brings is torevolutionise the access of customers to banks – and banks to their customers. Already we know thathuge numbers of customers have moved over to using the internet to carry out their basic bankingbusiness. This may in turn have enabled banks to realise cost savings, although it is as yet not easy tofind hard evidence to this effect.The implications for the structure of banking are unclear. One may envisage two extreme outcomes.One would be where banks, both established ones and new ones created as internet-only providers,compete fiercely in all areas of banking where human contact is not required. Consumers flit aroundfrom one to another in response to the best deals, splitting their banking relationships across anumber of banks if that appears cost-effective. The prices of these services are driven down to"commodity" levels. None of the banks makes much of a profit from it. Some of the "old" ones sufferloss of their bread-and-butter business. The outcome in the longer term is unclear. It is conceivablethat banks cease to exist as integrated multi-product businesses. They become instead productspecialists in a rather fragmented landscape, finding it tough to earn more than commodity profitseven in areas where, in the case of the longer established banks, they used to enjoy nicheadvantages.The other scenario emanates from the same starting point of intense competition. But in this case thenew entrants do not have the resources to continue with their generous initial terms for long enough tosecure a firm business foundation. The established banks reluctantly but necessarily take on thenewcomers aggressively, utilising their financial strength and making extra efforts to build robustrelationships across a broad range of services and to exploit the underlying inertia that customers mayexhibit. In other words, they use the internet to consolidate their relationships and to see off thecompetition. Customers are persuaded that it's not worth sacrificing the relationship for the sake of afew basis points. Some customers may be lost, but some of these may anyway be ones which thebanks can afford to say goodbye to. As a variant to this model, the banks may adopt different brandsfor their internet services, exploiting any opportunities available from product differentiation and marketsegmentation, but retaining the capacity from their standpoint to manage multiple relationships withany individual customer as one.One can envisage many other outcomes besides these examples. I know of no sure way of predictingwhat will happen, but my personal view is that the internet is likely to emerge more as a channel tobuild on existing relationships and to increase the efficiency of basic services than as something whichchanges the landscape of the banking industry. But perhaps I am guilty of thinking that everyone elsepossesses the same inertia as I do when it comes to changing one's habits.Concluding remarksI have skimmed over a few issues which can rather loosely be said to fall under the heading ofbanking and development. There are many experts attending this symposium who will, I am sure, offermuch deeper and more provocative insights into the economic outlook in general, and the relationshipbetween financial development and growth in particular. I wish you all a fruitful and enjoyable coupleof days.
BIS Review 58/20011Willem F Duisenberg: European Economic and Monetary Union: a successstorySpeech by Dr Willem F Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, on the occasion of theannual conference of the Ifo Institute, Munich, 26 June 2001.*      *      *Ladies and gentlemen,It is a great honour for me to be invited to the annual conference of the Ifo Institute in Munich. The IfoInstitute is among the most renowned economic research institutes in Germany. In addition toparticipating in the production of the joint spring and autumn reports by German economic researchinstitutes, it also plays a major role for the financial markets in compiling economic analyses,particularly on account of its Ifo Business Climate Index. Moreover, the Ifo Institute, through itsacademic research on a number of current economic policy issues, makes a valuable contribution todiscussions on economic polices.1.Introduction"European Economic and Monetary Union: a success story" - many of you might ask whether anassessment of this can be made at such an early stage. I know that in Germany in particular, manycitizens view the changeover from the Deutsche Mark to the euro banknotes and coins with muchscepticism. In my opinion, it is more a question of the loss of something which is well-established, i.e.the Deutsche Mark, than of any real concerns about the new currency. This sort of reaction is veryhuman. Nevertheless, holding onto something which is well-established can hinder progress andchange which in themselves can bring many advantages. The participants in European Economic andMonetary Union (EMU) have already come a long way and have overcome a number of difficulties.The cash changeover simply completes this process, which began at the beginning of 1999 with thestart of Stage Three of EMU. It was mainly on account of technical reasons that the euro banknotesand coins could not be introduced simultaneously at the start of Stage Three of EMU at the beginningof 1999. Despite this, the national currencies of the Member States of EMU have only beenrepresenting denominations of euro since then. The euro is therefore already "OUR money".I should like to refer briefly to the period before the introduction of the single currency at the beginningof 1999. Of course, we should not talk only of the past. The monetary policy of the European CentralBank (ECB) is after all forward-looking and thus I shall take a forward-looking stance myself. Followinga brief review of the history of EMU, I should like to explain the ECB's assessment of the monetaryand economic situation. In accordance with the ECB's strategy, I shall use the two-pillar strategy asthe basis for my explanations and analyse potential risks to price stability. In this respect, I should liketo elaborate on one of the most important issues this year and next year and that is the cashchangeover.2.Milestones on the path towards European Economic and Monetary UnionThe major plan to establish European Economic and Monetary Union was conceived over thirty yearsago. In 1970 the so-called Werner plan was drawn up under the chairmanship of the formerLuxembourg Prime Minister, Pierre Werner. It was only in the mid-1980s, however, that the idea ofEuropean Economic and Monetary Union found sufficient political support and was able to graduallymake further concrete progress in the following years. The Single European Act of 1986 is a milestoneon the path towards a single European market. The latter is characterised by the free movement ofgoods, services, labour and capital. At the end of the 1980s, the Delors report, which was drawn upunder the chairmanship of the then President of the European Commission, Jacques Delors, laid thefoundations for the introduction of a single currency. In this respect, a three stage process wasenvisaged together with the establishment of a European Central Bank with the primary objective ofmaintaining price stability. The first stage of EMU began on 1 July 1990 with the free movement ofcapital between most of the Member States. This marked an important step towards the efficientallocation of capital within the European Union. However, the exchange rate risk remained animportant determining factor in the decisions of investors.
2BIS Review 58/2001When looking back over the process towards a single European currency, the difficulties andtemporary setbacks should not be forgotten, including, in particular, the EMS crisis in the autumn of1992. Less than a year later, following renewed volatility in the EMS, the fluctuation margins for thebilateral EMS central rates were widened to +/- 15% in order to put a stop to financial marketspeculation. Both of these events can be regarded as examples of a number of tests by the financialmarkets to see how serious the Member States really were on the issue of integration.In November 1993, the Maastricht Treaty came into effect following the ratification by the MemberStates. The Treaty laid down the convergence criteria which were a prerequisite for joining EMU. On 1January 1994, at the beginning of Stage Two of EMU, the European Monetary Institute (EMI) wasestablished. The latter was given the task, as the forerunner of the European Central Bank, ofpreparing the framework in which the ECB, within the European System of Central Banks (ESCB),was to assume responsibility for monetary policy at the start of Stage Three of EMU on 1 January1999. The period prior to the start of Stage Three of EMU was characterised by the unprecedentedconvergence of short and long-term interest rates, the convergence of inflation rates, the reduction inthe general government budget deficits and debt ratios as well as relatively stable exchange ratesbetween the countries joining EMU.Given the convergence of long-term interest rates towards a relatively low level, market participantsgave the ECB a vote of confidence at the start of Stage Three of EMU. Moreover, inflationaryexpectations have remained low since the beginning of Stage Three of EMU. I shall elaborate on thisissue later on in my speech. This shows that the ECB has achieved high credibility in terms of itsprimary objective of maintaining price stability. I should now like to explain the economic and monetarydevelopments in the euro area and the outlook for price stability in the context of the two-pillarstrategy.3.The first pillar of the ECB's strategy - monetary developments give grounds for afavourable outlook for price stabilityAs you know, the ECB assigns a prominent role to monetary developments in the euro area within thecontext of its monetary policy strategy. Empirical evidence of monetary developments in the euro areapoints towards a stable relationship between demand for the broad monetary aggregate M3 and pricedevelopments as well as towards good leading indicator properties of M3 growth for inflation over themedium term.The ECB does not pursue monetary targeting, instead, it has set a reference value for the growth ofthe broad monetary aggregate M3 for a variety of reasons. This reference value is derived on thebasis of the Eurosystem's definition of price stability, i.e. an increase in the Harmonised Index ofConsumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2% compared with the previous year andassumptions for trend potential output growth of between 2% and 21/2% as well as for a trend declinein velocity of M3 of between 1/2% and 1% per annum.The reference value for M3 constitutes the anchor for the analysis and communication of monetarydevelopments in the euro area. The monetary analysis is, however, not restricted to a comparison ofthe current growth in M3 with the reference value, rather it incorporates a much broader approach.Because, in order to be able to interpret monetary developments accurately, it is crucial to know theprecise reasons for these developments. This means that, in addition to the broad monetaryaggregate M3, the individual components of M3 and the counterparts to money, in particular thedynamics of loans to the private sector, must be analysed in respect of their implications for futureprice developments. Allow me to briefly explain why a detailed analysis of the forces behind monetarydevelopments is so important.Not every increase in M3 growth in excess of potential growth has an effect on consumption andhence, necessarily poses a threat to price stability. Greater dynamics in monetary developments can,particularly in the short term, be attributable to portfolio movements for example, which are temporaryand therefore tend not to be a problem for inflationary developments. This was probably the case inthe first few months of 2001 when the uncertainty on the stock markets temporarily increased theattractiveness of short-term secure assets. The aim of the analysis must, therefore, be to trace thegrowth in M3 back to its underlying factors in order to assess the extent to which some components ofthe monetary developments are not relevant for future domestic price developments.The revisions to M3, which the ECB made in its publication of monetary data for April, should also beconsidered in this light. The ECB has recently come into the position to indicate the extent to which
BIS Review 58/20013money market fund shares/units are held by non-euro area residents and to exclude theseshares/units from M3. All national central banks (NCBs) in the euro area now regularly report data onthe money market fund share/unit holdings of non-euro area residents in accordance with the generalreporting obligations in the context of money and banking statistics. From a conceptual point of view,M3 should only capture the money holdings of households and firms located in the euro area. Aboveall, these have close links with domestic private consumption and to domestic price developments.The money holdings by non-residents are, by contrast, likely to be used more for portfolio purposes.These revisions should bring back the monetary aggregate M3 closer to its theoretical concept,thereby tending to strengthen the information content of M3 for domestic price developments.Purchases of money market fund shares/units by non-euro area residents increased following the startof Stage Three of EMU, whereas previously they had been of very little importance. The demand forshort-term, high-quality instruments was likely stimulated, on the one hand, by structural factors suchas, fiscal consolidation in most of the industrial countries and the resulting decline in the issuance ofgovernment debt securities, and on the other, by economic factors such as the flattening of the yieldcurve.One further correction to the M3 statistics still needs to be made. To date, only provisional data areavailable on purchases of money market paper and of short-term debt securities by non-euro arearesidents. By the end of the year, revised M3 figures should be published taking full account ofnegotiable instruments held by non-euro area residents.One of the important general challenges of producing and interpreting statistics is to maximise theireconomic content. The revision of the monetary statistics in order to take into account purchases ofnegotiable instruments by non-euro area residents is a further step in this direction. The monetarystatistics are among the most advanced statistics available for the euro area. They are based on afully harmonised consolidated balance sheet and on fully harmonised money-issuing andmoney-holding sectors, as well as on harmonised financial instruments. In view of their close links withinflationary developments and their good leading indicator properties for future inflation, monetarydevelopments must also play a prominent role in the monetary policy strategy of the ECB in the future.Since the second quarter of 2000, growth in M3 has been declining mainly on account of the increasein the short-term interest rates. Adjusted for the money market fund shares/units held by non-euroarea residents, M3 grew at an annual rate of around 41/2% in the first four months of 2001. If currentdata on purchases of money market paper and short-term debt securities of non-euro area residentsare also taken into account, the annual rate of growth of M3 over recent months has probably beenslightly below the reference value for M3. Overall, monetary developments therefore point towards afavourable outlook for the medium-term maintenance of price stability.Growth of credit to the private sector in the euro area has increased relatively strongly since the startof Stage Three of EMU. In particular in 2000, some of the credit demand can, however, be attributedto the financing needs in the context of mergers and acquisitions, partly outside the euro area, and tothe financing of UMTS licences. These factors, however, are not likely to affect domestic pricedevelopments. In this respect, the dynamics of loans to the private sector in the euro area also supportthe outlook of monetary developments for future price developments.4.The second pillar of the ECB strategy - real GDP growth around the level of trendpotential growthI should now like to talk about the real economic situation. The analysis under the second pillar of theECB's monetary strategy also confirms that the current level of key interest rates remains appropriateto ensure that the euro area economy will be able to maintain price stability in the medium term.Macroeconomic projections of developments in the euro area have just recently been published in theJune Monthly Bulletin by the experts of the Eurosystem. As announced last year and conducted inDecember 2000 for the first time, these projections are produced twice a year by the experts from thenational central banks of the euro area Member States in collaboration with the experts from the ECB.They serve as input for the assessment of economic developments and of the risks to price stabilityconducted by the Governing Council of the ECB within the framework of the second pillar of themonetary policy strategy of the ECB.When interpreting these projections, it should always be taken into account that they are based on aset of technical assumptions and that therefore they are not "unconditional". The projections areproduced, for example, on the basis of unchanged short-term interest rates and unchanged bilateral
4BIS Review 58/2001euro exchange rates. The projections by Eurosystem experts are therefore "conditional" and notdirectly comparable with the "unconditional" projections published by other institutions such as theEuropean Commission, the IMF and the OECD, for example. Moreover, the projections are publishedin the form of ranges, in order to take account of the degree of uncertainty. The ranges reflect theaverage forecast error from previous periods and therefore differ between each of the projectedvariables and the projection horizon.Compared with December 2000, growth expectations for 2000 and 2001 have been reduced. It isprobable that in 2001 real GDP growth in the euro area will decline as compared with the strongincrease observed in 2000, before recovering slightly in 2002. Overall, this year and next year it willbroadly be in line with trend potential growth for the euro area. At the same time, HICP inflation willprobably be somewhat higher in 2000 than was expected at the end of last year. The expectation thatinflation will fall in 2001 and will remain below 2% in 2002, has, however, remained unchanged,meaning that the ECB will meet its objective of maintaining price stability in the medium term.I should now like to go into some detail on the prospects for growth in the euro area. Eurostats firstestimate of the growth of real GDP in the first quarter of 2001 has confirmed that economic growth inthe euro area has moderated since the second half of 2000. Moreover, industrial production declinedfurther in April. The sentiment indicators available for the euro area also confirm weaker economicgrowth. The surveys provided to assess the situation and prospects for the economy constitute avaluable source of information for an up-to-date economic analysis. You also make a valuablecontribution towards an up-to-date assessment of economic developments in Germany with theproduction of your Ifo Business Climate Index. In this context, it should be emphasised that theGoverning Council of the ECB adopts an area-wide perspective in its assessment of economicconditions and the outlook for price stability.It is likely that during the course of the year the decline in global economic growth will show up to asomewhat larger extent than has been the case up until now in net export developments. While globaltrade (excluding the euro area) increased last year by around 12%, it will probably only rise by justunder 6% this year according to the Eurosystem's projections. This will have a negative impact onexport prospects for the euro area. While growth in export (including intra-trade) rose at double-digitrates last year, growth rates for the current year, on the basis of an unchanged euro exchange rate,are expected to lie somewhere between 5% and just under 8%. The contribution of net exports toGDP growth should, therefore, decline considerably compared with the previous year and be largelyneutral in the current year.As illustrated by economic growth in the euro area in the first quarter of 2001, subdued exportprospects can put pressure on domestic demand and particularly on investment. Despite thesenegative factors one should not, however, forget the positive factors which contribute towards astabilisation of domestic demand. These factors include the still favourable financing conditions forinvestment and consumption and a slight further increase in employment in the euro area.Furthermore, there are no fundamental economic imbalances, particularly in respect of the personalsavings ratio, which could put pressure on consumption in the euro area.Against this background, consumer confidence in the euro area has been relatively robust over recentmonths. Despite the slightly weaker assessment of the general economic situation in the latest surveyin May, consumer confidence in the euro area is still at an historically high level. In this respect, thesepositive factors should make a valuable contribution towards ensuring that growth remains broadly inline with its potential.I should now like to elaborate on price developments this year and next year. Following an averageannual HICP inflation rate of 2.3% in the euro area last year, temporary pressures are likely to causeinflation to be above 2% for a longer period of time than was expected at the end of 2000 by allinstitutions. Strain factors and easing factors are battling against each other at the same time. Theheavy impact of energy price developments should ease considerably this year. For the time being atleast, the renewed increase in energy prices in the second quarter of the year has delayed the fall inthe inflation rate in the euro area. In addition, the increase in food prices as a result of BSE and theoutbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in some of the Member States have had an impact ondevelopments in the HICP. Furthermore, the increase in some of the administered prices and indirecttaxation in some of the countries of the euro area have caused the inflation rate to rise over the pastfew months. These factors should, however, only have a temporary effect on inflation in the euro area.Lower economic growth also seems to point to a decline in the pressure on the price level.
BIS Review 58/20015In spite of the fact that these factors will only have a temporary effect on price developments, cautionis warranted. Above all, it is important that an inflation rate of over 2% over a long period of time doesnot lead to higher wage demands. Until now, wage developments in the euro area have beenrelatively moderate. Important wage negotiations will, however, take place in the second half of 2001and in 2002. Further developments in wages will therefore be closely monitored by the ECB. Hence,we will continue to remain vigilant.Despite the long period of time in which inflation has stood above 2%, inflation expectations have sofar hardly changed in the euro area. The difference between the nominal French government bondyields and the corresponding real yields on French index-linked government bonds can be used as anapproximation for measuring inflationary expectations. This so-called break-even inflation rate hasremained below 2% for ten-year government bonds since the start of Stage Three of EMU andcurrently stands at around the average level seen in 2000. This implies that the financial markets areconvinced that the ECB will be able to keep inflation in the euro area below 2% in the medium term.This is a success for monetary policy, particularly during such difficult times in which externaleconomic influences and further temporary factors are having a transitory impact on HICP inflation.The relatively low long-term interest rates arising from low inflation rate expectations and hencefavourable financing conditions are the most valuable contribution which monetary policy can possiblymake to achieving sustainable and sound growth prospects in the euro area.In addition to monetary policy and the responsible behaviour on the part of the social partners, fiscalpolicy is also responsible for ensuring sound long-term growth. In order to achieve this, fiscal policymust continue the process of consolidation as laid down in the Stability and Growth Pact and in thenational stability programmes. At the same time, fiscal policy must create an attractive economicenvironment for business investment and for the supply and demand of labour. In this respect, mostnational governments of the euro area have already taken steps in the right direction. Lower tax rateson businesses and households is, in this respect, very welcome. However, this reduction in the taxrates requires the appropriate adjustments to be made in order to meet the objectives of fiscalconsolidation, for example with the expansion of tax bases or cuts on the expenditure side. Until nowthis has not taken place to a sufficient extent. The reduction in the expenditure ratios over the past fewyears in the euro area has, above all, been achieved through lower interest payments and lowerexpenditure on unemployment benefits in the course of the strong expansion of the economy.Structural spending cuts must be more ambitious in order to meet the objective of sustainable fiscalconsolidation.The budget deficit in the euro area will probably rise slightly in 2001, excluding the proceeds from thesales of UMTS licences last year. This would mean that some of the euro area Member States maynot be able to meet their fiscal consolidation objectives for the current year, despite the fact thateconomic growth in the euro area will probably be broadly in line with its potential. In order to achievea sound and sustainable fiscal position, however, the euro area Member States are required tocontinue their fiscal consolidation efforts as laid down in the medium-term fiscal plans in accordancewith the Stability and Growth Pact.Other areas in which more effort needs to be made by the national governments, in particular in thelarge euro area Member States, include the goods and labour markets. Also in these areas, the firststeps in the right direction have been taken. The deregulation of the goods markets must, however, beexpedited in order to increase competition and to strengthen the growth of the economy. This is theonly way to increase the long-term growth potential in the euro area. With regard to labour markets,unemployment has fallen considerably over the past few years to stand at 8.3% in April 2001. Thenumber of unemployed has declined by more than one million compared with April of last year, eventhough, most recently, the decline in unemployment has actually decreased slightly in seasonallyadjusted terms. An unemployment figure of 8.3% is, however, much too high. Further incentives needto be made in respect of the demand for and the taking-up of employment. This requires not onlyfurther reforms to the tax systems, but in particular also to the social security systems.5.The implications of the euro cash changeoverFinally, I should like to talk about an issue which, until the beginning of next year, will be the focalpoint: the euro cash changeover. By 1 January 2002, 14.25 billion euro banknotes and 50 billion coinswill be produced for the 12 Member States of the euro area. The introduction of the banknotes andcoins is an enormous logistical challenge. As you know, the ECB has, therefore, decided that thefrontloading of euro banknotes and coins to credit institutions in the euro area and the sub-frontloading
6BIS Review 58/2001of euro banknotes and coins by credit institutions under special conditions to professional cash userscan begin on 1 September this year.Owing to its monetary nature, the euro cash changeover does not only present a logistical challenge,but also affects the economic analysis within the framework of the monetary policy strategy of theECB.A visible sign of the potential impact of the cash changeover on monetary developments is the annualrate of growth of currency in circulation which has been negative since the end of last year to stand at-2.9% in April. Preparations by euro-area residents for the cash changeover could be a factor in thesedevelopments. It is possible that this factor will become even more important during the course of theyear, when a growing number of the population pays in its liquid reserves to the banks, which are notdirectly needed as cash on hand. The effect of these transactions on overall developments in M3should, however, be relatively minor, as a large part of the liquid reserves, which is held as cash onhand, should be invested in deposits which are also included in M3. If this is the case, M3 growthshould largely remain unaffected.Not only the citizens of the euro area, but also non-euro area residents with cash holdings in thecurrent national currencies of the euro area countries will prepare themselves for the cashchangeover. In particular, this affects inhabitants from central and eastern Europe using DeutscheMark banknotes in parallel with their respective national currencies. According to estimates made bythe Deutsche Bundesbank, Deutsche Mark holdings abroad in the mid-1990s accounted for around30% to 40% of the German currency in circulation (see Franz Seitz: The circulation of the DeutscheMark abroad, Discussion Paper 1/95, Deutsche Bundesbank, May 1995). That is equivalent to aroundEUR 45 billion, which could potentially flow back into the euro area, presuming that the amount hasremained unchanged since then.According to all available sources, the actual flowback of cash holdings from abroad should, however,be a lot lower. Owing to its geographical proximity and the close trade links with central and easternEurope, the Deutsche Mark is used in many countries not only as a store of value but also as atransaction currency. Therefore, it is unlikely that the demand for the Deutsche Mark will be completelyreplaced by a demand for other non-euro area currencies. In addition to this, the exchange of nationalcurrencies of the euro area for euro will equally be possible outside of the euro area and it willprobably also be used to a large extent by the population. It is difficult to speculate over the behaviourof the informal side of the economy. At the same time, however, it should not be forgotten that we aretalking about a relatively small part of the economy, even though this part of the economy uses cashto a relatively large extent. In addition, empirical findings have, to date, given no hard evidence of anysignificant flowback of Deutsche Mark banknotes from abroad. In the light of this, it is unlikely thatthere will be any major effects on the growth of M3 or any significant impact on the exchange rate ofthe euro as a result of the euro cash changeover.In addition, the ECB will also closely monitor the potential price risks relating to the euro cashchangeover. In principle, it cannot be ruled out that businesses will try to use the changeover to theeuro in order to introduce price increases. This would temporarily affect inflationary developments inthe euro area. In this respect, the use of the dual price display method for a while will be of benefit forthe consumers, as it will allow them to make a direct comparison between the prices in their respectivenational denomination of the euro with the euro. Against this background, the ECB appeals to theconsumers to be vigilant in respect of possible price increases as a result of the euro cashchangeover.It should not be forgotten, however, that the conversion of prices in the former national currencies ofthe euro area into euro can sometimes lead to favourable rounding effects from the point of view ofpsychological price setting. In addition, hard competition in the retail sector will not make it possible forprice increases to be introduced easily. Comparisons with similar conversions in the past, such as theintroduction of the decimal system in the United Kingdom at the beginning of the 1970s or the abolitionof the cent in the Netherlands in 1983 show, above all, that the effect on price levels was generallynegligible. Finally, many euro area Member States have intensified the monitoring of prices. Theirgovernments have also guaranteed that overall, the general government will, in the context of the euroconversion, waive any receipts arising from any fees and charges levied by it and convert prices in aneutral manner or smoothed in favour of the consumer. Overall, possible short-term price and costburdens should, therefore, be seen against longer-term favourable price effects as a result of lowertransaction costs and greater price transparency in the euro area. Without a doubt, however, pricedevelopments relating to the euro cash changeover will need to be closely monitored over the coming
BIS Review 58/20017months by all participants, including the general government and consumers and last but not least theECB.6.ConclusionYou can be certain that by maintaining price stability in the euro area, monetary policy will continue todo its very best to contribute towards creating an attractive location, ensuring sound economic growthand prosperity for the population. I am confident that if fiscal policy and the social partners also maketheir contribution, the longer-term prospects for the euro area will be favourable and the euro area willbecome an increasingly attractive and dynamic location. I have no doubts that under suchcircumstances the success of EMU in the past shall continue into the future. I say this in view also ofthe enlargement of the European Union towards central and eastern Europe. Major reforms in the EUare needed in order to achieve further integration. The fact that further European integrationconstitutes a very positive growth potential by enhancing competition and as the result of the interplayof forces should not, however, be overlooked. I should like to refer back to my opening lines: holdingonto something which is well-established can hinder progress and change which in themselves canbring many advantages. This applies not only to the introduction of the euro but also to theenlargement of the European Union.Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attention.
BIS Review 58/20011Hermann Remsperger: The evolution of inflation measurement: a centralbanker's viewAddress by Professor Hermann Remsperger, Member of the Directorate of the Deutsche Bundesbank,at the symposium “Hedonic Methods in Price Statistics” held in Wiesbaden, 21 June 2001.*      *      *IFive years ago, the Boskin Commission reminded us that inflation measurement is anything butsimple. Although experts had known many of the problems for quite a long time, it took the BoskinReport to reawaken public awareness. This forced statistical offices – and, of course, also centralbanks – to sit up and take note of the situation in their countries. The Boskin Report prompted theBundesbank, too, to devote more attention again to the problems of inflation measurement.In the mid-sixties, the Bundesbank submitted a report to the Federal Fiscal Court in which thefollowing opinion was reached: “In general, it should not be considered a reduction in the value ofmoney if the cost-of-living index rises by, say, 1 per cent per annum; and an annual increase ofbetween 1 and 2 per cent in the index can be regarded as indicating a deterioration in the value ofmoney only with certain reservations.” In the Bundesbank’s annual derivation of its monetary target,this factor was reflected in a medium-term price assumption of 1½ to 2% per year.In 1998, our Research group arrived at the conclusion that the range of uncertainty in measuringinflation in western Germany is clearly below 1 per cent. There were hardly any thorough empiricalstudies on that topic for Germany at that time. And not very much has changed in the meantime.Yet this is exactly the reason why problems with measuring German prices will remain on our researchagenda. We certainly do not wish to take the easy way out by doctoring inflation figures downward,nor do we wish to overstate Germany’s real economic performance. Instead, it is our duty to run realitychecks on statistical methods, and to analyse their implications for economic policy in general andtheir importance for monetary policy in particular.This work is also important for the calculation of real aggregates in the national accounts. In our May2001 Monthly Report, we presented the results of a new study on this topic. It shows how real growthwould have developed in the second half of the nineties if US methods of calculating the nationalaccounts had been applied in Germany. The quantitative outcome of hedonic pricing and the use ofchained indices increased Germany’s statistical growth in the second half of the 90’s by nearly½ percentage point per annum.We presented this result of our research together with the Federal Statistical Office to the press. Andthis is just but one indication how excellently the Federal Statistical Office and the DeutscheBundesbank have been cooperating, in the field of German economic statistics in general and pricestatistics in particular. And let me point out that the Bundesbank’s inflation study in 1998 would nothave been possible without the generous support and the helpful comments given to us by membersof the staff at the Federal Statistical Office. Our joint sponsorship of this conference, which is sobrilliantly organised and chaired by Wolfgang Brachinger, is another example of good and closecooperation.III do know, however, that central bank research papers which take a critical look at statistical methodsare not always welcomed with open arms by statistical offices. For instance, it is often argued thatstudies oriented towards the ideal world of a cost-of-living index are hardly relevant to official statisticssince price statistics are founded on the principle of pure price comparisons.I do not want to go into details of this rather fundamental discussion at this stage. However, I believethat from an economic policy perspective it is not possible to generate a meaningful consumer priceindex without taking recourse to economic criteria. The minute one encounters the problem ofadjusting for quality changes, which is a centrepiece of this conference, there is no getting arounddrawing a picture of consumer assessments and consumers’ and sellers’ behaviour on the market.
2BIS Review 58/2001By the same token, I don’t think it would be desirable to look for the perfect “cost-of-living” index,meaning an index based on the sophisticated theoretical structure of microeconomics, without takinginto account the feasibility aspect. For all these reasons it is necessary to have an open dialoguebetween statistical practitioners, researchers and users.If we look at it that way, price statistics can never be static. Some years ago, Alan Greenspandelivered a speech in Frankfurt, quoting an official in the US government who once compared anation's statistical system to a tailor, measuring the economy much as a tailor measures a person for asuit – with the difference that the “person” we are measuring is running while we try to measure him.The only way the statistical system can succeed, the US official said, is to be just as fast and twice asflexible. That is the challenge that lies ahead, and it is, indeed, a large one.IIINow, five years after publication of the Boskin study, we are certainly allowed to ask the following twoquestions: What lessons have we actually learned? And what were the practical implications for pricestatistics?The first thing we’ve learned is that the statistical distortion which can occur at the uppermost level ofprice aggregation when using a fixed basket of goods is generally quite insignificant, if the indices arechanged to new, more up-to-date baskets of goods in a timely manner. This condition is sufficientlyfulfilled for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices. And this is the indicator of inflation used by theEuropean Central Bank to define its stability target.As for the lowest level of aggregation, Ernst Diewert has reminded us of something already preachedby Irving Fisher: We should at all costs avoid calculating the arithmetical mean of unweighted rates ofprice change. And that is exactly the reason, why the HICP is based exclusively on the geometricmean or on rates of change from average prices. So the European way of calculating the figures fulfillsa second important condition for proper price measurement.However, a big challenge arises with the vast field of new products, new types of products and newchannels of distribution. This poses a whole set of problems for official price statistics, and it has notyet been possible to solve them all in a fully satisfactory manner. For instance, it is hardly feasible totake due account of new goods and new types of outlets in “real time” when measuring inflation. In theHICP, therefore, we turn to a uniform threshold value: if the share of a new product exceeds 0.1 percent of total expenditure, this product should be included in the price index. It is true that this methodfails to capture the increase in consumer surplus generated by a new product and early pricedecreases. However, I see no other way to solve this problem. Incidentally, the remainingmeasurement bias is not likely to be very large, since fundamental product innovations tend to be rare.All in all the just mentioned 0.1 per cent provision seems to be adequate.The major problem of new product variants, and thus of adjusting for quality differences whenreplacing obsolete items remains. And this is a big issue in an environment marked by rapid productinnovations. And here I do not envy the statistical offices their jobs. Our research for Germany hasshown that, in practice, even uniform quality adjustment methods lead to diverging results dependingon the individual “price collector”. Therefore, centralisation of quality adjustment is the path oftenproposed. However, this is out of reach at the European level for the time being. Another way is toeliminate unreliable methods for quality adjustments so that the applied methods by individual “pricecollectors” will on balance result in unbiased estimates of the true price change. This is how Germanyhas been trying to solve the problem, and this has also been Eurostat’s method so far.In my view, the pragmatic approach should be carried out very carefully with all relevant partiescooperating in a network of experts. What I mean here – among other things – is accompanyingresearch on a permanent basis. Official methods have to be checked against potential alternatives.Hedonic price indices should be thoroughly developed and assessed.At the end of the conference, we may be better able to answer the question as to how far hedonicscan be used to generate indices in a timely manner. At any rate, there is much to be done regardingquality adjustment in price statistics.But before you go back to addressing the quality of price statistics tomorrow, it is now a pleasure forme to invite you to test the quality of our buffet. Unlike in the use of hedonics, here “there is a freelunch”.

BIS Review 57/20011David Klein: From price stability to financial stability: the situation in IsraelRemarks by Mr David Klein, Governor of the Bank of Israel, at the Ninth Annual EconomicConference, Caesaria, 21 June 2001.*      *      *En route to price stabilityAfter a fairly protracted process, we are beginning to grow accustomed to the concept of price stability.(cid:1) At the outset there were heated discussions on whether it was at all possible to achieve pricestability in Israel.(cid:1) When we asked ourselves what were our objectives regarding inflation, we answered,following the Economic Stabilization Program of 1985: “we will make every effort to lower it.”(cid:1) Towards the end of 1991 we set out on the path of annual inflation targets without knowingwhere it led or what obligations it entailed.(cid:1) Every year we came back to the questions of what was the appropriate target for thefollowing year, when should it be decided upon, and whether we could allow ourselves tolook further ahead than the next year.(cid:1) We debated whether inflation was the be-all and end-all, and whether it was possible to buymore growth at the price of higher inflation.(cid:1) We discussed whether inflation in Israel should be the same as that in the OECD, with orwithout Turkey.(cid:1) More than once we were uncertain whether it was right to adjust the inflation target upwards.(cid:1) We saw almost the whole world, advanced and emerging economies, gradually adopt thenorm of price stability as a trait of properly run countries wishing to integrate into the globaleconomy.(cid:1) On 16 August 2000 the government made the decision: a regime of price stability suits ustoo.(cid:1) As is our wont, we chose a roundabout route to price stability: before we finally come downto earth in 2003, the decision said, let’s first fly a little higher in 2001–02, perhaps for oldtime’s sake. It is not very clear why we first had to raise inflation before it could come down,maybe it was a yearning for the old, pointless arguments about how we may be able tocreate a few more jobs by juggling with inflation.Price stability does not arrive like manna from heaven, and we must remember that several obstaclesstill obstruct the path to achieving it, and these have to be removed. Some derive from thearrangements which were intended to make living with inflation more comfortable – these now make itmore difficult to beat inflation. Some of them arose out of attitudes widely ascribed to in the pastregarding the effect of the rate of interest on real activity. One obstacle which has attained prominencerecently is based on the almost mystic belief that the rate of interest has the power to offsetfar-reaching real effects – for example the effects on high-tech and related industries of the slowdownin the US, and the effect on tourism, construction, and agriculture of the security-relatedevents – without our having to pay the price of a rise in the balance of payments deficit andaccelerated inflation. Above all we must bear in mind that price stability is a system based on habit,and it takes time to acquire new habits.What is financial stability?As awareness of the importance of price stability increased in recent years, so did worldwiderecognition of the fact that a country aiming for sustainable growth must attain financial stability too.Financial crises have been a standard feature of advanced and emerging economies in the last twodecades, Israel among them.
2BIS Review 57/2001Such crises are characterized by wide fluctuations in prices of assets (real estate and shares) and inthe exchange rate, and by bankruptcies, or severe hardship, of financial institutions. A list of the mostprominent examples of such crises in Israel in the last twenty years includes:(cid:1) Persistent government difficulties in selling bonds at the beginning of the 1980s against thebackground of a two-digit deficit in terms of GDP, and three-digit inflation;(cid:1) The bank shares crisis of 1983;(cid:1) The unrestrained acceleration of real estate prices which accompanied the large-scaleimmigration of the 1990s;(cid:1) The bursting of the stock-exchange bubble in 1994;(cid:1) The imposition of limitations on the old pension funds in 1995 as part of a recovery program,in the light of their huge actuarial deficits;(cid:1) The provident-fund crisis in summer 1996.Several smaller crises also occurred en route, such as:(cid:1) The banks’ “special offer” of loans for the purchase of mutual funds in 1993;(cid:1) The large devaluation in October 1998, and the growing awareness of the significance ofexchange-rate risk, which had hitherto been considered a problem for the Bank of Israel totackle. This referred to the threat to banks’ stability not as a result of their own exposure, butof their customers’ unrestrained exposure.(cid:1) The lack of resources in the mortgage market which added to the problems facing the realestate industry in trying to adjust in the period following the influx of immigrants.The threats to financial stability in IsraelFinancial crises occur for two main reasons:The first is mismanagement of financial institutions. Dealing with this falls within the province ofsupervision, and I will not here go into the question of supervision of the financial markets, except tosay that a mechanism for proper coordination between the various supervisory authorities in Israel’seconomy is sorely needed, and it is a pity that it has not yet been activated.The second is artificial restrictions that were imposed by the authorities at some time or other on themechanism of the market. The removal of such restrictions is essential if financial crises are to beavoided. The major ones are:1. Earmarked bondsThe arrangement regarding bonds earmarked for the pension funds provides the clearest example ofsuch restrictions on the market mechanism. This arrangement systematically destroys the market fortradable government bonds, the existence of which is one of the preconditions for a market for privatebonds, providing the banking system with a basis for pricing for the system of medium- and long-termdeposits and credit.This phenomenon of earmarked bonds will spread even more quickly(cid:1) if the required tax reform assigning the tax benefits on pension savings mainly to savings forretirement is introduced;(cid:1) if the budget constraint on tax relief requires a distinction to be made between savings whichentitle the member to a pension and lump sum savings for retirement;(cid:1) if the move from unfunded to funded pensions follows the planned path;(cid:1) and if a Compulsory Pension Law is passed incorporating the rules which apply currently tothe pension funds.The best way out of the earmarked bonds arrangement is similar to the method used in the lifeinsurance field in the transition from guaranteed yield life insurance schemes to profit-sharingschemes. That is:
BIS Review 57/20013(cid:1) not to change the rules in the existing new pension funds, but to close them to newmembers;(cid:1) to ensure that pension funds established from now on are based only on the market. If thegovernment can support pension savings and wishes to do so beyond granting tax benefits,it would better do so directly vis-à-vis pensioners, and on a means tested basis.2. The crawling exchange-rate bandThe band is intended to contain, currently within fairly wide limits, possible fluctuations of the rate ofexchange. It is well known that the conditions which brought about the creation of the banddisappeared long ago:(cid:1) Initially the band served as an advanced version of the exchange rate, as a nominal anchorfor inflation. The exchange rate has not had this role to play for many years;(cid:1) Then, with the transition to an upward-sloping band, the slope of the band was defined asreflecting differences between inflation in Israel and that in other countries; these too havedisappeared;(cid:1) Next, in the wake of the development of high-tech industry, capital import for investmentbegan on a large scale. This capital inflow is not connected with differences in interest ratesor in inflation between Israel and other countries, so that it is illogical to limit exchange-ratefluctuations because of it;(cid:1) While these changes were taking place, and as we agreed in 1994 to allow the market todetermine the rate of exchange, a domestic foreign-exchange market developed. It involveddomestic banks and foreign financial institutions. Daily turnover is growing, and the markethas low volatility. The fact that the Bank of Israel avoids market intervention, and theexperience of external financial shocks have led to a better awareness among the public ofexchange-rate risk. This had a dual effect:a.Speculative activity is a rarity in the market.b.When assets and liabilities portfolios are being put together, interest-rate differentialsbetween Israel and abroad, which have existed for a long time and still exist areoutweighed by exchange-rate risk. Consequently, it is difficult to discern a change inthe composition of assets and liabilities portfolios in response to changes in interest-rate differentials around their current level, so that this component of capital flows hashardly affected the rate of exchange.In other words, interest-rate differentials do not explain why the actual rate ofexchange is close to the bottom limit of the band. The main reasons for the closenesslie in the inflow of long-term capital coupled with the upward slope of the limit of theband. For the sake of accuracy we should add the recent weakness of the euroagainst the dollar.On the other hand, protecting the lower limit of the band will cause financial complications:(cid:1) The purchase of foreign currency to lead towards a new equilibrium must be undertakenwhile prices are falling. The current positive slope, even if it falls to zero, does not allow thisto happen, so that it is a non-stabilizing factor.(cid:1) The obligation to purchase foreign currency means that the initiative in implementingmonetary policy is transferred to the importers of capital, although they have no intention ofparticipating in such management. They import capital according to their own needs, and notto inject into the economy in an ordered manner the liquidity it requires. It is clear that undersuch conditions monetary control may be affected.(cid:1) The instruments of absorption available to the Bank of Israel to neutralize the injectionderiving from the purchase of foreign currency are in the form of the banks’ deposits in theBank. The banks already deposit about a fifth of their unindexed sources in the Bank ofIsrael as a result of the problematic defense of the lower limit of the band in the years 1995–97. A recurrence of such an episode would increase the banks’ dependence on the Bank ofIsrael, a complete contradiction of the successful policy of deregulation pursued in the first
4BIS Review 57/2001half of the 1990s. Such increased dependence may raise questions concerning the banks’stability.(cid:1) Under such circumstances the Bank of Israel would again have to choose how to deal withthe losses inherent in such an activity. It could transfer them to the banks by paying them asimilar rate of interest on their NIS deposits in the Bank of Israel to the rate it receives on itsforeign-currency investments. The banks would of course pass this on to their customers bycutting the interest they pay their depositors and raising the interest they charge borrowers.And then there would be complaints about the high banking spread. Alternatively, the Bankof Israel could record the losses in its books, as it did on the previous occasion. In the finalanalysis this cost is of course borne by the taxpayer, and I believe that the last thing thegovernment wants to do is to raise the tax burden in such a roundabout way.We should bear in mind that we cannot evaluate in advance the importance of such a course of action.We know that on the last occasion, the Bank of Israel purchased $ 16.5 billion. An increase of only $ 1billion in the money supply would currently mean a rise of about 4 percent, whereas an annualincrease of 10 percent is considered too fast.  The simplest solution is to abolish the exchange-rateband. If the Bank of Israel has to defend it, the end result would be its abolition in any case, but afterincurring a high and unnecessary price. It is preferable to take such a step on our own initiative, andnot under pressure from the market.3.The ceiling on Treasury bills issuesBy law Treasury bills are an instrument for carrying out monetary policy, but we cannot fully use themfor this purpose because the creator of the tool also limited its quantity. In other words: Yes, you havean inflation target. You want tools for the job? Improvise!The outcome is that instead of implementing monetary policy via the capital market, we do so via thebanks, a more expensive and less efficient method. Why must we act in this tortuous way? To find theanswer to this question we may have to go back to the traditional work methods of the pre-State era.If the story were to end with the improvisations of the Bank of Israel, so be it. The rate of interestwould be, all in all, a little higher than it could have been. But this absurd limitation causes consumersand the economy real harm. In any normal country the Treasury bill market provides the basis for thegovernment bond market. As such it also provides the infrastructure for nonbank financialintermediation. In Israel, it strengthens the banks’ monopolistic hold over the money market.The implications are unequivocal:(cid:1) The banking spread in the unindexed sector is higher than required, to the disadvantage ofdepositors and borrowers;(cid:1) It is another obstacle to the development of the market for tradable securities, short-termcommercial paper, as an alternative to bank credit;(cid:1) It harms the economy’s ability to withstand financial crises, as the economy is totallydependent on the banks for financial intermediation.The Treasury bill ceiling causes persistent damage, and it should be abolished. It increases the cost ofmonetary policy, and causes harm to consumers and the economy as it acts as a millstone around itsneck and prevents the development of a nonbank money market.Can the horizon of monetary policy be broadened?Price stability is measured by changes in the CPI. The question is whether there is a connectionbetween the stability in the stock market and foreign currency market on the one hand, and pricestability on the other.It should be emphasized that the question is not whether the central bank should also have objectivesin the securities market (for example, to prevent sharp falls in the stock market) and in the foreigncurrency market (for example, to navigate the exchange rate along a particular route). It should not!As long as the arrangement of earmarked bonds, the exchange-rate band, and the Treasury bill ceilingexist, the central bank must steer clear from any intervention in the financial markets, both in itsactions, and in its statements. A similar conclusion applies, and to a similar extent, if fiscal discipline is
BIS Review 57/20015not maintained, and if the performance of the budget does not lead to a lowering of the governmentdebt/GDP ratio towards the level accepted as the norm worldwide.When these limitations no longer apply, we will have to reexamine the normal horizon of monetarypolicy. When there are no restrictions limiting the central bank’s choice of policy instruments, andwhen the culture of price stability has taken root, the Bank of Israel will be able to include reference tothe financial markets among its functions, with the aim of contributing to their stability.
BIS Review 56/20011Alan Greenspan: The growing need for skills in the 21st centuryRemarks by Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem, before the US Department of Labor 21st Century Workforce Summit, held in Washington, DCon 20 June 2001.*      *      *I am pleased to have the opportunity to be part of today’s 21st Century Workforce Summit andappreciate the hospitality of Secretary Chao and the Department of Labor.The past decade or so has been marked by a remarkable surge in technological innovation andbusiness efficiency. This period of rapid innovation has brought with it enormous opportunities toenhance living standards for a large majority of Americans. Our ability to take full advantage of theseopportunities depends crucially on how well we as a nation can integrate these new technologies intoour society.In my remarks today, I would like to offer some perspective on the challenges created by theinteraction of new technologies with the skills of the American workforce, and how the educationalsystem has in the past and can in the future respond to these challenges.The process of innovation is, of course, never ending. Over the past 100 years, for example, the rateof increase of the gross domestic product of the United States, adjusted for price change, hasaveraged around 3 percent per year. Yet only a fraction of that increase represents growth in thetonnage of physical materials – particularly oil, coal, wood, raw chemicals – and increases in theamount of manual labor employed in the production process. The remainder represents newvalue-adding insights into how to rearrange physical materials and labor inputs to better serve humanneeds – in short, the conceptual content of the GDP.The inexorably rising share of the nation’s output that is conceptual appears to have acceleratedfollowing World War II with the insights that led to the development of the transistor, microprocessor,laser, and fiber optic technologies. By the 1990s, these and other critical innovations had fostered anenormous new capacity to capture, analyze, and disseminate information and had begun to altersignificantly how we do business and create economic value, often in ways that were not foreseeableeven a decade ago. Indeed, it is the proliferation of information technology throughout the economythat makes the current period so special.The types of skills needed to interact with the new methods of adding value associated with thisdiffusion of information technologies are complex. One obviously needs a core of highly skilledworkers to push the frontier of technology forward and to make the newer technologies moreaccessible to the rest of the workforce. Once technology becomes more user friendly, the ability of thegeneral workforce to create value is greatly facilitated.What is particularly telling in this regard is how well the American economy has performed with aworkforce for which the average level of education has been roughly unchanged for a quarter of acentury. As labor markets tightened in the mid-1990s, the anecdotal reports of worker shortages wereworrisome. There were numerous stories of employers going through entire lists of people beforefinding someone who could do the job, and widespread concerns that a lack of high-tech skills amongAmerican workers would prevent much of the population from participating fully in the economic gainsassociated with the emerging high-tech revolution. Consistent with these anecdotes, in a nationalsurvey of small businesses, the percentage citing labor quality as their most important problem rosefrom less than 5 percent in 1993 to 20 percent by 1998.As it turned out, however, the capacity for American businesses to absorb the less educated part ofour workforce seems to have been far greater than these anecdotes implied. The unemployment ratefor adults with a high school education or less fell from 4¾ percent in 1998 to around 4 percent by themiddle of last year. And, while the proportion of small-business managers who worried about laborquality has remained elevated in the past few years, it did not increase further in spite of the decline inunemployment.One explanation for this phenomenon is the often-observed multiplier effects of technologicalbreakthroughs. For example, as engineers and programmers have developed increasingly moresophisticated hardware and software, the vast productive benefits of computers have become far
2BIS Review 56/2001more readily available to the average worker in recent years. Looking back a number of decades tothe early stages of the information technology revolution, we can see that COBOL and Fortran werethe “visas” into the world of technology. Those workers without very sophisticated programming skillscould not interface with the new computer-driven technologies and thus often could not takeadvantage of the potential productivity improvements associated with those technologies. But today’sincreasingly user-friendly software has enabled workers with far less education and skills to engendervalue added from new technologies that their older brothers and sisters could not have foreseen a halfgeneration earlier.In particular, we are finding that despite the awesome capabilities of our newer innovations, there arecertain skills inherent in all human beings that technology cannot replicate. Low-skilled workers indecades past had to rely principally on their manual labor skills to create value added. Today, thenewer technologies give similarly skilled workers the opportunity to vastly multiply theirvalue-producing capabilities by leveraging their ability to identify and classify. For example, retail salesclerks not only facilitate sales in the conventional manner, but also automatically engender books ofaccount, inventory control, and supplier reorders.But, while software has increased our capacity to integrate lower-skilled individuals into the workforce,the rapidity and unpredictability of innovation also imply a need to strengthen those cognitive skills ofour overall workforce. An increasing proportion of the workforce must be equipped not simply withtechnical know-how, but also with the ability to create, analyze, and transform information and toeffectively interact electronically with others.Moreover, learning will increasingly need to be a lifelong activity. The days when a high school orcollege education would serve a graduate throughout his or her working career are gone. Today'srecipients of diplomas should expect to have many jobs and to acquire and use an ever-expandingrange of skills over their working lives.It may not seem credible that an educational system shown by many studies to stifle learning betweenthe fourth and twelfth grades relative to the systems of our foreign trading partners can provide ourworkforce with the necessary intellectual tools going forward.But, while such studies suggest there is much to be done, there also are reasons to be optimistic. Inthe past, our educational system, defined in its widest sense, has been guided importantly by themarketplace toward the broader needs of our economy. Indeed, the history of education in the UnitedStates traces a path heavily influenced by two themes: the need for a workforce with the skills requiredto interact productively with the evolving economic structure, and a thirst for knowledge among theAmerican people.The educational system during the early years of the United States was far less formalized than today.There were, of course, grammar schools and colleges that catered to the wealthier segments ofsociety. But most individuals had little access to more than a minimal level of formal schoolingbecause they were needed to work on the farm. In 1800, for example, more than 90 percent ofAmericans lived on farms. Yet, our ancestors understood the value of education, and less formalarrangements were frequently used; home-based schooling, private tutors, and church-sponsoredSunday schools are just a few examples. The one-room schoolhouse on the prairie still provokes aremarkable, though perhaps not wholly justified, degree of nostalgia.People felt that once a child learned how to read and write, an unlimited world opened up. The focusin those early years was thus often on increasing literacy – beyond that, children were expected toread books to satisfy their interest in other subjects such as science or philosophy. In this sense, theinquisitive nature of the people of that time drove the need to know beyond the measures of formaleducation in those early years.Evidence of our ancestors’ intellectual capacity and desire to acquire a broader education areabundant. Abraham Lincoln, for example, had little formal education while a young child, but oncetaught how to read by his mother, he read voraciously in a wide range of subjects. And one can onlymarvel at the letters that twenty-year-old soldiers sent back home in the Civil War. They wereremarkably thoughtful and literate. These soldiers, presumably with little formal education, wereobviously reasonably well read. They did have the advantage, of course, of a world without television.Early in the twentieth century, advances in technology began to require workers with a higher level ofcognitive skills, for instance the ability to read manuals, to interpret blueprints, or to understandformulas. Our market-driven educational system responded: In the 1920s and 1930s, high schoolenrollment in this country expanded rapidly, pulling youth from rural areas, where opportunities were
BIS Review 56/20013limited, into more productive occupations in business and broadening the skills of students to meet theneeds of an advancing manufacturing sector.At the same time, our system of higher education was also responding to the advances in economicprocesses. Although many states had established land grant schools earlier, support for these schoolsaccelerated in the late nineteenth century as institutions located in states that specialized in agricultureand mining sought to take advantage of new scientific methods of production. A century ago, thecontent of education at an American college had evolved from a classically based curriculum to onecombining the sciences, empirical studies, and modern liberal arts.Universities responded to the need for the application of science – particularly chemistry andphysics – to the manufacture of steel, rubber, chemicals, drugs, petroleum, and other goods requiringthe newer production technologies. Communities looked to their institutions of higher learning forleadership in scientific knowledge and for training of professionals such as teachers and engineers.During this time, the scale and scope of higher education in America was shaped by the recognitionthat research – the creation of knowledge – complemented teaching and training – the diffusion ofknowledge. In broad terms, the basic structure of higher education remains much the same today, andit has been one that has proven sufficiently flexible to respond to the needs of a changing economy.Certainly, if we are to remain preeminent in transforming knowledge into economic value, the U.S.system of higher education must remain the world leader in generating scientific and technologicalbreakthroughs and in preparing workers to meet the evolving demands for skilled labor. However, thepressure to enable all workers to benefit from the new technologies also requires that we strengthenthe significant contributions of other types of training and educational programs, especially for thosewith lesser skills.The notion that formal degree programs at any scholastic level or that any other training programestablished today can be crafted to fully support the requirements of one’s full working life has becomesubject to increasing doubt. It is evident that we need to foster a flexible education system – one thatintegrates work and training and that serves the needs both of experienced workers at different stagesin their careers and of students embarking on their initial course of study.Community colleges, for example, have become important providers of job skills training not just forstudents who may eventually move on to a four-year college or university but for individuals with jobs– particularly workers seeking to retool, retrain, or simply to broaden their skills. The increasingavailability of courses that can be taken “at a distance” over the Internet means that learning can moreeasily occur outside the workplace or the classroom.Economists have long argued that a significant proportion of the work knowledge that one acquires ina lifetime is produced on the job. Several decades ago much of that on-the-job training was acquiredthrough work experience. Today, businesses and labor unions are placing greater emphasis on thevalue of formal education and training programs – ranging from corporate universities to partnershipswith community colleges and other providers – as well as relationships with public agencies, includingwelfare-to-work and school-to-work programs. These efforts recognize that technologically advancedlearning must be grounded in real-world curriculums that are relevant to changing business needs andthat it be provided in flexible venues that open access to development of skills to as many workers aspossible.Meeting the complex range of skills likely to be required of our workforce in the future presents asignificant challenge to our educational system. But it is a challenge we cannot afford to ignore. Wemust provide young people with the opportunities and incentives to learn. We must ensure that ourpopulation at all ages and all competencies receives an education that will allow full and continuingparticipation in this dynamic period.
BIS Review 55/20011Ernst Welteke: Trends in international bankingAddress by Mr Ernst Welteke, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the International ArabBanking Summit held in Frankfurt, 19 June 2001.*      *      *Ladies and Gentlemen,I would like to welcome you to the International Arab Banking Summit 2001 in Frankfurt, the City of theEuro. Frankfurt is home not only to the Bundesbank and the European Central Bank but also to asmany as 340 banks, including more than 130 foreign banks. It is the leading financial centre inGermany and the euro area.The heart of the Eurosystem is the right place to discuss trends in international banking, such aselectronic banking, as well as questions regarding a deepening of the Euro-Arab partnership.IThe success of the common currency in the European Monetary Union has rung in a new phase ofdebate about monetary unions. This holds for all continents, for North and South America, for Asia aswell as the Arab countries. The decision to adopt further steps leading towards a common monetaryunion by the Gulf Cooperation Council at the end of last year attracted a lot of attention.Clearly, the process of integrating different economies is an arduous one, involving not only thesurrendering of a national monetary policy but also a process of integrating the real economy.In Europe this process took almost half a century, from the first pro-European declaration to the fullintegration of monetary policy in the European monetary union. Harmonising tariffs and creating asingle European Market with free movement of goods, services, capital and labour created the basisfor a common monetary policy. In addition the convergence process caused macroeconomic policyand data to converge to such an extent that the abolition of national monetary policy would no longercause major distortions.The Arab countries face similar problems in terms of tariffs and trade barriers. Clearly, the basis for acommon monetary policy is a single market for the real economy, the financial system and labourmarkets. Even within the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) there is still a long way to go.There are, however, some encouraging characteristics in the GCC for integration. The similarity of theeconomies is a striking feature. All depend to a large extent on energy exports. The price of crude oilis by far the single most important factor determining the business cycle. In addition to the similarsectoral structure of the economies the common language represents an integrating element. Thesame holds true for the common culture, religion and the similar geography.To reach the goal of an Arab Monetary Union, particularism has to be overcome, and factorspromoting integration have to be supported. Overcoming particularism would foster communicationwithin the region and with partners in other regions.All Arab countries are endeavouring to develop their economies towards a more balanced structure.This ongoing modernisation in many Arab countries offers chances for the Arab countries and the restof the world alike. Sectoral diversification forms the basis for growing intra-regional trade. It will reducereliance on energy exports and create a more self-sustaining Arab economy. The world economywould clearly benefit from Arab industry playing a more lively and active role.Strengthening the domestic financial sector in Arab countries seems to me to be a necessary step inthis direction. The quick adoption of modern instruments like electronic banking and the coming revivalof the important financial centre in the 60s and 70s – Beirut – are only two examples of promisingdevelopments in this region’s financial markets.The Arab banking sector has successfully embarked on the current global trends in this industry.Based on its generally sound profitability it meets the challenges of globalisation, concentration andelectronisation.
2BIS Review 55/2001Modernization and diversification of the real economy will cause the need for banks to deal with thedemand and risks of non-oil-business. The dependence of the whole economy on the price of oil willdecrease, and so will the dependence of the financial sector. As a compensation a greater diversifiedeconomy provides for an easier risk distribution. In addition, liberalization, a more competitiveenvironment and the trend towards lesser state control will require a more active role of bankers.I have no doubt that the Arab banks will prove their success in dealing with a changing environmentand in reorganizing their business. They have impressively proven their creativity in dealing with thegrowing field of islamic banking. Maybe western banks can learn from this field for the growing venturecapital markets.Another challenge for Arab banks is electronic banking. However, the late but very quick adoption ofinternet banking and the high acceptance of this new medium provide for a good starting point.The European experience on electronic banking in a nutshell is: Banks will become “bricks and clicksbanks”. Many services can be digitalized and provided electronically, but not all. The combination ofdigital and personal services seems to be the successful strategy at present.The overall outlook for Arab banks hinges on the overall economic perspectives. These give rise tohope. Growth is picking up, inflation rates are kept relatively low and modernization of the economicstructure is proposed by leading businessmen and politicians. This will be supported by the relatively“young” population – in many Arab countries more than 50 per cent of the population are younger than20. This in itself provides for a rising competiveness and creativity in the economy.IIHaving this in mind Europe may be of special interest for Arab countries for two reasons: First, as apotential partner for economic cooperation and second, as an example of successful integration.The main development for financial markets in Europe has been the launch of a new currency, theEuro. The financial sector in Europe benefits to a large extent from the monetary union and theevolution of a single European financial market. That implies greater transparency, more competitionand more liquidity.Germany as a financial centre benefits from this – in everyone’s interests. Functioning, liquid andsound financial markets steer capital towards those areas of the real economy where it brings thehighest yield. In this way, they contribute to improving welfare, strengthen the economy and createjobs.The ECB, as a constituent part and the centre of the European System of Central Banks, is domiciledhere in Frankfurt. This has positive implications for Germany as a financial centre. It does strengthenthe self-confidence of the credit institutions located in Frankfurt, and – at least every fortnight – itdraws the attention to Frankfurt when the meetings of the Governing Council of the European CentralBank take place. This is where European monetary policy decisions are taken.The direct advantages of the monetary union are increasingly being appreciated. It is no longerpossible for exchange-rate fluctuations to distort competition. There is no longer a need for theeconomy to engage in hedging activities in cross-border trade and foreign direct investment.Transaction costs in the markets have diminished, and prices are directly comparable.These are advantages not only for the economy, but also for every citizen – advantages which makethemselves felt for every transaction, every trading operation, every trip abroad.The question arises as to whether the introduction of the single currency has led to the development ofa single, enlarged European financial market. It is precisely in this area that much was expected fromthe euro – when compared with the US financial market.Regarding the money market, these expectations have undisputedly been met. The individual nationalmoney markets in the euro area have rapidly combined to form a single euro money market.The capital markets are changing somewhat more slowly. On the capital markets the euro is not theonly factor promoting change. The trends towards globalisation and deregulation as well as newdevelopments in technology are also playing a major role. The markets have become more liquid,larger, deeper and more complex.
BIS Review 55/20013It is true that on the way towards a single European capital market more work has to be done.Institutional, technical and legal barriers are hampering the process of integration. The fact that thereis no single sovereign issuer, but rather 12 different government issuers, undoubtedly contributes tothe certain degree of fragmentation that still exists. In this context, the benchmark position of theGerman Bund is something of which we can be particularly proud. The great diversity of issuers will,for the time being, remain a characteristic feature of the European capital market.The same is true for the large number of stock exchanges and exchange-like trading systems as wellas the different clearing and securities settlement systems. This does not, however, rule out thepossibility that the individual capital markets will become progressively closer to each other in terms oftheir economic organisation. This is something the institutional investors themselves are alreadytaking care of.There are many signs that a more market-oriented financing structure is evolving in the euro area.Enterprises are increasingly meeting their financing needs directly through the capital markets, that is:by means of negotiable paper.The dynamism of this disintermediation process may be gauged by the development of the equitymarket: the degree of market capitalisation has increased significantly. This is a reflection not only ofhigher equity prices but also of the steadily rising total number of enterprises listed on the stockexchange.A major contribution to this development has been made by the Neuer Markt (new market) of theFrankfurt stock exchange. This is where young, innovative enterprises obtain access to risk capital. Interms of the Neuer Markt, Germany has the top position among European growth markets – even ifsome investors may have overlooked the fact that this is a market for risk capital.In addition, the market for corporate bonds is on the advance. Alongside the introduction of the euroitself, a major driving force has been the continuing restructuring of the corporate landscape.However, changes are not restricted to the financial markets themselves. The entire financial sector,including the whole range of financial intermediaries and financial institutions, is affected by them. Asa result of the loss of the “home-field advantage” represented by the Deutsche Mark, at the start ofmonetary union the German credit institutions entered into competition with all the other banks in theeuro area. All of them are now selling the same basic product: in other words, the euro. Besides that,credit institutions are faced with increasing competition from direct banks, online brokers, insurancecompanies, free investment companies, and so on.Possible responses to the new competitive situation are either consolidation – including hostiletakeovers – or specialisation. As we have had to learn from some examples from the recent past, themerging of long-established banks is not an easy undertaking: at the time when the mergers are to beimplemented, at the latest, there is a clash of different corporate cultures, and problems could emerge.This applies all the more in the case of cross-border mergers.At present, consolidation in the financial sector is taking place mainly at the national level. However,the situation may well change in the future. The euro has the effect of promoting competition. Itensures transparency and makes comparisons within the euro area easier.Those involved in the legislative process in Germany are nowadays aware that the underlyingstatutory and regulatory conditions are crucial to a financial centre’s success. Since the early nineties,the German legislature has passed three special acts for promoting the financial market. A fourth is toenter into force in this legislative period. So far, the main points of emphasis of the legislation havebeen the reorganisation of stock exchange supervision and the establishment of the FederalSupervisory Office for Securities Trading here in Frankfurt. In particular, the Securities Trading Actprovides the Federal Supervisory Office for Securities Trading with instruments for investigating insideroffences.The Fourth Financial Market Promotion Act is intended to strengthen further the integrity of thefinancial markets and broaden the scope of action available to stock exchanges and investmentcompanies.The supervisory system for financial markets in Germany and some other European countries isreformed to meet the challenges of globalisation and securitisation. In addition the trend towards amore capital market orientation will be met by the requirements for banking supervision as set up inthe Basle II agreement.
4BIS Review 55/2001Overall, the financial sector in Europe and Germany as a financial centre are well equipped to face thechallenges and make use of the opportunities that the euro presents.Moreover the European Monetary Union has led to a region of stability unprecedented in Europeanhistory. Currently, the area of stable money goes from the Atlantic Ocean to the Aegean Sea, andfrom the Strait of Gibraltar to the Arctic Ocean.Inflation as well as interest rates have gone down to levels hitherto unexperienced in manyparticipating countries. Growth and stability in the euro area will be promoted by the commoncurrency. Many changes in the political and structural conditions in Europe are yet to come. Europe isa region departing for more integration and a brighter future. This makes it particular attractive forpotential partners.IIIThe long history of fruitful European-Arab partnership leaves us with a unique legacy and forms abasis for us today to revive our commercial, cultural and political links. Especially the traditionally goodGerman – Arab relations of the past are a call to improve the current cooperation between these tworegions. 300 million Europeans and about 350 million Arabs, including all people in the Middle East,need to cooperate closely. A united Europe may include east and south-east European states withinthe foreseeable future. By then, the Middle East would be a direct neighbour of the euro area. Clearly,good neighbourly relations – marked by peace, fairness and much closer economic interrelationshipsthan today – should be in the interests of both regions.Both regions have a lot to offer. The Arab region is still gaining in importance for international stabilityand energy supply. Its large role in international finance, not only by the recycling of petrodollars, isbeing acknowledged. Within a couple of years the Arab countries will probably also be betterrepresented in international organisations and better integrated in world politics and the globaleconomy.I do know that the European Union is seen as a highly instrumental – or even natural – partner in theprocess of modernisation which Arab countries are undergoing at present. Therefore, the process ofcultural and economic convergence between these two regions should be accelerated. Economic andtechnological integration, cultural respect and political necessity have been identified as itscharacteristics.Conferences like this offer a great opportunity to enhance mutual understanding. May this conferencealso pave the way for mutual beneficial cooperation.
BIS Review 55/20011Otmar Issing: Monetary policy and financial marketsSpeech by Professor Otmar Issing, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, atthe ECB Watchers Conference, Frankfurt am Main, 18 June 2001.*      *      *In my remarks today I would like to discuss the conduct of monetary policy and its interaction with thefinancial markets. As we know, monetary policy is effective by working through financial markets andtherefore the markets are a key part of the transmission process. The smooth conduct of monetarypolicy is therefore supported by well functioning financial markets. Thus one major challenge formonetary authorities is to interact with the financial markets in a way which fosters the effectiveconduct of monetary policy in pursuit of its objective of price stability.My remarks will be concentrated on three main aspects of the relationship between the monetaryauthority and the financial markets.(cid:1) Firstly, I will begin by addressing the question of whether it is financial markets that shouldreact to the monetary authority or the monetary authority that should react to financialmarkets. Perhaps not surprisingly, I will argue that leadership on the part of the monetaryauthority is key in order to ensure price stability over the medium term. However, it should beclear – to paraphrase Alan Meltzer – that when policy is conducted in the context of aconsistent strategy it leads to a systematic decision-making process that uses information ina consistent and predictable way.(cid:1) This links to my second point when I will review the evidence from the financial markets onthe predictability and credibility of ECB policy since the start of Stage 3. I shall argue that theevidence strongly suggests that ECB policy has been credible throughout and – by andlarge – also predictable.(cid:1) Thirdly, I shall discuss the motivation behind the decision to cut official interest rates on the10th of May this year as I believe that this offers an interesting example of when surprisingthe markets is unavoidable.In the discussion of the interrelationship between monetary policy and financial markets one can seetwo distinct strands in the argument. The first is that the monetary authority leads the financialmarkets. In this case monetary policy leads by signalling its intentions to – and impacting on – thefinancial markets. In the case of the ECB our intentions are clearly signalled to market participants viaour stability oriented monetary policy strategy. The commitment to price stability over the medium termand a systematic analysis of all the available information should induce ‘rule like’ behaviour on behalfof market participants. This leads them to react to new developments in a manner consistent with themonetary policy strategy, thus aiding the smooth conduct of monetary policy. For example, where themarkets correctly anticipate that a new piece of information will lead to a change in official interestrates they will do ‘much of the work’ themselves through a change in the term structure.In such an environment, communication by the monetary authority is of the utmost importance and isdirected towards informing the markets of its assessment of the outlook for price stability andpreparing the markets for future policy moves, thereby avoiding unnecessary volatility and supportingthe smooth conduct of policy.Another idea is that the financial markets lead and the monetary authority follows. In such a world, themonetary authority will seek to satisfy the expectations of financial markets – in the extreme case:whatever they are – by never surprising them. If the monetary authority does not do what is expectedthe financial markets will ‘punish’ it – for example by demanding higher risk premia to cover the greateruncertainty. An important point to bear in mind here is that it can sometimes appear that the financialmarkets are leading the monetary authority when in fact the reverse is true. This is because the ‘rulelike’ behaviour I mentioned earlier will lead the markets to correctly anticipate monetary policydecisions and hence to react in advance of the monetary authorities. Nevertheless, it is still themonetary policy strategy of the monetary authority that determines the reaction.As I have already indicated I do not support the idea that the monetary authority should ‘follow themarkets’. To explain why I will rely on a quote from Allan Blinder, who puts the argument verysuccinctly:
2BIS Review 55/2001“...Following the markets may be a nice way to avoid unsettling financial surprises, which is alegitimate end in itself. But I fear it may produce rather poor monetary policy, for several reasons. Oneis that speculative markets tend to run in herds and to overreact to almost everything. Central bankersneed to be more cautious and prudent. Another is that financial markets seem extremely susceptibleto fads and speculative bubbles, which sometimes stray far from fundamentals. Central bankers mustinoculate themselves against whimsy and keep their eyes on the fundamentals. Finally, traders infinancial markets – even those for long-term instruments – often behave as if they have ludicrouslyshort time horizons, whereas maintaining a long time horizon is the essence of proper centralbanking.”Obviously there are few people who would argue that it makes sense for monetary authorities toslavishly follow the expectations of financial markets. Nevertheless, it is clearly desirable for policy tobe predictable in order to reduce uncertainty and volatility in financial markets. So, why does themonetary authority not always satisfy the expectations of financial markets? There are a number ofpossible explanations that I would like to highlight. However, before doing so, there is one point that Iwould like to emphasise most strongly. This is that there can be no interest in the monetary authoritydeliberately aiming to surprise the financial markets. It is sometimes suggested that central bankersoccasionally set out to ‘trick’ the markets into expecting one policy outcome and then deliver a quitedifferent one. Let us be quite clear that a monetary authority which did this would merely increasevolatility in the financial markets and damage its own credibility. It would do nothing to aid the smoothconduct of monetary policy and the pursuit of price stability.Turning to more plausible reasons why financial markets can sometimes be surprised by monetarypolicy decisions, the first point I would like to highlight is that of informational asymmetry between themarkets and the monetary authority. More specifically, the monetary authority has some piece ofinformation at its disposal which market participants do not. With the rapid and effective methods ofinformation dissemination that are now available this is not a situation that is likely to emerge veryoften. Nonetheless, as I shall discuss a little later, asymmetric information can sometimes explain whymarket expectations are not fulfilled.The second point is that – even with the same information sets – the monetary authority and thefinancial markets may not share the same assessment of the economic, financial or monetarysituation. There may simply be a difference between the dominant view in the markets and the view ofthe monetary authority with regard to the significance of new pieces of information and theirimplications for the conduct of monetary policy. The occasional emergence of such differences of viewis inevitable and may lead to the central bank surprising markets with its policy moves.A third reason relates to credibility – perhaps the financial markets do not believe that the monetaryauthority is deciding policy according to its announced decision making framework. Maybe they thinkthat it is vulnerable to outside pressure which may lead it to deviate from its stated objectives.One way of addressing all of these points is through good communication with the markets. This leadsto the fourth reason why the monetary authority may sometimes surprise markets – that there is someform of communication problem between the monetary authority and the markets. Perhaps thefinancial markets do not fully understand the decision framework used by the monetary authorityand/or its assessment of current and prospective economic, monetary and financial developments. Iwould argue that some ‘teething problems’ in communication with financial markets are inevitable for anew institution. The ECB is still learning about how best to communicate its message to the markets.The financial markets are still learning – from our track record – about the application of the ECB’smonetary policy strategy.I will now turn my attention to the evidence on the extent to which ECB monetary policy has been bothcredible and predictable in the eyes of the financial markets.A key indicator of credibility of ECB monetary policy comes from expectations of inflation implied bythe differences between the returns on real and nominal bonds. In this regard, the break-even inflationrate French index linked bonds has been consistently been in line with the ECB’s quantitativedefinition of price stability, indicating a persistently high degree of credibility for ECB monetary policy.Moving to the question of predictability it seems fair to say that policy moves have generally beenanticipated by the money markets. This can be seen if one looks at the implied short term interestrates and the subsequent official interest rate moves which seem to exhibit a high degreecorrespondence. According to work undertaken by Gaspar, Perez-Quiros & Sicilia (2001) whoexamine the behaviour of overnight interest rates, the markets do not appear to make systematic
BIS Review 55/20013errors with respect to monetary policy announcements. Furthermore, developments in the volatilityimplied by options on 3-month EURIBOR futures indicate that the degree of uncertainty amonginvestors with respect to future developments in short-term interest rates generally declines followingan interest rate change by the ECB. Indeed, the extent of this uncertainty around the time of interestrate changes seems to have diminished in magnitude over time. This is consistent with the notion thatinvestors have become more confident in their forecasts of future short-term interest ratedevelopments prior to ECB monetary policy announcements.Nevertheless, one could not claim that on every single occasion policy has always been wellanticipated by the money markets. This can be seen in the fact that on two occasions this year – onthe 21st and 22nd of February and the 12th and 17th of April – there was underbidding in theEurosystem’s Main Refinancing Operations. It appears that most market participants were expecting areduction in interest rates and therefore preferred not to participate in the auctions. When theseexpectations were not fulfilled there was a shortage of liquidity in the market.Policy moves also seem to have been generally well anticipated in the bond markets. Since the startof Stage Three of EMU, official ECB interest rate changes appear to have had only a limitedimmediate impact on nominal bond yields as measured by the average yield on 10-year governmentbonds issued in the euro area.Furthermore, ECB rate changes do not appear to have induced any noticeable additional volatility inthe break-even inflation rate on French index linked bonds. This would seem to suggest that themonetary policy actions of the ECB have not brought about any significant revisions among investorswith respect to the objectives of the ECB. In this sense, the actions by the ECB appear to have beentransparent to the markets. Bond market volatility has also declined. Implied volatility on 10-yearGerman Bund futures fell markedly during the course of 2000 and has subsequently stabilised.In sum, I would argue that the evidence from the financial markets supports the idea that since thestart of the Stage 3, ECB policy has always been credible and has usually been predictable. By andlarge the communication strategy with the markets has worked surprisingly well for a new institution.Nevertheless, it is occasionally necessary for central banks to surprise the markets. As I have alreadymentioned, some recent monetary policy decisions have attracted attention because it was felt thatthey were not well anticipated by the markets. Most notably the decision to lower official interest rateson the 10th of May this year came as a surprise to financial markets.The decision to make a 25-basis-point rate in interest rates was seen by the ECB as an adjustment ofthe level of interest rates to somewhat lower inflationary pressure over the medium term. As regardsthe first pillar of the monetary policy strategy, it was felt that monetary developments no longer poseda risk to price stability. As regards the second pillar, it was felt that upward risks to price stability overthe medium term had diminished somewhat.The change in assessment of the risks to price stability under the first pillar provides an interestingillustration of the problems faced by a central bank in communicating policy through financial markets.However, the circumstances of this monetary policy decision were unusual because the change inassessment came after it became possible to quantify significant upward distortions in M3 moneysupply growth. For some time, there have been indications that the monetary growth figures aredistorted upwards by non-euro area residents’ purchases of negotiable paper included in M3. Aroundthe time of the preparation for the Governing Council meeting, it became clear that the magnitudes ofthis distortion were both significant and higher than previously expected. As regards holdings ofmoney market fund units/shares by non-euro residents the distortion has become greater in recentmonths and currently amounts to around 0.5 percentage points in the annual growth rate of M3. Therehave also been non-negligible distortions to the annual rate of growth of M3 as a result of non-euroarea residents’ holdings of other marketable paper included in M3. Precise statistical information onthis is still being developed. Nevertheless, preliminary evidence indicates that this distortion may havebeen similar in size to that related to non-resident holdings of money market fund units/shares.Given the magnitude of these distortions it was clear that such information needed to be placed in thepublic domain without delay. However, this created a dilemma – whether to release such informationand consider the policy implications immediately or to give financial markets time to ‘digest’ theinformation before reappraising policy.If the information had been released first then the ECB may not have surprised the markets with asubsequent policy move. However, imagine the press conference following the Governing Council
4BIS Review 55/2001meeting when the revised M3 data were released. You can be sure that one of the first questions tothe President would have been: ‘Against the background of this new and important information – whydid you not act today? Was it impossible to reach a consensus?...etc, etc’.Market participants may – quite reasonably – have wondered why the ECB had not reacted to thisnew information. They may even have drawn erroneous conclusions as to the relative importance ofthe first pillar in the ECB’s monetary strategy. There would have been weeks of uncertainty andspeculation about the likelihood of a policy easing and how large such an easing might turn out to be.Another risk from delaying would have been the possible re-emergence of underbidding.To conclude, I would argue that it is not always possible or desirable for a monetary authority to satisfythe expectations of financial markets. Nevertheless, the evidence from the financial markets indicatesthat ECB monetary policy has always been credible and also – for the most part – has been wellanticipated by the markets. There is also some evidence that volatility in financial markets at the timeof interest rate decisions has been declining over time.The ECB has, on occasions, been forced to surprise markets with policy decisions. However ‘surprise’is never the goal or deliberate intention of monetary policy. Nevertheless, as indicated by themonetary policy decision of the 10th of May this year, when new and important information becomesavailable it is sometimes necessary to act in a way which was not expected by market participants.
BIS Review 54/20011Jean-Claude Trichet: Preserving financial stability in an increasingly globalisedworldKeynote speech by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, Governor of the Banque de France, at the EuropeanFinancial Markets Convention (EFMC 2001), Paris, 15 June 2001.*      *      *Ladies and Gentlemen,It is a great pleasure for me to participate in this European Financial Markets Convention. Theimpressively dense program of the Convention illustrates that the integration of financial markets inEurope is a major and multi-dimensional challenge. The Banque de France and the Eurosystem havea strong interest in all these issues. In particular, a safe and efficient functioning of the clearing andsettlement systems of the euro area is crucial for the stability and efficiency of the financial system andfor the good implementation of monetary policy. The consolidation of the market infrastructure,currently underway, will contribute to reaching these objectives through the fostering of market liquidityand the reduction of transaction costs. There is however no single path for such a consolidation: it willbe up to the market to select the way which best fits its needs, while it will be up to regulators and tothe Eurosystem to make sure that the resulting infrastructure is adequately safe, efficient and reliable.I would like now to share with you some views from the broader perspective of financial globalisation.As you know, the globalisation of the world economy and the development of financial markets weredriven by two key factors:(cid:1) firstly, financial deregulation -reinforced in Europe by the setting up of the single market andsubsequently of the Economic and Monetary Union- which liberalised capital flows andenhanced competition among financial sectors;(cid:1) and secondly, technical and financial innovation, which simultaneously paved the way for thecreation of financial markets that are deep, liquid and interconnected.What is interesting to stress regarding financial globalisation is that the interaction of free capitalmovements within interconnected markets, increasing integration of market segments and hedgingopportunities provided by new financial instruments have allowed a better fit between the financingcapacities and borrowing requirements of governments, households and companies. The use ofmarket interest rates, which represent the markets’ consensus on the risk incurred at a moment, as adriving force is fully beneficial to an efficient allocation of capital.Lowering the barriers to entering the financial sector, the free circulation of information and fiercercompetition have also brought financial markets closer to a situation of pure and perfectcompetition, which is beneficial to all consumers.Last but not least, the growth of market financing has allowed savings to be channelled directly intoinvestment. Reducing the share of bank financing, and consequently that of money creation, hasenabled a less inflationary financing of the economy. Thus increased, monetary stability hasproduced tangible and positive effects and contributed decisively to a strong and sustainable growthof the world economy.However, while globalisation and financial integration have decisively contributed to improving overalleconomic efficiency, experience also suggests that financial asset prices have experienced in somecircumstances somewhat erratic developments. The rapid emergence of the "new economy" bubble in1999 and early 2000- followed by a series of sharp corrections- illustrated the potential of markets forproviding funding to the real economy, particularly to the most innovative sectors; but it demonstratedagain the tendency of markets to over-react, moving from excessive optimism to disproportionatepessimism, with the ensuing negative consequences for the behaviour of firms and households.Thus financial authorities have been confronted with boom-bust episodes which must be carefullymonitored, since they could affect global monetary and financial stability. I would like therefore toconsider two issues here:(cid:1) First, some factors encouraging excessively homogeneous market behaviour may hinder asmooth and efficient functioning of the markets, and
2BIS Review 54/2001(cid:1) Second, the authorities might reflect on some ways of fostering more diverse behaviour onthe markets.Some factors encouraging excessively homogeneous market behaviour may hinder a smoothand efficient functioning of the marketsEven though fixed interest rate markets have a tendency to be somewhat contra-cyclical, financialasset price have tended to fluctuate widely and sometimes deviate from economic fundamentals forlong periods of time.Experience suggests that asset price cycles continue to be very substantialIn the last two decades market forces have indeed tended to cause misalignments betweenequilibrium and actual asset prices. Stock markets in particular have experienced this phenomenon.But in foreign exchange markets as well, prices have also a tendency to diverge substantially fromtheir “equilibrium level”, although those divergences have been contained through fruitful G7co-operation during the last 15 years.In addition, some markets have seen an increase in volatility and frequent volatility peaks.Although cyclical moves should be clearly distinguished from volatility, the latter may in somecircumstances exceed what can be considered optimal, making the price determination mechanismless efficient and thus contributing to misalignments.Moreover, as demonstrated by a number of financial crises during the last two decades, contagionamong countries and across financial markets has been frequent. As a result, investors havefaced asset price fluctuations that might be more synchronised than before.Lastly, the connections between credit, asset price and business cycles have tended to amplifycyclical swings. Credit, in particular, is playing an important role in asset price fluctuations. Observedin particular during the “speculative bubbles” of the 1980s and early 1990s, this trend has persisted.Another example is provided by boom-bust cycles in asset prices which have often been associatedwith sharp economic contractions.Several factors are in play when financial asset prices experience amplified movesI shall give a few examples.Some market participants have become more inclined to engage in "short-termism", that is, they mightbe too preoccupied with their short-term results. This trend might result, in particular, from growingpressure to yield immediate financial results that are not necessarily sustainable. Marking-to-market allassets and liabilities has also contributed to this widespread focus on immediate financialperformances. This focus on short-term performance can translate into additional volatility in the pricediscovery process: the shorter the investment horizon of market participants, the bigger the impact ofany new information on prices.Mimetic behaviour is by no means a new phenomenon on financial markets. However, technologicaldevelopments on markets may have gradually reinforced this type of behaviour. The spread ofbenchmarking, which allows fund managers and clients to measure performance against that of otherfunds, together with the growing competition within the sector, appears to have increased suchmimetic behaviour. Some operators have come to the conclusion that it is better to be wrong alongwith everybody else, rather than take the risk of being right, or wrong, alone. A striking example ofrational mimetic behaviour is the influence that hedge funds enjoyed, a few years ago, as "opinionleaders" and trend makers. By its nature, trend following amplifies the imbalance that may at somepoint affect a market, potentially leading to vicious circles of price adjustments and liquidation ofpositions.The spread of certain fund management techniques, in particular index management, which hasproven very popular on equity markets, may have contributed to amplifying movements in financialasset prices. This technique endeavours to match as accurately as possible developments in stockmarket benchmark indices. It therefore mechanistically leads managers to accentuate current pricetrends by buying stocks that are on the rise and selling those that are falling. It can be argued that
BIS Review 54/20013index funds distort the price of the targeted indexes and that, as a result, the indices might end upcreating rather than measuring performance.The impact of risk management techniques on market dynamics is particularly enlightening with regardto the question of asset price overshooting. Value-at-risk calculations have become a crucial elementof the standards approach used by market participants to evaluate the risk inherent in their marketactivities and set up exposure limits. Of course, central banks and financial institutions should continueto encourage the use of these instruments. But, in times of financial turmoil, the growing use ofhomogeneous risk management techniques by financial intermediaries has had the paradoxical effectof amplifying the initial shock and the spill-over effect. Regardless of the intrinsic qualities of these riskmanagement tools, their growing use may have produced some adverse consequences. When marketplayers rely on converging risk evaluations, they tend to take the same decisions at the same time,thus amplifying the initial shock to prices and trading volumes.All these factors have one consequence in common: they encourage homogenous behaviour andreactions to the detriment of the diversity that is indispensable to the smooth functioning of financialmarkets.For this reason, the authorities might reflect on some ways – in conjunction with the financialindustry – to foster behavioural diversity in global marketsMonetary policy alone cannot guarantee the stability of financial systems, which may be jeopardisedby shocks from both the financial and the real economies. However, it must be stressed that anadequate monetary policy is a fundamental prerequisite to smooth the financial cycles. Anappropriate monetary stance is crucial for banks and monetary participants to base their decisions onsolid ground. The objective of price stability lowers economic agents’ uncertainty regarding future pricedevelopments. In addition, by committing itself to a long-term objective, the central bank reducesmarket uncertainty, which can be a source of disruption to the financial economy. Interest rates andmoney supply are less volatile as a result, which is of benefit to the long-term growth of the economy.However important, a sound monetary policy is not enough. To safeguard the smooth functioning ofthe markets, and in particular an efficient pricing mechanism, it is essential to protect, and evenreinforce, the diversity of behaviour on the markets. This necessary diversity is merely the echo ofthe different time horizons, strategies and reaction functions of market players. On this point, I wouldlike to explore a few possible avenues for future action.Strengthen the continuing efforts aiming at market transparencyExperience shows that uncertainty and incomplete information are determining factors in mimeticbehaviour. These shortfalls in market transparency make mimetic behaviour seem rational to agents,who prefer to follow bigger participants, who are thought to be better informed, rather than developtheir own analysis. Strengthening transparency therefore continues to be a priority.One of the objectives of transparency is to enable better differentiation of borrower creditworthiness. Akey feature of mimetic behaviour is that all borrowers are "tarred with the same brush". So when oneemerging economy encounters difficulties, all neighbouring countries, or countries that share commoncharacteristics, are treated in the same way – regardless of their actual economic and financialsituation. The same applies to businesses operating in the same economic sector. Transparency hassubstantially increased since the Asian crisis, thanks to a solid global consensus. Let us continue andreinforce these efforts.Take into account the medium and long-term perspective of some market participantsSome investors, such as pension funds and insurance companies, have to invest funds in order toenable their customers to build up wealth over the medium and long term, notably in preparation forretirement. Consequently, these types of investors are supposed to behave differently from tradersand short-term investors, who are working on a very different time horizon. But at times it seems thatthey are all pushed to behave in much the same way, on the basis of a very short-term horizon.To preserve, and even restore, their specific investment approach, these investors might be moreshielded from excessive short-term pressures. This objective raises considerable difficulties, becauseit touches on the way in which the performances of medium and long-term funds (including pension
4BIS Review 54/2001funds) and life insurance companies are assessed. In other words, this objective concerns theaccounting standards and practices they use. It implies that some rules and standards would beadapted to the medium and long-term horizon used by these entities. I have no answer at this stage. Iam only asking the question.Diversify the risk management tools of financial institutionsAs I mentioned earlier, even the best techniques can have adverse effects when used by too manyparticipants. To some degree, this is perhaps what has happened to value-at-risk based techniques,which have been massively adopted by the financial industry. Because they use more or less similarparameters and suffer from the same weaknesses – for example, they took inadequate account ofmarket liquidity at the time of the 1998 crisis –, such tools tend to give converging signals to those thatuse them. They thus encourage the mimetic behaviour that I discussed previously.The fact that some market participants are more sophisticated than the average is a guarantee thatstandardisation will remain limited, since they will develop techniques that are little used by others. Inthis respect, I must stress that the Basle Committee, as illustrated by the new Capital Accord, isencouraging banks to use more sophisticated and accurate risk measurements techniques.In addition, supervisors might help –and obviously they are already helping- to spread the idea thatfinancial institutions should round out their current range of risk management tools to includeextensive use of stress testing. This technique offers a better reflection of the varying situations ofinstitutions and of the diverse perceptions that institutions have of exceptional events. The applicationof stress testing techniques and their results are thus inherently more diversified than those resultingfrom methods based on the value-at-risk approach.These are only examples of options to help improve the functioning of markets. There is probablysome merit in an overall review of regulatory, accounting and tax rules and regulations, as well as ofcodes of good conduct and good practices, and of structural developments of market themselves, toidentify possible amendments and improvements that could help protect and enhance the behaviouraland conceptual diversity of modern financial markets.In conclusion, let me stress the important role played by central banks in preserving monetary andfinancial stability in an increasingly globalised world.The recent years have shown the benefits of monetary stability in terms of growth in a globalisedworld. It is of course closely linked to central bank’s independence, which is no longer a matter ofdebate.Financial authorities are nevertheless faced with a new challenge, which is to strengthen financialstability in a context of amplified financial cycles. I would like to stress what I feel is the highlycomplementary nature of price stability and financial stability objectives: price stability is the bedrockon which financial stability is built.Central banks have a undoubtedly special responsibility due to their position at the heart of financialsystems:(cid:1) they contribute directly to supplying liquidity to the economy,(cid:1) their close and constant contact with credit institutions gives them a thorough understandingof banking systems,(cid:1) they contribute to banking supervision,(cid:1) last but not least, central banks are responsible for a safe and efficient functioning ofpayment systems and, at least for some of them, of securities clearing and settlementsystems.I thank you for your attention.
BIS Review 54/20011Roger W Ferguson, Jr: The productivity experience of the United States: past,present, and futureRemarks by Mr Roger W Ferguson, Jr, Vice-Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US FederalReserve System, at the US Embassy, The Hague, the Netherlands (via videoconference), 14 June2001.*      *      *Thank you for inviting me to address this group of distinguished business and government leadersfrom the Netherlands. As always, the views I will be expressing are my own and are not necessarilyshared by other members of the Board of Governors or of the Federal Open Market Committee.You have asked me to set the stage for our discussion with a brief review of the extraordinaryperformance of the U.S. economy during the second half of the 1990s. From 1995 to 1999, real grossdomestic product grew, on average, about 4 percent per year. This pace was significantly above thatin the previous five years, and you would have to go back to the 1960s to find even closelycomparable periods of consistently robust economic expansion. In this environment, theunemployment rate fell to 4 percent, and the underlying rate of price inflation slowed, on net, despitevery high rates of resource utilization. Even the most optimistic forecasters could not have anticipatedsuch a favorable confluence of economic events.Productivity growth and cost reductionsSo how did this confluence of positive events come about? The dominant force of late appears to havebeen a significant increase in the structural rate of productivity growth. Output per hour in the nonfarmbusiness sector – a conventional measure of productivity – increased at an annual rate of almost 3percent between 1995 and 1999, roughly twice the average pace that had prevailed over thepreceding two decades. The most important explanation for this increase in the rate of productivitygrowth, I suspect, is longer-term structural changes arising from the boom in capital spending and therevolution in information technology. Let me turn to the evidence on this point.Technological change and productivity growthBob Solow – the MIT economist who won the Nobel Prize in economics for his work on the theory ofeconomic growth – once quipped that you can see computers everywhere except in the productivitystatistics. A few years ago that situation began to change, and we now have strong evidence that thefaster productivity growth our economy has experienced is, in fact, due partly to the informationtechnology revolution.Research by Federal Reserve Board economists Steve Oliner and Dan Sichel sheds some light on thesources of this faster productivity growth. The high (and rising) levels of business investment raisedthe amount of capital per worker and thereby boosted productivity. About ½ percentage point of theincrease in productivity growth over the 1995-99 period can be attributed to this so-called "capitaldeepening," most of which reflected greater spending by businesses on computers, software, andcommunications equipment. The balance of the pickup reflected other factors, including technologicalinnovations in the actual production of computer hardware and semiconductors as well as bettermanagement – perhaps assisted by these high-tech investments – of the nation's capital and laborresources. Oliner and Sichel estimate that the consolidated influences of information technologyinvestments account for about two-thirds of the acceleration in productivity since 1995. This researchsupports the view that fundamental changes are under way in our economy.What's so special about this capital?That trend productivity has picked up and that high-tech investments are the source of theacceleration are important facts, but by now they are not new observations. Perhaps at this stage itwould be useful to explore in greater detail this positive "shock" to the ability of our economy to
2BIS Review 54/2001produce goods and services. What is so special about computers and other information technologiesthat they can have such a strong influence on our economy?Let me highlight three special characteristics of high-tech equipment. First, computers andcommunications equipment depreciate at a very rapid pace. The current best estimate is thatcomputers probably depreciate about 30 percent annually, although that estimate might be low, whileother equipment probably depreciates at a rate of less than 15 percent annually. Therefore, computersare retired, on average, after three years, and the useful life for other equipment is about seven years.Firms must invest in computers at a faster rate than they do in other forms of capital just to maintain agiven level of the capital stock. The rapid replacement of high-tech capital means that technologicalprogress becomes "embodied" in the capital stock at a faster rate than is the case for longer-livedassets.The second feature of high-tech equipment that sets it apart from other classes of capital is thesensitivity of demand to fluctuations in the cost of capital. For decades, economists have debated themagnitude of cost-of-capital effects on traditional capital goods. A past consensus was that thecost-of-capital effect was small and difficult to identify empirically. But a somewhat different conclusionhas arisen lately when the same basic models of investment are applied to spending on computersalone. The latest research suggests that the demand for computers is quite sensitive to movements inthe cost of capital. The combination of an apparently high price elasticity and a rapid decline in relativecomputer prices – 20 percent per year over the past decade – likely led to the boom in high-techinvestment.A third characteristic of some high-tech investment is the magnitude of external or spillover effects thatit generates. Some high-tech equipment generates benefits not only to the owner of the machine butto other agents in the economy as well. I am thinking in particular about so-called network effects-theobservation that four computers networked together are more than twice as valuable as two.Supporting structural changesThe technological changes inspired by investments in computers have enhanced the ability ofbusinesses to reduce their operating expenses. In many industries, investments in informationtechnologies have helped firms to cut back on the volume of inventories that they hold as a precautionagainst glitches in their supply chain or as a hedge against unexpected increases in aggregatedemand. Product development costs have probably also been reduced through the use of bettercomputer hardware and software, and new communications technologies have increased the speedwith which firms can share information – both internally and with their customers and suppliers.Moreover, given intense competition and the resulting lack of pricing leverage, ongoing programs toreduce costs have become a key part of corporate strategies to maintain or improve profit margins.The focus on cost reduction has worked to head off the development of inflationary pressures in thisexpansion.Productivity and the current macroeconomic settingAs you are aware, the United States is experiencing a period of subpar growth. For the last threequarters, the annualized growth rate has been 1¾ percent, which is well below the trend rate of growththat many think our economy can sustain. During this period, productivity grew at an annual rate ofabout 2½ percent during the second half of 2000 and declined at an annual rate of 1¼ percent duringthe first quarter of this year. This slowing in productivity growth has led a number of observers to askwhether the acceleration of productivity of the latter part of the 1990s was a cyclical phenomenon,which was bound to come to an end when the economy slowed, or a structural one. Cyclical forces,such as the inability of businesses to add to their payrolls as rapidly as they would have liked inresponse to the rise in demand, probably played some role in these productivity gains. In addition,some enthusiasts made overly optimistic statements about the benefits of these newer technologies.However, I believe that the answer to the question is that most of the growth in productivity wasstructural, or trend, and not cyclical. We should also be mindful that even during the period between1995 and 2000, productivity increases on a quarterly basis fluctuated; the trend increase that is soclear now did not progress unabated.Two fundamental factors lead me to be cautiously optimistic that the much of the improvement inproductivity is likely to be sustained. Notable advances in microprocessors, or semiconductors, have
BIS Review 54/20013been key to the enhanced productivity growth that we have experienced. Semiconductor industryexperts indicate that the improvement in performance described by "Moore's Law," which predicts thatthe capacity of chips will double every 18 to 24 months, continues to hold true. My understanding fromconversations with, and announcements by, leaders of the semiconductor industry is that later thisyear or early next year chip manufacturers plan to begin using larger wafers, allowing them to reducecosts by 30 percent. They also plan to adopt thinner circuit lines, which will allow the manufacturers toetch more transistors on a single chip.A second reason to expect that much of the improvement in productivity growth is trend and notcyclical is that businesses indicate in their words and their deeds a commitment to improvingproductivity and maintaining costs by substituting capital, mainly IT capability, for labor. Overall growthof the economy has slowed to a pace between 1 percent and 2 percent at an annual rate for the mostrecent three quarters. However, investment in equipment and software has held at relatively highlevels and is still sufficient to maintain relatively rapid growth of capital services. Moreover, end-usedemand for communications services seems to remain strong. Since the early 1990s, the volume ofdata sent over networks in the United States has doubled each year, and there is no reason why thattrend should abate.The role of government policyYou will have noted that I have not mentioned the role of government policy in creating a higher rate oftrend productivity growth. As a policymaker, I'd like to think that well-executed monetary and fiscalpolicies – each focused importantly on their respective long-run goals – played some role in creatingeconomic conditions that fostered noninflationary economic growth. It is important to note, however,that although sound policy undoubtedly helped create the conditions for growth, macroeconomic policycannot create growth itself. Only businesses and consumers can do that.The economy of the United States has also benefited from past actions by the government toderegulate industries. The more intense focus on the removal of unnecessary government regulationstarted more than twenty years ago, during the Administration of President Ford, and gatheredmomentum during the Carter years. Deregulation has altered the business landscape byallowing – indeed forcing – businesses to focus more clearly on a more competitive marketplace withfewer constraints and increased flexibility. Again, as with macroeconomic policy, a policy ofderegulating industry cannot create greater potential growth, but it can create the conditions underwhich such growth might occur.A third way in which the government and the private sector together have assisted the process oftechnology adoption is by fostering a highly flexible system of education and training that focuses onboth theoretical and practical skills. In part because of the rapid changes in technology, today'sstudents and workers no longer expect to keep a job for life, and they are keenly aware that,throughout their careers, new skills will be required for advancement. Employers, too, recognize thevalue added by developing human capital to complement their fixed capital. Thus, the United Stateshas experienced a demand for educational services catering to participants at various stages in life.The demand for skill development and upgrading has been met in a number of ways – throughon-the-job training, at so-called corporate universities, and in a range of public and private institutionsof higher learning. Surveys conducted by the U.S. Department of Education show that participation inadult education programs expanded over the past decade, with 46 percent of all adults reportedlyhaving been engaged in an adult education program in 1998-99. In part because much of the trainingis work-related, the rates of participation are positively related to formal educational attainment. Thetrend toward lifetime learning also shows through in the enrollment statistics for higher education.Today, more than 20 percent of the students in U.S. institutions of higher education are age 35 orolder, up from less than 15 percent in 1985. In part, this increase has been fueled by the rising numberof part-time students and of enrollees at two-year colleges. The latter group of schools, in particular,has lowered the cost of education for working students with night and weekend courses and with thedevelopment of contracts with employers to provide skill training. Another way to meet the needs forskill training in coming years will involve distance learning. In 1995, one-third of U.S. institutions ofhigher education reported some use of distance education – two-way or one-way videos, on-lineconnections, and the like. Another one-fourth planned to offer courses in the subsequent three years,with an eye to targeting workers seeking re-certification or skill updating.
4BIS Review 54/2001In addition, the U.S. government influenced the increase in productivity growth by supporting the earlydevelopment of what later became known as the Internet. In the mid- to late 1960s the Department ofDefense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) created a small network, ARPANET, whichwas intended to promote the sharing of computers among researchers in the United States. In 1969,ARPANET connected the first four university participants, and researchers on those campusescreated the first hosts of the ARPANET. Over time, this process of linking computers evolved into theInternet. Importantly, much of the work of creating the standards that drove the early creation of theInternet was led by the private sector, both commercial and academic.Finally, the federal government is reported to be an active user of the Internet to sell its products,including financial products. A recent study indicates that the government of the United States made$3.6 billion of transactions over the web in 2000, which was significantly larger than the revenue ofany web-based retailer.The macroeconomic implications of faster productivity growthTheory teaches us that the step-up in the growth rate of productivity will have important and pervasiveimplications for the performance of the economy. The main reason policymakers and economists areinterested in the growth rate of productivity is that it is the crucial determinant of the rate of change inthe general standard of living. If productivity increases 1 ½ percent per year on average, the standardof living will double about every 46 years – or about every two generations. On the other hand, if trendproductivity growth steps up to 3 percent per year, the standard of living will double roughly every 23years – or about every generation. That is certainly a difference worth studying and understanding,and at this stage our understanding is woefully incomplete.A second important reason for being interested in the growth rate of productivity is that in the nearterm it affects both the supply of and demand for goods and services. On the supply side, the effect isfairly clear and immediate: An increase in trend productivity growth implies a more rapid pace ofgrowth of the economy's productive capacity. In short, the economy can produce more, overall,without running up against production bottlenecks. Of course, this effect tends to cumulate over time,with progressively larger increases in supply coming as time goes by. Separately, businesses mayrespond to the increase in trend productivity growth by stepping up the pace of their investment inplant and equipment, further boosting the growth in the supply potential of the economy.How does the increase in trend productivity growth play out on the demand side of the economy? Oneimmediate effect is the step-up in capital expenditures that I just noted, as businesses perceive andreact to new profit opportunities. In addition, stock market investors will react to the pickup inproductivity growth by looking ahead, recognizing the improved prospects for future earnings, andbidding up equity prices today. The run-up in equity prices implies a reduction in the cost of capital forbusinesses, which could support a further increase in investment demand, especially on the part offirms that rely on this market for at least part of their funding.The increase in stock market wealth will also operate through the household sector. As you know,economists often speak of the "wealth effect." Econometric modeling indicates that consumerseventually tend to raise the level of their spending by approximately 3 to 5 cents for every incrementaldollar of wealth. Given changes in stock market wealth as large as the ones we have seen recently,this wealth effect can have a noticeable effect on consumption and macroeconomic performance. Totake the most prominent example, the wealth effect is the most important reason why the personalsaving rate in the United States has fallen from roughly 8 percent in 1990 to -1 percent in the firstquarter of this year. And to put a rough number on the impact on aggregate activity more recently,simulations by the Board staff using our econometric model of the economy suggest that wealthgenerated in the equity markets over the past four years added about 1 percentage point to the growthrate of real GDP.Overall, the stock market, working through the spending decisions of both households andbusinesses, will act to bring forward the demand effects of the improved outlook for supply, potentiallyeven pushing demand up ahead of the increase in supply.It is important to emphasize that higher productivity growth translates into higher real income growthfor employees. This added income is seen most clearly in the higher wages paid to that growingnumber of workers whose cash compensation is tied to company performance, either directly orthrough stock options. But real incomes should increase even for workers whose compensation is not
BIS Review 54/20015directly linked to company performance, as profitable business opportunities bolster the demand forscarce labor.ConclusionObviously the history of the productivity surprise in the United States is a long and complex one.Indeed, it is premature to write the entire story. But, the role of the Federal Reserve in this saga willcontinue unchanged. We have been given the responsibility to provide the monetary conditions thatwill promote the maximum sustainable growth in output. We will continue to perform that duty.
BIS Review 53/20011Donald T Brash: Promoting financial stability: the New Zealand approachAddress by Dr Donald T Brash, Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, to the Conference forCommonwealth Central Banks on Corporate Governance for the Banking Sector, London, 6 June2001.*      *      *IntroductionIt is a great pleasure to have the opportunity to speak to you today.The theme of this conference – Corporate Governance in the Banking Sector – is a subject that hasbeen an important element in the Commonwealth Secretariat's financial sector work in recent years. Ithas also been a notable feature of other international initiatives, including those of the InternationalMonetary Fund and World Bank, in their efforts to address the causes of financial crises and topromote greater financial stability. Appropriately, improving corporate governance is seen as asignificant way of encouraging banks to strengthen their capacity to manage risks. And it has rightlybeen viewed as an important element in the management of central banks.Today, I want to discuss the role that corporate governance plays in the New Zealand bankingsupervision framework and to relate this to the importance we attach to strengthening marketdiscipline in the financial system. But before doing this, let me briefly recap the main points made inthe report issued by the Commonwealth Secretariat last year on the causes of financial instability andthe policies for promoting stable financial systems. This provides a useful context within which todiscuss the New Zealand approach to financial sector regulation.Causes of financial instabilityAs indicated in the Commonwealth Secretariat's paper Corporate Governance in the Financial Sector,financial instability is caused by a combination of factors. These include:(cid:1) rapid financial sector liberalisation unsupported by measures to encourage prudent riskmanagement in the financial sector;(cid:1) unsustainable macroeconomic policies, such as loose monetary policy and excessive fiscalspending – such policies can contribute to asset price volatility and a subsequent erosion ofasset quality in the financial system;(cid:1) exchange rate arrangements that lack credibility, including unsustainable exchange ratepegs – this is particularly important where financial institutions and corporations have cometo rely on an exchange rate peg, and fail to hedge their currency risk, only to sustaincurrency losses when the peg collapses;(cid:1) protection against imports and other policies that impede the efficient allocation of resourcesin the economy;(cid:1) poor banking supervision;(cid:1) inadequate financial disclosure arrangements, including poor quality accounting and auditingstandards; and(cid:1) weak market disciplines in the banking and corporate sectors, reducing the incentives forhigh quality risk management by banks.Policies for promoting stable financial systemsThe broad range of factors that can contribute to financial crises suggests the need for an equallybroad set of policy responses. Of course, the particular policies will vary from country to country,depending on a country's stage of development, the nature of its economy and the structure of itsfinancial system. There is no single "right" policy prescription. Each country must develop policies thatsuit its own particular circumstances. However, at a general level, it can safely be said that thefollowing types of policies will be needed in order to promote financial stability:
2BIS Review 53/2001(cid:1) sound, sustainable and credible macroeconomic policies, including a monetary policy aimedat promoting price stability;(cid:1) microeconomic policies that minimise distortions to relative prices and that encourageefficient allocation of resources;(cid:1) exchange rate policy that is seen as credible by all market participants, that facilitatesmacroeconomic adjustment and that builds in incentives for financial institutions to hedgeagainst currency risk;(cid:1) an effective legal and judicial system, facilitating the enforcement of legal contracts;(cid:1) policies to encourage banks to manage their risks prudently, including corporate governanceand financial disclosure;(cid:1) policies to encourage effective market disciplines in the financial sector, therebystrengthening the incentives for banks to manage their risks prudently;(cid:1) policies to promote robust payment systems and minimise inter-bank contagion, such asnetting arrangements, real time gross settlement and failure-to-settle structures within thepayment system; and(cid:1) effective and well-enforced banking supervision arrangements.It would be tempting to discuss each of these policy areas, given their importance to the promotion ofsound and efficient financial systems. But we would need a great deal longer than one day to dojustice to such a broad range of complicated policy issues. Instead, I want to focus on the main themeof this conference – corporate governance in the financial sector.Corporate governance in the financial sectorAs noted in the Commonwealth Secretariat's report, improving corporate governance is an importantway to promote financial stability. The effectiveness of a bank's internal governance arrangements hasa very substantial effect on the ability of a bank to identify, monitor and control its risks. Althoughbanking crises are caused by many factors, some of which are beyond the control of bankmanagement, almost every bank failure is at least partially the result of poor risk management withinthe bank itself. And poor risk management is ultimately a failure of internal governance.Although banking supervision and the regulation of banks' risk positions can go some way towardscountering the effects of poor governance, supervision by some external official agency is not asubstitute for sound corporate governance practices. Ultimately, banking system risks are most likelyto be reduced to acceptable levels by fostering sound risk management practices within individualbanks. Instilling sound corporate governance practices within banks is a crucial element of achievingthis.As the Commonwealth Secretariat's report notes, there are a number of ways in which corporategovernance in the financial sector can be strengthened. These include:(cid:1) having a well designed and enforced company law;(cid:1) having codes of principles developed by professional or industry associations, setting outdesired attributes of corporate governance, and associated educational andconsciousness-raising initiatives;(cid:1) maintaining high quality disclosure requirements for banks and other companies, based onrobust accounting and auditing standards;(cid:1) adopting measures to strengthen market disciplines in the banking sector, including bypromoting a contestable and competitive banking system and seeking to ensure that bankcreditors are not fully insulated from loss in a bank failure;(cid:1) effective banking supervision arrangements, with particular emphasis on policies thatencourage sound governance and risk management practices; and(cid:1) leadership by example, including the adoption of sound governance, accountability andtransparency practices by central banks and regulatory agencies.
BIS Review 53/20013New Zealand's approach to financial stabilityAgainst this background, let me briefly summarise the New Zealand approach to promoting financialstability. This has three main strands:(cid:1) promoting self discipline by banks in the management of their risks;(cid:1) fostering effective market discipline on the banking system; and(cid:1) supervising banks for the purpose of promoting financial stability, but seeking to avoidsupervisory practices that might erode market discipline and weaken the incentives for bankdirectors to take ultimate responsibility for the management of risks.Let me elaborate on each of these in turn.Banks' self discipline in managing risksBanking supervision in New Zealand places considerable emphasis on encouraging banks' selfdiscipline in managing risks, primarily by reinforcing the role of bank directors in taking ultimateresponsibility for the stewardship of their banks. Since the mid 1990s, when a new public disclosureframework was introduced for banks, a key mechanism for encouraging banks to manage risksprudently has been the need for banks to issue public disclosure statements each quarter.The disclosure statements are in two forms: a brief Key Information Summary, which is aimed at theordinary depositor; and a more comprehensive General Disclosure Statement, which is aimedprincipally at the professional analyst.The Key Information Summary contains a short summary of information on the bank, including:(cid:1) the bank's credit rating;(cid:1) the bank's capital ratio, measured using the Basel framework; and(cid:1) information on exposure concentration, exposures to connected parties, asset quality andprofitability.The Key Information Summary must be displayed prominently in, and be available on demand from,every bank branch.The General Disclosure Statement contains wider-ranging and much more detailed information on thebank and its banking group, including:(cid:1) comprehensive financial statements;(cid:1) credit rating information;(cid:1) detailed information on capital adequacy, asset quality and various risk exposures; and(cid:1) information on the bank's exposure to market risk.One of the most important features of this disclosure framework is the role it accords bank directors.Each director is required to sign and make certain attestations in the disclosure statements, including:(cid:1) whether the bank is complying with the prudential requirements imposed on it by theReserve Bank;(cid:1) whether the bank has systems in place to adequately monitor and control its banking risksand whether those systems are being properly applied;(cid:1) whether the bank's exposure to connected parties is contrary to the interests of the bank;and(cid:1) whether the disclosure statement contains all the required disclosures and is not false ormisleading.Directors face potentially severe criminal penalties and civil liability where a disclosure statement isheld to be false or misleading.Complementing the disclosure requirements, banks incorporated in New Zealand are required to havea minimum of two independent directors (who must also be independent of any parent company) anda non-executive chairman. These requirements are intended to increase the board's capacity toscrutinise the performance of the management team. In addition, independent directors provide some
4BIS Review 53/2001assurance that the bank's dealings with its parent or other related parties are not in conflict with theinterests of the bank in New Zealand.The disclosure requirements have increased the accountability of bank directors and, indirectly, theaccountability of various levels of management within the banks. As a result of the disclosurearrangements, we have seen directors taking greater care than might otherwise have been the case toensure that they are adequately discharging their obligations. In so doing, directors have strongincentives to ensure that there are appropriate accountability mechanisms within the managementhierarchy.
BIS Review 53/20011Edgar Meister: How should regulatory and supervisory responsibilities beshared among the national functional regulators?Lecture by Mr Edgar Meister, Member of the Directorate of the Deutsche Bundesbank, held at theMultinational Banking Seminar in New York, 9 June 2001.*      *      *ILadies and Gentlemen,Voltaire, the famous French philosopher, once said: "If you see a banker jump out of the window, jumpafter him – there is sure to be profit in it". Well, having experienced the latest financial crises, I am notentirely convinced that it would be always wise to follow Voltaire's advice. The topics of this seminarperfectly illustrate the potential risk of this kind of “herding behaviour” and – not least – the challengesfor regulators and supervisors. I am delighted to have been given the opportunity of speaking here thismorning, and I would like to elaborate on the issue of how regulatory and supervisory functionsshould, or could, be shared between national authorities. Naturally, I wish to go into the current debateon this topic in Europe.IIThe design of regulatory and supervisory responsibilities is one of the most important matters affectingthe future course of financial market policy. There is, however, no universally valid answer to thequestion of how this should be done. The best way of organising supervision cannot be derived fromtheory. That is why we can see many forms of supervisory organisation in international practice thatfunction well. This diversity in the design of supervision is not surprising; after all, the supervisorysystems are, in each case, incorporated into their respective economic and legal structures and haveevolved over time.However, it may also be said about supervision that "the most constant thing is change". That is why,in the recent past, some countries – such as the United Kingdom – have radically reorganised theirsupervision or are discussing changes, as in Austria, Ireland and Germany, for example.Although there is no ready-made solution as to how responsibilities should be assigned in order to putin place an effective and efficient supervisory structure, there are nevertheless a few requirements thatshould be fulfilled.(cid:1) The supervisory structure should be geared to the financial market structures. In otherwords, due account has to be taken of developments on the markets, such as national andinternational mergers and acquisitions, and the emergence of ever larger businessenterprises.(cid:1) The institutions in charge must have expert knowledge and experience in their special field,they need an appropriate number and quality of staff as well as an efficient internalorganisational structure in order to make possible efficient and cost-effective supervision.(cid:1) Supervisors should be in close proximity to those who are to be supervised, and at the sametime not under too much political influence.(cid:1) If regulatory powers are shared among several institutions, there has to be a clear definitionof powers and responsibilities. An efficient structuring of the flow of information and of thecooperation between the supervisory bodies involved is also important.(cid:1) Harmonised supervisory rules as well as their consistent application in practice are essentialfor creating a "level playing field" for the financial institutions in the different sectors.Here in the United States, the role played by the Federal Reserve in financial supervision is not onlywell recognised but regarded as indispensable. In Europe, however, that role is hotly debated. Inaddition to the above-mentioned general requirements, I would also like to mention some aspectswhich argue for central banks having a substantial involvement in supervision.(cid:1) Owing to the globalisation of financial markets and the accompanying profound structuralchanges within individual banking systems, not only microprudential institutional supervision
2BIS Review 53/2001but also looking at the implications for the financial system as a whole are becoming evermore important.(cid:1) In this context, central banks are particularly affected since a stable financial system is anessential prerequisite of monetary policy. Combining the practical supervision of institutionswith the analysis of the stability of the financial system as a whole - "the marrying of micro-and macro-prudential analysis" – as the General Secretary of the "Bank for InternationalSettlements", Andrew Crockett, once put it – brings benefits for supervision and monetarypolicy.Effective financial market supervision relies on its own direct access to the relevant information.Especially when there is an impending crisis, the key factors are(cid:1) how quickly crucial information is available to those parties who need it,(cid:1) how extensive that information is,(cid:1) that the information is interpreted correctly(cid:1) and that an appropriate set of instruents for countermeasures is available.For direct access to information, proximity both to the financial markets and to the institutions is anadvantage. Supervisors, who are active in the markets themselves and know the market participantsfrom their own business relationships, possess major additional sources of information. It is preciselythe central banks which maintain these permanent contacts – not only for their monetary policyoperations but also because of their role in payment systems. Central banks are therefore in a positionto identify  problems within the financial system earlier than pure bank supervisors are able to.The central bank’s own financial market analyses, which are needed for monetary policy in any case,also provide valuable information for the purposes of system supervision, and can help to identifyirregularities or tensions within the financial system at an earlier stage. Moreover, central banks areable to perform the necessary interpretation of prudential data within the context of the economy as awhole. Ultimately, supervision has to serve the economy. And, finally, the central bank can also usethe infrastructure, which it has available for monetary policy, for purposes of crisis combating.However, there are also synergy effects between the implementation of prudential supervision andmonetary policy, since, with access to confidential prudential information, the central banks are evenbetter able to judge the current economic situation and gain direct benefit from it in terms of monetarypolicy.Furthermore, central banks are in my opinion well suited to be crisis managers, as was illustrated bythe action undertaken by the Federal Reserve in the case of the hedge fund LTCM. Under theleadership of the central bank, a private sector bail-out program was organised entirely without the useof public funds.When struggling for the best possible way to organise supervision, one is caught in a dilemmabetween the supervisor’s need to be close to the market and the global orientation, above all, of thebig market players. Equally, as far as supervision is concerned, market proximity and the need to takedue account of specific national features pose a conflict of aims with cost-effectiveness. The collectionof information and its analysis could – in theory - be handled more cost-effectively by amega-supervisor – at least from the point of view of the global players. The global supervisor mightalso be able to play a larger part in preventing global financial crises.In practice, however, such theoretical considerations are faced with scarcely surmountable problems.As an alternative, the conflicts of aims which I have described are therefore to be solved byintensifying cooperation further among the responsible supervisors which in fact is already in place.This holds true internationally as well as within national borders – if different institutions areresponsible for supervision – and especially across sectors.IIIHow has the question of supervisory organisation been solved within the European Union? Despitethe introduction of a single currency in most of the EU countries, the supervisory responsibilities haveremained with the member states. There is a wide range of models in the European Union, all of whichare functional. In Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain, the central bank isresponsible for supervision. In France and Germany, the central bank is closely involved in this task.Not too long ago, supervisory functions in the United Kingdom were transferred from the Bank of
BIS Review 53/20013England to the FSA, an authority with a very wide-ranging mandate. There are similar divisions ofresponsibility in Scandinavia. In Belgium, banking supervision and securities supervision arecombined in one agency, whereas in Austria the ministry of finance has so far conducted bankingsupervision in close cooperation with the central bank.The ECB is also involved in supervision, albeit to a limited extent. This is based on the relevantEuropean legislation contained in Article 105 (5) of the EC Treaty which provides that "the ESCB shallcontribute to the smooth conduct of policies pursued by the competent authorities relating to theprudential supervision of credit institutions and the stability of the financial system".Close cross-border cooperation is important for the converging European financial market. On amultilateral level this is carried out, for example, by the Banking Supervision Committee (BSC) residingat the ECB. This body consists of senior representatives of the central banks and regulatoryauthorities of all 15 EU countries and is thus well suited to covering the various aspects of supervision.In the event of an impending systemic crisis with potential contagion effects, the BSC could also playan important role in crisis management bringing the countries involved together.In the public debate, reference is sometimes made to potential conflicts of interest with which a centralbank might be faced when caught between the aims of monetary policy and its responsibility forsystemic stability within the context of supervision. An example that sometimes is mentioned is aninterest rate cut for the purpose of stabilising the financial system, which is inappropriate from amonetary policy standpoint. In practice, however, things look different. Within the European MonetaryUnion, monetary policy is determined by the 18 independent members of the ECB Governing Council.In terms of an appropriate monetary policy, this ensures a pluralistic assessment of the financialmarket situation for Europe as a whole and not with a view to specific developments in one country.Quite irrespective of the situation in Europe, I think that the argument of a "conflict of aims betweenprice stability and systemic stability" can be debated.(cid:1) First, the central bank has the responsibility for systemic stability anyway and not only whenit assumes supervisory tasks.(cid:1) Second, the conflict of aims alluded to would become apparent only in very rare cases whenserious problems have already emerged. An efficiently functioning prudential supervision,however, would prevent this.(cid:1) And, third, a potential conflict of aims cannot be settled more effectively by sharingresponsibilities among different institutions.Essentially, in a specific situation it is a matter of weighing two important public goods, systemicstability and monetary stability. There is no argument in support of this tending to be to the detrimentof monetary stability if these two goods are weighed up by the central bank. As a more generalobservation, I should mention that in the medium term, sound money contributes to the stability of thefinancial system.IVOn balance, central banks should be taken into consideration in an appropriate manner as far as thedistribution of supervisory powers is concerned. For that reason – in the light of the current debatebeing conducted in Germany on the restructuring of the financial services supervision – I also regard amajor participation by the Deutsche Bundesbank in prudential supervision as being essential. TheDeutsche Bundesbank is not against an integrated supervision with banking, securities and insurancesupervision under one roof. However, it must be able to continue making a contribution to systemicstability within the European System of Central Banks. The Bundesbank’s “invisible assets” such asexperience and knowledge of the big internationally operating institutions are indispensable for theevaluation of systemic risks. The proposals which the Federal Government presented last week aremoving in the right direction. Some remaining issues need to be clarified and settled during thelegislative process.Thank you for your attention.
BIS Review51/20011Peter Nicholl: Perspectives on monetary policy in Bosnia and HerzegovinaLecture by Mr Peter Nicholl, Governor of the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina, to the 1/1Student Initiative, Sarajevo University, Sarajevo, May 2001.*      *      *IntroductionI am very pleased to have this opportunity to talk to the top students of Sarajevo University aboutmonetary policy in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH). As we have only an hour and a half in all, and I wantto leave plenty of time for your questions, I do not have time for a comprehensive discussion of allpossible monetary policy issues for BH. So I have decided to talk on the following four inter-relatedissues:(cid:1) the Currency Board option;(cid:1) macro-economic sustainability in BH;(cid:1) the role of the banking sector in BH ;(cid:1) institutional design of economic institutions.The currency board optionAs I am sure you all know, the CBBH operates monetary policy in BH by a Currency Boardarrangement.  The three essential features of the Currency Board, all of which are specified in theCBBH law, are:(cid:1) The BH currency, the Convertible Mark (KM) is tied to the Deutschmark (DEM) at a fixedexchange rate of 1KM= 1DEM. It is now also tied to the Euro at the same rate as the DEM (1 KM = 0.511 Euro);(cid:1) The KM liabilities of the CBBH have to be fully backed with convertible foreign assets;(cid:1) The CBBH has to be prepared to convert KM for DEM at any time for any amount (i.e. It is afully convertible currency)It is interesting to remember back to the sort of payment and banking sector that operated in BHbefore the CBBH was established in 1997:(cid:1) there were four currencies in use in BH and the only one that was used over the wholecountry was the DEM;(cid:1) there were three payments bureaus that had a monopoly on domestic non-cash paymentsbut could not settle electronically with each other;(cid:1) there were around 70 organisations that called themselves banks but most were very smalland none of them operated over the whole country.Linking the KM to the DEM through a Currency Board was an easy choice for BH because the DMwas already extensively used in the country and was the currency people trusted.It has been a successful choice too:(cid:1) the KM has been a stable currency against the DEM and the Euro since it was introduced;(cid:1) inflation in BH is relatively low and stable;(cid:1) KM use has risen rapidly within BH and it is now the dominant transactions currency in allparts of the country. Our KM liabilities have risen from KM 132 million when we started inAugust 1997 to KM 1,023 million at the end of February 2001;(cid:1) they can even be traded in a number of other countries in Europe;
2BIS Review 51/2001(cid:1) the KM has remained fully convertible. Since the KM currency was introduced we haveissued around KM 3.44 billion and we have converted back to DEM around KM 2.66 billion.I do not think there is any other type of monetary policy, except the adoption of the DEM as thecurrency of BH, that could have given a country like BH a stable and trusted currency this quickly.Why has the currency board worked in BIH?I think there are four main reasons:(cid:1) first, people have faced many financial traumas. They therefore value a stable currency. TheCurrency Board consequently has a high level of public and political support within BH;(cid:1) second, people had complete trust in the anchor currency, the DM a strict Currency Boardhas allowed the CBBH, a new institution with no track record, to gain some of the credibilityof the DEM and the Bundesbank;(cid:1) third, some people say it is because the CBBH has a foreign Governor. I think that is only asmall part of the reason.(cid:1) in my view, the major reason it has worked is the very good legal and institutional frameworkthe CBBH has.– the goal of the CBBH is simple, clear and specified in the law;– the law limits our activities where there would be any potential conflict with the CurrencyBoard requirements;– within these statutory goals and limitations, the CBBH is independent of politicaldirection;– we have sensible and sound internal decision-making processes;– we are easily and firmly held accountable. A breach of the Currency Board requirementswould be quickly obvious to all. Within the current economic jargon, it is a verytransparent form of policy implementation.Some economists and others argue that a Currency Board has disadvantages because of thelimitations it places on the economic roles of the CBBH for example:(cid:1) the CBBH can not play a role in providing liquidity to the banking sector (i.e., it can not act aslender of last resort);(cid:1) the CBBH can not finance the Government;(cid:1) the CBBH can not play any direct role in financing economic development;(cid:1) the exchange rate can not be used as a tool to adjust to economic shocks or poor economicperformance.These areas of policy discretion, if used wisely and in moderation, could be of advantage to economicdevelopment in BH. There are lots of projects in BH for which a ‘little bit’ of CBBH finance may behelpful. But the problem would be in keeping the CBBH credit to a ‘little bit.’ The experience of theregion is that excess central bank credit has usually been created and the result is inflation. That doesnot help business, employment or confidence in BH. So in my view, the strict Currency Board is thebest approach for BH.Will the currency board be continued in BIH?I believe it will for the following reasons:(cid:1) there is widespread support for it because it has provided one of the few elements of stabilitythe people of BH have had for some time;(cid:1) it would be risky to change it. confidence in the KM would drop as people waited to see howany alternative monetary policy would work;
BIS Review51/20013(cid:1) Currency Boards have worked well in other eastern European countries such as Latvia andBulgaria. Currency Boards are becoming acceptable, even fashionable;(cid:1) the long-term goal of BH policy is to take the economy closer to Europe. The KM is alreadytied to the Euro. It would therefore seem sensible to maintain this link.Macro-economic sustainability in BIHWhile I believe strongly that BH should maintain its Currency Board, there will need to be changesmade in other areas if BH is to have macro-economic sustainability over the medium term. TheCurrency Board requirement means that the CBBH can not issue KM currency in any quantity itchooses or the economy needs. The amount that can be issued is tied to the net position of Bosniaand Herzegovina’s external accounts. This is the Currency Board arithmetic.What does this Currency Board arithmetic mean for a central bank and a country? If the net positionon a country’s external accounts is positive, the central bank’s foreign reserves will increase as theforeign inflows are changed into the domestic currency. There is nothing to stop a Currency Boardhaving more than 100% backing for its domestic currency liabilities.(Indeed, at present the CBBH has foreign reserves equal to 106% of our KM liabilities.) So if theoverall foreign accounts are in good shape, there will be no pressure on the Currency Board andmedium term economic sustainability will be easy.But, if the country’s overall foreign accounts are negative, the situation is very different. If people wishto buy foreign exchange with their KM currency, the CBBH has to do so without limit. That is what fullconvertibility means. The level of the CBBH’s foreign reserves will fall as will the volume of thedomestic money supply. The Currency Board rules will still be met, but the balance sheet of the CBBHwill decline and could continue to decline until there were no more foreign reserves. At that stage, BHcould only meet foreign expenditures as they earned or gained foreign exchange.The current position of the balance of payments of BH are a cause for concern. The trade deficit isvery high.  The amount of foreign private capital coming into the country is still very low. The flows thathave made the situation work are the large amounts of official capital and repatriations by Bosniansliving abroad.Looking ahead:(cid:1) we know the level of official capital flows will slow, the only uncertainty being exactly whenthis will occur:(cid:1) it will be difficult to rapidly increase export receipts, though more could be done than has sofar occurred;(cid:1) the country is very heavily dependent on imports. A slowdown in reconstruction will slowimports to some extent. But a rapid slowdown in imports would also hurt consumption andliving standards;(cid:1) it is difficult to predict or rely on repatriations;(cid:1) the item that has the most potential to change rapidly is foreign private investment. But forBH to attract more foreign private investment the environment for private investment willhave to change substantially.If BH does not attract large quantities of private foreign investment, pressure will come on the level offoreign reserves as the official capital flows slow down. This in turn will decrease the domestic moneysupply and put upward pressure on interest rates. Monetary policy as implemented through aCurrency Board arrangement is pro-cyclical when the economy has a foreign exchange problem i.e. Itwill increase the contractionary pressure on the economy.The situation facing the BH economy is critical and urgent. Most of the policy-makers have someunderstanding of the foreign exchange problems. But they still seem to think they have policy choicesand a sense of urgency is lacking. In my view the only choice is to make BH an attractive place forprivate investment and to do everything necessary to attract foreign private capital. If that does nothappen, the BH economy will have major foreign exchange problems and the currency board will beunable to protect the country from those shocks. Indeed, it could become one of the victims of thoseshocks as politicians look for scapegoats to explain the country’s economic problems to the people.
4BIS Review 51/2001Foreign investment is increasing. In 1999 for example, direct foreign investment was 50% higher thanin 1998 and though we do not yet have figures for 2000, I am sure it has risen strongly again. Butwhile this growth rate sounds spectacular, it is from a very low base. Direct foreign investment into BHin 1999 is estimated to have been KM 170 million. The current account deficit for that year was KM 1.4billion. So private foreign investment financed just 12% of the current account deficit in that year. BHneeds to be increasing private foreign investment by around 200% a year over the next two yearsrather than 50% a year if the current economic growth rates are to be sustainable when the official aidflows slow down.This target is possible. The arrival here of foreign banks from Austria and Croatia shows that there isincreased interest from foreign investors.  But the climate for private investment in BH is still far fromsupportive. This applies to local investment as well as foreign investment. There are still problems inthe legal system, which is incomplete, the licensing and regulatory systems, which are far toobureaucratic, intrusive and multi-level, and in the financial system, which is still relatively weak.Improving the environment for private investment, both local and foreign, is the key economic issuefacing this country. It is this that will determine whether BH has a sustainable economy – and whetherit is a country in which good students like yourselves should stay to be a part of its future.The banking sectorAs I said in the last section, a weak financial sector is one of the factors that hampers privateinvestment in BH. The good news is that this gloomy picture finally began to change in 2000. I willmention just a few of the highlights.(cid:1) First, the payments system underwent fundamental reform. The old state-owned centralisedsystem that had a monopoly was closed. It has been replaced with a modern European-typesystem with two clearing houses, a RTGS one and a Giro one, owned and operated by theCentral Bank and payments are being conducted by the commercial banks. The supplierswe used had put similar systems into place in nine other European countries. But it wasdone more quickly in BH than anywhere else showing that it is possible to implement large,technical projects  in BH successfully. It has been operating since 5 January 2001 and isgoing very smoothly.(cid:1) Second, minimum capital requirements for banks were increased and it became possible fora bank registered in one entity to operate branches in the other entity. Five banks arealready doing so and more will follow.(cid:1) Third, more foreign banks commenced operations in BIH in 2000, either by applying forlicenses directly or by purchasing an existing BH bank. Increased foreign competition will bevery good for the BH economy. It will give depositors more choice and will force the localbanks to improve the range and quality of the services they provide if they want to survive.One can already see these effects occuring after only a few months.(cid:1) Fourth, a limited deposit insurance scheme has started which should help return citizensconfidence to the banks that qualify. So far, only four banks have been admitted to thescheme and it is only operating in the Federation.(cid:1) Fifth, most of the state-owned banks (there are around twenty state-owned banks in BH)finally had their opening balance sheets approved and they moved into the privatisationphase. But progress in bank privatisation continued to be very slow in 2000. While this isdisappointing, in my view it is no longer critical for the process of bank reform in BH as thereform process is being largely driven by privately-owned banks, including the recentlyarrived foreign banks. The citizens actually show a higher degree of trust in privately-ownedbanks as compared to state-owned banks. While at first sight, this may seem to beparadoxical it is completly understandable once one knows a bit of the financial history of theregion.There is still a long way to go before BH has a banking sector that can play the major role that thebanking sector plays in most other countries in Europe, including most other transition economies inEastern europe. But 2000 will be seen as the year in which the BH banking sector finally began tomove in the right direction and it is certain that the speed of change will accelerate even more in 2001.
BIS Review51/20015The system will be fundamentally different and stronger in a year's time compared with today. TheCBBH will do all it can to ensure that happens. Similar progress needs to be made in the other areasso that private investors, both Bosnians and foreignors, see this as a good country to invest in.Institutional design of economic institutionsI want to conclude my lecture with some comments on the institutional design of economic institutions.Many internationals, and quite a lot of Bosnians, are critical of the performance of many of the stateinstitutions in BH. I do not want to comment on the structure of state political institutions. But I know itis possible to build successful state economic institution in BH. The CBBH is a state economicinstitution. It works successfully. In my view, the major reason it works successfully is the way it isstructured. I set out some of the features earlier in the paper but they are so important that I will repeatthem:(cid:1) the CBBH has clear and unambiguous goals;(cid:1) it has a sound and clear legal framework;(cid:1) it has good internal decision-making and monitoring processes;(cid:1) it has a sensible degree of independence.In other words, the legal and operational structure of the CBBH is much the same as that of CentralBanks in other countries – and it works, even in BH.But most other state institutions, and particularly the economic ministries, are constructed in acompletely different way. They have unclear goals, rotating heads, consensus decision-making,frequent changes of staff etc. They are built on political criteria rather than on effective operationalcriteria, even though there job should be to implement decisions taken by politicians, not to act aspoliticians. We should not therefore be surprised by the relatively poor performance of many of theseorganisations.I believe the design of state economic institutions is an issue the BH authorities and the internationalcommunity need to pay more attention to. Setting up an institution isn't enough. The way it isstructured will have a big impact on how effectively and efficiently it operates -no matter who its staffare. Also, making the ministeries political undermines the responsibility and effectiveness of theinstitutions in BH that should deal with political issues – the Presidency, the Council of Ministers, theState Parliament, and the Entity Governments and Parliaments.

BIS Review 50/20011Willem F Duisenberg: What exactly is the responsibility of central banks oflarge economic areas in the current slowdown of the world economy?Speech by Dr Willem F Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, at the InternationalMonetary Conference, Singapore, 4 June 2001.*      *      *The topic of the introduction I have been invited to provide at the Central Bankers' panel is bothchallenging and welcome. The challenge is to answer a question that has been hovering around inrecent months: should the euro area assume the role of a "global growth engine" in the currentslowdown of the world economy? The opportunity to address this issue directly is welcome, as itallows me to elaborate on the role the European Central Bank (ECB) must play in this field. In doingso, however, I shall start first by briefly recalling the objective of the monetary policy of the ECB, whichprovides an essential background to the analysis of the responsibility and the challenges the ECBfaces with respect to the current slowdown of the world economy.The primary objective of the ECB, as the Treaty of the European Union defines it, is to maintain pricestability in the euro area. The Governing Council of the ECB has defined price stability as "year-on-year increases in the HICP for the euro area of below 2%". Furthermore, it was made clear from theoutset that price stability should be maintained over the medium term. By unambiguously assigningthe primary objective of price stability to an independent central bank, the Treaty recognises thatfocusing monetary policy on the maintenance of price stability in the euro area ensures that monetarypolicy will make the best possible contribution to improving economic prospects.This view is rooted in the fact, supported by decades of practical experience and empirical evidence,that the benefits of price stability for growth are substantial. Without putting forward all the arguments,allow me to highlight, in particular, that the maintenance of price stability helps to allocate resourcesefficiently both across uses and across time. Inflation causes economic agents to confuse transitorywith permanent price changes, and therefore distorts their decision-making process. In evaluatinginvestment opportunities, firms need to have confidence in the signals conveyed by relative pricechanges, and to discriminate between relative price adjustments and general changes in the overallprice level. This process is facilitated in a situation of overall price stability. Price stability thereforeimproves the transparency of the relative price mechanism and can promote an adequate environmentto increasing the growth potential of the euro area economy. Moreover, as experience has shown,stable prices minimise the inflation risk premium, thereby lowering long-term interest rates and helpingto stimulate investment and growth.In order to maintain price stability, the ECB has designed a monetary policy strategy wherein risks toprice stability are assessed on the basis of two pillars. The first pillar assigns a prominent role tomonetary developments. The second pillar is a broadly based assessment of a wide range of othereconomic and financial indicators. This all-encompassing and systematic approach guarantees thatthe Governing Council of the ECB takes into consideration all relevant pieces of information whenassessing the outlook for price stability in the medium term.All this shows clearly that the ECB needs to focus on the euro area when conducting its monetarypolicy. Focusing on domestic objectives is, in fact, the mandate of all major central banks in the world,and rightly so. I strongly believe that the best contribution that the euro area can make to worldeconomic growth is to ensure macroeconomic stability "at home" by pursuing policies which lead tosustainable non-inflationary growth in the euro area. Given the size of the economy of the euro area, astability-oriented policy will help to create a favourable environment conductive to non-inflationarygrowth at the global level. The mandate of the ECB is fully consistent with this principle. This is theonly reasonable allocation of responsibilities among the large economies in the world. Anything elserisks blurring such responsibilities and diluting accountability, which would in turn distort incentives in aperverse way.This notwithstanding, the euro area is not, of course, economically speaking, an island and globaldevelopments do affect the euro area economy. Hence, let me also stress that one of therequirements of a globalised world is a frequent exchange of information and views among policy-makers. The ECB currently participates in the meetings of international organisations, such as theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development(OECD) and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), and different fora, such as the G7. Such
2BIS Review 50/2001exchanges are important, among other things, to better understand economic developments and tofully analyse the spillover effects in the economy arising from different policies.The ECB is not in a position to fine tune economic activity in the euro area, as it does not have theinstruments to do so. Any attempt to do so would prove counterproductive, leading to an inefficientmedium-term outcome characterised by higher inflation and lower growth. Two main factors supportthis view. First, economic developments are surrounded by a great deal of uncertainty. Thisuncertainty affects the analysis of both the current state of the economy and its future course. Andsecond, monetary policy operates with relatively long lags, having very little effect on the economy inthe short run. Past experience has shown that attempts to fine-tune the economy might place injeopardy the commitment to maintain price stability in the medium term, as is essential for a well-functioning economy. Once inflation exists and inflation expectations prevail in the economy, theeconomic costs of the subsequent necessary stabilisation far exceed whichever temporary benefitsmight have been previously obtained.Therefore, the ECB needs to remain focused on the maintenance of price stability in the medium term.The ECB pursues this objective in a consistent and forward-looking manner, ensuring the confidenceof all policy-makers, both within and outside the euro area.Experience so far suggests that the ECB has been able to keep inflationary expectations at a lowlevel. Although current HICP figures in the euro area are adversely affected by energy and foodprices, the current outlook is compatible with the maintenance of price stability in the medium term.This view is supported by the analysis of bond yields. It is comforting to see that market participantsexpect medium-term price developments to remain in line with the ECB's definition of price stability.Currently available forecasts give rise to the expectation that inflation will again fall below 2% in 2002.Hence, we appear to be on the right track. However, we must not ignore existing risks to price stability.The Governing Council of the ECB therefore always stresses that it is vigilant and will take intoaccount all new information that might affect the outlook for price stability in the medium term.Let me now conclude by recalling that, while the ECB cannot be held accountable for growth in theeuro area, interest rates in the euro area have been relatively low, and cannot, by any means, beconsidered to be an obstacle to growth. Currently, although uncertainty remains high, the generalexpectation is that growth in the euro area will remain at, or slightly above, trend potential growth inthe period ahead.Having said that, the ECB would welcome an increase of the already substantial contribution of theeuro area to global economic growth. However, this should be achieved in a lasting way, by increasingthe growth potential of the euro area. The growth potential of an economy, however, is determined bytechnological and structural factors. Raising its growth potential is an important challenge that the euroarea faces, achievement of which would spread its benefits throughout the world.While some reforms have already taken place, additional efforts are needed. Ongoing comprehensivestructural reforms of the labour and product markets remain essential in order to improve thefunctioning of markets in the euro area. Responsibility for these reforms lies with the governments,and with the key national economic agents on the side of labour and industry. It is crucial to increaseinvestment incentives through structural policy measures such as deregulation and privatisation.Fiscal policy should continue along the path of diminishing adverse incentives provided by tax, benefitand pension systems, while reforms on the expenditure side of the budget are also needed forprogress along the way towards the medium-term objective of attaining budgetary positions "close tobalance or in surplus".To sum up, although monetary policy cannot lift the euro area's growth potential, the benefits of pricestability for growth are evident, as stable prices provide the proper environment for structural reformsto work. While the ECB will maintain its commitment to the maintenance of price stability, otherpolicy-makers should assume responsibility for increasing the growth potential of the euro area. This,in turn, is the best allocation of responsibilities to contributing to sustainable non-inflationary growth inthe euro area and, thereby, also at a global level.
BIS Review 50/20011Lee Hsien Loong: Financial centres today and tomorrow: a SingaporeperspectiveAddress by Mr Lee Hsien Loong, Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore and Chairman of the MonetaryAuthority of Singapore, at the International Monetary Conference, Singapore, 4 June 2001.*      *      *Mr Sandy Warner, President, IMCLadies and Gentlemen:IntroductionI welcome all the delegates to this first IMC of the new century. Please allow me to share with you aSingapore perspective on financial centres as they are and as we expect them to be in the yearsahead.In the last few decades the pattern of international financial activity has undergone major changes.Starting with a high concentration in a very small number of financial centres, activity then spilt over tomore locations. But now with globalisation revolutionising the financial industry, and expanding theworldwide network of financial markets and activities, paradoxically the trend again seems to betowards concentration, with fewer mega financial centres, complemented by smaller centres with morespecialised focuses.In Europe, London is the premier full-service centre, with others like Frankfurt and Zurich occupyingstrong niches - Frankfurt in the derivatives business and Zurich in private banking. In America, NewYork is pre-eminent with Chicago playing a specialised role in financial futures, and Boston in assetmanagement. Both London and New York are not just continental but global financial centres, wherethe top financial institutions have congregated and capital markets run broad and deep.Asia does not have the equivalent of a London or New York. Tokyo is mainly domestic in orientation,while the smaller centres of Hong Kong and Singapore play more of a regional role.The economics of concentrationThis trend towards a mega financial centre complemented by smaller specialised centres in each timezone has persisted, even though technology has allowed market players to obtain information andtransact on it, virtually anywhere. Why has this concentration in activity happened?Firstly, technology has itself created tremendous economies of scale. This is especially so incommoditised markets such as foreign exchange and electronic financial services, and ininfrastructural facilities for payments and settlements, back-office processing and call centres.Secondly, critical mass of talent has become more important, with the growing complexity andmulti-faceted nature of finance. Talented and enterprising investment bankers, fund managers andcurrency traders work best when they can interact with other equally bright and capable people, tostrike deals, develop new products, exploit investment and business opportunities, and service clients.Executing financial deals requires a combination of top talent not only in finance and business, butalso in law, accounting, project management, and information technology. Few centres have the fullspread of necessary skills; fewer still have a critical mass of them. And for all the wonders oftelecommunications and the internet, there is no substitute as yet for face to face interaction betweentwo parties making a complex deal.Thirdly, issuers and investors in capital markets are placing a growing premium on liquidity. Capitalmarkets thrive on breadth and depth; and the broadest and deepest markets are those that transcendnational boundaries. Companies raising funds seek liquid markets, which attract investors and lowerthe cost of borrowing. So it is that many Asian companies issue bonds in the Euromarkets, andtechnology companies worldwide aspire to be listed on NASDAQ. Investors in turn seek liquidmarkets, because in rapidly changing conditions, the ability to move in and out of markets at minimalcost is critical.
2BIS Review 50/2001Fourthly, as a result of globalisation, small differences in conditions can translate into large differencesin outcomes. Market participants have always placed a premium on sound and responsive regulatorysystems. They seek jurisdictions that provide stable and resilient financial systems, and fair andefficient markets, at minimal regulatory cost and impediment to innovation. They prefer conducivebusiness environments which offer good market infrastructure, favourable tax treatment, and stableeconomic and political conditions. And talent has always preferred attractive living conditions. Theyvalue good schools, safe homes, clean environments, vibrant social and cultural activities, andcompetitive remuneration.In the New Economy, both financial capital and talent have become more mobile. More open financialmarkets and more liberal regulatory regimes have enabled institutions to choose where to reside andoperate. Countries have realised that people are the key success factor in the new economy. Theyhave opened their doors wide to the immigration of talent, and created a single global market for thosewhose skills are in demand. So the premium on sound regulation and good living conditions has goneup.LocationHowever, the trend towards concentration is unlikely to end in the extreme of only one or two globalfinancial hubs. Location still matters even in the globalised financial landscape of the New Economy.Physical proximity to potential clients will remain important, especially in capital market origination, theM&A business or private banking, where personal services and physical interactions with clients areessential. Indeed, the growing customisation of finance to suit local conditions and meet individualclient needs will mean that regional financial centres will continue to play a complementary role.Competition among financial centres will not be a zero-sum game of winner takes all. Smaller centrescan coexist with the mega centres, focusing on different niches and serving different regions. Thereare thus collective gains to be shared through co-operation. Linkages between key financial centres,both across and within time zones, can help the centres to reap the benefits of integration while at thesame time preserving close access to local communities. Similarly, there is an important role for closerregulatory co-operation and, where appropriate, harmonisation of standards, particularly incross-border listing requirements, ongoing supervision, and accounting and disclosure.For the regions they serve, international financial centres make good economic sense. They provideeasy access to funding and hedging opportunities, links to other key centres, and markets with liquidityand reach, especially for emerging economies.Financial centres tend to prosper when their hinterlands are buoyant. When the hinterland is indifficulty, the financial centre will be adversely affected, but it still plays an important role in facilitatingthe process of recovery. As confidence recovers and investor interest returns, the financial centre willbe an important conduit for the funds required for rehabilitation and growth.Thus as Asian economies make progress in putting themselves in order, they will need access toglobal capital for corporate restructuring and new investments. Singapore's financial centre will beready to play that role, whether the capital is to be raised through loan syndication, debt securitisation,private equity, or bond issuance.Financial centres in AsiaLooking ahead, the trend towards concentration of financial institutions and activities in fewer majorcentres is likely to persist. However, it is not easy to predict which specific cities will emerge as leadingcentres. This will depend not only on the static comparative advantage of the different cities, but alsoon the dynamic competitive advantages created by their policies and strategies. Incumbents willalways have an advantage, but no lead is totally unassailable, as London found to its dismay in 1998when within a few months Frankfurt snatched away the trading of German bund futures.London and New York will continue to be key global players. In Asia, while Tokyo will always be bigand significant, the role of the other centres is still unclear. Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney, and in thelonger term Shanghai are in play. Each has its advantages and limitations, stemming from differencesin their geographic and political situations, and their regulatory and corporate environments. They willsurely compete amongst themselves to gain market share and critical mass, and anchor in Asia someof business which presently goes to London and New York. But in my view they also have
BIS Review 50/20013considerable scope for co-operation, as each will occupy a distinct market niche and none candominate in all aspects of finance.Singapore will never have the advantage of Tokyo's large economic base. Nor do we have HongKong's physical proximity to China. But we seek to provide a world-class regulatory environment thatresponds to the needs of global markets and global institutions, and the most efficient infrastructure forbusinesses to use as a platform for all of Asia. Singapore plays host to some 6,000 multinationalcorporations and the financial institutions that are their global advisers, many of which use Singaporeas their regional headquarters. And our strategic location at the heart of Southeast Asia and within 7hours of key markets in Northeast Asia, South Asia, and Australia positions us well to serve as afinancial centre for all of Asia.SingaporeWhile the external environment is not within Singapore's control, our strategies and policies are. Webelieve that the right strategies and policies will help us to capitalise on opportunities and overcomedisadvantages arising from our size. There are no secrets to the strategies, because the factors forsuccess are not unique to Singapore. The challenge is in their execution and implementation. Hereare five things that we have set out to do in order to excel as a financial centre in the New Economy.Enhance business environmentFirst, we are seeking to further enhance our conducive pro-business environment. Economic andpolitical stability, an efficient and impartial legal system, comprehensive and up-to-date marketinfrastructure, and fiscal discipline that allows low taxes are key preconditions, more important thanspecial incentives for the financial sector. Singapore has established a reputation for delivering thesepreconditions, which we will maintain and improve upon in future.Build talent poolSecond, we are building up our talent pool. In a knowledge-intensive industry like financial services,Singapore will not get anywhere without world-class talent. We are making a concerted effort to attractforeign talent who can make a contribution to Singapore, and to integrate them into our economy andsociety. We are also nurturing home talent to its full potential through a good education system for theyoung and ongoing training opportunities for those in the workforce.As Asian companies begin to use more complex strategies and products, our financial institutionsneed the expertise to advise on these sophisticated techniques. From time to time they will fly outexperts from London or New York to service clients, but we must also build up our own indigenouscapabilities.To make the most of our talent, we must create an environment which encourages innovation andenterprise, rewards those who venture and succeed, and is tolerant of honest failure. This depends inpart on the culture of the society, which takes time to change. But it is also affected by the regulatoryand legal environment. Here we are working to remove impediments to enterprise, for example in thetax treatment of stock options.Singapore has long offered a good, wholesome living environment for international talent wanting towork or sink roots here. We are now paying greater attention to the less tangible aspects of the qualityof life. Our arts and entertainment scene has livened up considerably in recent years. I would stillhesitate to describe Singapore as funky, but certainly it is a far cry from being boring.The outcome of all our efforts is that one is beginning to hear a distinct buzz in Singapore.Develop sound and responsive regulationThird, specifically for the financial sector, we are constantly improving our regulatory and supervisoryregime. Good regulation commands a premium. The rules must be aligned with the underlying risks,and kept constantly updated, following global best practices. Prudential oversight must becomplemented by enhanced corporate disclosure and market discipline.
4BIS Review 50/2001The regulator's touch has to be sufficiently flexible and light, to let market forces work, innovationthrive, and the industry develop. But the regulator must also be vigilant in enforcing prudentialsafeguards, with firmness where necessary. A lighter touch does not mean a laxer approach, andmaintaining high standards of integrity, transparency and enforcement is more important than ever.Foster competitionFourth, we are opening up to, rather than sheltering from, global competition and the winds of change.To develop as a financial centre, we must attract global players to locate here and carry out moreactivities in Singapore. We have therefore been levelling the playing field for local and foreigncompetitors, and opening up hitherto closed parts of the financial industry, including domestic banking,insurance, and securities trading.We are completely open in the insurance industry and will be so in the securities industry as well fromnext year. We have, however, proceeded more cautiously in banking, where we consider it crucial forsystemic stability to have strong Singaporean banks retain a significant market share. Here ourapproach is to liberalise in a phased manner so as to inject more competition and spur the strongerSingapore banks to upgrade and compete, and not to put off liberalisation while waiting for smallerplayers to become strong and confident enough.We introduced the first banking liberalisation measures two years ago. We are now finalising a secondbanking liberalisation package, which we will announce at the end of this month.Promote key markets and activitiesFinally, we are actively promoting the development of specific markets and activities, which havestronger growth potential. An example is the wealth management industry. Another example is thedebt markets, which until recently were underdeveloped all across Asia.However, we should focus our resources first on activities where we have a natural advantage, or canbuild up a capability. We must push in the same direction as market forces, and not against them. Ourmain approach to developing the financial centre should therefore be to establish a level playing fieldwith transparent rules and the right environment, so that market forces can operate and innovation canflourish. Active promotion of specific activities complements this.ConclusionThe major changes in the financial industry compel financial centres to adapt and evolve, or else bebypassed and rendered irrelevant. Singapore aspires to be one of the financial centres in Asia, and anode in the global network of financial markets. By implementing the right policies and strategiesvigorously, we hope to develop and grow as a financial centre, serving Asia and contributing to itsdevelopment and prosperity.
BIS Review 49/20011David Carse: Bank consolidation in Hong KongSpeech by Mr David Carse, Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, at the JPMorgan Asian Financial Institutions Strategy Conference, Hong Kong, 1 June 2001.*      *      *Ladies and GentlemenI am grateful to J P Morgan for giving me the opportunity to speak to you this morning on the subjectof bank consolidation in Hong Kong.Consolidation of the banking industry has been a prominent feature of many of the world's leadingfinancial centres during the last decade. Hong Kong has been something of an outlier in this respect.My speech today will explain some of the reasons for this and will describe how and why this situationis changing. I will also discuss the attitude of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority towards the processof consolidation and what we can do to assist.The G10 Report on Financial ConsolidationThe trend towards amalgamation among the world's financial institutions prompted the G10 FinanceMinisters and Central Bank Governors in September 1999 to commission a study of financialconsolidation and its potential effects. A Working Party was formed for this purpose, which reported inJanuary of this year. The Report1 is available in both summary and detailed form on the BIS website.The G10 Report notes that there was a high level of merger and acquisition activity in the 1990samong the financial firms in the 13 countries studied. Banks were the main participants in this. Theannual number of M&A deals increased threefold during the 1990s and the total value of dealsincreased almost tenfold in the 13 countries as a whole. Moreover, the trend accelerated during theperiod, with a noticeable increase in activity in the last three years of the decade. As we proceed intothe first years of the 21st Century, there is little sign of this trend abating.The result has been the creation of a significant number of large and complex banking groups with aglobal reach. The host of today's conference is a living example of this. We also, of course, have ourown homegrown example in the shape of HSBC.Motivations for consolidationThe motivations behind all this activity are not hard to discern. Banks, like other companies, are inbusiness primarily to generate value for their shareholders. M&A, it is commonly held, offers aneffective means of achieving this through creating synergies that can increase revenue and reducecost. In particular, larger banks may be able to achieve revenue gains by filling gaps in their productrange and offering customers the opportunity of "one-stop shopping". Increased size and market sharemay give a bank more credibility in the eyes of larger customers, thus providing the opportunity forbigger and more value-added transactions. Size can also open the door into overseas markets. Acase in point is that a bank needs to have assets of at least US$20 billion to be eligible to establish abranch in Mainland China, which is at present beyond the reach of most local banks in Hong Kong.Future profits may also benefit from cost reductions arising from economies of scale – that is, theability to spread fixed costs, including particularly those which are technology-related, over a largerscale of operations. Cost economies can also be achieved by eliminating duplications in branchnetworks, functions and staff. There may also be a reduction in risk, and therefore saving in costs, dueto geographic or product diversification and the ability of larger institutions to invest in moresophisticated risk management systems. To the extent that risk reduction boosts a bank's credit rating,or increased size attracts the attention of investors, its cost of capital may be reduced, thus providinganother means to increase shareholder value.Of course, merger is not the only way to maximise value. Nor, must it be said, is M&A always pursuedfor this reason. Management may have its own motives for chasing size - personal ambition or herd                                                     1 "Consolidation in the Financial Sector": Group of Ten, January 2001, available at www.bis.org.
2BIS Review 49/2001instinct may also be part of the story. This may help to explain one of the paradoxes of theconsolidation boom. Lots of companies are doing it, but the success of M&A in achieving its statedobjectives of cost and revenue synergies is not clear-cut.Does M&A work?The G10 Report to which I referred concluded, for example, that there was only weak evidence of costreduction arising from increased size, except perhaps in the case of smaller banks. While there wasstronger evidence for improvement on the revenue side, the gains were probably not as large as thoseanticipated by the practitioners. Not surprisingly therefore, there was not much to show that, onaverage, M&A generated significant shareholder value. Rather, what tended to happen was that therewas a transfer of wealth from the shareholders of the acquirer to those of the target.Other studies, and some well-publicised mergers that have failed to deliver the promised benefits,support this somewhat sceptical view. It is however equally possible to point to cases where mergershave been successful. Indeed, most, if not all, of the market leaders in the industry have got to wherethey are today through a series of mergers that have taken place over the years. The risk, however, isthat banks may sometimes embark on a "merger too far". In other words, at some point the complexityof a merger may outstrip the ability of management to handle it, and diseconomies of scale set in.This means that we cannot really generalise about the success of bank mergers. The answer, as arecent study2 by UBS Warburg has indicated, seems to be that sometimes mergers work andsometimes they do not. It depends to a large extent on management capability. It also seems to be thecase that the benefits of mergers, in terms at least of securing economies of scale, may be relativelymore easy to exploit in the case of smaller retail banks. This may be relevant to the situation in HongKong, to which I now turn.The situation in Hong KongAs I mentioned at the beginning of this speech, the local banking system in Hong Kong has stoodsomewhat aloof from the general trend towards consolidation. The emergence of HSBC as a trulyglobal player over the last decade is of course an outstanding example of what can be achieved withthe help of M&A. But this has happened outside Hong Kong. Until recently, at least, the situation withinHong Kong has been more static.The family ownership of a number of local banks is often cited as one of the reasons for this. It is truethat family owners may be influenced by factors other than value maximisation, such as the desire topreserve the family heritage and to pass it on intact to the next generation. But an additional factor isthat hitherto banks in Hong Kong have not been under economic pressure to merge becauseprofitability has been satisfactory in absolute terms. Local banks recorded average growth in pre-taxprofits of 15% per annum in the six years prior to the Asian crisis. Moreover, most banks remainedprofitable during the crisis itself and all continued to maintain high capital ratios. Financial distress wastherefore not a driving force for merger, as it has been in other Asian countries.But there are signs that the consolidation process is gathering pace in Hong Kong. The reasons forthis are to some extent the same as those elsewhere. These include increased competition from bothdomestic and global players, deregulation, the need to invest in new technology and the increasedfocus, even for family-owned businesses, on generating shareholder value.All this means that the life of a banker in Hong Kong is not an easy one at present. Some of the oldcertainties are breaking down. The removal of the remaining interest rate controls in a month's timewill usher in a new era of full competition on the liabilities side of the balance sheet. While the surplusliquidity in the system may mitigate the immediate impact to some extent, banks will face newchallenges on products, pricing, fees and charges, and asset and liability management.This comes on top of the challenges that the banks are already facing to generate new lendingbusiness. The residential property market, which has been the mainstay of most of the local banks'business, is currently drifting without clear direction, and mortgage business is still sluggish, as thelatest figures for April demonstrated. Margins on new lending have been slashed without generatingmuch in the way of demand, and the effects of this on the overall net interest margin were evident in                                                     2 "The Urge to Merge - a Global Phenomenon": UBS Warburg, March 2001
BIS Review 49/20013the first quarter of this year. This in turn contributed to a moderate decline in the aggregate profits ofthe local banks' Hong Kong operations compared with the same period of last year.In this environment, where organic growth is hard to come by, it is not surprising that the local banksshould be asking themselves if they should merge or acquire or be acquired.Coupled with this are global or regional developments that impinge on Hong Kong. When foreignbanks merge in their home countries the combined entity may have operations in Hong Kong that arenow surplus to requirements and that they want to sell. This may attract willing buyers from bankswhich want to get into the Hong Kong market or expand their existing presence here. Some foreignbanks are in any case keen to acquire a presence in Hong Kong because they want to escape theconfines of their domestic market, and see attractive business opportunities in Hong Kong, both in itsown right and as a gateway to China. The latter may also be a reason for local banks to get bigger inorder to meet the size criterion for entry or expansion into the Mainland market.Whatever the motivation, a series of transactions have recently taken place that show that the pace ofconsolidation is picking up in Hong Kong. Last year, for example, we saw the acquisition by StandardChartered of the credit card and retail banking business of Chase Manhattan and the purchase byBank of East Asia of First Pacific Bank. This year, Development Bank of Singapore is in the process ofacquiring Dao Heng Bank with the intention of eventually combining it with its existing locallyincorporated subsidiary. Two of the Mainland banks, Bank of China and ICBC, are also consolidatingtheir Hong Kong operations. The Bank of China move is particularly significant since it will create thesecond largest banking group incorporated in Hong Kong.What we have not so far seen in Hong Kong is merger among indigenous banks that are more or lessof equal footing. This is perhaps not surprising. Such mergers are generally more difficult to arrangethan straightforward acquisitions of a smaller bank by a larger bank. In the latter case, the acquirer isin a position to decide what it wants to do as regards management and staff changes, harmonisationof systems and the introduction of new products. With a true merger, these matters have to be settledby consensus, which may not be easy. Who for example is going to be the chairman or chiefexecutive? It is probably better to avoid the Japanese solution of sharing each of these responsibilitiesamong more than one individual.There is also the question of what is the end-result of the merger in terms of market share. It may benecessary for more than two banks to get together in order to achieve a significant increase in scale.But the more banks that are involved in a merger, the greater the complexity of achieving strategic fitand cultural harmony.The attitude of the HKMAThis reinforces the general point made earlier that successful execution of M&A is not an easy task.However, despite the potential pitfalls, the HKMA continues to believe that consolidation of the localbanking sector is desirable and probably inevitable. This is for the reasons I have already mentioned.In general, it is difficult to see how a banking system like Hong Kong's, which is open to the forces ofglobal competition, can resist the pressures that are leading to consolidation in other banking systems.In terms of Hong Kong's particular situation, while it is always dangerous to extrapolate current marketconditions into the future, it does appear that organic growth is going to be more difficult to achievethan it was in the years before the Asian crisis.This lays greater stress on the need for smaller banks to find a strategy that will differentiatethemselves from their competitors and enable them to earn an adequate return on capital. This will notbe straightforward, particularly since a number of the potential business options such as wealthmanagement involve heavy set-up costs that need scale to justify them. Such new businesses arealso more demanding in terms of managerial skills and smaller banks may find it difficult to attract theright talent.Consolidation by means of M&A is not the only way of grappling with these issues, as the BankConsortium Trust has shown, but it is an option that the local banks in Hong Kong should keep verymuch in mind. This should be done as part of an ongoing process of strategic planning that looksahead to the medium-term rather than simply the next year. The outcome of this process may be thatthe bank opts to stay as a stand-alone entity. This is a valid commercial decision if taken in aconscious and considered manner rather than by default. However, it should be kept under regularreview in the light of the changing financial landscape.
4BIS Review 49/2001Against this background, the position of the HKMA on bank consolidation can be summarised asfollows:(cid:1) We continue to believe that we cannot, and should not try to, force healthy banks to mergeor be acquired against their will. As noted above, this has to be a matter of commercialjudgement by the banks concerned. It would be difficult for the HKMA to form a better viewthan market participants of how they should partner themselves, particularly since thesuccess of individual mergers is by no means assured. Forced marriages between banks areeven more unlikely to be successful.(cid:1) We will, however, where appropriate, raise the issue of consolidation in meetings with banks'board of directors and management, and will encourage them to make it part of theirstrategic planning.(cid:1) We will also do what we can to provide appropriate incentives for banks to think seriouslyabout consolidation, in particular by removing potential barriers to competition such as thelast remaining controls on interest rates.(cid:1) We will not erect artificial barriers to acquisition of local banks by foreign banks, which wouldbe contrary to Hong Kong's traditional free market ethos and our commitments under WTO.(cid:1) We note the view that is sometimes expressed that it would be desirable for Hong Kong toretain a core of strong, locally owned banks. This is something that we would support, but itis not something that we can deliver. Rather, it would depend on whether the local banks canagree to merge among themselves.(cid:1) We will do what we can to facilitate individual transactions that are put to us forconsideration. This will include giving prompt advice on what is acceptable from a bankingregulatory point of view. We will also look sympathetically at the use of acceptable debtinstruments to finance mergers as opposed to our previous preference for equity or cash.This reflects modern trends in capital management.(cid:1) We may also be prepared to relax our capital requirements for an acquiring bank on a strictlytemporary basis provided that there are firm and credible plans by the acquirer to raise newcapital. This would only apply where, for good reasons, the timing of the acquisition cannotcoincide with the timing of the issue of capital.ConclusionsTo summarise, consolidation offers the banks, and perhaps especially smaller institutions, theopportunity to achieve cost reductions and revenue enhancements. This is not, however, somethingthat can be taken for granted, and there will always be a certain element of execution risk. This is oneof the reasons why it is difficult for banking regulators, like the HKMA, to take a heavy-handedapproach towards mandating consolidation. Rather, proposals should emanate from the industry itselfbased on careful examination of strategic fit and quantification of the benefits that will flow from themerger or acquisition.While the local banks are not under immediate pressure to consolidate, we believe that this is an issuethat they should keep under close and continuing review.
BIS Review 48/20011The Rt Hon Sir Edward George: The convergence of financial systemsSpeech by The Rt Hon Sir Edward George, Governor of the Bank of England, at the OesterreichischeNationalbank Economics Conference held in Vienna, 31 May 2001.*      *      *The theme of this session is convergence of financial systems, within the context of the overallconference theme of "The single financial market – two years into EMU". What I propose to do thismorning is to ask, first, what are we – or should we be – looking for from our financial systems; then toask, secondly, what are the major driving forces that have been, and are, affecting our financialsystems – including but not confined to EMU; and, finally, to offer some thoughts on how thosesystems might continue to evolve.So let me begin by asking what should we look for in our financial systems. In answering that questionI suppose I could give you a long list of particular payments and savings services as well as credit,investment and insurance services, provided to individuals, to private organisations and businesses ofall kinds, and to various levels of government. But that would be simply a description of our financialsystems which do still differ in many respects as a result of history and tradition, of particular localneeds, and of the state of evolution in individual countries. We are more interested in the essentialpurpose of our financial systems. And at the very heart of that is their capacity to bring togetherfinancial resources not currently needed by their owners for expenditure on consumption or physicalinvestment, and to channel those resources to wherever they can be most productively used – alwaysallowing for risk.The free movement of capital, like free trade in goods and services, is an immensely powerful meansof promoting efficient resource allocation nationally, regionally and globally, and as such it can make amajor contribution to improving economic welfare – reducing poverty and raising living standards –which is, of course, what we all want to see. Certainly the free movement of capital, like free trade,needs to be governed by rules designed to minimise distortions and unfairness, and to reduce therisks of intermediaries being unable to honour their commitments or of broader, systemic, instability. Idon't pretend for a moment that it works perfectly in practice: we could all well do without the well-publicised institutional failures of recent years, for example, or the volatility which characterised theAsian financial crisis or the more recent "tech stock" bubble. But it is certainly the most effectivemeans of financial resource allocation that we have so far discovered. The challenge is to make itwork more effectively – more efficiently, both in terms of intermediation costs, and crucially in terms ofthe direction of the flow of resources – but also more reliably and securely for both savers andborrowers. This is largely down to financial markets themselves. But it is a challenge, too, for thefinancial authorities who need to balance the need for market competition with the maintenance ofminimum prudential and business behavioural standards by individual financial institutions, and theneed to preserve overall macro-level financial stability. How far we are succeeding in meeting thischallenge is, to my mind, the essential criterion against which we should seek to assess thedevelopment of our financial systems.Against that background let me now try to identify some of the main drivers of change that have been,and are, affecting all our financial systems to varying degrees.The first is financial deregulation, that is to say the relaxation of controls designed to override marketforces in either an overall macro-economic or a directional sense. In the case of the UK this extendsback very importantly to the abolition of exchange controls and direct controls over bank lending overtwenty years ago, to enabling building societies (our principal mortgage providers) to extend theirrange of financial services activities, to the opening up of membership of the Stock Exchange andbroader capital market intermediation and so on.Deregulation in this sense was both encouraged by, and in turn contributed to, increasingly intensecompetition within the financial services industry, including a blurring of traditional distinctions betweendifferent types of financial institution. They were accompanied by what I think of as "re-regulation" thatis to say more formal and structured regulation of both the prudential behaviour and standards ofconduct of virtually all financial services activity targeted more specifically at both institutional stabilityand consumer protection but, subject to that, leaving the market to do its job. Such regulation in theUK has now been consolidated in a single, over-arching, financial services regulator, the FSA(Financial Services Authority). The Bank of England remains responsible for macro-prudential
2BIS Review 48/2001oversight, that is to say the stability of the financial system as a whole, including oversight of paymentssystems. But we are no longer responsible for prudential banking supervision at the micro-level.The re-regulation process, of course, conforms with the access provisions of the WTO and withinternationally-agreed standards agreed within the IMF. It incorporates the minimum standards ofbanking supervision agreed (and now subject to revision) under the Basel Accord. It incorporates, too,those measures that have so far been agreed at the regional, European, level relating to a wider rangeof financial services activity in the context of progress towards the single financial market.Whether or not these initiatives lead over time towards greater "convergence" of our financial systemsin some structural sense – as they may – taken together with national deregulation they should atleast contribute to greater competition, including cross-border competition, and help to improve theeffectiveness of our financial systems in terms of the key criterion which I suggested earlier in myremarks.That is particularly true, at least potentially, of the steps proposed to advance the European singlefinancial market, as set out in the Commission's Financial Services Action Plan, because of its broadscope. But progress has so far been painfully slow. In that context I welcome the recent emphasis oncloser and more active co-operation between financial regulators within Europe, regardless of nationalregulatory structures. And I particularly welcome the proposals put forward by Alexandre Lamfalussyand his "Wise Men" for accelerating progress on measures that would encourage greater efficiency inEurope's securities markets. But there is clearly a great deal more that we can do in this whole area.Such changes in national financial services regulation, and related international and regional actions,taken together with increasing awareness in many parts of the world of the potential advantages ofopening national financial markets to international competition, provide an encouraging environmentfor a second main driver of change in our financial systems – globalisation. It is a process we areparticularly conscious of in London where major financial institutions from all over the world, including,of course, from elsewhere in Europe, have long been predominant players, especially in internationalwholesale market activity. But international ownership of banks (including newly privatised banks) andother financial institutions has increasingly become a common characteristic of financial systems in awide range of other countries. I will not comment further on globalisation, which is certainly veryfamiliar to you, except perhaps to say that I have often been teased by people who talk about theWimbledonisation of the City of London – meaning that we provide the tournament venue but theprizes are mostly carried off by competitors from overseas. I think that many of those people nowincreasingly understand that it is activity rather than nationality of ownership which creates acompetitive market place, and in turn provides employment and income and tax revenue, which arethe things that really contribute to the macro-economy. As a broad generalisation the wider the rangeof participants the more efficient the market place.A third major driver of change in our financial systems – as elsewhere in our economies – is, ofcourse, information technology. This has clearly transformed transactions processing, putting apremium on throughput, and encouraging some forms of specialisation and consolidation. It has madepossible entirely new – and typically much cheaper – means of delivering financial services making iteasier for new entrants to contest existing franchises. It has facilitated the development of newfinancial instruments and investment strategies, and it has radically changed trading mechanisms. Itshould also have made it easier for both financial institutions and their regulators to measure, monitorand manage risk. But the electronic revolution, as it applies to our financial systems, has clearly had avery positive impact on the efficiency of all our financial markets and no doubt still has a long way togo.Other major drivers include: the effects of rising living standards and the associated increase infinancial wealth; and the consequences of ageing populations in many of our countries with a relatedemphasis on private pension provision. They include also the impact of fiscal policies which are nowtypically directed to limiting budget deficits and reducing public sector debt and of monetary policiesdirected at consistently low inflation as a necessary condition for sustainable economic growth. Manyof these trends seem likely to encourage a continuing relative shift in savings and investment patternstowards private sector capital market intermediation, although such intermediation will often be carriedout by banks or within banking groups. I've no doubt that you can all think of other important drivers ofchange in our financial systems.And all of this before we even come to EMU!
BIS Review 48/20013Now, let me be clear, I agree with those who argue that the single currency – by eliminating exchangerisk within the participating countries – can make a significant contribution to increasing the depth andliquidity of financial markets and reducing transactions costs within the Eurozone. And indeed italready has had that effect, particularly in money and bond markets, especially the corporate bondmarket. It has no doubt also been a factor encouraging the tendency to, mostly national, consolidationas financial institutions prepare for greater competition from other euro-based institutions in theirnational markets. All of this is very positive for the competitive efficiency of Euro-zone financialsystems both nationally and within the Eurozone as a whole. It is in fact one of the two main potentialeconomic benefits of the single currency, the other, of course, being the positive effect of nominalexchange rather certainty within the Eurozone on trade flows of goods and other, non-financial,services and its impact in more efficient resource allocation. It is also the field in which the UK, throughLondon, has been able to make a positive contribution to the development of the Euro even fromoutside the Eurozone.So I do not at all underestimate the contribution that the euro has made, and is making, to improvingthe efficiency of the Eurozone financial systems. But the point I have tried to emphasise this morningis that it is just one important factor among a number of others affecting our financial systems, so thatone should not perhaps expect that it would have had a dramatic overall impact – certainly not in soshort a period of time. And my message is that there are many other things beyond the introduction ofthe single currency that we can and should do, whether from inside or outside the Eurozone toimprove the functioning of our financial systems.Nationally, certainly within the UK, apart from continuing to try to find the right balance generallybetween competition and necessary regulation, we need also – through the authorities and thefinancial markets working together – to continue working to ensure that the financial system reachesthose parts of the economy that are traditionally most difficult to get at, including particularly theencouragement of smaller and medium-sized businesses and new enterprises as well as communitydevelopment and regeneration.Regionally, within Europe, as I said earlier, we need to work away at developing the single financialmarket, pressing on with the Financial Services Action Plan. Most immediately, in line with theLamfalussy recommendations, we need to address some of the regulatory obstacles to greaterintegration of securities markets. And we need to encourage the markets to find more efficientsolutions to trading, clearing and settlement systems, particularly in securities markets, but also moregenerally.The main driver in this last context, certainly from the point of view of those who use these systems, isthe wish to reduce costs. It is often pointed out that there are thirty plus exchanges in Europe andprobably at least as many settlement systems – which are linked to a greater, but often to a lesser,degree, which operate under different legal and regulatory regimes and which all incur their ownrunning and development costs. The fragmentation also means that market participants incur indirectcosts because it is harder for them to manage their liquidity and collateral efficiently. So the generalmessage, which commands wide support, is that some serious consolidation would be in order. Thequestion however is how to bring this about.I will not go into the technical debate about horizontal versus vertical integration, nor into thedistinctions – which are nevertheless important – between trading, clearing and settlement. And thereare other, less technical, influences too, including perceptions of national interest. But whatever thereasons it is proving difficult for the markets to make real progress in these areas. In the face of this,there are those who argue for some outside party to intervene and enforce consolidation. The outsideparty some seem to have in mind is the authorities in one guise or another. I have to say that I havedoubts about the wisdom of such an approach. There is little reason to suppose that the authoritiesare likely to be any better than the private sector at finding the way forward. Nor is it obvious thatnational authorities have the locus or leverage to insist on a particular model. Much the samereservations would apply to any European level intervention. That said, what the public sector cancontribute, in this area as in financial markets more generally, is a removal of barriers to competition,requirements on the provision of information and the easing of constraints on the effective functioningof the market. If consolidation does indeed take place, the public authorities may also have a role inensuring that heavily concentrated market infrastructure providers do not exploit their position. But at aEuropean level we are at present still some way from this situation.And internationally we need to work together, within the WTO and the IMF, as well as within thevarious international regulatory and professional bodies, to promote the global free movement of
4BIS Review 48/2001capital, because in this context – as in the case of free trade – the potential benefits are not confinedto national or even regional boundaries but increase within wider international participation.Mr Chairman, we have come a long way in improving the effectiveness of our financial systems, andthere are powerful forces at work pushing us in the right direction – including, within Europe, theintroduction of the euro. But we still have a very long way to go. I have no doubt that the effort willprove to be worthwhile.
BIS Review 48/20011Lim Hng Kiang: Meeting the challenges of the globalised economyOpening remarks by Mr Lim Hng Kiang, Deputy Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, atthe 36th SEACEN Governors' Conference, Singapore, 31 May 2001.*      *      *Honourable GovernorsDistinguished Guests and DelegatesLadies and GentlemenIntroductionIt gives me great pleasure to bid you a warm welcome to the Annual Conference of the Governors ofthe South-East Asian Central Banks. This is the 36th Conference and reflects the close ties and strongco-operation that central banks and monetary authorities in the region have forged over the last30 years.SEACEN economy/Recent financial developmentsThis year's Conference is held amid concerns of a global economic slowdown. After expanding by anaverage rate of 7.3% in the year 2000, prospects for regional economies are set to slow this year.Average real GDP growth for the East Asian economies1 is projected to fall to around 4.5% for 2001.The slowdown will be due largely to the cyclical downturn in the US economy, as well as the globalelectronics industry, both of which will hurt regional exports.Due to its very open nature, East Asian economies are susceptible to the current global downturn inexternal demand. The US is the largest export market for most of the SEACEN economies, with exportshares averaging 20%. In terms of goods structure, electronics accounts for over 20% of total exportsin all East Asian economies. Exacerbating the downturn is the continued economic weakness inJapan, the second largest market in the region. Reflecting the weak external environment, exportgrowth in many SEACEN economies has fallen sharply. This has also undermined domestic demand.Challenges for AsiaConcerns over the slowing growth in the US and the much weaker Japanese economy have hitregional currencies. Since end-2000, regional currencies have seen higher volatility. While the greaterflexibility of exchange rates has reduced the risk of large speculative attacks, such fluctuations are notwithout risk. The challenge facing policymakers is how to ensure the greater exchange rate flexibilitydoes not lead to greater financial system fragility.Aside from macro-prudential risk, financial regulators also faced challenges arising from the rapidchanges in the global financial landscape. In particular, advancement in technology, investors'demand for shareholder value and customers' demand for integrated financial supervision haveaccelerated consolidation and globalisation of financial institutions and markets. The boundaries of thebanking, insurance and securities industries are less clearly defined. This calls for a more harmonisedand integrated approach to supervision of the financial system. Besides co-ordinating among thedifferent regulatory bodies to address unsupervised risks, overlaps and gaps in their regulatoryframework, there may be a need to re-look the way national regulatory and supervisory authorities areorganised, to create greater synergies and enhance efficiency.At the international level, efforts are underway to strengthen the architecture of the internationalfinancial system. In particular, efforts have been taken to increase transparency, and develop andimplement standards and codes to promote greater stability and enhance the robustness of financialsystems to shocks. Efforts undertaken by international financial institutions include the IMF's Reports                                                     1 The East Asian 9 economies are Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, Singapore, Korea, Chinese Taipei,Hong Kong and China.
2BIS Review 48/2001on Standards and Codes (ROSCs), and the IMF/World Bank's Financial Sector Assessment Program(FSAP). Many developing countries, however, have expressed concerns over the tendency of theseorganisations to adopt a one-size-fits-all approach without taking into account the differentcircumstances and varying implementation capacity of the countries involved.In the banking industry, the Basle Capital Accord of 1988 was a landmark agreement which helped toincrease the capital held by internationally active banks, and to create a more level playing field forbanks under different jurisdictions. However, the rapid changes in banking and finance have ledregulators to propose a New Basle Capital Accord which will establish a more risk sensitive andcomprehensive capital framework, to benefit banks as well as improve safety and soundness of thefinancial system. The new Accord, however, poses challenges to Asian banks and regulators alike.The banks would have to develop more sophisticated risk management capability while the regulatorswould need to build up technical knowledge as well as supervisory resources to validate banks' riskmanagement systems and determine if banks are sufficiently well capitalised on an on going basis.MAS initiatives to face the challengesI am sure Governors will discuss at length the various challenges that I have highlighted earlier.Perhaps I could share with Governors efforts taken by Singapore to address some of thesechallenges.The Monetary Authority of Singapore undertook a fundamental review of our supervisory andregulatory policies. In the area of banking, our reforms have focussed on liberalising the bankingsector, strengthening corporate governance and raising disclosure standards of local banks, andshifting away from one-size-fits-all regulation to risk-based supervision. MAS announced a five-yearprogramme to liberalise access by foreign banks to the domestic banking sector in May 1999. We arecurrently reviewing the measures to position ourselves for the next phase of liberalisation.In the area of corporate governance, MAS has set guidelines on the composition, roles andresponsibilities of banks' Board of Directors and Nominating Committees. We are finalising theguidelines for the Compensation and Audit Committees. Local banks are also required to divest all oftheir non-financial business interests to limit contagion risks to the local banks arising from theirnon-financial businesses, enhance market discipline and improve transparency, and focusmanagement attention on core banking business. Disclosure standards of our banks have also beensignificantly raised. Local banks have taken steps to disclose directors' remuneration, related partytransactions and risk management practices. They will be disclosing further details next year on allthese areas.Our success in these endeavours will require effort by all market participants. A private-sector-ledpanel will be set up later this year to advise the Ministry of Finance and the Monetary Authority ofSingapore on matters relating to corporate governance, disclosure requirements and accountingstandards. Through feedback from market players and continual reviews, we will continue to refine ourregulations to promote competition and innovation whilst maintaining high prudential standards andthe stability of the financial system.The future of SEACENThe Asian financial crisis clearly demonstrated that the world has become more inter-linked.Liberalisation of markets in the region resulted in the fortune of each economy being more intertwinedto one another than ever before. There is much scope for co-operation, and room for economies tolearn from the experiences of one another. Over the past couple of years, there has also been aproliferation of regional and international foras, bringing together regulators and government officialsto deliberate the intricacies of financial stability.In this regard, the challenge for SEACEN is to remain attuned to the needs of its various members,and to maintain its relevance by reaching out to its members. The SEACEN Centre has played animportant role in facilitating the exchange of information and expertise on financial supervision and theconduct of monetary policy among the staff of SEACEN central banks. There is room for greaterco-operation among regulators, as well as with other regional groupings and international financialinstitutions. SEACEN should explore ways to leverage off the expertise of these various groupings,and to create greater synergies through partnership and co-operation.
BIS Review 48/20013I understand that the SEACEN Board of Governors will deliberate at length a strategic review of theSEACEN Centre during the Conference. This is an opportunity for Governors to re-examine therelevance of SEACEN activities, and explore ways in which SEACEN can better serve its members.SEACEN has to reposition itself to meet the challenges of the new globalised economy.ConclusionWe have a full and demanding agenda ahead of us. At the same time, the Conference tomorrow willallow us to share experiences and exchange ideas, as well as strengthen existing relationships andforge new friendships. I would also like to wish all participants a pleasant stay in Singapore. I nowhave the pleasure of declaring the 36th SEACEN Governors Conference open.Enjoy the evening. Thank you.
BIS Review 47/20011Svein Gjedrem: Economic developments and monetary policy in NorwaySpeech by Mr Svein Gjedrem, Governor of the Norges Bank, at the meeting of the National Council ofthe Confederation of Norwegian Commercial and Service Enterprises, Oslo, 30 May 2001.*      *      *Monetary policy objectives and guidelinesThe most important objective of monetary policy is to contribute to low and stable inflation. Economicagents should be fairly certain of the future value of money. High and fluctuating inflation impairs thefunction of prices as an information vehicle. Agreements pertaining to sales and purchases, loans andinterest rates are concluded in nominal krone amounts. The tax system is in nominal rates. When theprice level displays wide variations, it is difficult to predict the real content of agreements and budgets.Unexpected swings in the price level can easily lead to fluctuations in the real economy and instabilityin financial and property markets. The experience of our country and that of others in the 1970s,1980s and 1990s is that periods of high inflation are followed by downturns with high unemployment.High and variable inflation also leads to an arbitrary redistribution of wealth and income. Hence pricestability is the best contribution monetary policy can make to economic growth, welfare andappropriate distribution.This spring, the Government and the Storting (Norwegian parliament) issued new guidelines foreconomic policy. The guideline for fiscal policy implies the use of petroleum revenues equivalent to theexpected real return on the Government Petroleum Fund, ie an estimated increase in the use ofpetroleum revenues over the central government budget of about 0.4 per cent of mainland GDP eachyear up to 2010. A clear majority in the Storting supported the Government's long-term strategy forusing petroleum revenues.
2BIS Review 47/2001At the same time, the guidelines stipulate that the Government shall use the budget to stabiliseeconomic developments. The annual budget resolutions will provide an indication of the emphasisplaced on this consideration.The Norwegian economy and state finances are marked by a high and varying level of petroleumrevenues. The basis for determining central government expenditure from one year to the next maythus easily be impaired. If budget outlays are allowed to swing in pace with oil prices, the result maybe abrupt shifts and instability in the Norwegian economy. Changes in oil prices will then rapidlyinfluence wage and price expectations, the exchange rate and long-term interest rates. In that case, itwould be very demanding to ensure price stability. This would prompt rapid and pronounced changesin short-term interest rates and be accompanied by a higher risk premium on Norwegian kroner, whichwould lead to a generally higher interest rate level over time. Norges Bank therefore attachessubstantial importance to what seems to have become a fairly broad consensus on a long-term anchorfor fiscal policy that takes into account possible fluctuations in oil prices from one year to the next. Therule would appear to be credible as well since it is robust in relation to various scenarios for oil pricesand oil production.The Government was of the view that a clearer anchor was required to reinforce monetary policy’s rolein underpinning stable economic developments. This is why Norges Bank was given a new operationalmandate for monetary policy. Norges Bank shall set the key rate with a view to maintaining low andstable inflation. The inflation target is set at 2½ per cent.The new mandate for monetary policy is in line with international practice. Sweden and the UK havean inflation target. These countries generally have a positive track record, but this may also beascribable to a situation that was conducive to low inflation after the downturn in many countries in theearly 1990s.In our view, there has been a reasonable degree of confidence in monetary policy over the pastdecade. Inflation has been low and stable. By quantifying an inflation target, the Government maynevertheless have made it easier to understand Norwegian monetary policy.With the revision of monetary policy, the Government has also, in our view, recognised low inflation asa benefit in itself. A track record of low inflation over several years has provided Norges Bank with a
BIS Review 47/20013better basis for implementing monetary policy.The new guidelines do not imply a significant change in the conduct of monetary policy. The key rateis set on the basis of an overall assessment of the inflation outlook.Higher interest rates curb demand for goods and services and reduce inflation. Lower interest ratesstimulate economic growth. Lower interest rates have the opposite effects. If evidence suggests thatinflation with unchanged interest rates will be higher than 2½ per cent, the interest rate will beincreased. If it appears that inflation with unchanged interest rates will be lower than 2½ per cent, theinterest rate will be reduced. There is symmetry here. It is equally important to avoid an inflation ratethat is too low, as it is to avoid an inflation rate that is too high.A change in interest rates is not expected to have an immediate effect on inflation. Our analysesindicate that a substantial share of the effects of an interest rate change occurs within two years. Twoyears is thus a reasonable time horizon for achieving the inflation target of 2½ per cent. Hence, thekey rate is set with a view to achieving an inflation rate of 2½ per cent two years ahead.In some situations where unexpected events lead to an inflation rate that is too high, it may beappropriate to apply a longer time horizon than two years. For example, reducing inflation to 2½ percent within this time horizon may be associated with unnecessary real economic costs. A preconditionfor applying a longer time horizon is that there is clear evidence of strong confidence in low and stableinflation over time on the part of economic agents. As experience with setting interest rates using aninflation target is gained, the scope for placing emphasis on stability in the real economy will probablyincrease.Low and stable inflation is a necessary precondition for stability in the foreign exchange and financialmarket and the property market. However, there have been episodes where bubbles haveaccumulated in these markets, in the form of sharp increases in asset prices in an environment of lowinflation. Price increases in property and financial markets can have a considerable impact on wagegrowth and consumer price inflation after a period. When the bubbles burst, the result may be aneconomic downturn. Developments in financial markets and property markets can be a source of amore unstable inflation environment. In principle, it would be appropriate to use the interest rate tocounter this. In practice, however, it is difficult to assess whether price trends in property and financialmarkets are sustainable.When Norges Bank concludes that a change in the key rate is appropriate, the change will in mostcases be made gradually. This is because there is normally uncertainty attached to the situation in theeconomy, disturbances to which the economy may be exposed and how fast an interest rate changeinfluences price inflation. But we will not always take a gradualist approach. A rapid and pronouncedchange in the interest rate is appropriate if, for example, heightening turbulence in financial markets ora cost-push shock resulting from negotiations indicates that confidence in monetary policy is injeopardy.Norges Bank analyses the inflation outlook in its Inflation Report, which is published three times ayear. Further assessments are presented every sixth week in connection with the Executive Board'smonetary policy meetings. It is, as mentioned, the inflation outlook two years ahead that determinesthe interest rate set by Norges Bank. If special circumstances prompt Norges Bank to apply a differenttime horizon, the Bank will provide an assessment of this. The same applies should special emphasisbe placed on developments in financial markets and property markets.Today's inflation rate is partly the result of the interest rate that was set one to two years ago. Currentinflation figures do not provide an adequate basis for determining the level at which interest ratesshould be set today. Monthly figures for the consumer price index are also influenced by random andtemporary factors that have little impact on developments in inflation over time. Precipitation levelshave an effect on electricity prices. Changes in indirect taxes have an immediate impact on theconsumer price index. The direct effects of these factors on inflation are exhausted after a year.Hence these factors do not have any implications for the interest rate, which is normally set with aview to maintaining inflation at 2½ per cent two years ahead.However, it is still interesting to adjust monthly inflation figures for temporary effects to determinewhether developments are broadly in line with our projections. This is why Norges Bank presentsfigures for consumer price inflation where the effects of some temporary factors are excluded.However, the automatic adjustment of inflation figures for direct effects of one-off factors can also beassociated with pitfalls. Higher indirect taxes and electricity prices can be a source of acceleratinginflation via spillover effects on other prices and wages.
4BIS Review 47/2001The mandate for monetary policy with an inflation target provides a sound basis for assessing NorgesBank's interest rate setting. Inflation at one point in time, adjusted for certain temporary effects,provides a measure of whether interest rate setting was appropriate. Market participants and otherscan assess the quality in the inflation reports and analyses published by the Bank, and whether ouranalyses are consistent with our interest rate setting. The uncertainty associated with economicdevelopments and inflation, as observed since the mid-1990s, may indicate that we normally reach theinflation target within an interval of +/- 1 percentage point.The Government has assigned a task to Norges Bank. Norges Bank uses its professional judgementin a delimited area. The results of our decisions can be measured. Hence the government authoritiescan evaluate our performance.The interest rate differential against other countries has widenedCentral banks in several countries have reduced interest rates earlier this year with a view tocountering an economic turnaround. The Federal Reserve has cut the federal funds target rate by atotal of 2½ percentage points since the beginning of the year. The Bank of England and the EuropeanCentral Bank have recently cut rates. There is a also a tendency towards a more expansionary fiscalstance in many countries. In the US, fiscal policy has become somewhat more expansionary aftermany years of relatively tight budgets. Many European countries have also taken a pause in theconsolidation of state finances.Norges Bank increased the sight deposit rate – which is our key rate – by a total of 1½ percentagepoints last year. So far this year, the key rate has remained unchanged. As a result, the differencebetween short-term rates in Norway and other countries has increased. Money market rates are about3 percentage points higher than among our trading partners. Money market rates are 3½ percentagepoints lower in Sweden than in Norway.The wider interest rate differential implies, in isolation, a somewhat tighter monetary policy. The kronebecomes a more attractive investment currency, and this may have contributed to strengthening thekrone. Investments in the NOK market are now generating a return of 7 per cent. A stronger kronereduces the cost of imported goods and services for enterprises and households. Imported inflation islower. So far this year, the import-weighted krone exchange rate has appreciated by about 3 per cent.Substantial uncertainty surrounding international economic developmentsThere is considerable uncertainty attached to international economic developments.
BIS Review 47/20015In the US, industrial output and retail sales have weakened markedly over the last three months.Between March and April employment declined by more than 200 000. GDP growth slowed from anannualised rate of a good 5 per cent in the first half of 2000 to about 1 per cent in the fourth quarter oflast year and the first quarter of 2001.US equities, as measured for example by the Dow Jones index, declined markedly through 2000 andin the first quarter of this year. Stock markets in other countries also fell during this period. Equityprices have picked up again since the beginning of April, however. In addition, industrial commodityprices and oil prices have risen over the last month. Moreover, long-term interest rates haveincreased. These developments may indicate that many operators in financial markets and commoditymarkets have again become somewhat more optimistic about the prospects ahead.Household and business confidence also deteriorated through the latter half of last year and early thisyear, but has remained steady over the last two to three months, as illustrated by the confidenceindicators in this chart.
6BIS Review 47/2001There is substantial uncertainty associated with developments in Japan. Industrial output and exportshave declined. The financial sector is struggling in the face of large losses and poor performance, andthe general price level is falling.In the euro area the picture is mixed. Growth is solid in countries like France, Finland and Ireland.Germany has a large internationally exposed industrial sector, which is feeling the effects of theslowdown in growth in the US and Asia. In a survey1, growth forecasts for Germany have been reviseddownwards this year from 3 per cent a few months ago to a good 2 per cent. Economic growthprospects for Sweden and the UK are also weaker than a few months ago.However, the easing of monetary and fiscal policy in many countries should contribute to a pick-up ingrowth and reduce the risk of a pronounced international downturn.The Norwegian economy will be particularly hard hit by an international downturn if this translates intoa sharp fall in oil prices and other commodity prices that are important for Norwegian exports. Thiswould lead to lower export revenues and slower growth. Employment would also be affected. Aninternational downturn would also lead to lower prices for imported goods and services and therebyreduce domestic inflation. If other Nordic countries are negatively affected, this will have an impact onthe supply of labour in Norway since the Nordic labour market has become increasingly integrated.Continued pressures in the Norwegian economy                                                     1 Consensus Forecasts.
BIS Review 47/20017Available labour resources are limited in the Norwegian economy. The labour force participation rate ishigh. Vacancies are numerous, particularly in the health sector, schools and the construction industrydue to a shortage of teachers, nurses, dentists and construction workers. Extensive use of disabilityand sickness benefits is limiting the supply of labour. Reforms such as contractual pension schemes,which were stepped up through the 1990s, cash allowances for families with small children and anincreased number of vacation days this year and next also contribute to reducing the effective laboursupply.The country as a whole is experiencing labour shortages, but the differences between regions andindustries are considerable. In Eastern Norway, where service industries are very important,unemployment has declined the last year. From 1998 to 2000 alone, employment in private servicesrose by 26 000 nationwide. In Southern and Western Norway, unemployment rose last year, largelyreflecting the decline in manufacturing employment since the beginning of 1999. Unemployment hasdeclined again recently.Employment in the public sector has also increased markedly in recent years. Over the last 30 years,the public sector and private services have laid claim to an increasing share of labour resources inNorway, a trend that will probably continue.
8BIS Review 47/2001The tight labour market reflects a high activity level in the Norwegian economy. The mainlandeconomy is experiencing an upturn, but growth is low. Growth in private consumption has beenmoderate the last year following many years of high consumption growth in the 1990s. House priceshave increased markedly the last decade. Inflation-adjusted house prices are now more than 10 percent higher than at the highest level in the 1980s. Growth in lending to the household and enterprisesectors remains high.Since 1997, price inflation has been higher in Norway than among our trading partners. Price inflationhas accelerated the last year, also when we disregard the increase in petrol prices and indirect taxessince the beginning of this year. The year-on-year rise in overall consumer prices was 3.8 per cent inApril 2001. Excluding indirect taxes, electricity and petrol prices, the year-on-year rise in prices wasabout 2 ½ per cent in April of this year.
BIS Review 47/20019Higher price inflation in Norway is primarily due to a tight labour market that has persisted over manyyears, fuelling strong growth in wages and labour costs. In the light of higher price and cost inflation inNorway than in other countries, it has been appropriate to maintain higher interest rates in Norwaythan in most comparable countries.A special feature of wage formation in Norway has been that conditions for exposed industries,including those that do not face international competition, have received considerable emphasis in thenegotiations. The last few years, the sheltered sector has had a greater influence on overall wagedevelopments.The centralised income settlements in Norway have been an arena of coordination, wheremacroeconomic considerations have at times received considerable emphasis. This has contributed tolow unemployment levels in our country. But we have also seen that the income settlements may be asource of economic disturbances. The income settlements in 1974/75 and 1986 have had thestrongest negative impact. The settlements in 1998 and 2000 also fuelled higher cost inflation. In1998, high wage growth, combined with the fall in the krone exchange rate, contributed to a 4 ½percentage point rise in interest rates during the spring and summer months. The retail and serviceindustry almost acted as a spearhead in this wage negotiation. During and after the wage settlementin 2000, short-term interest rates rose by 1½ percentage points.We have also seen that income formation is affected by labour market conditions and profit trends inthe business sector. This is also true of wage and income developments among managers, salariedemployees and the liberal professions. The structural changes that now seem to have occurred in theincome formation for these groups has probably also been important for the outcome of the ordinarywage settlements.Distributive trades
10BIS Review 47/2001Growth in wages and labour costs in distributive trades has also been high the last five years, with anaverage wage growth per normal person-year of 5 per cent, the same as for mainland Norway.National accounts figures for service industries are more uncertain than figures for manufacturingindustry. Measuring productivity in service industries is difficult. The chart shows that according to thenational accounts, productivity growth is very volatile.If we smooth the data somewhat, it appears, however, that productivity growth has been relatively highthrough the 1990s, following low growth at the end of the 1980s. At the very end of the 1990s,however, productivity growth was weak.
BIS Review 47/200111One source that may be used to analyse developments in distributive trades is Norges Bank’sdatabase Sebra which contains figures for all limited companies that have turned in valid accounts tothe Brønnøysund Register. The figures, from 1988 to 1999, show that profitability in this industry hasbeen positive since 1993. Both measures of profitability show a slightly falling trend from the peak year1994 to 1998. In 1999, it appears that profitability improved again. The increase in profitability from theend of the 1980s to the mid-1990s reflects a structural development in the industry since the 1980s.The most important changes were the emergence of chains and the development of shopping centres.When the upturn came in the mid-1990s, a better structure was in place. Both the chains and theshopping centres have increased their market shares.This structural development has probably made it possible to maintain satisfactory profitability at thesame time that profit margins2 have declined. Operations became more efficient. Profitability has beensatisfactory despite lower mark-ups on the cost of goods. In 1998 and 1999, however, profit marginsincreased somewhat.The higher profit margins since 1997 may reflect the greater concentration in the grocery trade.                                                     2 Profit margin is defined as operating income less cost of goods as a percentage of operating income.
12BIS Review 47/2001Labour cost growth and wage costs as a share of income in distributive trades declined sharply untilthe mid-1990s and have since picked up. This had the opposite effect on operating margins3, whichfell in the five years to 1999.One possible explanation is that weaker competition in distributive trades the last few years has madeit possible to increase profit margins without losing market shares and thereby weakening profitability.This may also have contributed to the industry’s role of spearhead in the wage settlement in 1998.However, a fresh report from the Norwegian Agricultural Economics Research Institute and ECONshows that gross margins4 on meat in the grocery trade were reduced somewhat between the springof 1999 and the autumn of 2000. Farmers' margins fell fairly markedly. The survey concludes that it isprimarily the processing industry that increased margins on meat products in this period.A substantial share of the food industry is sheltered from international competition through trade policymeasures. Analyses conducted by Statistics Norway show that productivity growth in this industry wasvery low between 1993 and 19995. Weak productivity growth in this industry and in the graphics andpublishing industry contributed to the substantially poorer productivity growth in Norway comparedwith Sweden in this period. A substantial share of the graphics and publishing industry is characterisedby natural protection against foreign competition.Excluding border trade, distributive trades are exposed to foreign competition only to a limited extent.Exposure to international competition is a source of learning, innovation and development forindustries. It is essential, in my view, to maintain a broad internationally exposed sector in the                                                     3 Operating margin is defined as operating result as a percentage of operating income.4 Gross margin is defined here as the difference between retail price and purchase price for meat products and is to coverprofits and all costs other than the meat raw material (see NILF)(2001).5 See Boug, P. and Naug, B. (2001).

At the same time, constructive unrest in retail and service industries and othersheltered industries, with new entrants, mergers and demergers, could also promote efficiency andlower prices.ConclusionThe operational mandate for monetary policy is to stabilise inflation around 2½ per cent. Prices forgoods and services that are set by commercial and service enterprises are an important component ofthe consumer price index. It has therefore been a pleasure for me to provide this assembly with apresentation of how Norwegian monetary policy is conducted.Thank you for your attention.
BIS Review 46/20011Paul Jenkins: Communicating Canadian monetary policy: towards greatertransparencyRemarks by Mr Paul Jenkins, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the Ottawa EconomicsAssociation, Ottawa, Ontario, 22 May 2001.*      *      *I want, first, to thank the Ottawa Economics Association for your invitation to speak to you today. Iwelcome this opportunity to talk about an important aspect of the work of the Bank of Canada inconducting monetary policy – communications.In the next few minutes I would like to discuss some of the factors that are central to monetary policycommunications. I will touch on a few of the particular challenges we at the Bank of Canada face. AndI’ll conclude with a few words on the Bank’s communications approach, including its role in the newsystem of fixed dates for announcing interest rate decisions.The trend to openness and transparencyLet me begin with a brief backward glance. It is not so long ago that central banks did little to letpeople know what they were up to and why. Indeed, in the conduct of monetary policy, little emphasiswas placed on trying to explain the objectives of policy because those objectives were not clearlydefined. Without clear objectives for monetary policy, central bank actions were generally notpredictable. And the conventional way of thinking among central banks was that it was best to saynothing and let actions speak for themselves.It is a different story today. Indeed, there has been nothing less than a sea change in the way centralbanks view the role of communications in monetary policy. What we have seen in recent years is abroad and continuing trend among central banks towards greater openness and transparency in theconduct of monetary policy. This trend has come about not because of any “fad” for public relations orfor marketing a central bank’s image. It has occurred because of fundamental changes in the waymonetary policy is approached and conducted and the corresponding recognition that theeffectiveness of monetary policy is improved through greater transparency. And to be transparentrequires proactive and well-planned communication.Why communications has become so important for monetary policyFor the Bank of Canada, communications has become a strategic priority in supporting our goal ofpreserving a low and stable inflation environment. We believe that maintaining low, stable, andpredictable inflation is the best contribution monetary policy can make to a productive, well-functioningeconomy.An important step towards increased transparency, and thus towards clear and focusedcommunication, was taken in 1991 when Canada adopted explicit inflation-control targets. Theannouncement of the targets clarified the objective of monetary policy and provided a nominal anchorfor economic and financial decisions. (As you know, last week the government and the Bank agreed torenew the inflation-control target of a 1 to 3 per cent target range and a 2 per cent target midpoint.)The greater transparency of inflation targets has also anchored the Bank’s approach tocommunicating what monetary policy is trying to achieve, our means of achieving it and ourassessment of the state of the economy.While the targets continue to define our inflation objective, conditions in the economy are constantlychanging. Both international and domestic developments can affect the economic outlook in Canada.The Bank has to continually assess these changes and their implications for future inflation. Ifrequired, we take appropriate policy actions that are consistent with achieving the inflation-controltarget over the medium term. The role of communications is, therefore, to explain how and whycircumstances have changed and to relate the Bank’s actions to our inflation target and to thewell-being of the economy.I’d like to suggest to you that there are at least three important and related ways that goodcommunications can help monetary policy be effective.
2BIS Review 46/2001First, good communications helps put the Bank and financial markets on the same wavelength. That isvery important because, generally speaking, monetary policy is more effective when financial marketsunderstand how the Bank assesses economic developments in relation to our policy objectives. Whenwe are all on the same wavelength, markets can anticipate, rather than simply react to, interest rateactions by the Bank.If the Bank does a good job of keeping market expectations broadly in line with the direction of policy,there tends to be less volatility in financial markets and a smoother, more rapid incorporation of anyshifts in policy into interest rates and exchange rates. In other words, effective communicationsimproves the monetary policy transmission process and leads to responses in the exchange rate andin the term structure of interest rates that are more consistent with the Bank’s intentions. This greaterstability and predictability is in everyone’s interest.A second reason why communications has become so important has to do with the effect of publicexpectations and behaviour on the Bank’s ability to meet our policy objectives. Improving publicunderstanding and acceptance of what the Bank is trying to do increases the chances of success inachieving the inflation targets with as little economic disruption as possible. It is largely a matter of thecredibility of the Bank’s commitment to those targets.Let me be more specific. If consumers, investors, workers, businesses, and governments believe thataction will be taken to ensure that inflation remains close to the target, then they are more likely tomake economic and financial decisions accordingly. Pricing decisions by producers and suppliers willreflect inflation expectations consistent with our target. Wage bargains between employees andemployers will tend to be in line with the inflation target. The net effect will be a more stablemacro-economic environment and greater success in keeping inflation low.Keeping in touch with expectations also entails good two-way communication. The Bank consultsCanadians in business, finance, and government across the country on a regular basis. By doing sowe keep informed of economic developments and perspectives on the ground, and this contributes toour understanding of what is happening in the “real” economy.A third reason why communications is important is accountability. As a public institution with a highdegree of autonomy for the conduct of monetary policy, the Bank of Canada bears an obligation toaccount to Canadians for how well it is doing its job. An explicitly defined and agreed upon inflationtarget provides a clear basis for accountability. This clear basis for judging the Bank’s performance isextremely important for credibility. But for the Bank to be fully accountable, it must provide the publicwith the information it needs to be aware of, and understand, the Bank’s policy objectives, the factorswe take into account in making decisions, and our progress in meeting our objectives. That is the jobof communications.Challenges in communicating monetary policyRecognizing and understanding the importance of good communications does not mean the job iseasy. In fact, being more open and transparent has created a wide range of communicationschallenges.One of these challenges stems from the medium-term time frame in which monetary policy operates.When the Bank raises or lowers interest rates, it takes about 12 months for this change to have itspeak impact on aggregate demand and about 18 to 24 months to fully affect inflation. In other words,when the Bank acts, it does so on the basis of assessing developments, gauging the impact on theeconomy and on inflation 1 to 2 years down the road, and taking action to achieve our inflation targetover that horizon.If the public is going to make informed economic and financial decisions, then it needs to understandand take into account the time frame over which monetary policy has its effects. Yet there continues tobe a tendency to view Bank actions only as a short-term response to immediate events rather than inthe context of medium-term trends and objectives.Adding to this communications challenge is the fact that assessing economic trends in the future is notan exact science but rather a highly interpretive exercise. Unforeseen developments or “shocks” arealways occurring, and there is always an element of uncertainty about the order of magnitude andpersistence of these developments. Thus, what we say and communicate about the future has to bephrased in conditional terms. And if the picture looking forward is clouded by uncertainties, it is
BIS Review 46/20013impossible for a central bank to provide financial markets and the public with a high degree ofprecision and certainty.A second key communications challenge could be formulated as a question something like this: Inbecoming more transparent, how can the Bank best ensure value in what we communicate?At the risk of sounding a touch glib, I would argue that, when it comes to monetary policycommunications, “more” isn’t necessarily “better.” It is “quality” that is of greater importance intransparency than “quantity.”As I have already noted, monetary policy needs to be viewed from a medium-term perspective.Therefore, the Bank can provide substantive value by communicating what it sees as the key trends inthe economy and inflation and how the conduct of monetary policy relates to these trends.Usually it is the accumulation of information that gives understanding to these trends. For that reason,the Bank cannot, and should not, comment on every piece of new economic data or information thatbecomes public. But by transmitting our view of the larger trends in the economy, the Bank canpromote better anticipation of the direction of policy.Our concern about quality has also influenced how we approach the flow of information just prior to,and at the time of, our policy announcements. The Bank consciously refrains from making publiccomments on issues relating to monetary policy in the week before an announcement on officialinterest rates. This is a sensitive period, particularly for financial markets, and comments could easilybe misinterpreted.The other point I would stress about the quality of information relates to how the Bank arrives atmonetary policy decisions. The decision-making of the Bank’s Governing Council is a process ofconsensus building. Members of the Governing Council are full-time employees of the Bank who meeton a daily basis. In the two weeks prior to a policy announcement, there is a series of meetings atwhich information from several sources is presented by Bank staff and discussed. Out of this processa consensus is developed within the Governing Council on the appropriate policy decision. Therefore,what is of greatest value from a communications perspective is a clear statement of the substantivereasons for a policy decision. That statement is the press release announcing our decision.Four times during the year, the announcement is supplemented two weeks later with the publication ofour semi-annual Monetary Policy Reports (in May and November) and Updates to the full Report (inFebruary and August). These publications, which are finalized as of the policy announcement date,elaborate in greater detail the Governing Council’s assessment of the factors that shaped the interestrate decision.Another challenge revolves around the fact that the Bank`s communications are with differentaudiences that may have different degrees of interest in what the Bank says and does.The general public, for example, is generally interested in inflation, the value of the dollar, and whetheror not interest rates are going up or down – those developments that have an impact on their dailydecision-making.Financial markets, on the other hand, are intensely interested in both the direction and the intricaciesof monetary policy and tend to be highly sensitive to any Bank action or comment bearing on theseissues. They scrutinize Bank publications and speeches by senior Bank officials for any shade ofmeaning about where monetary policy might be heading. This makes communicating monetary policya difficult task, because some of the subtleties and complexities related to the direction of monetarypolicy simply can’t be reduced to a few words.The challenge is in tailoring messages that communicate as clearly as possible the Bank’sassessment of the economy and the direction of policy, while bearing in mind the specific concernsand information needs of different audiences.This challenge is all the more difficult when it comes to the media, an audience that is instrumental inwhether or not we communicate successfully.There are no two ways about it. The Bank relies heavily on the media to get our message to thepublic, whether it is via TV and radio, newspapers and magazines, or the various wire services thatfeed financial institution trading rooms as well as news outlets across the country.We also recognize that the media act as a filter for what we say and often determine which of ourstatements will be reported. It is part of the media’s job to interpret our decisions and perspectives and
4BIS Review 46/2001to comment on how they see the Bank executing its mandate. It is also their job to reflect the views ofthird parties on what we say and do. That is healthy for democracy, healthy for our accountability, andcan be healthy for raising public awareness of monetary policy issues.In this rather complex communications environment, it is squarely in the Bank’s interests that themedia cover monetary policy as fully and accurately as possible. And the chances of full and accuratereporting are enormously better if the media are well informed about monetary policy and the factorsaffecting what we at the Bank do. Bearing in mind my comments a few moments ago about thefrequently complex and conditional nature of monetary policy, I don’t underestimate the challenge –either for us or for the media.For the Bank’s part, we have taken a number of steps in recent years to strengthen our relations withthe media and to furnish them with the information necessary for high-quality reporting andcommentary. We now provide not only more information than in the past but more occasions when weexplain information directly to the media and respond to their questions.Thus, for example, we have instituted regular media briefings prior to the release of key Bank reports.We installed a special “lock-up” facility at the Bank to enable the media to read our releases and writetheir stories in advance of their official publication. We have increased the number of pressconferences and media sessions given by the Governor and Deputy Governors.The media tell us these changes have been helpful. But I would suggest that there is still someprogress to be made to ensure that Canadians receive the accurate and insightful coverage ofmonetary policy they have every right to expect.  For example, the media might assess whetherinvesting more time and intellectual capital could strengthen and deepen its reporting and commentaryon monetary policy issues. And there may well be additional things the Bank could do to promotebetter understanding of monetary policy. Indeed, we have been looking at the greater use of theelectronic media to reach the public, and our new Governor has already done a fair number ofinterviews on radio and television. Our goal here is to continue the move to greater openness in Bankcommunications while at the same time being careful to stay clear of any short-run, market-sensitiveissues.We will continue to consult with journalists and reporters about this and other improvements that wemight consider.The Bank’s communications strategy – an evolving processTo this point, I’ve underlined why communications is important for effective monetary policy and someof the challenges we face in communicating a complex subject to a variety of interested audiences.Now I’d like to say a few more words about what we’ve been doing at the Bank of Canada tocommunicate monetary policy in an open and transparent way.As I’ve already indicated, our overriding objective is to focus attention, debate, and understanding onthe Canadian economic and financial situation and what it means for keeping inflation low and stable.To do this, the Bank has taken a number of initiatives. In 1995, we introduced our semi-annualMonetary Policy Report, which in many ways has become the centrepiece of our communicationsstrategy. It is the Bank’s fullest interpretation of recent developments in the economy as well as ouroutlook for the medium term, the horizon over which monetary policy has its effects.Between each Report, we publish an update of the Bank’s views. Interspersed between thesereleases are speeches and press conferences by the Governor, speeches by Deputy Governors,press releases, and regional outreach activities, which have greatly broadened our audiencecoverage.As part of our communications strategy, we have tried to schedule our publications andcommunications events throughout the year to achieve a regular, continuous, and integrated programof public communications. This permits us to communicate on a more continuous basis our evolvingviews on the economy and on the trend of inflation.On the operational side, in 1994, we introduced an operating band for the overnight rate of interest togive greater clarity to financial markets about the Bank’s desired rate setting. In 1996, we set the BankRate – the rate at which we lend to financial institutions – at the upper limit of the operating band. Andin 1999, we set the target for the overnight rate as the midpoint of the band. Currently, we are movingto place more focus on the target for the overnight rate in our announcements since it is the
BIS Review 46/20015appropriate policy rate for international comparisons. For example, our target for the overnight ratecorresponds with the U.S. Federal Reserve’s target for the federal funds rate.We have also put a lot of emphasis on developing and maintaining our Web site. It gives the public atlarge direct access not only to our publications and speeches but also to more easily understandableinformation about the Bank and monetary policy. (By the way, I encourage you to take a look at ourWeb site at www.bankofcanada.ca. It was recently ranked second among 24 central bank sitesreviewed by the London-based organization, Lombard Street Research Ltd.)Fixed announcement datesOur most recent innovation to our strategy, launched on 5 December last year, is a new system forannouncing decisions on official interest rates. Any change to the target for the overnight rate ofinterest is now announced on eight pre-specified or “fixed” dates during the year. On each date, apress release is issued, indicating the Bank’s decision either to change rates or to leave themunchanged and giving a short explanation of the reasons for the decision. This approach replaces theformer practice of only making an announcement if we changed interest rates and doing so withoutany warning to the public or to financial markets.The new, fixed-date approach is an extremely important step for the Bank in implementing monetarypolicy actions. From a communications perspective, it provides a number of important benefits. First, itgives the public, the media, and financial markets the certainty of knowing exactly when the Bank willmake an announcement on interest rates. This allows them to plan more efficiently and make moreorderly assessments as each announcement approaches.A second communications benefit of fixed dates is the increased emphasis they bring to the economicsituation in Canada as the primary focus of Canadian monetary policy. We believed this would lead toincreased commentary on Canadian economic circumstances and their implications for monetarypolicy during the period leading up to a fixed announcement date. That, in turn, would contribute tobuilding public awareness of both economic developments in Canada and the role of monetary policy.A third benefit is that fixed dates provide the Bank with a regular opportunity to put the recenteconomic and financial developments into a medium-term perspective. As I said earlier, this isimportant because the effects of monetary policy actions are usually spread over 1 to 2 years. Thepress release on each fixed date, together with the Bank’s other communications vehicles such as theMonetary Policy Report and Updates, enables the Bank to position recent developments in terms ofthe underlying trends over this time horizon. If we communicate this successfully, there shouldultimately be more public focus on the trends over time that are important to monetary policy and lessreaction to near-term developments.Finally, the eight new fixed dates increase the number of opportunities for the Bank to communicate itsviews on the economy. Whether or not there is a change in our policy rate, the analysis in the pressrelease should stimulate a more frequent and continuous dialogue with key audiences and shouldgenerate more regular commentary among analysts and the media.We now have the experience of four fixed announcement dates under our belts. While it is still early todraw conclusions, generally we are very pleased with the way fixed dates are working and with thepositive reaction they have generated. We have already seen more focused public commentary on theCanadian economic situation, and that is extremely encouraging. With the benefit of furtherexperience with the new approach and feedback from financial markets and the public, we will be ableto assess what further improvements might be made. But we are more convinced than ever that thisnew approach will increase the effectiveness of monetary policy.ConclusionTo conclude, I want to emphasize that the Bank will continue to look at ways to build on the progresswe have made in increasing the openness and transparency of monetary policy. Communications willplay an increasingly vital and strategic role in helping achieve this further progress. It is a role that weat the Bank are extremely serious about. For in the final analysis, monetary policy is most effectivewhen it is effectively communicated. Thank you.
BIS Review 80/20011Willem F Duisenberg: Developments in international financial marketsSpeech delivered by Dr Willem F Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, at theinauguration ceremony of the Second Swedish National Pension Fund, Gothenburg,26 September 2001.*      *      *IntroductionIt is a great pleasure and honour for me to be here today at the inauguration ceremony of the SecondSwedish National Pension Fund. My comments will not be directly concerned with developments inSwedish financial markets, but I will focus on trends and developments in the financial markets ofEurope. Although Sweden is not part of the euro area, you should expect to benefit from any efficiencygains achieved in the capital markets of the euro area, both as a borrower and – perhaps of greaterrelevance to the pension fund industry – as an investor. I would like to concentrate my remarks todayon three issues. First, I shall say a few words on the need to reform pension systems in Europe. Then,I would like to discuss recent developments in euro area capital markets from a global perspective.Finally, I shall address the issue of oversight of financial markets and recent institutional andregulatory developments.Need to reform pension systems in EuropeOver the last fifty years we have witnessed an unprecedented era of growth, technological progress,prosperity and welfare improvement across all generations. Notable demographic changes are takingplace not only in Europe but also across the western world and this raises many important issues. Inparticular, improving economic welfare has been associated with longer life expectancy. Combinedwith lower birth rates, this is leading to an ageing of populations, which will have far-reachingimplications. It raises issues concerning possible resource constraints that may be faced in the futureand questions about the sustainability of prevailing living standards in an environment where currentprojections point to a future population decline in Europe. Related to that is the issue concerning thesustainability of the current pension systems.As members of the pension fund industry are undoubtedly aware, on current trends the ratio of elderlypeople to the working-age population is set to increase significantly. In the euro area, the ratio of over65 year olds to those between 20 and 64 is forecast to rise from prevailing levels of 27% to around53% by 2050, with a maximum of 67% in Italy. This is expected to result from a combination of effects.Most importantly, life expectancy has increased considerably over the last half century and this trendlooks set to continue. At the same time, the number of births has declined substantially throughout thedeveloped world and even a return to higher birth rates in the future would most likely come too late tosolve the problems faced by many pension systems in the coming decades.Pension systems in Europe rely heavily on state-run pay-as-you-go arrangements. Funded pensionarrangements, be they publicly or privately managed, are generally less developed. Pay-as-you-gosystems are particularly vulnerable to demographic change: with a declining ratio of the labour forcerelative to the number of pensioners, the tax base shrinks while the number of recipients increases,leaving policy-makers to adjust the system through reductions in benefits and increases incontributions.It should be noted that debt financing of the gap between pension contributions and pension paymentsdoes not represent a viable alternative. Given the public knowledge of the pension system dynamics,participants in financial markets would anticipate the unsustainability of delaying pension systemreform and require higher risk premia on new debt. In this respect, it is helpful that governments of theeuro area have committed themselves to refrain from excessive public deficits through the MaastrichtTreaty and the Stability and Growth Pact.In order to deal with demographic changes, European governments are moving in several directions.So-called parametric reforms strive to put the existing pay-as-you-go systems onto a sound financialfooting. They include changes to contributions and benefits, such as adjustments in the indexation ofexisting pensions and in benefit formulas for new pensioners. Two approaches are particularlynoteworthy, and the Swedish pension reform has been impressive in this respect The first is the
2BIS Review 80/2001introduction of longevity adjustments in the benefit formula, which can insure the system againstunforeseen – but welcome – increases in life expectancy after retirement. The second is theintroduction of a notional defined contribution system which closely links an individual's contributionsto his or her own future benefits. However, parametric reforms have limits: raising contribution rateswould increase distortional taxation of labour with a negative impact on labour markets. Indeed, labourmarket reforms are also needed to counter the detrimental effects of the ageing of the population. Oneshould, for instance, consider measures aimed at stimulating the supply of labour. Moreover, limitingbenefits runs the risk of increasing poverty among the elderly.An alternative and complementary route to securing future pensions consists in systemic reforms,namely a move toward more funded systems. This would partially replace labour taxation with anaccumulated capital stock as the source of financing for pensions. Several countries, such asDenmark and the Netherlands, use private savings for future pensions. Germany is moving in thesame direction after its recent pension reform. In Finland, a part of the social security contributions ischannelled into a publicly administered fund. France has decided to create a fund equivalent to 10% ofGDP by 2020. Ireland's public national reserve fund has assets of 7.5% of GDP, and the Irishgovernment is committed to setting aside contributions equal to 1% of GDP up to 2025. Belgium hasset aside revenues from UMTS licenses for such a fund. Sweden is obviously well advanced in thisrespect with a pension trust fund equivalent to 25% of GDP.We should not be afraid of a stronger role for privately managed funded systems. Such systems havethe advantage of efficient administration and an absence of political interference. They may alsoinduce increased private savings. But suitable regulation must deter risky investment strategies thatcould jeopardise living standards at a vulnerable stage in people's lives and would discredit anincreased role for the private sector.The ageing of the population will also have a profound impact on budgetary policies, not only becauseof the consequences of population ageing on pension arrangements. Expenditure on healthcare isalso expected to increase markedly. The potential impact of population ageing on the fiscal position ofcountries is an important reason why European countries should not only pursue balanced budgets,but also a surplus. This would allow them either to reduce their public debt, which would lead to lowerinterest payments and more scope for an increase in expenditure relating to population ageing, or toestablish special funds to be used to finance this additional expenditure.As a final remark on this particular issue, I would like to mention that population ageing is one of thebroad economic trends shaping the future of financial markets in the euro area. Over the comingyears, together with the liberalisation of financial markets, population ageing will lead to furtherdemand for long-term investment instruments on the part of pension funds. In addition, the need forportfolio diversification may drive up the volume of cross-border investments, including investments inemerging markets with a more favourable demographic structure. These trends are likely to providefurther impetus to the development of suitable financial instruments for pension funds, and moregenerally for savers at the end of the intermediation chain.Developments in euro capital markets from a global perspectiveI will now try to describe recent developments in euro capital markets from a global perspective.The launch of the euro on 1 January 1999 was an historic event. Eleven national currencies wereconverted into one single currency overnight. On 1 January 2001 Greece became the twelfthEuropean Union Member State to adopt the single currency. The newly created currency area of thetwelve participating EU Member States has a considerable weight in the world economy. It accountsfor around 20% of both world GDP and world exports. The successful launch of the euro, which is akey element in promoting economic stability and prosperity in Europe, has boosted the integration offinancial markets in the euro area. This process of integration in European financial markets coincidedwith a trend towards globalisation and securitisation which was already well underway.Since its inception, the euro has been the second most widely used currency at the international level.This reflects the importance of the euro area in the world economy. Recent trends in theinternationalisation of the euro are the result of market developments and policies both inside andoutside the euro area.In capital markets the euro has seen a tremendous development in its short existence. This has beenthe case for both the bond and the equity markets.
BIS Review 80/20013The economies of, and the economic processes in, the countries currently within the euro area havebecome increasingly intertwined as we have moved towards EMU. This has naturally led to thedevelopment of more cross-border financial interconnections. At the same time, financial flowsbetween the euro area and the rest of the world have increased rapidly in recent years. As far as euroarea financial markets are concerned, the introduction of the euro acted as a catalyst for greaterintegration within the euro area, although this process is still far from complete. The improvement inefficiency which integration is bringing to financial markets in the euro area should be beneficial notonly for euro area residents but also for non-resident borrowers and investors, who are able to accessthe financial markets of the euro area and take advantage of their breadth, depth and liquidity. Inparticular, even though euro area financial markets are not yet fully integrated at an area-wide level,they are larger and more accessible than any of the markets that were denominated in thepredecessor currencies of the euro.This has brought important benefits for residents of the euro area, but it also has importantimplications for Sweden. As regards to the bond market, I would like to share a number of morespecific observations with you. The first is that the introduction of the euro created the second largestbond market in the world. The second is that, while the corporate bond market was of limitedimportance in the euro area before 1998, the launch of the euro seemed to act as a catalyst for thedevelopment of a market in which corporations could issue debt securities of unprecedented size.Reflecting this, the amount outstanding of debt securities issued by the non-financial corporate sectorgrew by an impressive 17% in 1999.The same growth rate was recorded in 2000 and – in the first sixmonths of 2001 – growth rates of around14% were observed. The wave of mergers and acquisitions inthe euro area corporate sector seen since the launch of the euro provides just one example of theincreased possibilities offered by the larger and deeper single financial market.A third observation is the increasing importance of the euro in the overall stock of "truly international"debt securities. What I mean by "truly international" debt securities is those securities issued in acurrency that differs from that of the country in which the borrower resides. By the end of 2000, theeuro accounted for 26% of such securities. This share is 7 percentage points higher than the totalshare accounted for by the euro's predecessor currencies at the end of 1998. The share of the euro iseven larger if account is also taken of the issuance of debt securities denominated in the homecurrency of the borrower and targeted at the international financial market. Furthermore, by virtue of itsopenness and its breadth, the bond market of the euro area has become an important component ininternational bond markets and can be expected to develop further in the coming years.This picture of the euro bond market in terms of size, growth and international participation goes handin hand with increased liquidity and efficiency. Over the past couple of years, this has resulted indeclining transaction costs, as bid-ask spreads have narrowed. Furthermore, we have seen anincreased diversity, due to the arrival of issuers with low credit ratings, which used to be all but absentin the euro bond market. This has increased the investment possibilities in the euro bond market.Let me now turn to the stock markets. In the stock markets of the euro area there is also evidence offurther integration. A number of benchmark indices now exist for the euro area as a whole. In addition,derivatives markets have been established which allow market participants to shift from taking acountry perspective in their investment decisions to taking a sector perspective across the euro area.As a result, sectoral factors should play a greater role than before in determining share pricemovements over time.The integration of stock markets at the euro area level means that issuers across the euro area haveprivileged access to a large number of investors in a large and open market place. This has paved theway for new firms and relatively small firms to obtain finance from stock markets that have specialisedin providing funds to young and innovative firms. We have seen an astonishingly large number of newlistings in recent years.Oversight of financial markets and recent institutional and regulatory developmentsLet me now turn to the issue of the oversight of financial markets and recent institutional andregulatory developments. The internationalisation of markets is posing new challenges for supervision.The new challenges posed by recent market developments come mainly from two sources,technological advances and the increased competition and market integration triggered by theintroduction of the euro. Until the 1980s, financial activity was conducted within heterogeneousframeworks. Each financial system was characterised by a different currency, legislation and
4BIS Review 80/2001supervisory structure. In general, each sector of the financial industry – banking, securities andinsurance – had its own supervisory agency. Financial innovation has significantly blurred thedistinction between products supplied by different intermediaries, and technological advances havehad a major impact on the importance of the physical location of the market players, since the twosides of the transaction and the intermediary need not be close geographically. The concept of themarket itself has drastically changed, since it has become an entity not clearly identified by a physicallocation. For example, a large part of the regulation relates to the definition of a market as a physicalentity. In today's financial systems it is possible to have markets, like the foreign exchange market,that do not a have a geographical location. Public policies have progressively adapted to the newmarket environment, increasing cross-border and cross-sectoral co-operation between competentauthorities and shaping new, less cumbersome and intrusive regulatory and supervisory tools. Theintroduction of the euro has further eroded sectoral and geographic segmentation, thus initiatingdebates in many countries on the most efficient institutional arrangements for prudential supervisionand financial stability.The single agency approach has recently gained ground as a response to the breakdown of sectoraldistinctions in the financial industry. Sweden and Denmark within the European Union and Canadaand Norway outside it were the first countries to adopt such a model. This solution attracted evenmore attention with the reforms in the United Kingdom establishing the Financial Services Authority.The developments which have occurred in the market seem to favour the single supervisor approach.In fact, financial products are now mixed and the same economic function is performed by contractssupplied by firms belonging to different segments of the financial industry. This implies that thetraditional approach of specialised agencies is no longer perceived as satisfactory. On the other hand,the problems related to the creation and effective management of a universal agency are verycomplex. Indeed, co-ordination remains necessary, be it between specialised agencies or between theorganisational units within a universal agency.A second issue involves the role played by central banks. There are three main arguments in favourand three main arguments against the unification of prudential supervision and central banking. Thearguments in favour are the following. First, there is a potential for exploiting synergies between thesupervisory function and the core tasks of a central bank. A thorough understanding of the properfunctioning of payment systems and of other market infrastructures is essential for the smooth conductof monetary policy. Information collected for supervisory purposes may play a significant role in this.The second argument concerns the need to focus on systemic risk. Central banks have a privilegedposition from which to assess the impact of macroeconomic shocks and the financial stability ofgroups of intermediaries. The third argument concerns the independence from political interferenceand the technical expertise of central banks.Similarly, we can identify three arguments supporting the establishment of a supervisory agencyoutside the central bank. The first one concerns the alleged conflict of interest between monetarypolicy and prudential supervision. Many authors have argued that the body in charge of monetarypolicy cannot be entrusted with supervision, because the monetary policy stance would be affectedand it would pose a threat to price stability. A second argument is based on the observation that noclear distinction is made between the different financial products and intermediaries belonging todistinct financial sectors. I already discussed this argument earlier when I talked of the technologicaladvances. The third and final argument concerns the need to avoid an excessive concentration ofpower in the central bank.While it may be a difficult and controversial exercise to weigh up the pros and cons of the twosolutions at a general level, without making allowances for the specific environment, in the particularcontext of the Eurosystem the balance of the arguments leans in favour of maintaining a strong role fornational central banks in prudential supervision. The reasons for this are twofold. First, the conflict ofinterest regarding monetary policy and concentration of power is no longer relevant given the structureof the Eurosystem, since the introduction of the euro has implied an institutional separation betweenthe monetary jurisdiction – the euro area – and the supervisory jurisdiction – domestically charteredinstitutions in individual countries. Second, in a single currency area in which financial markets areincreasingly integrated, swift and open communications among supervisors are of vital importance forcrisis prevention and management. The dual nature of national central banks, which are at the sametime both national institutions and part of the Eurosystem, might be a valuable asset when dealing withcross-border or area-wide issues.
BIS Review 80/20015ConclusionsThe implementation of the single market and the introduction of the euro have strengthenedcompetitive pressure and increased flexibility in the EU economies. Furthermore, they have also had aclear impact on global markets, prompting further integration of international financial markets. In otherwords, it is clear that developments in financial markets have contributed to a more efficient allocationof capital. This is also to the benefit of pension funds. On the other hand, the integration of thefinancial markets and the technological developments have substantially increased the risk ofcontagion in the event of a financial crisis. It is necessary therefore for governments and authorities tocontinue to co-operate to create regulations and institutions for the purpose of minimising financialrisk.Thank you very much for your kind attention.
BIS Review 80/20011Zeti Akhtar Aziz: Towards gaining the competitive edgeSpeech by Y Bhg Tan Sri Dato' Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz, Governor of Bank Negara Malaysia, at theChartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA), held in Kuala Lumpur, 17 September 2001.*      *      *Ladies and Gentlemen,IntroductionIt is indeed my great pleasure to be here today to have this opportunity to deliver this lecture on"Towards Gaining the Competitive Edge", organised by the Chartered Institute of ManagementAccountants (CIMA). Our quest to gain the competitive edge in this increasingly more difficult globalenvironment is aimed at building the foundation on which our future growth can be secured. Theemerging developments in the global economy has brought the issue of competitiveness into sharpfocus. Increased competition and higher standards of efficiency and quality amidst intensifiedglobalisation have heightened attention on how the Malaysian economy can remain viable in theglobal market place. With the emergence of new economies with lower production costs, the challengeof the global market place can be expected to be heightened.The issue before us is how Malaysia can gain a competitive edge so as to sustain our growthprospects and continue to raise our standards of living. What are the factors that would determinethe competitiveness of the Malaysian economy in the future, in this more competitive environment.How can Malaysia effectively and efficiently utilise its resources in this more difficult environment.What are the strategies that should be adopted by the authorities and by the private sector to enhancecompetitiveness? Let me begin with a discussion of what we mean by being competitive and thefactors that determine competitiveness and then proceed to discuss alternative strategies andapproaches that may be adopted to build this competitiveness.Definition of competitivenessThe term competitiveness has many interpretations. Competitiveness is generally equated with theperformance of an economy. As competitiveness relates to competition, it also implies a comparativeelement, with the implication that competitiveness is essentially about securing market-share. Inpractice, the alternative definitions of competitiveness used depend on the focus of interest. TheOECD has defined competitiveness for a nation as the degree to which a country can producegoods and services which meet the test of international markets, while its citizens earn astandard of living that is both rising and sustainable in the long run. For a firm, competitivenessis the ability to produce the right goods and services of the right quality, at the right price, at the righttime. It means meeting customers' demands more efficiently and more effectively than other firms.Generally, discussions on competitiveness focus on supply-side measures to strengthencompetitiveness, being usually achieved through raising productivity so as to enhance the ability of theeconomy to generate more output from a given supply of inputs. However, competitiveness as relatedto increased output growth requires also demand side measures to ensure a conducivemacroeconomic environment so that resources are allocated in response to market conditions. Thissuggests that the focus of attention should be both on capacity building and on capacity utilisation.The changed environmentPrevious economic success cannot be expected to be replicated in the new economic environment.The new environment is now characterised with increased competitive pressures and greateruncertainty. The globalisation process and the rapid spread of technology has brought about a morecompetitive environment as markets become increasingly more open, with an increasing number ofnew entrants to the market. In this environment, the ability to compete is no longer just based onaccess to raw materials, land, capital and labour. It will demand much more.
2BIS Review 80/2001In this new economic environment, businesses can expect to be confronted with increased levels ofuncertainty. Previously, under stable business environment, it was possible to identify distinct businesstrends. In an environment of greater uncertainty, businesses are often caught unaware by suddenchanges. In the new economy, gains are accorded to those who are the fastest to recognise changeand are the first to exploit the opportunity. Businesses that are rigid and too slow to respond to changecan expect to face increasing difficulties in the new economy.In the new economy, businesses also can expect to face a greater demand for better information,increased disclosure and for more transparent systems. Businesses will therefore need to cope withnumerous reporting requirements. Global standards can be expected to be increasingly rigorous.Traditional reporting that have tended to be based on current and previous financial statements willgive way to greater emphasis on the future.Ladies and Gentlemen,Factors affecting competitivenessIn this rapidly changing economic and financial environment, a continual assessment of ourcompetitiveness is required to provide a basis on how we should respond to the new pressures andchallenges. Survival in the new economy will require new approaches. Previous approaches that havebrought successes may no longer be relevant. While there are many factors that influence a nation'scompetitiveness, allow me to highlight ten important areas that are fundamental in affectingcompetitiveness.Firstly, a sound macroeconomic environment and a conducive business environment is essential tosupport the economic growth process and to enhance competitiveness. Appropriate macroeconomicenvironment will help businesses to respond accordingly to the changes in market conditions.Macroeconomic stability and a conducive business environment provide enterprises with the platformto achieve the highest standards of performance. We are only too aware that economic instability andperiods of heightened economic and financial uncertainty are not conducive for private sectorinvestment decisions.Secondly, the ability to adapt and adjust and to respond to changing economic conditions, changes incomparative advantage and to the new opportunities that the new environment accords. This willinvolve having the degree of agility to adjust, to move out of those areas where we no longer havecomparative advantage and to pursue new growth areas. Very often, such adjustments will involve acontraction in some industries and expansion in others. Economies with a high degree of labour andcapital mobility will facilitate this process. Furthermore, industries which are subject to market swingsneed to increase their adaptability to such shocks, to have the ability to shift resources and to shiftfrom one market to another. The degree of exposure or the degree of concentration of an economy orof an industry will affect the degree of flexibility to adjust to the changing conditions. Excesses or ahigh degree of exposure will increase the vulnerability and risks to sudden shifts or shocks to thesystem and would reduce the ability to adjust accordingly. Countries therefore need to enhance thedegree of resilience to cope with external shocks.Thirdly, corporate resilience. There has been a great deal of attention in the recent years given tomicro reform, corporate restructuring, and rationalisation, all being part of the process of attaininggreater efficiency and becoming more competitive. Other benefits arising from this include betterpricing structures, productivity improvements and a strengthened ability to absorb external shocksmore effectively.Fourth, a well developed and efficient physical infrastructure will contribute to enhancecompetitiveness and support the growth process. The cost of infrastructure services will also affect thecompetitiveness of the private sector. These include the provision of the various transportationsystems, port facilities, energy, telecommunications, utilities, whether the provision is by the public orprivate sector, cost effective pricing structures need to be in place to contribute to overallcompetitiveness of the economy in general and industries in particular.Fifth, Government regulations and procedures have a direct impact on business. An effective andefficient functioning government will contribute to enhance competitiveness. Bureaucratic red-tape andregulations that cause long delays will result in increased financial costs, opportunity costs andfinancial risks. The higher levels of efficiency of the delivery of public services will contribute towardreducing costs to the private sector. Decisions on locating business in the country would depend not
BIS Review 80/20013only on the cost of doing business but also on the quality of services that contribute to the businessenvironment.Sixth, a well functioning and efficient financial system is vital for achieving robust economicperformance. The financial system including an efficient and resilient banking and payment system isimportant in facilitating the overall functioning of the economy. The banking system and capital marketprovides an effective and efficient means of financing the appropriate financial structure that meets therequirements of the economy. The financial system needs to provide the range of products andservices to support the changing needs of the economy. Key is for the financial system to becompetitive and efficient and able to provide financial products and services at competitive rates thuscontributing towards the overall competitiveness of the economy. At the same time, the resilience ofthe financial system is key so that it will be in a position to withstand the destabilising shocks to thesystem.Seventh, having the skills is crucial in achieving long-term competitiveness. Knowledge in the neweconomy will become an increasingly important factor in wealth creation. Marshalling knowledge in thenew economy is becoming an important strategy for businesses not only to improve products andservices but also to enhance productivity and efficiency. While the education and skills levels of thework force is an important element, of greater importance is the ability to translate the knowledge intoenhancing the capabilities of the business. Companies increasingly will have to compete bydeveloping and exploiting skills, knowledge and creativity. In most cases, manpower gaps are found inthe areas of science and technology. Deficiencies in management and work force skills would be aconstraint. In this environment, qualifications acquired during initial education is no longer adequateand new skills need to be continually acquired.Eight, investment in technology is vital to improve competitiveness. An important technology that iscrucial for future performance is Information and Communications Technology (ICT). Not only areinvestments in ICT important but more importantly that these new technologies are put to their bestuse. This can be a major factor elevating the performance and competitiveness of an enterprise.Ninth, research and development which is important for enabling innovation to generate new andimproved products. Strong science and technology capabilities, would enhance the competitiveposition. Low levels of research and development are usually due to weak technological capability.High levels of expenditure on research and development would contribute to enhance the ability tocompete in the global market place.Finally, institutional developments will be important in ensuring sustainability of performance of aneconomy. An important part of this is developing strong private and public institutions. It has beenrecognised that poor systems of corporate governance have contributed to problems that came to thesurface during periods of slowdown or crisis. Corporate governance practices including havingeffective board of directors, strong internal controls, reliable financial reporting, adequate protection ofminority shareholders, audits and enforcement to ensure compliance. Other important aspects ofinstitutional development include streamlining the institutional structure and arrangements andensuring reliability of financial information. Also improving legal and regulatory framework forenforcement of the laws and regulations. All this will contribute to enhance the business environmentand thus enhance competitiveness. Strong professional organisations can play an important role toimprove and enforce the standards and practices. This includes that of the code of ethics and code ofconduct of accountants. While these standards may be in place, of importance is to ensure proper andeffective application of these standards.Programme for competitiveness : a total approachAfter several decades of economic success, it is recognised that a major challenge to ensure itssustainability is to address the issue of competitiveness. This would provide the foundation on whichour aspirations to achieve high quality, broad-based equitable growth can be realised.Very often the discussion on competitiveness has centred on the promotion of greater competition andan accelerated pace of liberalisation that will lead to greater efficiency gains and competitiveness thusenhanced competitiveness. However, the global experience has shown that the liberalisation processneeds to be managed in a manner that is orderly and not disruptive to the overall functioning of theeconomy. It also needs to be recognised that the degree of economic liberalisation and increasedcompetitive pressures alone, cannot be relied upon to achieve competitiveness. Domestic capacityhas to be built and strengthened to deal with the challenges of the new environment. Thus, while
4BIS Review 80/2001liberalisation and the increased competition may be a factor driving domestic firms to be morecompetitive, there is the need also to build the capacities and capability for this to be realised.An issue that has drawn significant debate in relation to the issue of competitiveness is the choice ofexchange rate regime. While Malaysia remains committed to the market mechanism we also want tobe assured that we will operate in an environment of efficient functioning markets. As a small openeconomy, we need to be assured that we will not be subject to mis-aligned rates and that the marketforces will ensure a convergence to equilibrium levels that reflect the underlying fundamentals.An open economy with the volume of trade that is two times the size of the economy, Malaysiarequires a stable and efficient functioning exchange rate regime to facilitate international trade andinvestment. For over three years now we have operated with pegged exchange rate regime. Therelative exchange rate stability accorded by the pegged exchange rate regime has reduced Malaysia'svulnerability to sharp short term movements in the exchange rate and has contributed positively toeconomic activity in the country. Experience in the aftermath of the Asian Financial Crisis has shownthat excessive volatility has occurred, with regional exchange rates that have been driven by specificdevelopments changes in market perceptions and by contagion. This becomes disruptive to trade andinvestment activities. Relying on the exchange rate to gain a competitive advantage in theinternational markets will only provide temporary advantages as prices adjust and as others follow withcompetitive adjustments.Gaining competitiveness therefore necessarily requires a total approach, whereby the factorson all fronts are addressed in a comprehensive manner. Nations that are able to provide moreconducive macro-fundamentals environment, more efficient cost structure, more responsive andresilient institutions as well as strengthening the cultural and educational dimensions would have agreater probability of sustaining competitiveness and economic growth over the medium and longerterm.Sustaining macroeconomic fundamentalsMalaysia has over the decades adopted a comprehensive approach. In the changed environment, thisapproach has been broadened further to address the new issues that have emerged. In terms ofmacroeconomic fundamentals, Malaysia has a track record of low and stable inflation, which haskept the cost of doing business low and has increased the attractiveness of Malaysia as an investmentdestination. Low inflation has also encouraged capital formation through a high savings rate. Inessence, macroeconomic policies to address short-term concerns have been judiciouslyimplemented while not creating any long-term risks to the economy. This policy strategy and theconducive macroeconomic environment is often taken for granted. It has however, enabled Malaysiato recover rapidly from periods of shocks to the system experienced by the nation. This policy strategyof sustaining macroeconomic fundamentals is an essential part of the overall programme torestructure and reform the nation to gain competitiveness.Restructuring and reformThe past strategies of economic diversification and structural reforms have also strengthened theunderlying structure of the Malaysian economy and has placed Malaysia in a stronger position to meetthe new challenges. Going forward, six areas have been identified for improvement in order toincrease the nation's resilience and competitiveness. The six areas are to achieve a broad-baseddiversified economic structure; to accelerate the development of financial infrastructure, financialsector restructuring and consolidation; to intensify efforts towards corporate restructuring; undertakefurther public sector reform; and to foster growth and development of small-and medium-scaleenterprises (SMEs). The strategies to address these issues have been formulated and are wellarticulated in the various long-term plans of the Government and key regulatory agencies. The ThirdOutline Perspective Plan (OPP3) launched this year in April, the financial sector masterplan and thecapital market masterplan launched in early 2001 contain the strategies to enhance Malaysia'scompetitive strength in the international markets place, in terms of both price and quality.Strengthening the economic structureA key policy strategy that has been pursued over the decades is the emphasis on strengthening theeconomic structure with increased diversification of the economic base. The strategy is essentiallydirected at promoting the development of a broad-based economy. It was recognised that over
BIS Review 80/20015dependence on a few export-oriented industries increases vulnerability to external developments.While Malaysia has reduced over the years the concentration in the low-end electronics industries,given its vulnerability to changes in demand and sharp price movements across all electronics goods,including the higher-end products, Malaysia is still affected by the recent electronics down turn. Inorder to further reduce vulnerabilities to external demand a, balanced approach has been taken,targeted at expanding the traditional areas, whilst developing new sources of growth in themanufacturing, services and agriculture sectors. In the traditional services sectors, issues beingaddressed pertain to the need to raise efficiency and productivity to optimise the use of large capacitythat has been built up as a result of investment in pre-crisis years. The new growth areas will focus onresource-based sectors, services and ICT-related activities. At the same time, the non-traditionalagriculture is targeted to increase its contribution as part of this diversification.Development of the financial sectorLadies and Gentlemen,The competitive environment in Malaysia has been enhanced by the development of the financialsystem that is able to support and facilitate trade and investment. Strategies towards developing amore competitive, efficient and effective financial sector have been outlined in the Financial SectorMasterplan (FSMP). The FSMP includes specific recommendations on measures for buildingdomestic capacity and enabling greater innovation and performance improvement. A keyrecommendation to drive the banking sector's competitiveness is the benchmarking exercise. In thisexercise, performance indicators are being developed for monitoring performance over time drive thecapacity enhancement of the banking institutions.In the new financial landscape that will be more open and competitive, only a few will emerge tocompete effectively and efficiently across all banking markets and to provide the full range of bankingservices. As such, financial institutions must re-examine existing business models to see wheretheir strengths lie and to what opportunities these strengths can be applied to enhance returns. In thisregard, the FSMP has outlined specific recommendations that will allow greater flexibility for bankinggroups to operate and build internal capacity to compete. Banking institutions would also need toconsider new business arrangements and approaches in order to enhance returns.The broadening and deepening of financial market will provide an efficient and cost-effective source offunds for corporations. In particular, efforts to develop the capital market especially the corporate bondmarket will aid this process.Restructuring the corporate sectorLadies and Gentlemen,In a fast changing economic and business environment, the restructuring of the corporate sector hasalso become an increasingly important element of competitiveness in Malaysia. In particular, corporaterestructuring would enhance general corporate sector resilience by ensuring that businesses remainagile and are able to increase returns to shareholders and investors. The reorganization of businessstrategies and focus, rationalization and consolidation of operations as well as processrestructuring, would all contribute toward the minimisation of duplications and overlapping offunctions within the group, as well as the optimisation of group strength either financially oroperationally. From the investor's perspective, this is an encouraging trend that would ultimately resultin enhanced shareholder value.The sustenance of enhanced corporate sector resilience resulting from corporate restructuring wouldbe greatly facilitated by high standards of corporate governance. Good corporate governancewould also ensure that the management of companies act in the best interest of shareholders, with theultimate objective of realising long-term shareholder value through enhanced efficiency, productivityand profitability. Evidence of the receptiveness of the market to good corporate governance has beenborne in this respect. The Asian financial crisis has shown that creditors and investors are increasinglyviewing good corporate governance as an essential element in their lending and investment decisions.As such, companies that demonstrate good corporate governance practices would find it relativelyeasier to attract and retain financing and at a lower cost, to effectively and efficiently finance theirresearch, development, innovation and capacity expansion activities, that are critical to ensuresustainable long-term competitiveness.
6BIS Review 80/2001Emerging from severity of the recent economic crisis and amidst the global economic slowdown, theMalaysian corporate sector is now undergoing major adjustments and restructuring in order toenhance its resilience and competitiveness. This corporate restructuring is being undertakenthrough several avenues. Under the current economic scenario, most corporate workouts andreorganisations are carried out through structured approach such as section 176 of the Companies Actand restructurings spearheaded by the Pengurusan Danaharta Nasional Berhad, the national assetmanagement company as well as the Corporate Debt Restructuring Committee. Market-driven orvoluntary corporate restructurings are also taking place which are initiated either at the corporate levelor by the lenders.In the context of the corporate restructuring efforts under the ambit of the Corporate DebtRestructuring Committee, continuous efforts have been made to improve the efficiency and expeditethe pace, completion and implementation of corporate restructurings. Irrespective of the routeadopted, the ultimate end-game is the creation of a robust corporate sector that is responsive tochallenges and changes that are taking place. It is therefore the main vision of all stakeholders to co-operate and get their act together in ensuring that restructuring efforts are implemented expediently topreserve the value of the company and more importantly to harness maximum benefits from emergingopportunities to enhance shareholders value. Given the paramount importance of corporaterestructuring in the competitive business environment, continuous corporate reorganizations areenvisaged to be a natural process in the business scene in order to remain viable.Given its importance, the authorities have also put in place several measures to improve thestandards of corporate governance. The release of the Finance Committee Report on CorporateGovernance marked a new beginning of our concerted efforts towards enhancing the standards ofcorporate governance in Malaysia. Since the release, there has been significant progress inimplementing the recommendations in the Report. These included among others, the development ofthe Malaysian Code of Corporate Governance to enhance the self-regulatory mechanisms thatpromote good governance. Various changes have also been effected to the Securities CommissionAct 1993 and to the KLSE Listing Requirements, to strengthen the statutory and regulatory frameworkfor corporate governance.To enhance corporate governance in the banking sector, a number of guidelines and regulationshave been introduced. Among these are, the Guidelines on Duties and Responsibilities of Directorsand Appointment of Chief Executive Directors, the Code of Conduct for Directors, Officers andEmployees in Banking Industry, the Minimum Internal Audit Standards and the Guidelines on theSpecimen Financial Statements for the Banking Industry. Indeed, according to a 2001 survey byPolitical and Economic Risk Consultancy Ltd., Malaysia's quality of corporate governance wasrated the best among 12 nations surveyed in Asia.While the authorities will continue in its role to promote the standards of corporate governance, it mustalso be noted that the private sector has an equally important role. It is critical that allstakeholders, both public and private sector participants, inculcate a culture of good corporatebehaviour. With the active participation of the private sector, including the management accountantspresent here today, we are confident that these efforts will be able to achieve the desired results andcontribute towards our gaining the competitive edge.Public sector reformOn the public sector front, a number of the Government outdated regulations, cumbersomeprocedures and practices are being reviewed. The review aims to enhance operational efficiency andtransparency as well as to streamline Government's machinery. Efficient and transparent Governmentmachinery would reduce business costs and financial risk. This would improve the businessenvironment and thereby contribute towards enhancing competitiveness.Small and medium enterprise (SME) developmentAn important element of strategies to enhance competitiveness is the development of small andmedium enterprises (SMEs). A holistic approach is required to realise the potential of SMEs in theeconomy. For SME development it is necessary to move towards a well-planned and comprehensivestrategic policy to ensure the orderly and systematic development of the SMEs. In this respect,currently, initiatives to develop SMEs by a number of agencies with varying degrees of involvement
BIS Review 80/20017are being reviewed to address the issues of viability and survival of SMEs after the AFTA. Movingforward, the development aspect of SMEs in the areas of finance, research and development, trainingand advisory as well as marketing and distribution strategies are being addressed in order for theSMEs to compete effectively after the AFTA. In this regard, the policy direction is to review the roleand function of the existing establishments to minimise destruction of value and expertise that isalready developed, and more importantly to adopt measures to facilitate the future development of theSMEs.Closing the knowledge gapIn order to effectively reap the gains from the restructuring and reforms outlined above, efforts tonarrow the knowledge gap with the goal of developing creative and competitive humanresources becomes vital. The efforts are focused on upgrading the quality and relevance of theeducation system while enhancing the skills of the labour force. In this regard, the Government haspledged additional resources to the education sector in order to narrow the knowledge and skills gap.In 8MP, the Government continues to finance and support programmes in education and training, inwhich the expenditure allocated amounted to RM22.7 billion or 21% of total allocation during the planperiod (RM19.7 billion was spent during 7MP). The holistic approach taken in education willemphasise higher productivity growth through investments in IT and knowledge-intensivetechnologies. Hence, measures are in place to promote computer literacy amongst students andworkers, improve teaching and learning methods and review the existing curriculum in schools andinstitutions of higher learning in tandem with current developments and needs. By the end of 2001, alarge number of schools are expected to be equipped with computers and software through the SmartSchools programme, with priority being given to rural schools.In order to upgrade human resource skills to meet the need of the K-economy, training at every levelwill be strengthened to generate well-trained labour to meet industry demand. Opportunities for lifelonglearning after students have completed their formal education are also being created to ensure thecontinued relevance of skills. Whilst emphasis will be placed on intensifying advanced skillsdevelopment through training, retraining and apprenticeship schemes, efforts to pool the best talentsfrom Malaysia and abroad have also been intensified. As such incentives have been provided in the2001 Budget to attract highly skilled Malaysian citizens working abroad to return to Malaysia.Emphasis on science and technologyIn order to enhance efficiency and productivity gains through restructuring and reform, an increasedfocus is on science and technology-related activities. The Government has taken the lead to boostits investment in IT, leading the way for the private sector to follow suit. As part of these measures,the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) was launched in 1996 to propel the Malaysian economy towardsa higher value added and technology driven activities. Similarly, increased in information technologyacross all sectors is taking place. The incentive structure in terms of fiscal and financial support haveaided this process. The potential for this however has yet to be realised.To intensify the attention towards research and development (R&D) activities, the Government hasallocated RM1.6 billion for R&D under the 8MP (RM1 billion in 7MP). The Government has alsobroadened the scope of research under the Intensification of Research in Priority Areas (IRPA) toinclude venture capital companies interested in carrying out R&D in the MSC. To provide supportservices as well as R&D for high technology industries, the Government announced an allocation ofRM16.7 million in the 2001 Budget for this purpose. Besides IT, public investment in R&D in othertraditional areas such as agriculture and natural resources continue to be funded and encouraged.Measures have also been taken to enhance monitoring of R&D activities, including those in the privatesector, to ensure better coordination and track the progress towards achieving targets.To further enhance the nations' capability in science and technology, the promotion of strategicalliances through smart partnerships has been encouraged. Various forms of strategic alliances areencouraged between foreign and Malaysian parties, not only by way of foreign equity holdings, butalso at the management level in sectors such as ICT, energy, ports, financial as well as the nations'airline and national car industry. Foreign direct investment has an important role in facilitating thetransfer of technology. The Government has implemented a number of initiatives to attract FDI into thecountry through an incentive structure of packages that are customised to meet the interest of specificinvestors. At the same time, the incentive structure has been designed to improve the quality of FDI
8BIS Review 80/2001away from labour-intensive to more technology-driven FDI with strong emphasis on R&D andknowledge content.ConclusionIn conclusion, it is critical that all stakeholders, both public and private sector participants, including themanagement accountants present here today to direct efforts to contribute towards our gaining thecompetitive edge. Malaysia's macroeconomic fundamentals are sound. The public sector also remainscommitted to ensure that macroeconomic environment remains favourable to ensure costs remain low.It is, therefore, important for the private sector to focus on the issue of efficiency to elevate Malaysia toa higher level of performance and prosperity.Thank you for your attention.
BIS Review 79/20011David Dodge: Current developments in the Canadian economyRemarks by Mr David Dodge, Governor of the Bank of Canada, at the annual meeting of the Bank’sBoard of Directors, Ottawa, 21 September 2001.*      *      *For reasons explained in our media advisory of 17 September, the annual out-of-town meeting of theBank’s Board of Directors that was to take place on 19 September in Moncton was held in Ottawainstead. A scheduled speech by Governor Dodge to the Moncton Chamber of Commerce waspostponed. The following is the section of that speech dealing with current economic developments.Right now, last week’s tragic events in the United States are uppermost in people’s minds. Likemillions of people around the globe, Canadians are very concerned about the situation. We all share inthe sheer horror of what has happened.In circumstances like these, part of our job as Canada’s central bank is to respond by addressing thefinancial needs of the country. That is why the Bank of Canada, like other major central banks, movedswiftly last week to provide liquidity to ensure that financial markets continued to function effectively. Inaddition, the Bank of Canada and the U.S. Federal Reserve agreed to temporarily increase theamount of their existing swap facility to provide liquidity in U.S. dollars to Canadian banks, should theyneed it to settle their U.S. dollar transactions. And this past Monday, we took action to counteractpotential effects on confidence in the aftermath of the extraordinary events in the United States, bylowering our key policy rate outside our normal schedule of announcement dates.Clearly, the events in the United States have increased the uncertainty surrounding global economicprospects in the short run. It is important, however, that we look through the short term to thelonger-term trends and potential of our economy.The first decade of the twenty-first century will continue to bring to Canada and to the rest of the worldimportant technological changes—changes that will transform our economies through the wideningapplication of new information, communications, and other general-purpose technologies. Thistransformation can be expected to raise the potential of our economy to grow and to generate incomegains in the decade ahead. Once the cyclical forces that are currently constraining investment andinnovation are behind us, we should see productivity and income gains from past investments andadjustment. And the way will be clear for further innovation and growth.In addition, Canada has made great progress over the past decade in strengthening its economicfoundations: low inflation has been firmly established; the fiscal health of governments has beenlargely restored; and Canadian businesses have undertaken major restructuring.Thus, the medium-term outlook for growth in output, employment, and incomes in Canada is veryfavourable.Let me now put the short term in perspective.Around this time last year, both the Canadian and the U.S. economies were pushing against, orthrough, their capacity limits. Because of that, some slowing was anticipated, and indeed wasdesirable, to keep inflation in check. However, the economic slowdown in the latter part of 2000 wasmore abrupt than had been foreseen, especially in the information and communications sectors.At the beginning of 2001, the Bank of Canada expected that the economic slowdown in this countrywould continue through the first half of the year and that inflationary pressures would therefore bereduced. Thus, we began to lower interest rates.We also expected that, as the process of adjusting inventories and excess capacity was completed inmost industries, capital spending in the United States, which had been sharply curtailed, would beginto recover in the second half of 2001.With the pace of economic expansion thus picking up in the United States, we expected that growth inCanada would also rebound—to above the growth of the economy’s production potential—during thefirst half of 2002. Consequently, the small output gap that had opened in 2001 would begin to close.The economic data received through last winter and spring were broadly consistent with this scenario,and the pace of monetary easing was set accordingly.
2BIS Review 79/2001By mid-summer, however, evidence began to accumulate that the U.S. slowdown would be moreprotracted than anticipated and that economic activity outside North America would be much weaker.At the same time, there were indications that domestic demand in Canada, which had held up wellthrough the first part of the year, was softening.In view of these developments, at the time of our last fixed announcement date, on 28 August, werevised down our expectations for economic growth in the period ahead. We projected that outputgrowth in the second half of 2001 would be only slightly stronger than in the first half. The pace ofeconomic expansion would then start to gain momentum in the first half of 2002 and would moveabove potential growth in the second half. This meant more economic slack going into next year thanwe had previously anticipated, and it would take longer to absorb.In these circumstances, the Bank lowered interest rates again, at the end of August, to supportdomestic demand growth and to keep inflation near the target of 2 per cent over the medium term. Andin our press release of 28 August we indicated that, given the continuing uncertainties in the globaleconomy, particularly the timing and strength of the recovery in investment in the United States, andthe uncertainty surrounding domestic demand growth in Canada, we would continue to monitordevelopments closely.Last week’s tragic developments in the United States, and their reverberations around the world,obviously bring with them further uncertainty with respect to the timing and extent of a rebound ineconomic activity.Although it is too early to fully assess the likely consequences for our economy, the Bank’s initialefforts involve trying to estimate the direct effects of disruption in sectors such as transportation,finance, and tourism. The terrorist attacks on the United States will also affect consumer and businessconfidence worldwide, including here in Canada. It is precisely for this reason that we moved promptlythis week to lower interest rates by one-half of one percentage point. This action, which leavesshort-term interest rates 2 1/4 percentage points lower than at the beginning of the year, aims toprovide further support for economic growth in Canada.The Bank also recognizes that a key factor in preserving the confidence of Canadians in the prospectsof our economy is a financial system that continues to function effectively. That is why, as I saidearlier, we took steps, together with the other G-7 central banks, to inject liquidity into the financialsystem to support its smooth functioning in the wake of the tragic events in the United States. Westand ready to do so whenever necessary. But it is encouraging that at this juncture, with each passingday, we seem to be moving back to a more normal state of affairs in the financial system.Right now, it is difficult to look too far ahead in terms of the economic implications for Canada of lastweek’s events. Nevertheless, economic growth in the third quarter will likely be close to zero or slightlynegative, and we will continue to feel the adverse effects into the fourth quarter. With the economicslack that is opening up, we continue to see core inflation falling to about 2 per cent by year-end. Wealso project that total CPI inflation will drop to close to 2 per cent over the same period, assuming thatenergy prices remain near current levels. There is a risk that world oil prices could rise sharply,depending on the fallout from last week’s events.A more complete analysis of the impact of last week’s events on the Canadian economy, including theeffects on output and inflation in 2002, will be carried out as we prepare for our next policyannouncement on 23 October. This analysis will be presented in our November 2001 Monetary PolicyReport. Clearly, there are adverse effects that need to be assessed, but there will also be offsettingfactors, from such activities as rebuilding in the United States and a return to more normal operationsin both Canada and the United States, that need to be considered. Given the uncertaintiessurrounding all these elements, there will be a wider-than-usual confidence band around the economicoutlook for next year.
BIS Review 79/20011Lars Nyberg: Sweden and the world economySpeech by Mr Lars Nyberg, Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at Danske Securities,Stockholm, 24 September 2001.*      *      *Exactly two weeks ago I landed courtesy of SAS at Newark airport, after circling around Manhattan. Asalways, I was fascinated by the skyline dominated by the twin towers of the World Trade Center. Lessthan 24 hours later, those towers were gone and thousands of people had lost their lives in an act ofterrorism that shook the entire world. It is tragic, terrifying and in many respects still incomprehensible.You all work in the financial sector and I am sure many of you have business contacts or friends whohave been affected, directly or indirectly. I myself will never forget the pictures of human despairreflected in the US media during the week I had to wait for a flight back to Sweden.Naturally, the events in New York and Washington will have both political and economicconsequences. At the moment, everything appears to be very uncertain, for understandable reasons.However, it is necessary to take developments in the US economy as a starting point for anyassessment of how the Swedish economy will develop over the next few years. This applied beforethe attack against the USA and it applies even more now. I would therefore like to share with you -after a brief description of what preceded the economic slowdown we have now entered – my view ofwhat are the core issues for assessing growth and inflation prospects for the near future, both in theUSA and in Sweden.The driving forces behind the economic upturn in the USAThe very optimistic expectations regarding long-term growth comprised an important driving forcebehind the sustained rise in the US economy. It was the rapid developments in information technologyand the telecom sector in particular that were assumed to have such spread effects to the rest of theeconomy that production was expected to continue increasing at a more rapid rate than before, evenin the long term. Investments therefore rose strongly, particularly in the IT sector. There were alsomany people who claimed that future fluctuations in the business sector would be less pronouncedthan before. Efficient stock management and trimmed production processes were assumed to befactors that would reduce the risk of major fluctuations in growth. The USA had taken the step into a“new economy”. And developments on the stock market reflected the belief that “this time it’s reallydifferent”.At the same time, the fact that demand could increase so strongly and over such a long period of timewithout inflation accelerating in the USA was regarded by many as the revenue from breaking earliereconomic ties. Low inflation expectations and a high level of confidence in the central bank’s capacityand willingness to maintain price stability also created favourable conditions for future growth.Confidence in the US economy was further strengthened by the positive development in publicfinances.The optimistic expectations for the future - which were expressed in rising share prices and growingwealth - also increased households’ willingness to consume durable goods. Together with the strongrise in investment, this led to a large expansion of credit. Many IT companies were able to find cheapfinancing on the risk capital market, but despite this indebtedness increased markedly among bothhouseholds and companies. This development was reflected in the rapidly increasing deficit on thecurrent account, which was entirely due to a reduction in saving in the private sector. The financing ofthe current account deficit was mainly achieved through a greatly increased capital inflow from foreigninvestors’ purchases of US shares. Demand for US capital was so extensive that the dollar continuedto rise in value, despite the growing deficit on the current account.In winter last year, however, the trend on the stock exchange was broken and the air slowly went outof the IT bubble. When raised interest rates and high oil prices reduced household purchasing powerand demand during the autumn, company profits also began to decline. Falling profits and a highburden of debt contributed to subduing investment and the downturn in the US economy became fact.With hindsight, one can wonder how so many people could be so sure that we had left the whole storybehind us and entered a new world. However, we will probably make the same mistake again. Let me
2BIS Review 79/2001just remind you of the first “IT bubble” at the beginning of the last century, which concerned wirelesstelegraphy. 150 companies were introduced onto the New York stock exchange in 1901 and early1902. In 1907, only one of these still showed a profit and paid dividends, and even that company hadhalved its market value since its introduction.Similar development in SwedenThe development I have outlined applies first and foremost to the USA until the end of last year, butmany parts of the description also fit the Swedish economy. Here, our GDP growth had exceeded3.5 per cent for three years at the start of the year. The IT and telecom sectors’ large share of Swedishbusiness contributed to a more rapid economic growth in Sweden than in many other Europeancountries. Many people claimed that Sweden also had one foot in the “new economy”.However, the economic upturn here in Sweden started later than that in the USA, and from a situationwith a higher level of financial saving in the private sector. The imbalances in saving and foreign tradethat distinguished - and still distinguish - the USA thus had no counterpart in Sweden.Despite the strong growth, however, inflationary pressure was unusually weak, even in Sweden. Theusual explanatory variables - resource utilisation, import prices and inflation expectations - were notalways enough to explain or forecast the low inflation rate that was established periodically – whichwas also something that affected many forecasters and analysts around the world during this period.When the economic upturn began, there were still plenty of free resources, which had a dampeningeffect on inflation. At the same time, inflation expectations had stabilised around our inflation target of2 per cent and wage agreements were moderate. However, apart from this we had to seekexplanations for the low inflationary pressure in increased competition on internationalised andderegulated markets supported by developments in information technology. We appeared able to livewith a lower growth rate than before, without this endangering price stability.The low inflationary pressure meant that the Riksbank could be content with cautiously slowing downthe economy during 2000, despite the high growth rate. The steering interest rate was raised onlytwice from the end of 1999 up to November last year. Before that the rate had been reduced fromalmost 9 per cent in autumn 1996 to as low as 2.90 in March 1999. The Swedish repo rate was low incomparison with the corresponding steering interest rates in, for instance, the USA and the euro area.At the end of last year, however, resource utilisation in the Swedish economy was beginning to bestrained and inflation was estimated to rise to the extent that it would exceed the target level twoyears’ ahead. The Riksbank therefore raised the repo rate by a quarter of a percentage point to4.25 per cent. The assessment of the risk spectrum indicated at the same time that a weaker economyin the USA could dampen growth in Sweden. As we now know, this is what happened.Developments during the springDuring the first half of the year, the economic climate continued to weaken both in Sweden and othercountries, but the signals regarding the strength of the downturn were mixed. The weakening in theeconomic climate was concentrated to the manufacturing industry, while household confidenceremained strong, despite an undermining of household wealth in the form of falling share prices.Property prices were not affected in the same way as share prices, which probably contributed tokeeping household’s confidence in the future strong. This applied both to the Swedish economy andthe US economy. In the USA the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates gradually by 2.75 percentagepoints during the first half of the year, while tax reductions provided stimulation for households.For the Riksbank the picture was complicated by the fact that import prices rose unexpectedly rapidlyin May. Later, the statistics showed that consumer prices had also risen more rapidly than expected.The increase (measured at an annual rate) in May was 3.1 per cent. At the same time as theeconomic climate gradually weakened, there were indications that inflation was beginning to rise. Theprice increases could to some extent be attributed to non-recurring factors - such as higher food pricescaused by BSE (“mad cow disease”) and crop failure -but some of the price increase was more difficultto explain. When the exchange rate also weakened substantially in June, there was justified uneasethat this could have an impact in the form of rising inflation expectations.Given these developments, a majority of the Executive Board of the Riksbank decided on 5 July toraise the repo rate by 0.25 percentage points to 4.25 per cent. There was still considerable uncertaintyas to how rapidly the US economy could recover. Nor was there any other economy elsewhere in the
BIS Review 79/20013world that could take over the USA’s role as growth engine. Quite the reverse, the economies in theeuro area and Japan were weakening. The Asian economies that had been strongly IT-dependent intheir exports were also unable to act as pacemaker.When the Executive Board had to make a decision regarding the repo rate this time, the situation wasunusually complicated and uncertain. This was also reflected in the fact that we Board membersdiffered in our judgements but hardly at all in our fundamental analysis. My assessment was that therewas a greater risk that the international slowdown would be deeper and more prolonged than themajority of the Board believed. The signals regarding developments in the US economy were mixedand the assessment hung in the balance between a rapid recovery and a more long-drawn outsequence of events. In my opinion, there was every reason to wait for clearer indications beforechanging the interest rate. Others were more concerned that the weaker exchange rate would have animpact on inflation.The role of the krona for an inflation target policyAs the krona has long come under focus, I would like to briefly remind you of the role the exchangerate plays in monetary policy. We have an inflation target, and the development of the krona has aneffect on inflation, partly through import prices, partly through influencing demand for Swedish goodsand services. For instance, if the krona has a low value, demand and resource utilisation in the exportindustry increase.When we want to influence inflation, we do so primarily via the repo rate. Occasionally, but in my viewvery rarely, we can also try to influence the exchange rate and thereby the inflation rate, throughcurrency interventions. It is important to remember that we can never have a target for the value of thekrona while monetary policy is directed at an inflation target.The monetary policy decisions are based on forward-looking assessments of the inflation rate. Thismeans that the Riksbank must make assessments of how the krona will develop in relation to othercurrencies during the forecast period, and assess what effect the development of the krona will haveon demand for Swedish goods, as well as the impact the krona will have on consumer prices. None ofthese assessments is simple.Allow me first to point out the mechanisms that are important with regard to a direct impact on inflationvia import prices. If the krona weakens and prices on the goods we import are determined in theexporter’s home country currency, the weaker krona will have a direct impact on import prices. For theweaker krona to have a full impact on prices of imported goods in the consumer channel, all domesticintermediaries must pass the price increases on to the end consumer.During the years with a floating exchange rate we have been able to note that the weakening of thekrona has not had the impact on consumer prices that we had expected. One explanation could bethat internationalisation and increased competition have first and foremost meant that the exportingcompanies endeavour to adapt their prices to developments on the markets where they sell, in orderto retain their market share. It is reasonable to imagine that large corporations with sales andproduction spread around the world can act in this way without facing large fluctuations in profits. AGerman exporter selling goods both in the USA and in Sweden could, for instance, have kept itsprofits up fairly well by determining its prices in dollars in the USA and in Swedish kronor in Sweden.At the same time, increased competition should in general mean that wholesalers and retailers in thedomestic market have greater difficulty in passing import price increases on to the consumer channel.The general demand situation in the world also has great significance for the capacity to raise prices inall channels - low utilisation of resources subdues price pressure and high resource utilisationincreases price pressure. However, our knowledge of pricing behaviour among both exporters toSweden and domestic operators is limited. This means that assessments of the effects on inflation of aparticular development in the krona are uncertain.An even more difficult task is to make assessments regarding the krona exchange rate during theforecast period. In the medium to long term, we do not obtain much guidance from the theoreticalmodels for determining the exchange rate. Almost all models are based on the real exchange ratecreating balance in a country’s foreign trade. A particular basket of goods shall, for instance, costapproximately the same here as in Germany. If it is -as is the case today - cheaper in Sweden, we willincrease our exports and have a surplus on the current account - which we have. A prolonged surpluson the current account will sooner or later strengthen the nominal exchange rate so that a balance isachieved. However, this can evidently take longer than expected.
4BIS Review 79/2001Although the long-term value of the krona is determined by flows of goods and other items in thecurrent account, its price is governed in the short term by supply and demand on the foreign exchangemarket, and here other factors can prevail. Developments on the financial markets have led to rapidand substantial portfolio transfers when, for instance, Swedish investors have bought shares abroad orforeign investors have sold Swedish shares. Changed expectations of earnings on various shares andchanges in the willingness to take risks appear to have increasingly governed the developments onthe foreign exchange markets in a way that is not captured by traditional exchange rate models.Portfolio transfers as a result of deregulation or changes in investment regulations may also have hadsignificance.In the long term, however, it is difficult to believe that anything other than the development of thefundamental economy shall determine how the exchange rate develops. Regardless of which modelwe apply to explain the krona rate, it will show that the krona is undervalued and has been so for along time.Despite the difficulties connected with forecasting exchange rates, we have to make assumptionsregarding the development of the krona in our assessments of inflation. We have chosen to usefundamental analysis as a basis but to also weigh in as far as possible the effects of other factors. Thismeans that our assessments assume that the krona will appreciate in the long term, which it has so farstubbornly refused to do. Nevertheless, the consequences of these “misforecasts” have not been sogreat. During the period we have had a floating exchange rate, fluctuations in the krona rate have nothad as large an impact on inflation as before, which we have taken into account when making inflationassessment. This means that monetary policy has not been affected to any great extent by the factthat the krona has not developed as expected.What does the future hold in store?The prospects for the US economy played a decisive role in the assessment of Swedish growth andinflation even before the terrorist attack a couple of weeks ago. One important factor was whetherthere was actually grounds for the optimistic expectations of future growth that characterised theeconomy and that had previously pushed up investment and share prices. Was the economicdownturn in the shape of a V, i.e. would it soon be over? There can scarcely be any doubt thatdevelopments in information technology had created and are still creating growth potential that is farfrom exhausted. Or would it take longer time to grow into the overinvestment that occurred when the“new economy” appeared to be a fact, i.e. would the economic downturn take on the shape of a U? Orwould the USA simply experience a recession in the backwater of the burst IT bubble?At the Riksbank we were discussing a “banana-shaped” development from an early state, which couldbest be interpreted as a very long drawn out U. And even in the USA, the assessments had alreadychanged from V to U even before the catastrophe and there was talk here and there of the possibilityof a recession. The positive figures expected with regard to consumption and investment had largelyfailed to materialise, despite interest rate reductions and tax relief, while unemployment had increasedand consumers found it more difficult to pay their debts. Nor had the stock exchange shown the upturnexpected by many.Of course, the tragic events in the USA will have a severe dampening effect on the business cycle, atleast in the short term. A number of central banks, headed by the Federal Reserve, have thereforelowered their steering interest rates. The Executive Board of the Riksbank also decided last week tolower the repo rate by 0.5 percentage points from 4.25 per cent to 3.75 per cent. Subdued inflationarypressure as a result of lower resource utilisation both in Sweden and abroad was judged toovershadow any price increases caused by the continuing weak krona.We stated in the press release that “the uncertainty occasioned by last week’s act of terrorism createsthe risk of a further dampening of global demand. It is difficult in the present situation to assess thecollective consequences for the international economy and thus inflation prospects in Sweden over thenext few years. There is a risk that confidence in the future will decline in both the corporate sectorand the household sector, which could result in a deeper and more prolonged economic slowdown.This would indicate that inflation two years’ ahead, with an unchanged repo rate, would be lower thanthe Riksbank’s target. The shape taken by future developments will depend partly on the economicpolicy measures taken now.”Despite this gloomy statement, there is no cause for despair. The US economy is basically strong witha high potential growth. Some increase in household saving is needed to reduce the burden of debt
BIS Review 79/20015and the deficit on the current account. And of course the dollar appears to be rather overvalued. TheSwedish economy is also in good condition, with low unemployment, a surplus on the current account,a declining central government debt and low inflation. The conditions for coping with an economicdownturn are good, even if the downturn proves more prolonged than we believed in the spring.Thank you for listening.
BIS Review 79/20011David Klein: Israel’s macro economic policy and the European standardsSpeech by Mr David Klein, Governor of the Bank of Israel, for the Euro Conference, Tel Aviv,4 September 2001.*      *      *Israel is an open economy, more than many other countries in the world. A few indicators tell the story:- The share of exports plus imports, relatively to GDP, is almost 100%;- The stock of Israeli assets, shares and loans, private and public, held by foreigners, amountsto US $130 billion - more than our GDP;- The stock of foreign assets, shares and loans, held by Israel’s residents, amounts to someUS $65 billion.- Exchange controls have been almost fully removed and the exchange rate is freelydetermined in a growing interbank foreign currency market;- Israel is party to bilateral and multilateral international agreements, with the US, the IMF, theEU, and the WTO, committing the economy to open trade in goods and services and opencapital account.This background is, of course, not accidental. Economic thinking in Israel was very much influenced, inthe last decades, by the agenda of the more developed industrial economies. Early on we realized thatfree trade agreements and low custom duties, although painful in the short-run, are a necessarycondition for sustainable growth of a small economy like that of Israel. This state of affairs is takento-day as given and nobody contemplates seriously protecting Israeli industry from foreign competitionby tariff and non-tariff barriers, as we used to do in the past.* * *Nevertheless, there is still a bridge that we have not completely crossed. We already understand thatto get integrated with the world economy we have to follow some rules. Paramount among them areMaastricht-like criteria relating to fiscal discipline, public debt and price stability. However, since weare not a member of the EU, and not even one of the accession countries that wait to join in, there isno external pressure to abide by these rules. Hence, we have to do it on our own, which turns out tobe a rough process.The major hurdle to-day is fiscal discipline. The essence of this rule, as is well known, is to limit thegeneral government deficit in order to reach a reasonable level of public debt ratio to GDP. The publicdebt ratio of Israel is still high, above 90%, although it was a lot higher before we embarked on thisroad. This means that we cannot pause, and certainly not change direction, in our attempt to maintaina low deficit. Raising the deficit is not an option, especially because our public spending level isalready one of the highest, if not the highest, in the world. Our estimate is that in the current year,2001, our ratio of public spending to GDP amounts to 54%, compared to an average of 42% in 20 ofthe OECD countries, where all of the individual countries ratio are lower than ours.So what can the government do, given the current slowdown, to help the economy get out of therecession? The only viable option is to change the composition of spending so that growth-enhancingexpenditures will get priority. Government investment in infrastructure, for example, ought to getprecedence over government programs to support those who are not working. This does not meanthat these programs should be scrapped altogether. But it does mean that they should be refocused.The question should not be how the state can help those who are not working to maintain a modeststandard of living, but rather how the state can help them join the labor force.Another example, often quoted, relates to the efficiency of our public education programs.International comparisons indicate that, in some instances, we get less for our money, compared withother countries. Furthermore, we still grapple with the question whether, and to what extent, there isroom for private sharing of educational expenses - not necessarily to save public money but, forexample, to focus more on education in development towns.
2BIS Review 79/2001These are only some aspects of fiscal discipline or, as it is sometimes called, fiscal consolidation.They serve to illustrate why it seems, sometimes, easier to bypass the need to be more efficient, andjust increase overall government spending and the deficit.* * *A good reason to resist the temptation to give up fiscal discipline is its implications for financialmarkets:- The first, and most immediate, effect of increased deficit is an increase in the interest rate ongovernment instruments to finance the deficit. This has already started to take place in thelast few months. The outcome holds not only for the increase in public debt, but also for thatpart of the debt that needs recycling every year. Interest payments take already some 15%of the government current resources, and are larger than the education budget and verymuch larger than government investments.- The increased interest on government instruments reverberates to private ones. This is thesecond effect. We know that the yield on government bonds serves as a benchmark forpricing long-term loans, like mortgages. The increased deficit level in the current year castsalready some doubts about the future trend of the cost of mortgages. Another example hasto do with the government initiative to commission private entrepreneurs to invest ininfrastructure (the so-called P.F.I.). These will need capital resources, or long-term loans,and they will be priced based on the yield on government securities. Hence, increasedbudget deficit will increase the cost of capital also for privately financed long-terminvestments.- The third effect is on inflation and/or on the balance of payments. It takes more time tomaterialize, but it is a certain outcome. We went through such a period in the middle of thelast decade where, following an expansionary fiscal policy in the first half of the decade,supported by an expansionary monetary policy, we got a large and non-sustainable deficit inthe balance of payments and increasing inflation. To avert crisis, we had to back off and theeconomy slowed down. This is why it is so important that the government added to itsdecision, to increase the deficit in 2002, a commitment to lower it in the three consecutiveyears. The only question now is whether the markets will believe.- If the credibility of the government is in doubt, we will get the fourth effect of a highergovernment deficit, this time in the foreign currency market. We often note the relativestability of this market, despite the decline of long-term capital inflows and the regionaltension. But we should not overlook the factors that hold the balance in this market:- On the one hand we have foreign investors who started, in recent months, to buy foreigncurrency on a relatively large scale, apparently to hedge their exposure to the shekel, due totheir long-term investments in Israel. The timing may reflect a concern lest the stability of thecurrency will be impaired due to the rising military tension.- This added demand for foreign currency is met by supply of Israelis, mainly from thebusiness sector. They sell foreign currency, in the spot and future markets, that they geteither from their export receipts, or from foreign currency loans, or from drawing on theirforeign currency deposits in Israel or abroad. It seems clear that Israelis who sell foreigncurrency have more faith in the stability of the shekel than their foreign counterparts. This iswhat keeps the market in a relative balance.Here is where the credibility of the government enters:- In the eyes of the Israelis - if their trust in the government’s ability to maintain fiscal controlwill be shaken; and if they will loose their confidence that the government is indeedcommitted to price stability - they will draw the conclusions. The relative balance in theforeign currency market will be replaced by excess demand.- From similar episodes we know that it is the domestic sector that reacts first, but thatforeigners follow suite. Right now they just reduce their domestic currency risk. The situationdoes not justify going beyond that, although foreigners have reduced some of their tradedportfolio in Israel.On the wayside stand foreign analysts and rating agencies. They publish newsletters, interviewpolicymakers, collect data and offer their considered view to their customers and the public. We know
BIS Review 79/20013their agenda: fiscal discipline, price stability, low public debt, stable financial system, structuralreforms. They are not very good in seeing the future, but they are very quick to join the party in itsearly phases. For them too, perhaps especially for them, the credibility of the government isall-important.* * *Hence, a government that starts by raising the deficit, especially after a year where the deficit isexpected to be larger than planned, is already on an inferior ground and has to do more to convincethe public that its commitment, to reduce the deficit in the following years, is credible. What can it do?The first thing is to confine the increased level of spending to investment, put a lid on currentexpenditures, and show it explicitly. The government ought to ratify not only the ceiling on totalspending for 2002, but also its breakdown to current and capital expenditure, and present the figuresin comparison to the estimated figures for 2001. It is one thing to borrow more for investment, andcompletely another - to borrow more to finance current spending, even if it is called teachers’ salaries,hospitals’ maintenance and poverty reduction programs. The approved capital spending aggregateought to be accompanied with a list of projects and time-table for their implementation. Finally thegovernment ought to discuss, and publish to the public, a quarterly report on the budget execution,compared to its plan.The second thing is to make absolutely clear that the government is committed to price stability.Hence:- If somebody says that short-term interest should be reduced, he should also add: providedthat it does not undermine price stability;- If somebody says that we should follow in the footsteps of the US central bank that reducedinterest rates in 2001, he should also quote the Fed’s emphasis that, given the conditions inthe U.S economy, these interest-rate reductions are consistent with price stability;- And if somebody says that price stability is important and so are growth and employment, heshould also explain that if we have more than one target we should employ more than oneinstrument, and we should not expect to attain all targets using one instrument. Partialstatements may convey the message that an interest rate reduction is an end to itself,regardless of the consequences, thus increasing skepticism regarding the intention ofgovernment policy. But clear statements are not enough. The government should strengthenthe ability of the Bank of Israel to maintain price stability and go on with the reform requiredto change the structure of the domestic financial markets. The main elements of the reformare well known:- Removing the obstacles preventing the creation of a non-bank money market, that willinclude short-term bills (Makam), commercial papers, certificates of deposit, repos andvarious derivatives;- Enhancing the competitive structure of long-term institutional investment, by graduallyabolishing the issuance of non-tradable government bonds to pension funds, and reduceconcentration in this industry;- And abolish the remaining controls on foreign currency transactions, including the archaicexchange rate band, thus reaching full convertibility of the Shekel.* * *The mission to lead the economy out of the recession is indeed awesome. Nevertheless, we shouldnot loose sight of our ultimate destination: durable growth, based on a competitive market, integratedwith the world economy and operating based on the same ground rules. Such an economy should bealso better equipped to deal with poverty reduction and other sensitive social issues.
BIS Review 78/20011Eva Srejber: Competition and growthSpeech by Ms Eva Srejber, Second Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, to the SwedishTaxpayers Association, Stockholm, 21 September 2001.*      *      *According to the Sveriges Riksbank Act, the objective of monetary policy is to safeguard the value ofmoney. The Riksbank has specified this in its inflation target, i.e. that CPI inflation should amount to2 per cent with a deviation interval of plus/minus one percentage point. This means that when weformulate monetary policy, we must take into account changes in a number of areas that affect pricetrends, either directly or indirectly. I thought that I would comment on one of these areas today, namelycompetition, and its effects on potential growth. This is an area that we are forced to consider when weanalyse the economy, as it is essential to assess potential growth when shaping monetary policy.However, before I begin, I should like to make the point that I will not be discussing the currentmonetary policy situation.Growth is a constant central feature of monetary policy discussions, as demand in the economy inrelation to production capacity is crucial for determining whether inflationary bottlenecks arise orwhether we will underutilise the production potential. It is sometimes claimed that maintaining pricestability limits growth. This is incorrect. The limits are determined by the potential growth rate. Wemust take into account the potential growth rate, even if we do not influence this by means ofmonetary policy once price stability has been established. Correspondingly, we must take into accountchanges in conditions for competition, as such changes can influence inflationary trends both directlyand indirectly. Any measures taken to strengthen potential growth come under other economic policythan monetary policy. Such measures can include avoiding limits to competition that would lead to apoorer allocation of resources.The Swedish economy was showing very favourable growth until last winter. Today, now that growthhas slowed down, it may be worthwhile to remember that it is from this starting point that growth wassubdued. We can put it even further into perspective by comparing with the situation in the beginningof the 1990s. Conditions then were very difficult and characterised by rising unemployment, a highinflation rate and poor public finances. The situation was so strained that the government turned to theacademic world for advice and a report from the Economics Commission was delivered in spring1993.1This report, which is usually referred to as the Lindbeck Commission, contained no less than113 proposals – many of them were controversial, which stimulated the debate of the day. TheLindbeck Commission took the view that the crisis was based on problems in three fundamental areas;stability, efficiency and growth. The proposals were also grouped into measures to create stability,measures to increase efficiency in resource utilisation and measures to increase growth in theeconomy.Price and budget stability has been attainedIf one reads this report today, one is struck by how many of these proposals have actually beenimplemented. When it comes to measures for attaining macroeconomic stability, most of them havebeen implemented and Sweden has for several years enjoyed low inflation and sound public finances.Progress has also been made in the field of wage formation. With regard to measures to increaseefficiency and potential growth, the result of a survey of which proposals have been implementedgains more mixed results. Important changes have been made in some areas; while in others verylittle has happened.If we look at developments during the eight years that have passed since 1993, the results areheartening. The average growth rate during this period has amounted to 3.1 per cent. This is verydifferent from the average growth rate of 1.8 per cent that prevailed during the previous ten years. Ifdevelopments since 1993 had been limited to this 1.8 per cent, we would currently have a GDP levelaround SEK 174 billion lower than now, i.e. more than eight per cent lower, and the situation wouldhave looked radically different in most areas. Open unemployment would be twice as high if one                                                     1 "New terms for economics and politics", proposals from the Economics Commission, SOU 1993:16.
2BIS Review 78/2001utilises the "Okun relation" - at approximately 8 per cent rather than roughly 4 per cent. It is doubtful,however whether the Okun relation is relevant over such a long period of time. The greatest part of thedifference would probably have resulted in lower real wages, i.e. our disposable incomes would havebeen substantially lower. It is possible to make many calculations of this nature, all of which illustratehow differences in the growth rate provide very strong effects over a number of years.There is therefore good reason to discuss which factors have contributed to this favourabledevelopment. It will probably not be possible to agree on a definitive answer, but I believe it is likelythat the structural reforms implemented even before 1993 (in particular the tax reform of 1990/91) andthe proposals by the Economics Commission that were implemented have all contributed.A more efficient economyOne interesting condition is that total factor productivity really took off in 1993 and that it thereafterdeveloped more strongly than it had during the previous decades. Total factor productivity concernsthe quality of available resources and how efficiently we utilise them, and in this respect developmentsshow a marked improvement. From the mid-1980s up to 1993, there was in general terms no increaseat all in factor productivity, which means that the limited increase in productivity that arose was due toinvestment, i.e. to an increase in capital intensity. From 1993 onwards, the relationship has beenreversed. We have had an impressive annual increase in factor productivity of per cent2, while capitalintensity has increased by a modest 0.1%.The fact that this change began in the same year that the Economics Commission presented itsproposals is probably mainly coincidence, but the fact that a macroeconomic stabilisation has a rapidand enduring effect on the development of productivity has been proved by the economist Easterly,amongst others. That is to say, the combination of price and budget stability is an importantexplanation of developments in total factor productivity. It is probably due to stable prices providing abetter information value in relative prices, which improves the allocation of resources. The combinationof price stability and budget stability also increases willingness in the household sector and corporatesector to make long-term decisions.If we consider other factors that stimulate the rise in total factor productivity, there are a number ofchanges that play a central role. In general, one tends to seek explanations for increasing factorproductivity among factors such as technological developments, education, competence andincentives among the labour force, allocation of resources in society, as well as between and withinbranches and companies. There is therefore a large group of possible factors, but many of these areconnected to general incentives behind the transformation and to the capacity to utilise technologicalprogress in the world around us.The allocation of resources in society includes an area where important changes were implementedmainly before the days of the Lindbeck Commission. I am referring to the deregulation of the financialmarkets and the development of these in recent years. A number of international studies indicate thata deregulated and well-functioning financial market clearly stimulates the development of factorproductivity.With regard to a more efficient use of the labour force, several changes have been implemented thathave probably stimulated development. These include reforms in the pension system, the tax systemand the social insurance system. The burden of taxation has been subdued and the economic returnon higher education has increased - in particular in technical education. In addition, wage formationhas been improved, which should have been facilitated by the monetary policy focus on price stability.At the same time, the pressure on companies to use resources efficiently has increased during the1990s. Tougher competitive pressure as a result of both increased internationalisation andderegulation in a number of sectors has increased the need for companies to economise with scantresources. Less wastefulness with resources means that labour force and capital are employed inother areas, where they can better contribute to the national economy. The development of investmentis another factor that may have contributed, even if capital intensity has increased at a very slow rate.One factor that has not contributed to a long-term improvement in resource allocation is thedevelopment of the exchange rate. The devaluations in the 1970s and 1980s have been followed by afloating exchange rate, but with an undervalued Swedish krona. The longer the krona remains                                                     2These calculations are based on a Cobb-Douglas production function with a constant returns to scale.
BIS Review 78/20013undervalued, the greater the risk of bad investments being made in domestic businesses. I do notintend to go into these issues in greater detail here and now, but would nevertheless like to point outthat undesirable effects on business can arise through a misaligned currency giving flawed relativeprices. Companies may make decisions regarding investment and employment on the basis of theserelative prices. The foremost risk here is that too many resources will be drawn to the export sectorand to the import competition sector before there is a return to the equilibrium exchange rate and tocorresponding relative prices. At that point, the resources overinvested in these sectors will betransferred to other sectors. We know from previous structural changes in, for instance, shipping, steelmanufacture and the property sector, that such a development would result in considerable costs tothe real economy. One should not underestimate the importance for welfare of a correctly valuedSwedish krona.Openness is importantFactor productivity is also affected by a country's capacity to utilise technological progress in theoutside world. This capacity in turn depends on how open the country is to impulses from outside,which is determined by the barriers that exist to ideas, goods, services and production factors movingfreely across the borders. A number of studies have shown that countries, which are more open havea greater capacity to imitate technological progress. The capacity to renew regulatory frameworks andinstitutions to enable the country to embrace change is an important part of this openness.Obstacles to ideas, goods, services and production factors moving freely across borders havedeclined during the 1990s, partly thanks to our membership of the EU, and it is reasonable to assumethat this has had a positive effect on factor productivity. For a small country like Sweden,internationalisation and increased international competition are expected to lead to particularlyfavourable productivity effects. Various measures indicate a marked increase in the degree ofinternationalisation in the Swedish economy. Both the import share and the export share have risen,which means that trade and the degree of specialisation have increased. Moreover, foreign directinvestment in Sweden has multiplied and it is mainly direct investment from EU countries that hasincreased.Although the increasing international openness has been pronounced in Sweden with, for instance, arise of 13 percentage points in the export share of GDP during the 1990s, there are several smallercountries that have shown an even more rapid increase in the equivalent figures. This reflects theglobalised world in which we live, and does not reduce the significance of openness for thedevelopment of factor productivity.Internationalisation has thus contributed to ensuring that an increasing percentage of trade andindustry is exposed to competition. Increased competition means that companies must become moreefficient and cost-conscious, which in turn should have a positive effect on productivity. In addition, anew competition act came into force in Sweden in 1993, containing an expressed prohibition ofco-operation between companies that limits competition, as well as a ban on the misuse of a dominantposition. There has also been deregulation in a number of areas. For instance, governmentmonopolies have been abolished and freedom to establish businesses has been introduced withregard to, for instance, transport, communication and energy.Changed conditions for competition thus affect productivity growth, but they can also affect pricetrends in a more direct manner. Despite the fact that we gained much tougher competition legislationin 1993, it appears that developments in this field are moving rather slowly. Swedish prices continue tolie at a higher level than those in other countries in most areas, without this being fully explained bydifferences in VAT rates and wages. Increased competition could contribute to a convergence of pricelevels.High food pricesSwedish food prices were, for instance, more than 18 per cent higher than the average prices in theEU in 19983. The difference has declined somewhat since then, but apparently at a very slow rate. Ifone regards 1998 prices in current terms with the aid of HICP development since then, one finds that                                                     3Eurostat's survey of the price level index for 1998, published in 2000.
4BIS Review 78/2001we probably still have approximately 17.5 percentage points of the 18 percentage point difference infood prices.Another field in which competition appears to be weak is the construction sector, and in particular theconstruction materials sector. This area is characterised by a high company concentration withconsiderable entry barriers to new companies and weak import competition. With regard to prices forconstruction materials, one can also see a much more rapid price rise than for other industrialproducts over a number of years, which may indicate rising profit margins or considerable inefficiencyin resource utilisation.In some further fields, such as telecommunications services and electricity, deregulation had apronounced dampening effect on price development for some time. This is no longer the case. Themost recent statistics available indicate price increases of 7 per cent and 20 per cent respectively forthese areas. In addition, Telia has announced a large rise in its subscriber fees with effect fromOctober. I therefore see it as natural that there are investigations underway and planned intocompetition conditions in these markets.Vested interests versus consumer interestsAlthough we have thus achieved improvements in certain areas, it appears to me that the descriptionin the Economics Commission's report of 1993 (page 10) still applies to large parts of the economy."It is evident that a number of important markets in the Swedish economy function poorly and that thisleads to considerable wastefulness with resources and to large costs for the national economy. TheCommission's assessment is that the fundamental reason is the lack of competition in Swedish tradeand industry. One indicator of the lack of competition is that prices on a large number of goods aremuch higher in Sweden than in other countries. Other indicators are the many public regulations of themarket, the agreements between companies that limit competition and the monopoly-like marketstructure in many sectors. The limitations to competition are a clear example of how vested interestsdominate over general consumer interests."More recently, this type of question has arisen with regard, for instance, to the EU Commission'srevelations of price collaboration between the airline companies SAS and Maersk. From an economicperspective, these are important questions that motivate a broad discussion. From a monetary policyperspective, an influence on price developments from changed conditions for competition is one ofseveral important areas that we at the Riksbank must consider, as the potential growth rate dependson how effectively resources are allocated.To summarise, there has been considerable change in the Swedish economy in recent times. Theexternal framework is currently characterised by significant fiscal and monetary stability, whichfacilitates planning and decision-making by both households and companies. These fundamentalconditions, together with a pronounced increase in openness towards the outside world give reason toexpect a continued favourable development in productivity.At the same time, one should remember that several markets in Sweden still show clear signs of poorcompetition. This involves considerable cost. The various parts of the economy are connected, whichoften means that a strengthening of the weaker parts is even more important to the economy as awhole than to the effects on a particular branch or sector. It is exactly this – the complementarity of theeconomy4 – which makes it particularly important to deal with our weak links and to listen with humilityto the proposals of the OECD and IMF, for instance. It is often easier to identify problems if one cansee things with a little perspective. I believe that the Swedish economy has considerable unutilisedpotential for a strong growth if we concentrate on it, if we all work together to make our joint cakegrow.                                                     4The significance of a complementarity in economic policy has been demonstrated by, for instance, Aziz and Wescott 1997 in"Policy Complementarities and the Washington Consensus".
BIS Review 77/20011Willem F Duisenberg: The EURO. OUR moneySpeech delivered by Dr Willem F Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, at theEuro 2002 Information Campaign hosted by Suomen Pankki (Bank of Finland) in Helsinki on17 September 2001.*      *      *Ladies and Gentlemen,Thank you for inviting me here today. Before I proceed with my speech, I would like to express mysincere condolences and those of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank to all thosewhose lives were touched by last week’s terrorist attacks in the United States of America. The attackswere so horrific – and tragic – that we are talking about the world being a different place now. Thatmay be so. But life – and that includes business life – has to, and will, go on.I would like to emphasise that the Eurosystem stands ready to support the normal functioning ofmarkets and relevant operational systems if the need arises. The Governing Council reaffirmed itssupport at its meeting last Thursday. In this context, the Eurosystem conducted liquidity-providing finetuning operations last week. The ECB also agreed last week on a swap arrangement with the FederalReserve System to facilitate the functioning of the financial markets and to provide liquidity in dollars.The Eurosystem is co-ordinating its activity with the Federal Reserve of the United States and theworld’s other major central banks.Furthermore, as a mark of respect, the European Union held a day of mourning last Friday. And as agesture of solidarity, we withdrew all TV commercials and print advertisements by the Euro 2002Information Campaign from the media on that day.Let me now turn to the subject of this conference, the Euro 2002 Information Campaign. Theconference is being hosted by Suomen Pankki and it is one of the last ones in the campaign beingconducted by the European Central Bank (ECB) and the twelve national central banks of the euroarea. Tomorrow, the Banca d’Italia, and in one month’s time, the Bank of Greece will conclude thisseries of conferences, which has brought together more than 5,000 key actors in the euro cashchangeover process. They have benefited from the exchange of views and information, for they havebeen able to enhance their own preparations for the cash changeover. Moreover, the media attendingthese conferences have made the public more aware of the impending introduction of the eurobanknotes and coins. My colleagues on the Executive Board and myself have been pleased to activelycontribute to these conferences.In just over 100 days, the EURO.OUR money, will be in our pockets, and will finally become aneveryday reality for all of us. In just over 100 days, we will be able to travel from one euro area countryto another, from Helsinki to the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, without having to change our money.We will be able to compare prices for products and services much more easily; it’s an enormous stepthat will give a major boost to competition and price transparency. In just over 100 days, companiesand organisations will be able to expand their markets and pursue their activities without having thecost and inconvenience of dealing with several currencies. In just over 100 days, Europeans will feel athome in many parts of Europe because, for the very first time, they will share the same banknotes andcoins.The general public sometimes does not realise that the euro has existed as a currency since1 January 1999. The euro is already OUR money. Whenever we buy something with current nationalbanknotes of the euro area, we are in fact already paying in euro.The introduction of the banknotes and coins represents an unprecedented logistical challenge for allparties involved; almost 15 billion banknotes and around 50 billion coins are being produced and themajor part will be distributed, first to the banking sector and then to the retail sector before reachingthe public. These two steps, known respectively as frontloading and sub-frontloading, started on1 September and entail a gradual supply of euro banknotes and coins to different sectors of theeconomy in order to make the process as smooth as possible. Of course, there will be a considerabledemand for euro banknotes from outside the euro area and therefore we have adopted generalprinciples and a guideline for the frontloading of euro banknotes to non-euro area residents. Mr. AnttiHeinonen, Director Banknotes at the ECB, will review the production and distribution of the eurobanknotes in more detail later this afternoon.
2BIS Review 77/2001On 30 August, I unveiled the seven euro banknotes and their security features at a press conferencein Frankfurt. The banknotes show windows, gateways and bridges – symbols of openness andcommunication. They reflect Europe’s artistic and architectural heritage and, at the same time, willhelp to promote a feeling of solidarity, to bring about new opportunities and to strengthen ties andtransactions between the nations of Europe.But transactions need to be trustworthy. The new banknotes include state-of-the-art security features,which will make the euro one of the world’s safest currencies. These features will provide reassurance:they will enable both the public and professional cash handlers to check the banknotes quickly andeasily. The needs of blind and partially sighted people have also been carefully considered: they willbe able to identify the banknotes with confidence. The seven euro banknotes differ in size and colour,and the value of the banknote is printed in large, bold numbers. This will make it easier for all of us torecognise the banknotes when they enter into circulation on 1 January 2002.Ladies and gentlemen, this will be a watershed in Europe’s history; it will be a unique event thatrequires our fullest support.It is crucial that we, the European Central Bank and the twelve national central banks of the euro area,do our utmost to ensure that euro banknotes and coins are well received by the public. A rapidacceptance will very much depend on how well we communicate about OUR money with “our” public.The more effectively we communicate, the more we will convince Europeans that Europe is not someabstract and remote idea, but an immediate and dynamic reality. The quality of the information weprovide will determine how well the public copes with the cash changeover and gets used todenominations that may differ from national ones.That’s why the Governing Council of the ECB has launched an information campaign. We have thesupport of Publicis, a communication agency which we selected for this historic task, and the nationalcentral banks of the euro area, which are implementing the information campaign and alsosupplementing it with their own euro-related communications at the national level.Our campaign covers the practical aspects of the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins.Moreover, it is aimed not only at people inside the euro area, but also at those outside it, such astourists, travellers as well as the citizens of countries where the predecessor currencies to the euro areused widely as parallel currencies. In order to reach such a broad public, the information campaignuses various groups and institutions as partners or “multipliers”. They include banks, retailers,educational institutions, the tourism industry and the media.I would like to highlight the key role these partners have played and are still playing. Here in Finlandand in the rest of Europe partners in the Euro 2002 Information Campaign from both the public andprivate sectors are contributing to this important communication effort by conveying information oneuro banknotes and coins to their staff, customers and other target groups. We have over2,600 organisations which have signed a partnership agreement with the ECB and the 12 nationalcentral banks of the euro area.I would also like to stress that the media are receiving special attention in the campaign. For them, wehave produced a total of six media kits, each marking a specific milestone in the countdown to theeuro.  These have been, and will be, distributed to more than 3000 media companies in the euro areain the course of 2001. The media kit marking today’s milestone, is E -100 [“e minus one hundred”], or100 days to go, and focuses on the final visual appearance of the euro banknotes and their securityfeatures. Furthermore, we are paying particular attention in the campaign to vulnerable groups whoneed and will receive tailor-made information and training.We have now reached the crucial period in terms of communication on the euro. Our mass mediacampaign, with TV and print adverts across the euro area and beyond, has just been launched. Thecommunication offensive will continue into the first weeks of 2002, when the changeover will be takingplace and people will have the euro banknotes and coins in their hands and pockets. They will then bemore receptive to messages about the euro.In Finland, you can watch our TV commercials for the very first time today, and see our print advertsas from 3 October. The creative concept here focuses on the positive spirit which comes from beingpart of a broad community with a single currency, and is reflected in the slogan, the EURO.OURmoney.Because we cannot afford to miss a single opportunity to inform three hundred million Europeans, twohundred million public information leaflets, in 11 languages, have been produced, enough for every
BIS Review 77/20013household in the euro area. The leaflet is entitled Getting ready for the euro, and shows the eurobanknotes, with details of the security features and of the changeover plan for each country. Theleaflet is tailored to the needs and circumstances of each country and will be distributed by thenational central banks through a variety of channels.I would also like to mention our initiative to help the children of the euro area learn about eurobanknotes and coins. Seven million posters, each including a competition designed to raiseawareness of the euro, will soon be sent to primary schools. The competition, which runs until mid-November, must be one of the largest ever held for children aged between 8 and 12 in Europe. Thelucky winners, our 24 “euro superstars”, two from each euro area country, will receive their prizes at anevent that will take place in Frankfurt on 31 December.Finally, let me turn to the ECB itself. It is still a young central bank just 3 years old. Its mandate is toguarantee price stability by conducting a single monetary policy for the 12 countries and 300 millionpeople in the euro area. The public perception of an institution sometimes differs sharply from, andeven oversimplifies, the complex reality. This is also the fate of the ECB. Its tasks are indeed complex,involving monetary policy decisions and operations, statistics, payment systems, legal issues, etc.However, its primary objective as laid down in the Treaty of the European Communities is very clear:price stability in the euro area, in other words, safeguarding the value of the euro banknotes and coinsand keeping inflation under control. Keeping control of inflation was and remains our main focus. TheECB has so far fulfilled its mandate successfully and aims to do so in the future for the benefit ofEurope’s citizens. Of course, the impact of the cash changeover on price developments in the comingmonths needs to be carefully monitored. Price transparency and market competition are likely to limitinflationary pressures stemming from the cash changeover. Still, I would like to appeal to all economicoperators, including governments, to strictly apply the rounding rules. We cannot afford such amomentous event to be overshadowed by unjustified price increases. Any increases would undermineconfidence in the euro and damage the credibility of those abusing the cash changeover in such away. The ECB is also asking the public to keep a close eye on prices during the changeover periodand is encouraging consumers and various organisations to follow up any – may I say – abuse of theoccasion.I am repeating myself, but it is important to be aware that on 1 January 2002 we are not introducingthe euro. The euro has been OUR money since 1 January 1999. What we are doing is introducing theeuro banknotes and coins. Then, for the very first time, twelve countries in Europe will be sharing onecurrency: the EURO.OUR money. Or, as you say in Finnish, EURO YHTEINEN RAHAMME.
BIS Review 77/20011Matti Vanhala: Old age, new economy and central bankingSpeech by Mr Matti Vanhala, Governor of Suomen Pankki (Bank of Finland), at a CEPR/ESIconference, Helsinki, 14 September 2001.*      *      *A shrewd title for the conference! You see, ”Old Age”, in its ambiguity, is meant to be the gracious wayto include central bank decision making, and the occasional central bank governor in thesediscussions. For this I am thankful. My colleagues in the Bank know that long ago Juha Tarkkaconverted me to the view that policy oriented research, and constant dialogue with other researchinstitutions, is increasingly important for us. The policy relevance of this particular conference iscertainly proof of this. In order to engage productively with the academic world, central banks have toallocate sufficient resources to research, and, as Juha Tarkka has argued in this institution, in order forsuch an effort to be worthwhile, the investment must be on a consistent, long term basis, and it mustbe strictly focused.I appreciate the privilege of being allowed to address this gathering.Coming to the topic of the conference, let me admit straight away that the more I read and hear aboutthe New Economy, the more my own interpretations shift towards the conclusion that the NewEconomy is neither unique nor new. Even the exuberant rate of return expectations and the relatedover-investment into itc in the second half of the 90’s seems a repetition of behaviour in connectionwith major technological advances in the past.As is to be expected from a central banker, I would certainly be very sceptical about monetary policydoctrines carrying New Age connotations. Nevertheless, the operating environment of monetary policyhas changed. But it has been a very gradual change, resulting at least as much from deregulation andinternationalisation as from the adoption of its technology. That process has been going on for a longtime, long before anyone had invented the ”New Economy”. From a monetary policy point of view thetwo important elements of that long term change are, in my view, first, that markets’ access to relevantinformation is identical to that of policy makers, in real time and with few exceptions; second, thattrading in financial markets has become (technically) ever more efficient and indeed on a globalizedbasis.Although most of this got under way long ago, it may be that on the official community startedadjusting to this change in the environment rather slowly, often reluctantly. Not least for this reason,the relatively recent prominence of credibility, transparency and accountability in research agendashas been such an important development. It had to emerge as a major issue in the wake of thechanged environment, and in the light of some painful regime failures in the early 90’s. The greateremphasis on price stability and the independence that in a great number of countries was thought tobe necessary for a central bank’s credibility and effectiveness certainly were an important elements inpromoting interest in accountability and transparency.I would not say that this globalized situation is a more difficult environment to cope with for a centralbank, but it is certainly different. It is a healthier situation in many repects. The very existence ofmarket anticipations and real time reactions is a powerful force tending to weed out what one mightcall ”rhetorical and political window dressing” from policy making. The real time flow of information byitself brings a kind of inevitable de facto transparence and at least a measure of accountability. It iseasy for the market to see and to assess economic policy in general and monetary policy in particular.This is a healthy development; after all, all interest and exchange rate policy impact households andcompanies in major way.Also the macroeconomic behaviour of economies changes, although in subtle and less easilyidentifiable ways.Some say that productivity growth has shifted the Phillips curve inward, in the US and perhaps insome other economies, possibly for a lengthy period, meaning that higher productivity growth wouldcoincide with – or could be made to coincide with - a widespread expectation of solid price stabilitycontinuing, allowing lower unemployment without fuelling inflation. – This would be an extremelyattractive prospect. But we really cannot judge whether, in what social and political circumstances, andwhere, this is at all likely. And where all would seem to turn out nicely, prudently we would have to
2BIS Review 77/2001assume that at some stage the constellation would turn around and real wage demands would catchup with productivity growth.What we do know is that every assumption about productivity growth, for the next few years at thevery least, will be uncertain, to say the least.This means that some of the standard pillars of policy debate, like output gaps and nairu’s, are eludingus. They may remain useful conceptually but are nevertheless neither quantifiable nor a priori stableenough to be useful when it comes to deciding responsibly on policy.And what about the transmission mechanism of monetary policy? We have identified a number ofchannels and effects, but how much do we really know about their relative importance in the kind offluid world in which we live – in that ”slice” of a constantly evolving constellation that we happen toinhabit at any given moment, with balance sheets, market structures, institutions, behaviour patternsshifting all the time. How much of the accumulated analytical research could possibly provide groundsolid enough to allow reasonable assessment of the likely consequences of alternative policy choices?Analytical work is advancing impressively on all fronts, but at the same time the world has gone into amode of continuous change.Thus there is probably less and less of theory that one could responsibly commit monetary policy to.Fortunately, as we take on board all these vagaries, at the same time we seem to be getting rid ofsome inconvenient ballast that perhaps looked a little bit too conspiratory for comfort, namely thenotion that unanticipated policy may reduce real disturbances. What a relief. Unanticipated policy isnot an enormously credible possibility in the kind of world into which we have been moving. Ambiguityis a poor policy to sell; it assumes an uninformed public and an uninformed professional market.Fortunately, we do not have that.All clearly specified monetary policy decision rules, like the popular Taylor rule along with all itsvariants, depend on reasonably solid knowledge about key inputs, one being the output gap, orequilibriu real interest rates, etc. My lay impression is that not much of that is available with the kind ofprobability that one would look for in public policy discussions.This means that the credibility of monetary policy cannot be based on a central bank locking itself in bymeans of a specific irrevocable commitment. The possibility of such locking in of the central bankfeatures prominently in analytical debate outside the central banking community, but it is probably anillusion, a will-o’-the-wisp? (Currency board regimes being a separate regime altogether, and I do notthink we are generally looking for last resort regimes.)All this is not a problem for the ECB in particular. It is a reality for all central banks operating in marketeconomies. This will be clear to those who have read Bob Woodward’s recent account of monetarypolicy making in the US in the 90’s. I suggest that it be read with professor Mankiw’s recent essay as acompanion.Whenever monetary policy really matters, i.e.. when the outlook is a cause for great concern, there isso much uncertainty in the air about current and future behaviour, including previous policy decisionsstill working themselves out in the pipeline. Any policy measure to be taken will overlap and interactwith many other past and future decisions.So there we are, pretty naked (or perhaps: naked, but not pretty).xxxObviously, so are those who analyse and comment on central bank policy. For that reason, thecommentary does not always advance our understanding of what would be a way forward. Thisapplies equally to criticism as well as the occasional approval.There is another reason: It is often difficult to precisely pinpoint the target and focus of a comment.Quite often a comment is not really about how the ECB conducts policy but about whether and howMaastricht should be changed. Often a desire to achieve a shift in the objectives of ECB policy isinvolved, away from the primary role of price stability.I am of course more interested in suggestions as to how we might best accomplish the task within ourmandate, by which we are bound. Of course the mandate may also be an interesting subject ofinquiry, but it belongs in a different compartment.
BIS Review 77/20013For the ECB, there can be no question about the primacy of price stability as an objective. The Treatyis very explicit on this point. Other possible objectives, including the exchange rate, are strictlysubordinated.I have some difficulty imagining how we would in practice pursue secondary objectives in parallel witha primary goal, having only an interest rate at our disposal. There would occasionally be scope to letthose secondary concerns weigh in the setting of rates, but it could never be anything systematic andconsistent. One wonders whether analytically a case can credibly be made for such on/off occasionalfine tuning of occasional objectives. In popular political debate, there are, as you know, constantdemands of this kind, so this is not an impertinent remark to make.Having expectations of low inflation, i.e. monetary stability, firmly in place is really irreplaceable inproviding the conditions for pursuing all those other policies immediately concerned with the realeconomy and human welfare. This is in my view no minor point.Getting expectations of monetary stability firmly is in itself an enormous job for monetary policy. Mypersonal prejudice is that, apart from good faith, transparency is more important than anything else.We cannot hope to forecast accurately. Nor can we be sure about the precise impact of our decisions.And since the public knows this, and is in any case more enlightened than we the establishment like tothink, it does not enhance credibility to pretend that we know everything and are always fully in control.It is enough, but then also very important, that the public knows that the central bank is not shy aboutadjusting its view as the facts change.Transparency clearly means different things to different people. To me, its essential content is that thebroad public has• clarity about the objective(s) of monetary policy• clarity about the central bank’s diagnosis of the economic situation and the outlook• certainty about the central bank’s determination to pursue consistently its declared objective.Communication then becomes quite important. Above all else, it has to be open, and it has to bedirected to a broad public, because this is where the expectations of price stability have to beanchored. It goes without saying that correctly guiding the “markets” is also important, but this is so forsomewhat different reasons, and it is a less difficult job. The financial markets are sophisticated in thisarea and I would claim, that whatever their posturing, they are rarely misled.Communication is an area where the ECB is often faulted by the media and the markets. This beingthe case, we should take it seriously, of course.But perhaps the critics are both right and wrong. It is not helpful if the public and the markets areconfused by what they perceive as possibly contradictory statements about the intents and reasoningin monetary policy, or if the information is too scant to allow the public to make an assessment of thepolicy. This is an area in which the ECB probably can and should improve.But there is also another angle to this. Every policy decision results from weighing a number of prosand cons. In the end a judgement is made. It is an unambiguous outcome that can and will becommunicated as it comes out from the discussion. But, it is also a fact that the pros and cons remain,along with the mass of partly contradictory indicators, as the basis of the decision. We shouldtherefore perhaps not be shocked if the members of the decision making body, in their efforts to “openup the decision” for the public by explaining the various considerations that went into it, use their ownwords and thereby risk being interpreted as representing different nuancings. It is self evident, anddesirable, that members of a decision making in the the area of public policy bring their own views tothe table, as the input for the process of coming to common decisions.Some of the central banks practising inflation targeting even publish summary minutes or votingrecords. Outside analysts have not been of the opinion that this would have reduced their credibility,quite the contrary. A relatively broadly based engagement with the media and the broad public is ahallmark of the ECB. This is in part due to its non-federal institutional basis. But it is also more in tunewith a world in which everyone who so wishes has equal and real time access to facts, information,analysis and forecasts, and in which we know that nothing, literally nothing but the trivial, is certain.In line with what I earlier set out regarding transparency, I believe in accepting and indeedencouraging open debate in all areas of public policy.
4BIS Review 77/2001So, even if some of the debate about the ECB’s transparency and its communication profile has beentongue in cheek, it is, as usual in an engaged debate, for a good cause, with great conviction and ingood faith.My personal conclusion from all this is that a devoted involvement on the part of the academiccommunity is highly desirable. If it is to weigh in public debate, it must of course be visible, which bythe way is important also as a counterweight to the populist brand of debate that tends to get moreattention.My second conclusion is that central banks, the Eurosystem central banks included, should considerown research as fundamental to their ability to participate in the shaping of policy and in the debate.Their involvement in the public debate is needed; otherwise the academic community has no one todebate with.
BIS Review 76/20011The Rt Hon Sir Edward George: Challenges confronting central banksSpeech by The Rt Hon Sir Edward George, Governor of the Bank of England, at the Centre forFinancial Studies Seminar, Frankfurt, 13 September 2001.*      *      *I thought that what I might do this evening is to talk about the challenges confronting central banks - inthe US, Japan, the eurozone and the UK in particular - and what can and what can't realistically beexpected of them in the face of those challenges.But I'd like to begin by discussing what it is that we are all trying to do. Let me start with our statutorymandates.The Federal Reserve's marching orders are to "maintain long-run growth of the monetary and creditaggregates commensurate with the economy's long-run potential to increase production, so as topromote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interestrates". The Bank of Japan Law prescribes that "currency and monetary control shall be aimed, throughthe pursuit of price stability, at contributing to the sound development of the national economy". Theprimary objective of the ESCB "shall be to maintain price stability"; but, without prejudice to thatobjective, the ESCB shall support the general economic policies in the Community, which, in turn aredesigned (inter alia) "to promote … sustainable and non-inflationary growth … and a high level ofemployment". And the Bank of England is similarly mandated to pursue "price stability as defined bythe (symmetrical) inflation target, and without prejudice to that objective to support the Government'seconomic policy, including its objectives for growth and employment".Now the exact words of these mandates differ - to varying degrees. What's more we all have our ownprocedures and processes - in terms of the composition of our decision-making bodies for example, orthe form and frequency of our policy meetings, or of our arrangements for public accountability. Andour approaches to fulfilling our mandates vary from one central bank to another - some of us, forexample, have a more precise target, or tolerance range, for inflation, or some provide a more explicitrole for monetary aggregates within the analytical framework and so on. And much is sometimes madeof these various differences. One can in fact spend many happy hours debating the finer pros andcons of one formulation as against another, and that can be a productive thing to do in pointing up theissues, though I think in the end my own conclusion is that circumstances alter cases - there's nounique best buy.But I think that we need in any event to be careful that in pointing up the differences between us wedon't exaggerate them. Because I have to say that in my experience - at a more fundamental level -we are all trying to do the same thing.The essential instrument of monetary policy - control over short-term interest rates operates, through anumber of different channels, certainly - on the demand side of our economies - primarily on domesticprivate sector demand. There is very little that monetary policy can do directly to influence thesupply-side capacity of our economies to meet that demand over time, which is what determines therate of growth that we can hope to sustain.Improving supply-side performance is therefore fundamentally important and hugely more complexthan overall macro-economic management of which monetary policy is a very important part. Oursupply-side performance is affected by the whole range of public policy decisions. It is affected, forexample, by the extent of free trade and market competition both nationally and internationally; by allforms of regulation, which have an important bearing among other things on the flexibility of goods andlabour markets. It is affected by the level and structure of taxation on the one hand and of publicexpenditure on the other. And perhaps most fundamentally it is affected by the attitudes, and thetechnical and entrepreneurial skills of the workforce and management which, in turn, dependsimportantly on education and training. Decisions in these areas often involve difficult politicaljudgements on how to strike the right balance between social and economic considerations. I shallhave no more to say about supply-side issues in my remarks, except to thank my lucky stars that I wasborn a central banker and not a politician.What in practice central bankers everywhere have to do is to try to keep aggregate demand growingconsistently over time broadly in line with the underlying, sustainable, rate of growth of supply. Andconsistently low inflation is essentially the measure of our success in achieving that. Yes, we are all
2BIS Review 76/2001aiming for effective price stability, certainly. But that is not simply a doctrinaire end in itself - as issometimes suggested, though not often here in Germany. It is a reflection, if you like, of our broaderaim of achieving macro-economic stability in the much wider sense of a sustainable balance betweenaggregate demand and underlying supply. Insofar as we succeed in that aim we can hope thereby tomoderate rather than aggravate cyclical fluctuations in the economy, and to remove much of thenominal uncertainty and related short-termism from economic decision-making. To that extent we canhelp indirectly to improve the supply-side performance of our economies. This is essentially thethought that underlies the universal central banker's mantra that "Price stability is a necessarycondition for sustainable growth", not to mention sustainable high levels of employment and risingliving standards, which are, of course, the really good things of macro-economic life.Now it is relatively easy to explain in these terms what we are trying to do. Actually doing it is a gooddeal harder!For a start we cannot directly observe or measure what is happening in an underlying sense on thesupply side with any great precision. We may become aware of short-run shocks relatively promptly,and we are able to draw inferences from partial information over time. But we can't be confident weknow just where the "target" is, and we will often need to approach it somewhat tentatively. And thereare equally uncertainties on the demand side as to just what is happening currently, or even more asto what is likely to happen in the period ahead. Nor can we know at all exactly just what the size of theimpact of monetary policy action will be, or the timescale over which it will have its full effect, in theparticular circumstances of any given situation. It has often been said that monetary policy is more ofan art than a precise science even though we all bring to bear as much economic science as we canmuster.There are particular difficulties in interpreting movements in asset prices, including exchange rates, letalone seeking to manage them through monetary policy. And even if we have a view about the assetprices we might like to see in the broader context of our monetary policy objectives, it is often veryhard to predict even the direction in which they might move, over even relatively long periods, inresponse to changes in interest rates. We necessarily take asset prices into account, both in ourforecasts and in our policy decisions, but insofar as we cannot influence them directly we have to besatisfied with seeking to offset their effects on demand and inflation through other channels of thetransmission mechanism. And the same is true, in a broader sense, of external demand shocks, whichnational or regional central banks cannot themselves directly affect, so that they must try tocompensate for them through offsetting changes in domestic demand growth. What all this means, inturn, is that the most monetary authorities can hope to achieve is to maintain overall macro-economicstability; we cannot pretend that this means stable conditions for every sector of the economy, still lessevery individual producer.Now let me be clear, I'm not pleading impotence! Monetary policy can have very powerful effects onoverall macro-economic stability. But it is important that the limitations of monetary policy - what it canand what it can't hope to achieve - are clearly understood. Otherwise expectations are likely to bedisappointed, and disappointed expectations may lead to building pressure for alternative policyactions, which may not in the event be in our longer-term economic interest.Against that - rather long-winded - background I turn to the uncertainties in the present worldeconomic situation.The major uncertainty, of course, relates to the situation in the United States - the world's largesteconomy - which had experienced a period of exceptionally strong economic growth with relatively lowinflation until the latter part of last year, which itself played a vital part in buoying up the whole worldeconomy through the Asian financial crisis. Briefly - and no doubt oversimply - this very strongperformance was made possible by developments on the supply side of the US economy in the formof exceptional productivity gains, as the application of new information and communicationstechnologies spread through the economy. This development - though extremely difficult to quantify -promised a higher sustainable rate of growth in the US economy and higher corporate earningsgrowth. That expectation in turn contributed to a rapid rise in equity prices, especially in the "high tech"sectors, which helped stimulate both business investment in the US and consumer demand causingthe private sector to move into financial deficit. It also attracted massive direct and portfolio investmentinflows from abroad which over-financed an increasing current account deficit in the US and causedthe dollar to strengthen against other currencies.But by the first half of last year the US economy was expanding at a rate of around 5%, which even onthe most optimistic view of underlying productivity growth was clearly unsustainable. The pace of
BIS Review 76/20013demand growth in the US needed to slow down - as of course it has, dramatically, to the point wheregrowth in the US in recent quarters has pretty well come to a halt.The big questions now are whether we are at the low point, and what might we expect in terms of thestrength of a recovery. And the reality is that no-one can be confident that they know the answers.What we do know so far is that there has been a sharp downwards inventory correction and acontraction of investment notably in ICT which was so buoyant before, with associated declines inequity prices and in US imports. Consumption growth, supported by a strong housing market has sofar held up rather better than might have been expected. Looking forward, on the positive side, onecould point to the strong monetary policy response to the slowdown, and to the recent tax rebate,which have yet to have their full effect. There were some suggestions in recent capital goods ordersfigures that the rate of decline in investment spending may now slow. And the rate of inventoryliquidation had stabilised pointing to a turn at some point so long as consumption continued to bereasonably well sustained. Consensus opinion, or so it seemed to me, had become modestlyoptimistic. At least that was the prospect until Tuesday and the appalling terrorist attacks in New Yorkand Washington.The immediate impact of those events was a sharp fall in already weak equity prices worldwide, andfears that the trauma would undermine confidence -including consumer confidence in the US, alreadyvulnerable to rising unemployment.Even before the terrorist attacks, the pessimist could point to the imbalances within the US economy,including the weakness of private sector savings, the overhang of past investment excesses, and theUS external deficit, which would, at some point, need to be corrected. On that view one couldenvisage a gradual adjustment over time in which case the US might face a protracted period of near-stagnation; or - if you were really pessimistic - the adjustments might be more abrupt, implying aperiod of negative growth and possible further financial instability. The tragic events on Tuesday willhave encouraged such pessimism.For what it is worth, while I recognise the downside risks, I remain - perhaps stubbornly - cautiouslyoptimistic.On the immediate situation, I was immensely impressed that the Federal Reserve and other USagencies have been able to keep essential payments and settlements services functioning as theyhave, which has allowed markets internationally to continue to function. And I was encouraged thatequity markets in Europe yesterday recovered some of their immediate losses. Of course it is muchtoo soon to assess the lasting impact of the events of the past two days. But the fundamental forcesaffecting the US economy have not changed. And in terms of confidence effects, it would be a mistaketo underestimate the resilience of the American people in the face of adversity. Either way I canassure you that the monetary authorities around the world are actively co-operating to minimise theimmediate damage, and that they will certainly be monitoring - continuously and very closely - theemerging evidence of more lasting effects. They will react to that evidence in the light of the likelyimpact on their own situation.The US slowdown came at a particularly bad time for Japan. Japan was already suffering from acombination of weak domestic demand - particularly consumer demand - and supply-side constraintsreflecting pressures on the banking system, heavily burdened with non-performing loans, as well as anacknowledged need for restructuring parts of the non-financial sector. Japan has pretty well exhaustedthe scope for macro-economic stimulus. Successive fiscal packages focussed on public works, and asustained period of attempted monetary expansion, at near-zero interest rates in the face of deflation,have failed to overcome a high rate of precautionary saving by an ageing population facing anuncertain economic future. The policy emphasis of the new Japanese administration appears to haveshifted towards firmer action to bring about supply-side reform in the belief that this will help toengender greater business and consumer confidence. The danger is that, to the extent that moreaggressive restructuring results in bankruptcies and higher unemployment in the short term, that initself might tend to weaken consumer demand for a time before the benefits of the restructuring comethrough. It is not clear to me at least that one can realistically expect much additional demand stimulusfrom monetary policy in these conditions, though no doubt the Bank of Japan is doing all that it can.Here at home the euro area economy seemed comparatively well placed to withstand the effects ofthe US slowdown. For most of last year it had performed relatively strongly, with overall output growthat above its longer term trend rate and unemployment in the area as a whole falling from its earlierhigh peaks.
4BIS Review 76/2001A problem, of course, was the recurrent weakness of the euro in foreign exchange markets, despiteapparently strong "fundamentals" in terms of any conventional analysis. This euro weakness seemedto be explained by an outflow of capital, much of it drawn into the US by the strong attraction ofprospective corporate earnings growth. I would be only too delighted if anyone here this evening couldexplain to me why the euro has not recovered more strongly than it has in the wake of the USslowdown!The euro's weakness in foreign exchange markets gave rise to widespread criticism of the EuropeanCentral Bank - not least in the British press, but also in some quarters here on the continent. Thatcriticism in my view was wholly unjustified. It was a classic example of expecting too much frommonetary policy. The role of a central bank is - as I said earlier - essentially to maintain overall macro-economic stability, and the measure of its success is consistently low inflation. On that criterion theECB has been substantially successful. The Euro area economy grew at above trend with coreinflation nevertheless remaining within the ECB's tolerance range of 0-2%, even though the headlinemeasure of inflation, influenced by rising energy and food prices which were essentially shocks on thesupply side, and by the weakness of the exchange rate, moved above that range. Had the ECBattempted during this period to target the exchange rate, presumably by raising interest rates, it is notat all obvious to me that it would have succeeded; and even if it had, the likelihood is that it wouldhave put the internal stability of the euro-zone economy at risk.More recently the ECB has sometimes been criticised as slow to respond to the weakening of the USeconomy. Implicit in that criticism no doubt is a strong conviction about the extent and duration of theUS slowdown and its likely impact on the euro area. As I have said there is in fact a great deal ofuncertainty about that.But the ECB has had to take account, too, of domestic demand pressures within the euro area, and ofthe fact that, even on the core measure, Euro area inflation was moving up gradually to the top of theECB's 0-2% range. Frankly I don't see how anyone can be confident whether the ECB had it preciselyright or wrong - it is perfectly normal for even the best-informed people to disagree on thesejudgements, as anyone who reads our own Monetary Policy Committee meeting minutes will tell you.But I am wholly confident that the ECB is sensitive to the issues surrounding those judgements,including the downside risks in the US, as indeed it demonstrated a fortnight ago.So, too, are we in the United Kingdom. In our case, we again enjoyed relatively steady overalleconomic growth through last year, combined with a further fall in unemployment to its lowest rate forover 25 years. Inflation meanwhile continued to run below the Government's 2½% target - and iscurrently running at around 1½% on the eurozone measure of inflation. This relatively low inflation ratewas partly a result of the dampening effect of sterling's surprisingly persistent strength against theeuro. The problem for us - and it is a real problem which has been with us for some time now - is thesectoral (and associated regional) imbalance within our overall economy. The domestically-orientedsectors have, for the most part, been doing relatively well, whereas those sectors that are exposed tointernational competition, particularly within or from the Euro area, have been under considerablepressure. And that pressure on the internationally exposed sectors has of course intensified with theslowdown both in the US and in the euro area.Understandably in these circumstances we too have been criticised, by many in the suffering sectors,for being slow to respond. They point to the fact that inflation has been consistently below what isintended to be a symmetrical target for the past two years, and they assume that had interest ratesbeen lower over that period so, too, would the exchange rate. They sometimes, also, find it difficult tounderstand why, when our inflation rate is lower than in the Eurozone, and the US, our interest ratesare higher.In fact, the undershoot of the inflation target has been marginal over the past two years - averagingless than ½% and we tend to argue that - given all the uncertainties - it is unrealistic to suppose thatwe could get much closer to the target than that; we point out, too, that sterling has actuallystrengthened against the euro since the beginning of the year even though we have reduced ourinterest rate relative to that of the ECB. Our higher level of interest rates we explain as a reflection ofthe fact that we continue to operate closer to capacity than elsewhere and with a tighter labour market.I'm not sure that our critics are convinced, let alone mollified! But I do find it encouraging that theycontinue for the most part to support the policy objective of continuously low inflation even if from theirperspective we are too rigorous in our pursuit of that objective!We have in fact reduced interest rates by ¼% on four occasions so far this year. What is disappointing- both to us and our critics - is that while we have been able to compensate for the dampening effects
BIS Review 76/20015of external factors - the exchange rate and the global economic slowdown - by encouraging strongerdomestic consumption, we have not been able to alter the external environment itself, which is whatour critics in the suffering sectors would really like to see. We have in effect increased the sectoralimbalance rather than reducing it. That may seem like second best but it is as much as anyone canreasonably ask of monetary policy.Mr Chairman, I have gone on for too long and perhaps you will think that I have been overly-defensiveboth of myself and of my central banking colleagues. That was not my intention.My intention rather was to explain what can and what cannot reasonably be expected of monetarypolicy in the present world economic situation. There are no easy or quick answers to the problems weare facing - and I'm tempted to say that if anyone thinks that there are then they probably don'tunderstand the questions! But I am confident that persisting in our parallel attempts to maintain macro-economic stability in our respective currency areas provides the best way forward for the worldeconomy as a whole. But it may be a somewhat bumpy road.
BIS Review 76/20011Christian Noyer: The stability-oriented monetary policy of the ECBLuncheon speech by Mr Christian Noyer, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, at theconference organised by HSBC CCF Securities, Paris, 6 September 2001.*      *      *Ladies and Gentlemen,I am very grateful for your invitation to speak today in Paris on the occasion of the forum organised byHSBC. As a contribution to today's discussion of strategies, I should like to explain the design of themonetary policy strategy of the ECB and how it helps the Governing Council of the ECB in itsmonetary policy deliberations and the communication with the public. Then, I should like to discuss thecurrent monetary and economic situation and its implications for monetary policy. Finally, I would liketo give you some information on the introduction of the new banknotes and coins.Let me turn to the monetary policy strategy of the ECB. The primary objective of the ECB is tomaintain price stability in the euro area. This objective has been chosen because price stabilitysupports higher living standards through a number of channels. It enhances the transparency ofrelative prices and thereby fosters competition. Inflation risk premia that would be asked for byinvestors in the presence of uncertainty about inflation are minimised. Firms and individuals do notneed to heavily invest in hedging against inflation and deflation, and thus can allocate their resourcesto productive uses. In an environment of price stability possible distortions of tax systems are reduced.The related improvement in the efficient allocation of production factors may help to enhance theproduction potential of the economy. Also from a social point of view, inflation is not welcome. It leadsto a 'random' redistribution of wealth between economic actors, to the detriment of the mostvulnerable.Since the start of 1999, the ECB applies its monetary policy strategy, which is centred around aquantitative definition of price stability and the analysis of risks to price stability. This monetary policystrategy has helped the Governing Council to derive and explain monetary policy decisions. It hascontributed a lot to the successful mastering of this task and has triggered academic debates whetherelements of this strategy should be introduced by other monetary authorities.The key element of the ECB's policy framework is the precise quantitative definition of price stability. Itclarifies that the Governing Council aims to keep annual increases in the Harmonised Index ofConsumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area below 2%. Moreover, the Governing Council announcedthat price stability according to this definition shall be maintained over the medium term. Thereby, itprovides the public with clear guidance for inflation expectations. In addition, the ECB's transparentframework facilitates the process of accountability of the ECB by providing a yardstick against whichits performance can be assessed.The statement that "price stability is to be maintained over the medium term" acknowledges theexistence of short-term volatility in prices, resulting from non-monetary shocks to the price level suchas the effects of indirect tax changes or variations in international commodity prices. There are goodeconomic reasons why monetary policy should be oriented towards the medium term. Monetary policyaffects prices with "long and variable lags", so that a policy of fine-tuning the economy is, in practice,neither a viable nor a desirable option. It is evident that the ECB cannot be held responsible forshort-term shocks to the price level, since it has little control over them. Rather, assessing theoutcome of the monetary policy of the ECB over the medium term ensures a meaningful and genuineaccountability.Having a well-defined goal is vital. In addition, the ECB, like any other central bank, also requires ananalytical framework which facilitates the achievement of this goal. The ECB's strategy recognisesthat, in an environment of change and uncertainty, no single model or view of the world is likely to befully adequate to capture the ongoing economic processes and the implications for price stability.The need to adopt a diversified approach to analysing and assessing information in an uncertain worldwas a main reasoning behind the adoption of the ECB's two-pillar strategy. The distinct, yetmutually-reinforcing perspectives of a complex and changing environment provided by the two pillarsare the best tools with which the ECB can distil and master the information relevant for monetarypolicy-making.
2BIS Review 76/2001Under the first pillar, the ECB assigns a prominent role to money. A broad array of aggregates,ranging from M3 to its components and counterparts, notably credit, are analysed in order to assessthreats to price stability. Assigning a prominent role to money guarantees that the fundamentallymonetary origins of inflation will not be neglected in the analysis driving monetary policy decisions.The prominent role of money is signalled by the announcement of a reference value of 4½% for theannual growth of the broad aggregate M3. This reference value defines the rate of growth of M3 whichis consistent with price stability over the medium term. The ECB has from the start explained that it willnot react mechanistically to deviations of M3 growth from the reference value. Rather monetarydevelopments always have to be analysed carefully in order to assess the information content theyhave for future inflation. This is because the money - price link is in essence a medium-termrelationship, whereas short-term movements in monetary aggregates always have to be interpretedcarefully.In parallel, a wide range of other economic and financial indicators is assessed under the secondpillar, in order to extract additional information which is not contained in monetary data, and tocross-check the evidence obtained from assessing monetary developments. Analysis within thissecond framework is intended to reveal the impact of a host of factors on price developments in theshort to medium term, such as wage developments, fluctuations in commodity prices and exchangerates, confidence among consumers and producers, etc.Under the second pillar, macroeconomic projections based on conventional models also play a role asa tool for organising and summarising existing information. In the light of the ECB's commitment tobeing a transparent institution, the ECB has published the Eurosystem staff macroeconomicprojections since last December. However, the analysis carried out under the second pillar does notonly involve the production of projections. The staff projections cannot, in practice, include the latestdevelopments in all economic indicators. It is therefore useful to monitor individual indicators in parallelwith producing the projections, not least because such analysis also provides an insight into the forcesdriving the projections. Moreover, under the second pillar of the ECB's strategy, the Governing Councilalso evaluates indicators of financial market expectations derived from financial yields and prices. TheGoverning Council also looks at forecasts for the euro area produced by international organisationsand the private sector. All this information is assessed simultaneously by the Governing Council underthe second pillar, and is complemented by the monetary analysis under the first pillar.In the discussions leading to its policy decisions the Governing Council systematically incorporates theanalyses conducted under both of the complementary pillars underlying the ECB's monetary policystrategy. It should be regarded as a strength of the strategy that multiple frameworks are embodiedand the resulting need for decisions which are robust across different models of the economybecomes obvious.A good understanding of the ECB's monetary policy in public enhances the effectiveness and fostersthe credibility of the ECB's monetary policy. Experience collected over the time since the start of StageThree of EMU suggests that the anti-inflationary credibility of the ECB is high. Indeed, long terminflation expectations have remained in line with price stability since early 1999.Finally, let me briefly explain the Governing Council's assessment provided under the two pillars of theECB's monetary policy strategy.As regards the first pillar, growth in monetary aggregates has somewhat picked up in recent months.In the period May to July, the three-month moving average of M3 growth was 5.9%. However, thisfigure needs to be corrected for the upward distortion related to non-euro area residents' holdings ofmoney market paper and short-term debt securities by non-residents of the euro area. According topreliminary estimates, these factors explain around three-quarters of a percentage point of annual M3growth. Furthermore, the recent move in this figure is driven very much by the effects on moneydemand of some factors which are likely to remain temporary. First, the increase in the rate of growthof M3 over the past few months reflects a relatively flat yield curve and the recent weakness in stockmarkets, both of which made the holding of short-term deposits and marketable paper included in M3attractive. Second, as it also reflects the fact that consumers needed a higher level of transactionbalances to finance the past rise in energy and food prices, recent increases in M3 growth may betransitory and, hence, do not necessarily have implications for price stability in the medium term.Lastly, the annual rate of growth of loans to the private sector, although still high, has continued todecline over recent months.
BIS Review 76/20013As regards the second pillar, there are clear signals of lower inflationary pressure from the demandside. Recent data on economic activity indicate that real GDP growth in 2001 will most likely be lowerthan was expected a few months ago. The deceleration reflects both the global slowdown, which hasaffected euro area exports, and weaker than expected consumption growth owing to losses in realdisposable income related to past increases in consumer prices. All these factors also had a negativeimpact on investment. This notwithstanding, over time, the expected decline in consumer priceinflation, to which the strengthening of the exchange rate has contributed, should support the growthof domestic demand. Further positive effects on euro area economic growth are expected from the fullimpact of tax reductions in several euro area countries and the favourable financing conditions.Turning to price developments, annual consumer price inflation in the euro area, as measured by theHarmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), declined to 2.8% in July, from a peak of 3.4 % in May.A concern with regard to the outlook for price stability in the coming years has been the possibleemergence of second-round effects, via wages, on the current level of consumer price inflation. Theinformation available shows that wage moderation prevailed in the first quarter of 2001. At the currentjuncture, two factors support the view that this downward trend will continue in future. First, theslowdown in economic activity may contribute to containing inflationary pressure stemming from thelabour market. Second, there are encouraging signs, such as those coming from data on consumerand producer prices, which confirm that the increase in consumer price inflation was temporary. In theabsence of further unfavourable price shocks, it is likely that price stability will be restored in the nottoo distant future.Against the background of lower inflationary pressure, the Governing Council decided on30 August 2001 to lower the minimum bid rate on the main refinancing operations and the interestrates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility by 25 basis points respectively. Itemphasised that it considers the new level of interest rates as compatible with the maintenance ofprice stability over the medium term, which at the same time, is an essential contribution to creating afavourable environment for sustainable economic growth.At this juncture, let me also make some remarks about recent discussions on fiscal policy. For theeuro to be successful, governments need to adhere strictly to the Stability and Growth Pact andachieve a budget position in balance or surplus. Under the present circumstances, the automaticstabilisers should only be allowed to work fully in those countries whose budget positions haveachieved this sustainable level. Let me emphasise that a medium-term perspective is essential for theconduct of fiscal policies in all euro area countries. Short-term discretionary measures aimed atstrengthening domestic demand risk having an unwelcome impact on the economy, not least onaccount of time lags. In addition, if such measures are not consistent with the Pact, they mayundermine the credibility of the consolidation process.Let me turn to the introduction of the euro. With the forthcoming introduction of euro banknotes andcoins, it is sometimes forgotten that Europe has had a single currency since 1 January 1999.Therefore, let me recall that today most cash-less transactions in the euro area involve the euro as acurrency (with the exception of retail payments). The euro is present on all major financial marketsaround the globe. Currency trading in euro has been going on for two and a half years. Shares aredenominated in euro on most European stock exchanges. The next and final step will be theintroduction of euro-denominated banknotes and coins on 1 January 2002.The introduction of the new euro banknotes and coins is the final step which completes the creation ofthe single currency. With this changeover, the considerable benefits of the single currency will becomeapparent to European citizens. A natural advantage of the single currency is that it reduces transactionand information costs in the euro area. It enhances the function of money as a medium of exchangeby lowering the costs typically associated with market transactions. Generally speaking, money is animportant component of any market economy. In a complex exchange economy, money is animportant means of achieving decentralised co-ordination between the plans and actions of economicagents across time and space. The function of money as a medium of exchange is significantlyenhanced by enlarging the area in which a single currency is used as legal tender not least since thiseliminates exchange rate uncertainty within the currency area.The introduction of the new euro banknotes and coins in the euro area, which comprises around300 million citizens, is in many respects a huge challenge. First, the launch of the euro banknotesrequires an initial supply of about 14.25 billion banknotes – representing a value of around €641 billion– to be available by a fixed deadline. Second, the banking sector, security carriers, retailers and thecash-operated machine industry are closely involved in the preparations at an early stage, as a
4BIS Review 76/2001smooth cash changeover can only be achieved in a short period of time by systematic andco-ordinated interaction on the part of all the main participants. Third, the successful introduction ofeuro cash is preceded by a goal-oriented information campaign to prepare the general public andprofessional cash handlers in Europe for the new currency. The President of the ECB launched thiscampaign on 30 August and at the same time presented the details of the new banknotes to thepublic. This new currency which will be in some 100 days' time in our pockets, is our money, a tangiblereality and a symbol of European integration in every sense of the word. The euro banknotes areproduced with state-of-the-art security standards and combine many of the highly effective securityfeatures already used in the national banknotes of the euro area Member States together with someadditional features. Finally, a series of legal and organisational measures is being taken to ensureboth a successful currency changeover and unimpeded circulation in the future. Production of the eurobanknotes started in July 1999. The euro banknotes are currently being produced by 15 differentprinting works throughout Europe, including the printing works of a number of national central banks(NCBs).The role of the ECB can be described as that of a central co-ordinating, controlling and monitoringbody, focusing in particular on the timely production of the euro banknotes and on the organisation ofthe changeover. Let me emphasise that both production and delivery of euro banknotes are onschedule. In most countries frontloading and sub-frontloading of euro banknotes and coins hasalready started and is well under way. Frontloading is the advance distribution of euro banknotes andcoins to those credit institutions that are counterparties for monetary policy operations within theEurosystem. Credit institutions can then sub-frontload euro banknotes and coins to professionalgroups (retailers, cash-in-transit companies, the cash-operated machine industry) provided that certainconditions are fulfilled. The most important condition is to guarantee that the euro banknotes will notbe put into circulation before 1 January 2002.Thank you for your attention.
BIS Review 75/20011Lars Heikensten: The Swedish krona and monetary policySpeech by Mr Lars Heikensten, First Deputy Governor of Sveriges Riksbank, at a seminar of CréditAgricole Indosuez, held in Stockholm on 5 September 2001.*      *      *Over the past year the Swedish krona has weakened markedly. Both we at the Riksbank and otherplayers in the currency market have been surprised by this. In that the exchange rate is an importantfactor in our assessments of future inflation, it also plays a part in the direction of monetary policy. Thefact that, for the first time in years, the Riksbank has intervened in the currency market has alsocontributed to the recent heightening of attention on the exchange rate.Today I shall first endeavour to clarify the krona’s role in the Riksbank’s intellectual framework formonetary policy. A policy that targets inflation requires us to forecast the exchange rate, which is mynext theme and by no means an easy task. In that context I shall also say something about theRiksbank’s view of the krona’s long-term real equilibrium exchange rate and its course in the pastyear. Another question I shall be considering is how exchange rate movements affect inflation. Beforeconcluding, I will also talk a bit about interventions and transparency - a topic that has featured in thedebate since we took the decision in June.The krona’s role changed in the 1990sIn the period since the fixed exchange rate was abandoned the Riksbank has not targeted the level ofthe krona. For monetary policy the primary consideration is how inflation prospects relate to the2 per cent inflation target. But in the Riksbank’s assessment of inflation the exchange rate is, ofcourse, an important factor.Through producer and consumer prices for imported goods and services, the exchange rate has adirect effect on inflation that normally is comparatively rapid. Moreover, the exchange rate influencesinflationary pressure indirectly and usually with a longer lag via effects on the level of economicactivity. All else equal, a weaker exchange rate leads to stronger demand for Swedish goods andservices and thereby to rising resource utilisation. The exchange rate can also influence inflationexpectations indirectly, with effects in the first place on price setting.Since the Riksbank introduced the inflation target, our view of the exchange rate and inflation haschanged by degrees. In the early years with a flexible exchange rate, monetary policy was influenceda good deal in practice by short-run exchange rate fluctuations. The focus then shifted and today it isclearer that what matters for monetary policy is the entire path of the exchange rate and inflation in thecoming years.The monetary policy reaction to a shift in the exchange rate depends on the cause of the shift, itsperceived duration and the economic situation in general. Exchange rate movements are not to beconsidered as isolated events, neither should monetary policy’s reactions to them be mechanical. If adepreciation stems from an international slowdown, for example, the consequences for monetarypolicy will differ from a case where the roots lie in a lack of confidence in Sweden’s economic policy.The situation at the beginning of June can serve as an illustration. The problem was not simply thatthe krona was under-valued. That had been the case, though not so dramatically, for a long time.What led us to conclude that the situation was sufficiently serious to warrant action was a conjunctionof several factors. The depreciation occurred very rapidly and we had not received any newinformation that justified such a marked movement. That meant that the future, relatively optimisticpath for the krona on which monetary policy had been formulated now appeared less realistic. Thedepreciation was, moreover, particularly troublesome in that it coincided with a substantial price riseand accordingly heightened the risk of inflation expectations shifting to a rate of price increases thatexceeded the Riksbank’s target. The increase in inflation stemmed both from transitory factors andfrom persistently high resource utilisation.
2BIS Review 75/2001Forecasting exchange rates is difficultAs I said, it is the exchange rate’s path in the coming two years that is important for monetary policy.So how can one arrive at a picture of the exchange rate several years ahead? The central banks thattarget inflation can be said to have three main approaches.• One alternative is to assume that the exchange rate will be unchanged during the forecastperiod, quite simply to adopt a cut-off rate. This, however, raises a number of problems. Asexchange rates are liable to shift rather rapidly and the assumed rate is of considerableimportance for the forecast rate of inflation, this approach may entail sudden changes in theassessment of inflation and thereby in the repo rate. Another problem is the risk of beingtrapped in a game situation with the market. So there are sound reasons for not resorting toa more short-term pattern of reactions. Sooner or later, other central banks have generallycome to the same conclusion.• Another alternative is to base an exchange rate forecast on market pricing or otherassessments of market expectations. This approach, which is used by a number of centralbanks, reduces but does not eliminate the risks associated with rapid fluctuations andspeculation. Another problem here is that the picture of expectations is liable to vary withhow they are measured. On the other hand, this approach has the advantage of presumablybeing most credible in the eyes of market players; it is, after all, based on their assessments!• The Riksbank has chosen a third alternative, which is to make an independent assessment.Here the initial position - the cut-off rate - is naturally one important component and so arethe market’s expectations. In addition, we consider other relevant information that isavailable, not least the exchange rate that can be said to be more fundamentally reasonable.Which of these three approaches is most appropriate - given that game situations and the risk ofsudden shifts could be disregarded - is not self-evident. Personally I cannot see why we should nottreat the exchange rate in much the same way as other forecast variables. We normally try to considerall the relevant information that can be gathered on a particular variable. It seems reasonable to do soin this case, too. Another matter is the considerable degree of uncertainty that surrounds virtually allforecast variables and particularly the exchange rate. That is why we also produce an assessment ofrisks. Our policy is then based on an overall assessment, including a valuation of the various risks.Exchange rate theoriesIt is often said that for the conduct of economic policy, the best help in practice is a good theory. In thecase of exchange rates, however, the relevant theories have not been particularly successful at eitherexplaining or predicting movements of the Swedish krona or other currencies in recent years.A basic difficulty with theories for determining exchange rates is the fact that an exchange rate is anominal price, whereas economic analysis is constructed to explain relative prices. For that reason,exchange rate analysis tends to focus on real rates, which in principle are defined as the basket ofgoods a particular country has to provide in order to obtain a given basket from abroad. In such anexpression for the real exchange rate, the numerator is usually written as the product of the nominalexchange rate and a suitable price index in foreign currency and the denominator as a suitabledomestic price index.A common approach is that the real exchange rate is constant. The term equilibrium is used here todenote internal balance with full employment and external balance with stable external debt. So with afixed real equilibrium exchange rate, the nominal exchange rate is ultimately determined by thecountry’s rate of inflation relative to inflation abroad. If inflation is lower in the rest of the world, thenominal exchange rate will depreciate so that the real rate remains constant. This is the doctrine ofpurchasing power parity. While it is the most common starting point for determining an exchange ratein the longer run, the theory is known to be rather poor at explaining nominal exchange rates in boththe short and the medium term.In practice the real equilibrium exchange rate is liable to be affected by many different factors, two ofwhich seem particularly self-evident.Terms of trade. Suppose that a country exports cars and imports wine. A deterioration in terms oftrade then means that the price of cars falls relative to the price of wine in a common currency. In
BIS Review 75/20013order to be able to sell more cars with a view to buying an unchanged quantity of wine and therebyleave the balance on current account unchanged, the country’s real exchange rate has to depreciate.Productivity growth. Suppose instead that the country becomes more efficient at manufacturing cars.This can lead to better quality cars for a given input of resources and a given price in the domesticcurrency. The cars can then command a higher price in the world market and the real exchange ratecan appreciate. In practice, high productivity growth tends to be associated with a higher potentialGDP growth rate. In a country where growth is higher than in the rest of the world, the real exchangerate can therefore be expected to show an appreciating trend. However, the relationship betweenproductivity growth and the exchange rate is not stable. Economic theory is not clear cut on this point -some lines of reasoning could lead to the opposite conclusion.An additional factor that is closely related to the real exchange rate is the balance on current account.A succession of current-account deficits leads to growing external debt and rising interest payments.The real exchange rate must then depreciate if the country is to achieve enough additional exports tofinance the interest payments.Besides these more fundamental explanations with links to the theory of purchasing power parity,there are numerous notions connected more or less closely with the flows in currency markets. Thenominal exchange rate is the price of a currency; like prices of other goods, this price is naturallyaffected from time to time by more or less temporary fluctuations in demand and supply. It isexplanations of this type that market players are most prone to put forward for short-run exchange-ratefluctuations.The most general flow-related explanation is probably the short-term interest rate differential.Textbooks teach that international currency flows and nominal exchange rates are susceptible todifferences in current and expected monetary policy. Today, when monetary policy throughout theindustrialised world is focused on price stability, so that interest rate differentials between countries aretending to decrease, the explanatory power of this variable is presumably weaker.Another factor that has been of major importance for nominal exchange rates from time to time is thestate of the government finances. High and growing government debt leads to expectations of asuspension of payments or a monetary policy realignment in a more inflationary direction. That in turnresults in a depreciation of the exchange rate.The picture in SwedenSince 1975 the Swedish krona has weakened in nominal terms by as much as 90 per cent. But atleast half of this depreciation can be explained by Sweden’s higher inflation. And in this respect therehas been a decisive change. We now have the same policy commitment to price stability as the rest ofthe world.That leaves around 40 per cent of the depreciation to account for. Our work at the Riksbank suggeststhat in the 1970s and ’80s, the major part of the real exchange rate’s weakening can be attributed todeteriorating terms of trade, low GDP and productivity growth compared with the rest of the world andgrowing external debt. One of the models we have used indicates that about three-quarters of thedepreciation stemmed from relatively poorer growth in Sweden and about a quarter to worseningterms of trade.The picture in the 1990s looks different. As far as we can tell at present, in the past decade neitherproductivity nor GDP growth has been poorer than in the rest of the world (Fig. 1). So in this respect,too, there seems to have been a change for the better. It is partly against this background that thekrona’s persistently weak average path in the latter part of the 1990s is surprising.
4BIS Review 75/2001In the more recent discussion in the media and on the markets, attention has focused on more specificflows. This discussion is not always completely accurate. One reason for this is that it is not theindividual flows, but rather the complete picture including all of the flows, various currency strategies,etc. that determines developments. We have little knowledge of the extent to which the players in theeconomy take exchange rate positions when they buy and sell various types of securities. We knowfrom financial theory that large fluctuations in financial prices can often occur without any connectionto large flows.Concern about the government finances can hardly have been a crucial factor in the latter 1990s.Neither is it probable that the short-term interest rate differential played a sizeable part, though aneffect at times cannot be ruled out.In the more recent discussion, attention has focused on more specific flows. There were periods lastyear, for example, when the paths of the Stockholm stock exchange and the Swedish krona wererather closely related. It looks as if the krona tended to fall when foreign investors quit the market. Thesizeable purchases of foreign securities by Swedish investors have a similar effect; recently, thesepurchases have mirrored the opportunities provided by the new pension system. Flows that arecomparatively small in this context have also been occasioned by the repayment of governmentexternal debt. At the same time, purchases of kronor have presumably decreased in that exportreceipts have fallen significantly for a number of large companies this year and big concerns haveincreased their cash holdings in foreign currency accounts.Moreover, in recent years increased unrest in the international financial markets has tended to hit theSwedish krona; this was particularly evident during the financial crisis in autumn 1998. It seems to bea consequence of a generally heightened aversion to risk in the major financial centres, such as NewYork and London. Money is then withdrawn from countries whose currencies and economies took abeating in similar situations in the past; since the crisis in the early 1990s Sweden is unfortunatelyincluded in this category even though the current macroeconomic situation does not warrant this.Finally, the generally stronger dollar should be mentioned as a partial explanation for the weak krona.Many economists consider that according to conventional theory the dollar’s strength is inexplicableand the dollar is markedly over-valued. In this situation the Swedish krona, like most other currenciesin the OECD area, has depreciated against the dollar.One problem with explanations of this kind is that they come and go. It is also easy to show that theylack universal validity. One currency’s depreciation is attributed to a heavy dependence oncommodities at the same time as another’s is said to stem from the opposite, for instance a large ITFig 1. TCW index and expected growthdifference against other countriesSources: Consensus Forecast and The Riksbank-1.5-1.0-0.50.00.51.01.5Mar-96Nov-96Jul-97Mar-98Nov-98Jul-99Mar-00Nov-00Jul-01110115120125130135140Sweden - TCW countriesdifference expectations/growthTCW index
BIS Review 75/20015sector. While the Swedish krona has been falling with the stock exchange, both the Swiss franc andsterling have appreciated, and so on. The explanations are therefore of little value for forecasting.Under these circumstances it has seemed to us that there are good reasons for attaching majorimportance to the available assessments of the krona’s more fundamental value. Many otherobservers appear to do the same when they predict an appreciating krona in the somewhat longer run.It is quite simply improbable that Sweden can continue to have large trade surpluses and, as aconsequence of an unduly under-valued currency, more profitable firms than the rest of the worldwithout this leading to a reversal of the occasional flows that have recently gone against the krona. Inforecasting work and monetary policy decision-making we then, as I mentioned earlier, have tocombine this assessment with risk scenarios, so that different risks, including the possibility of thekrona being weaker than in the main scenario, are weighed against each other.Smaller pass-through to consumer pricesAs I have indicated, the exchange rate concerns us because it influences inflation. Since 1993exchange rate fluctuations have been comparatively marked but the effects on price developmentshave been smaller than expected.Consumer prices for imported goods are dependent on a variety of factors. Besides exchange ratemovements, these include the development of world market prices and the level of resource utilisationin Sweden. The importance of domestic resource utilisation has to do, for example, with the fact thatmost imported goods are handled and processed in Sweden before reaching consumers and thatraising prices is generally more difficult when demand is weak.When we look back at the 1990s in order to draw conclusions about the future, all these factors haveto be born in mind. Let me cite a couple of examples.During 1994 and much of 1995 a comparatively weak exchange rate led to rising import prices but thepass-through to consumer prices was smaller than the Riksbank had anticipated. One explanation wasthat capacity utilisation turned out to be below the Riksbank’s assessment both because it wasoverestimated initially and because demand was weaker, partly as a result of the Riksbank’s interestrate hikes. Another explanation was the krona’s marked appreciation towards the end of 1995.In 1998 the krona weakened again in connection with the Russian crisis. On a 12-month basis thedepreciation amounted at most to about 10 per cent. Even so, import prices did not rise; on thecontrary, they actually fell a good way into 1999. This largely reflected the factor that triggered thecrisis: one of the largest price falls in modern times in commodity markets, including a barrel price ofoil down towards USD 10. The result was markedly decreased international export prices - theequivalent of our import prices.A factor that may have contributed to the exchange rate pass-through to consumer prices beingsmaller after the Asian and Russian crises is that importers turned away from traditional tradingpartners in the United States, for instance, in favour of countries whose currencies have notappreciated against the krona. Our imports from Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia, for example,have increased markedly since 1995.It is conceivable that the krona’s depreciation at the time of the Asian and Russian crises has beenexaggerated because the TCW index measures the exchange rate against the most importantindustrialised countries and uses weights based on export and import shares from 1989-90. In order tothrow light on this, we have constructed a simple, broader preliminary import-weighted index thatcovers 44 countries. The results again show that the krona was weak in 1998 and 1999 but not asweak as the TCW index indicated. One reason why the exchange rate pass-through to consumerprices became smaller than expected may have to do with changes in the composition of imports.There are, however, also reasons for supposing that the krona’s direct pass-through to inflation hasdecreased. Simple estimations indicate a marked reduction in the early 1990s, followed by somefurther fall (Fig. 2). A variety of factors may have contributed to this.• Exchange rate movements, upwards or downwards, may now be perceived as a moretransient phenomenon, whereas the devaluations under the fixed exchange rate regimewere regarded as more permanent. If importers expect a price change to be temporary, theywill no doubt be more prone to absorb the exchange rate fluctuations in their profit margins.That this may have been the case is indicated by some preliminary studies.
6BIS Review 75/2001• Generally increased confidence in the low-inflation regime may also have tended to reducethe exchange rate’s pass-through to inflation. More stable expectations about future inflationshould make prices less volatile.• During the 1990s, moreover, competition in the Swedish economy has generally increased,for instance as a consequence of EU membership, continued tariff cuts, the reduction ofother barriers to trade and deregulation of the domestic economy. Increased IT trade and theadvent of new low-cost producers have had a similar effect. Although such changes are ofthe one-off type, in the past decade they have affected a series of markets and therebypresumably had a more protracted effect on the aggregate price level.The conclusion from all this is that the pass-through from the exchange rate to consumer prices hasprobably decreased. At the same, this conclusion should not be taken too far, so that the tendency isassumed to be permanent. As we have seen, there have been periods when the rate of priceincreases for imported consumer goods has been held back by other factors than just an alteredexchange rate pass-through.In a situation where resource utilisation is high, a weakening of the exchange rate is no longerperceived as transient and favourable one-off effects have ceased to act, the pass-through fromexchange rate movements can be larger than what we have observed in recent years.Currency interventions and transparencyBefore concluding, I would like to say something with reference to the discussion that arose inconnection with the Riksbank’s currency interventions in June.First I should underscore that for a number of years now we have taken great pains to be as open andclear about monetary policy as it is possible to be. I have no qualms about claiming that during thepast five years we have become one of the world’s most transparent central banks. What we haveachieved in this respect is something of a cultural upheaval. The most recent step, in spring 1999, wasthat we began publishing the minutes of the new Executive Board’s monetary policy meetings. As Ihave explained in other contexts, transparency and clarity serve several purposes. They can enhancemonetary policy’s credibility and legitimacy. They can also make monetary policy more predictable. Inmy opinion, moreover, they have had a favourable effect on the Riksbank’s internal atmosphere andefficiency.Fig 2. Exchange rate impact onconsumer prices0.000.050.100.150.20Jan-84Jan-85Jan-86Jan-87Jan-88Jan-89Jan-90Jan-91Jan-92Jan-93Jan-94Jan-95Jan-96Jan-97Jan-98Jan-99Jan-00Jan-010.000.050.100.150.20Recursive estimations of TCWcoefficients lagged 3 quartersSource: The Riksbank
BIS Review 75/20017As regards currency market interventions, we should likewise naturally aim to be as open and distinctas possible. The arguments about credibility and legitimacy apply here as well. There is also reason tobelieve that interventions will be more successful if they are perceived as a monetary policy signal,with information about the central bank’s assessment of price developments and thereby the futurepath of the instrumental rate.When the Riksbank intervened last June we made a point of demonstrating that the measure’s contextwas monetary policy. The measure was announced and communicated in speeches by UrbanBäckström and myself. At the time of the first intervention, moreover, the Executive Board issued apress notice and Urban Bäckström took part in a broadcast interview in which a good deal of time wasdevoted to this issue.The degree of openness was also substantial in the sense that we informed our counterparties thatthe interventions had been made and confirmed this when questions were asked. Moreover, the sizeof the interventions could be calculated later from the weekly publications of the Riksbank’s balancesheet. So on this occasion we were more transparent and distinct than is customary with currencyinterventions, compared both with our earlier record and with most other central banks.We did, however, depart from the customary procedure in one respect. The Executive Board’smonetary policy decisions are normally recorded in separate minutes that are published about afortnight later. We have chosen not to publish any minutes after the interventions. This is primarilybecause, as a monetary policy instrument, the effective implementation of interventions is aconsiderably more complex matter than a repo rate decision. As you know, a central bank does notcontrol the currency market in the same way as the market for overnight loans. By setting the reporate, the Riksbank determines interest rates in the market, whereas in currency interventions theRiksbank is one of many players. Releasing information that might weaken the Riksbank’s marketposition is therefore a problem.Preparations for a currency intervention normally include, for example, a strategy for the intervention’ssize, the criteria for how and when the interventions should be made, the choice of currencies,deliberations about counterparties and contacts with other central banks. In my view, it would notunder normal circumstances be reasonable to publish this type of operative deliberation. That mightprejudice the possibility of achieving the approved or envisaged goal.Another question concerns the Executive Board’s position on the publication of minutes when theBoard’s discussion has more to do with matters of principle, including information about the views ofindividual members. This, too, is a complex issue because information of this type can also affect theeffectiveness of the measures that are taken. One possibility I consider worth testing would be to waitfor some months before the Board evaluates the measures comprehensively and publishes moredetailed minutes. This, in any event, is a matter to which the Board intends to return later this autumnwith the aim of establishing a procedure for preparing these matters and providing information aboutthem in ways that are appropriate to the current exchange rate regime. At the same time, it should beunderscored that the arrangements we lay down will not be set in concrete. There must be somelatitude for unforeseen circumstances. It is worth mentioning that when the Executive Board came intobeing in January 1999 and chose to work with public minutes, the interval before they were publishedwas comparatively long, 6 to 8 weeks. Since then it has proved possible to reduce the lag to only afortnight without giving rise to serious detrimental effects.ConclusionThe main message in my address today has been that in the current monetary policy regime theexchange rate ought to be regarded mainly as one of a number of forecast variables. The problemhere is that, like other currencies, the Swedish krona is difficult to forecast in the time perspective thatis relevant for monetary policy, namely a couple of years ahead. The situation is complicated,moreover, in that the exchange rate is a variable that in certain situations monetary policy canconceivably affect directly. We try to use all the available information in order to arrive at our forecast.At the same time, the monetary policy decision is reached in the light of other, alternative paths for theexchange rate.In the course of the last three decades the krona has depreciated. The main causes have beenSweden’s higher inflation and lower growth. Since the realignment of Sweden’s economic policy in theearly 1990s, these factors no longer apply.
8BIS Review 75/2001The fact that, on average, the krona has been under-valued in the 1990s has not posed such largeproblems for monetary policy as might have been expected. Various factors have helped to limit thepass-through to inflation. However, some of these factors cannot be seen as permanent. For instance,resource utilisation is likely to be higher than during the decade that followed the crisis of 1990-92.Interventions are an instrument the Riksbank has used very sparsely in recent years. Today I haveonly commented very briefly on our reasons for acting in the early summer. I have had more to sayabout my view of transparency in connection with interventions. Although, as usual in the context ofmonetary policy, there are grounds for striving for a high degree of openness and clarity, thecomparison with repo rate decisions does not really hold. In the case of currency interventions theRiksbank is a minor player and it is difficult for our ambitions to have an impact. This must be borne inmind in the autumn when we establish a procedure for preparing for and informing about currencyinterventions.
BIS Review 75/20011Ernst Welteke: The Bundesbank’s view on the world economySpeech by Mr Ernst Welteke, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the Annual Members’ Dinnerof the Financial Services Industry Association in Dublin, on 4 September 2001.*      *      *ILadies and gentlemen!For a true European Dublin today is a great place to be. Ireland has shown the most spectacularcatching-up process in the EU. It is all the more impressive as Ireland lies geographically on the edgeof the EU. The favourable starting conditions created by the advent of the common currencyframework were helpful in this respect. Economic and political convergence make for an ever-strongereconomic entity in Europe.Great challenges are ahead for us. We are on the eve of the physical introduction of the singleEuropean currency. And we are in the process of negotiating the access of new EU members, most ofthem much less wealthy than the current member states.The euro area is the second-largest economy in the world. Right now, we find ourselves in anenvironment of slowing global growth. Increasingly, the global markets have brought the strains in theworld economy to our doorstep, faster and with more thrust than at first expected. We do not blamethe markets, though. On the contrary, we are glad to see the financial markets in Europe evolvingrapidly. In this regard, the euro is important. The single currency both facilitates and acceleratesintegration. And with the financial markets becoming ever-more complicated, financial supervisors arefaced with a challenge. In Ireland, as well as in Germany, a debate on how best to design prudentialsupervision is taking place.IILadies and gentlemen!The development of the Irish economy is indeed impressive. Most of the catching-up took place in thesecond half of the 1990s. Since 1994, Ireland has been the fastest-growing country in the EuropeanUnion with an average real growth rate of eight percent a year. More than half of the growth occurreddue to an increase in capital and labour inputs. Employment growth was the highest in the EU. Theunemployment rate has fallen by nearly ten percentage points during this period. With employmentconditions being that favourable, Ireland now sees net immigration.Ireland is the only EU country that has consistently seen double-digit growth in private investmentsince 1994. Productivity has thus risen faster than in most EU countries. Ireland is now among themost productive countries in the EU. Last year, GDP per worker was 15 percent above the EUaverage.Foreign direct investment has been important in financing the Irish boom. Inward direct investmentnearly tripled between 1998 and 2000. The major part originated outside the EU; the US alonecontributed three-quarters. Ireland is now a favourite location for enterprises trying to gain a foothold inthe EU.These impressive developments have improved living standards considerably, GDP per capita inIreland is 117 per cent of the EU average. As productivity increases, however, the need forsubsidisation should decrease in step. The Irish boom owes much to funds allocated by the EuropeanUnion. For the period 2000-2006, Ireland will be granted a total of 4.2 billion euros via both theStructural Funds and the Cohesion Fund. Well, I just mentioned this fact to complete the picture.The flip side of the impressive catching-up process in Europe can be seen in what is recognised as alack of economic convergence. And, most often in view of the national inflation rate, Ireland is beingcited as an example.
2BIS Review 75/2001Well, then, what exactly is meant by “convergence”? The term is one with many facets. The Treaty ofMaastricht set out to measure nominal convergence. You remember the fiscal and monetary criteria:inflation rate, capital-market rates, sustainable fiscal policy and exchange-rate stability.The Maastricht criteria were subject to heated debate in academia, as well as in policy circles. By nomeans are they mere history. On the contrary, they are very much alive. They are to be applied whenfurther countries join the euro-currency area, be it the pre-ins like the UK or the accession countries.The Maastricht criteria, however, are in a way both “stability criteria” and “convergence criteria”. Theyensure that a country is not pursuing policies that might impinge adversely on the stability of thecommon currency. In the longer run, such stability must be built on economic integration. An extensivebody of theory has evolved on the characteristics of optimum currency areas. Central criteria areflexibility for wages and prices as well as mobility for goods, labour and capital. Most of these criteriacall for a high degree of structural convergence. Market integration is crucial in this respect.Under the common currency framework, market integration is deepening. It is already well advancedin trade in goods and services, and in financial markets. The labour market is lagging somewhatbehind. In this respect, Ireland looks like being in a somewhat difficult situation. Labour mobility ishampered by being an island on the edge of the common currency area. Furthermore, Ireland’sneighbour and most important trading partner, the UK, has not yet joined the euro.Apart from structural and nominal convergence, there is real convergence - a term I use here in thesense of synchronicity of business cycles. Real convergence is of importance in a currency union,because all the countries in the union are subject to the single monetary policy. The GoverningCouncil of the European Central Bank designs monetary policy to fit the euro area as a whole. Acountry whose business cycle gets completely out of step might therefore suffer from an individuallyinadequate monetary policy. However, marching in absolute lock-step is not necessary, as can beseen in the US, where certain regions grow faster than others.During recent years, Ireland has been growing considerably faster than, for example, Germany. Thefaster growth is due mainly to catching-up, and to the still incomplete synchronicity of the Anglo-Saxonand the continental business cycles. Irish economic growth derived additional impetus from the start ofthe European Monetary Union. Interest rates in Ireland were effectively cut by three percentage pointson January 1, 1999.That sort of extra stimulus sent real interest rates to a historic low and boosted demand. Fiscal policy,the instrument to cushion such monetary shocks, was tightened. However, with the fiscal surplusbeing already large, this tightening did not prevent inflation from starting to rise in late 1999.Considering the facts that led to this situation, does it really indicate a lack of the necessaryconvergence? I don't think so. A major part of the excess inflation is accounted for by the catching-up,and by the one-off effect of the start of the common monetary policy. As economic and financialintegration is going on, the business cycles will grow ever-closer, that is, real convergence willincrease further.IIILadies and gentlemen, world output grew by 4.7 per cent last year, the highest rate in a decade. Thatgrowth rate could not be kept up. Has the world economy now bottomed out? My answer: “We do notknow for sure” should come as no surprise to you.The US economy is still playing the key role in the global economy. It accounts for 22 per cent of worldGDP and for 15 percent of world exports. The heavy dependence of NAFTA and some Asian countrieson trade with the US proliferates US weakness.Signals from the US economy continue to be mixed. No direction is clearly visible from the data. Theslowdown started with domestic technology investment. Recently, some spillovers have beenobserved. Consumer demand, up to now the stablest pillar of demand, is advancing more moderately.Inventory correction that set in quickly is now well advanced. A positive contribution to growth may beexpected in the near future.The slowdown opens a window of opportunity to unwind macroeconomic imbalances - both thosedomestic to the US and international ones - in an orderly manner. In the US, the personal savings ratehas started to increase, slightly but steadily, since the fourth quarter of 2000. Slackening domesticdemand should help to contain the large current-account deficit. The tech bubble has been deflated.
BIS Review 75/20013The labour market is no longer overly tight. The dollar/euro exchange rate may have seen aturnaround; at least the downward trend is broken.However, the risks are for real. The overconfidence in technology investment in the US may havegiven rise to over-investment that can be unwound only slowly. In case of a further fall in equity pricesthe slump in consumer confidence and demand may be prolonged somewhat.In spite of these risks, I tend to find the prospect of the start of a modest recovery towards the end ofthis year plausible and encouraging. The macroeconomic easing should show its effects in the secondhalf of 2001. The Fed has brought interest rates down by 300 basis points in seven rate cuts, and atax cut of about 55 billion dollars is becoming effective this year. The confidence of both businessesand households has strengthened somewhat, and usually this presages a pick-up in growth.In Japan, the economic situation is broadly unchanged. The banking crisis still weighs on theeconomy, a marked revival of economic activity is still not in sight, nor is it being predicted for the nearfuture. Unfortunately, macroeconomic policy has very little leeway left for providing further stimuli.Structural reforms could - as in the euro area - be of considerable help in accelerating potentialgrowth.In the wake of slower global growth, the euro-area economy has lost some of its previous dynamism.World trade is no longer growing at double-digit rates. Caution in investment, as well as inconsumption spending, is being reflected in receding industrial production; the July increase is not yetto be regarded as a firm signal of a turnaround. Furthermore, capacity utilisation is now lower,although still above its long-term average rate. Business confidence has sunk, the previous reductionin unemployment has come to a halt.The euro-area economy has been hit particularly hard by the oil and food crises. Both led to sharpprice increases and put the consumer into a state of uncertainty. The oil price shock caused anegative terms-of-trade effect and major reductions in real disposable income. At this juncture, we seethe economy of the euro area having lost momentum, after the vigorous expansion in the year 2000.There are, however, several reasons for feeling confident. The waning food crises will no longer weighon consumption and this year’s tax cuts are to come into effect in some euro-area countries.The risks are clearly on the investment side. A major part of the reduction in GDP growth during thefirst quarter - the latest data available - occurred owing to a lower contribution of gross fixed capitalformation. Capacity utilisation is still high, and the global outlook does not call for stepping upinvestment. On the whole, business sentiment, and thus the propensity to invest, hinge on a moreoptimistic view of the world economy. Financing conditions, however, are favourable in the euro area.Capital markets rates are about the same level as rates in the US.In an environment of weakening growth the continuation of the consolidation of the public sector’sfinances is becoming more difficult. In 1997, the European Governments decided to implement theStability and Growth Pact. They agreed to pursue a policy of eliminating structural deficits. In mosteuro area countries, this process is well advanced. These countries are in a somewhat favourableposition, as they have enough room to manoeuvre to let automatic stabilisers work in full. A minority ofcountries (Germany, Italy, France and Portugal) - which, however, account for 70 per cent of euro areaGDP - still show structural deficits of a considerable extent. Under the present circumstances,therefore, the automatic stabilisers should only be allowed to work fully in those countries whosebudget positions are close to balance or in surplus.Recently, suggestions have been aired to replace targets for the public sector deficit with targets forpublic expenditure. I am strongly in favour to stick to the tried and tested deficit target. The publicsector deficit is the decisive measure for its demands on the financial markets. The deficit is thebenchmark for a government’s stability-orientation.Last Thursday, the Governing Council of the ECB decided to lower its key interest rates by 25 basispoints. We considered that the available evidence points to an improvement in the outlook for pricedevelopments. With regard to the first pillar of the monetary policy strategy, the three-month averageof the annual growth rate of M3 was 5.9 per cent. However, this figure needs to be corrected for someholdings which do not necessarily have implications for price stability in the medium term.Regarding the second pillar, there are clear signs of lower inflationary pressures from the demandside. Lower growth expectations, a strengthening exchange rate, the downward trend of the growth ofconsumer and producer prices lead to the expectation that price stability will be restored in the not toodistant future. Overall, as several indicators are pointing to an abatement of inflationary pressures, the
4BIS Review 75/2001new level of interest rates is compatible with the maintenance of price stability over the medium term,which, in turn, is essential to create a favourable environment for sustainable economic growth.IVThe evolution of the slowdown in the US highlights how important and how effective financial marketsare. The speed at which the slowdown spread around the world underlines this importance.Changes in investment and in financing habits have altered the international links between thebusiness cycles. For the first time since the mid-seventies oil crisis, the G-7 countries are slowing instep. Evidence is piling up that this synchronicity is more than sheer chance.Financial markets seem to more and more replace trade in goods and services as the majortransmission channel for economic developments. The reasoning runs as follows:Financial market prices react immediately, once new information becomes available. So financialmarkets reflect developments in, and expectations for, the real economy very quickly. Moderninformation and communication technologies are of help. Any investor anywhere in the world can in notime update his view of - let’s say - the correctness of the markets' expectations as to the future pathof ECB interest-rate policy. If his opinion differs from the markets’, that is, if he perceives opportunitiesfor arbitrage, he will rearrange his portfolio.What is new about this process - besides technology? International portfolio diversification is no longera privilege of institutional investors. Today, nearly everybody’s portfolio is internationally diversified.International portfolio diversification may occur in its direct form, for example, in holding shares incompanies located in different countries. It may otherwise come in its indirect form: foreign directinvestment. More and more often, companies substitute foreign direct investment for internationaltrade. FDI flows are growing fast.The financial sphere in Europe has changed tremendously. We now have a common currency in theeuro area. Currency risk has been eliminated. Financial markets are integrating faster than ever. Theyhave become, and are still becoming, broader and deeper. Breadth and liquidity of financial markets,however, favour a capital-market-oriented financial system of Anglo-Saxon type. Anddisintermediation, in turn, fosters the breadth of capital markets. The broader and more liquid financialmarkets are, the more attractive they are to international investors. Thus, the euro is one of the forcesworking towards ever-closer financial links between national economies.Ever closer financial integration has times and again provoked calls to “throw sand in the wheels of theforeign exchange market”. A ”Tobin tax” on short-term currency transactions was proposed to barexcessive currency speculation. Such a tax would clearly lower transaction volume in internationalcurrency markets. However, it would come at too high a cost. Foreign trade in goods and services isbound to suffer as well. In the end, the wealth-enhancing international division of labour will behampered. Furthermore, in times of distress, a Tobin tax is not effective. Expected returns onspeculative capital movements during a crisis by far outweigh the costs of any sensible transactiontax. The Tobin tax simply cannot make up for a loss of confidence.On a worldwide scale, financial links are gaining in importance. Internationally, business cycles aregrowing closer. That is why Europe was relatively quickly affected by the US downturn, although ourstarting point was quite different from theirs. Although growth in Europe was vigorous, too, overheatingwas not an issue with us.VThe financial services industry is very dynamic not only, but especially, in Ireland. Sophisticated newproducts, new technologies, new channels of delivery and new forms of cooperation among hithertoseparate lines of business pose new risks.As the financial world evolves, financial supervision faces new challenges. “Basle II” is one instrumentfor financial supervisors to take these new risks into account. The three pillar approach seeks to bringrequired minimum capital more into line with economic risk. Second, it brings banks’ risk profiles andtheir ability for risk management closer into the focus of financial supervisors. And, third, enhanceddisclosure will bring about more transparency and even will integrate financial markets into financialsupervision.
BIS Review 75/20015It is no accident that new models of financial supervision are being put into practice in severalcountries. Ireland has decided on a new model, and Germany is also in the process of devising a newinstitutional structure for its supervisory authorities. In both our countries, the role of the central bank inthe supervisory task is affected.In March, the ECB published its views on the role of central banks in prudential supervision. The ECBargued in favour of a strong involvement of central banks. That view is well-founded. In all majorindustrial countries, the responsibility for the stability of the financial system is assigned to the centralbank. Macro- and microprudential analyses, however, are intertwined. If you want to assess the risksto the system, you need to know about the players. If you want to assess individual risks, you need toknow about their exposure to systemic risk.Central banks are required to oversee the smooth functioning of payment systems, another source ofsystemic risk. During the conduct of monetary policy, central banks collect information which is of usein the supervision of individual financial institutions. Interlinking central bank functions and prudentialsupervision takes advantage of these synergies.In Germany, the envisaged reform of financial supervision is linked to the reform of the Bundesbank.In its statement on the planned reform of the Deutsche Bundesbank, the ECB made it clear howvaluable the independence of a central bank is - institutional independence, personal independenceand financial independence alike. The Maastricht Treaty set out to protect central bank independencein all three regards. Article 108 of the Treaty explicitly protects both the independence of the ECB andthe independence of all the national central banks within the ESCB. Any central bank reform at thenational level must likewise respect such independence.VILadies and Gentlemen!Today, financial integration is one of the distinctive features of the world economy. Ireland has been ina position to exploit this development to its advantage. The catching-up has indeed been impressive,and is encouraging in view of the upcoming eastward enlargement of the European Union.Recent developments suggest that business cycles are linked more closely in a world of deeperfinancial integration. For the eurozone, this is particularly good news, as it facilitates the conduct of thesingle monetary policy. The ESCB has been successful in pursuing a stability-oriented monetarypolicy. Its strategy and recent monetary policy decisions will contribute to more growth and stability inEurope.In 118 days the physical introduction of the euro will bring the single European currency to completion.In Ireland you will then use the same notes and coins as will people in Greece. This is globalisation ona European scale. As economic and political integration deepens, Europe can, Europe wishes to andEurope will increasingly assume responsibility on a global scale.
BIS Review 74/20011European Central Bank: Press conference – introductory statementIntroductory statement by Mr Willem F Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank andMr Christian Noyer, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, at the press conference, held inFrankfurt am Main, 30 August 2001.*      *      *Ladies and gentlemen, I am here to report on the outcome of today's meeting of the GoverningCouncil of the ECB, which was also attended by Mr. Reynders, President of the EU Council, and Mr.Solbes from the European Commission.Following its regular examination of monetary and economic developments and analysis of theirimplications for the maintenance of price stability in the euro area, the Governing Council decided tolower the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. The Governing Council considers that theavailable evidence points to an improvement in the outlook for price developments. This is particularlyapparent from the information under the second pillar of the ECB's monetary policy strategy, while thatrelated to the first pillar remains consistent with a favourable outlook for price stability in the mediumterm.Let me elaborate somewhat on the assessment provided under the two pillars of the monetary policystrategy of the ECB.With regard to the first pillar, the three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 was 5.9% inthe period from May to July 2001. However, this figure needs to be corrected for holdings of moneymarket paper and short-term debt securities by non-residents of the euro area, which, according topreliminary estimates, have contributed around three-quarters of a percentage point to annual M3growth.The increase in the rate of growth of M3 over the past few months must be interpreted carefully. Itreflects the relatively flat yield curve and the recent weakness in stock markets, both of which madethe holding of short-term deposits and marketable paper included in M3 attractive. As it also reflectsthe fact that consumers needed a higher level of transaction balances to finance the past rise inenergy and food prices, recent increases in M3 growth may be transitory and, hence, do notnecessarily have implications for price stability in the medium term. In addition, the annual rate ofgrowth of loans to the private sector, although still high, has continued to decline over recent months.Regarding the second pillar, there are clear signals of lower inflationary pressures from the demandside. Recent data on economic activity indicate that real GDP growth in 2001 will most likely be lowerthan was expected a few months ago. This is due in part to external demand, which has remainedweak and below expectations, owing to slow growth in economic activity in the United States andpersistent economic weakness in Japan, which have spilled over to other regions of the world. Inaddition, consumption growth in the euro area has been dampened by losses in real disposableincome related to past increases in consumer prices. All these factors also had a negative impact oninvestment.This notwithstanding, over time, the expected decline in consumer price inflation, to which thestrengthening of the exchange rate has contributed, should support the growth of domestic demand.Further positive effects on euro area economic growth should stem from the full impact of taxreductions in several euro area countries and from the fact that financing conditions in the euro areaare favourable.A concern with regard to the outlook for price stability in the coming years has been the possibleemergence of second-round effects, via wages, of past increases in consumer price inflation. Theinformation available shows that wage moderation prevailed in the first quarter of 2001. It is essentialthat this trend continues and, at the current juncture, two factors support the view that this shouldindeed be the case. First, the slowdown in economic activity which I just mentioned may contribute tocontaining inflationary pressure stemming from the labour market. Second, there are encouragingsigns, such as those coming from data on consumer and producer prices, which confirm that theincrease in consumer price inflation was temporary and that, in the absence of further unfavourableshocks, it is likely that price stability will be restored in the not too distant future. The downwardmovement in import prices which has gradually been taking place over the past few months shouldsupport this process. The falling trend in consumer price inflation will contribute to containing inflation
2BIS Review 74/2001expectations of economic agents, thereby influencing price and wage-setting behaviour. This view isconfirmed by bond yields, which indicate that financial markets expect inflation developments to bewell in line with price stability in the medium term.Overall, as several indicators are pointing to an abatement of inflationary pressures, the new level ofinterest rates is compatible with the maintenance of price stability over the medium term, which, inturn, is essential to create a favourable environment for sustainable economic growth.At this juncture, I should like to express concern about the impact that slower growth may have on thedetermination of the governments of some countries to adhere strictly to the Stability and Growth Pactin the context of their existing stability programmes. Under the present circumstances, the automaticstabilisers should only be allowed to work fully in those countries whose budget positions are close tobalance or in surplus. Let me emphasise that a medium-term perspective is essential for the conductof fiscal policies in all euro area countries. Short-term discretionary measures aimed at strengtheningdomestic demand risk having an unwelcome impact on the economy, not least on account of timelags. In addition, if such measures are not consistent with the Pact, they may undermine the credibilityof the consolidation process.In their efforts to set the conditions for further expanding the production potential of the euro area,governments should also give more impetus to the implementation of structural reforms. Selectivefiscal reforms, including those related to pension reforms, should provide the correct incentives toeconomic agents. Labour and product market reforms will be beneficial to employment growth in theeuro area and improve the resilience of the euro area economy to adverse shocks in the future.Finally, I should like to draw your attention to a press release that was issued today on the ECBDecision on the denominations, specifications, reproduction, exchange and withdrawal of eurobanknotes.
BIS Review 73/20011Roger W Ferguson, Jr: Technology, information production, and marketefficiencyRemarks by Mr Roger W Ferguson, Jr, Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US FederalReserve System, at a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, JacksonHole, Wyoming on 31 August 2001.*      *      *I am pleased to participate in this symposium on the information economy. My colleagues in KansasCity deserve thanks for again having arranged a stimulating program. I will begin by discussing someissues that relate directly to the paper by D’Avolio, Gildor, and Shleifer. I will then offer some broadercomments on the actual or potential effects of information technology in markets for financial services.This paper fits into the large literature on the economics of imperfect information. This line of researchhas generated important insights concerning economic behavior and the functioning of markets,showing in particular that imperfect information can lead to outcomes that are distinctly less favorablethan those under complete information. Andrei Shleifer (with many co-authors) has been a leadingcontributor to this field.The current paper argues that advances in information and communication technology have improvedthe functioning of financial markets in many ways but that this technology also has a dark side thatmay harm market efficiency. This concern centers on the stock market and reflects the followingargument. Improvements in information technology - most notably, the rapid growth of the Internet -have made participating in the market much easier and cheaper and, as a result, the market hasdrawn in many new and unsophisticated investors. These “noise traders” cannot differentiate betweenaccurate and distorted information about a given company. Thus, company managers see greateropportunity to boost their firm’s stock price by fooling investors through the release of distortedinformation - and have a strong incentive to do so because of the shift toward stock-basedcompensation and the widespread use of equity financing in the “new economy”. In the end, accordingto the paper, more information is available, but its quality has deteriorated, which reduces the benefitfrom information technology for market efficiency.Because the incentive to produce distorted information is so strong, the authors doubt that marketmechanisms alone can correct the problem. They advocate a two-pronged strategy of enhanceddisclosure requirements and investor education to improve market efficiency. These recommendationsare very sensible. The emphasis on disclosure has long been a cornerstone of the regulatoryframework in the United States, and it lies behind recent initiatives at the SEC to combat what thecommission views as a variety of conflicts of interest that threaten the integrity of our financial markets.The authors’ other recommendation - greater education of investors - is also important, especiallygiven the broadening participation in financial markets. The Federal Reserve, along with othergovernment agencies, is working to promote financial literacy in several ways - by issuing regulationsthat make comparing financial products easier, by producing educational materials for the public, andby supporting private-sector initiatives, such as programs that design and disseminate coursematerials for use in schools.Although I certainly concur with the policy recommendations in the paper, I have some suggestions fortightening the analysis that lies behind those recommendations. For example, the paper implies thatfinancial disclosure is generally weaker than in the past, and uses the media focus on pro formaaccounting as one proof of the increasing weakness of financial disclosure. Increases in pro formadisclosures do not necessarily imply that misleading information is always being disclosed. While theauthors demonstrate that, in a small number of firms, earnings from pro forma numbers are highrelative to GAAP earnings, it is not clear from the paper how severe a problem exists with regard tothese disclosures. Similarly, while the paper attempts to show that earnings management can fool themarket, virtually all the evidence is based on data from the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s, and thus itmay not be relevant for the later years. Moreover, the analysis of more recent effects of earningsdistortions tends to be loose. For example, the paper argues that the high turnover of shares in option-intensive companies may indicate that their shareholders are relatively unsophisticated - on thethought that the omission of option-related costs from GAAP earnings overstates the firm’s trueincome and that uninformed investors trade heavily on this noise-ridden news. Perhaps. But the paperignores other plausible explanations for the high turnover that may be unrelated to the sophistication
2BIS Review 73/2001of shareholders. One such explanation is that option-intensive firms are concentrated in the high-techsector, where the flow of news and, hence, trading opportunities are greater than elsewhere in theeconomy.My second suggestion is that the authors be more careful about asserting that information technologyhas greatly expanded the presence of uninformed investors in the equity market. Based on my readingof the available data, this occurrence seems far from clear, and I would like to spend a couple minutesindicating why.Let’s begin by looking at the aggregate data on household equity holdings from the Federal Reserve’sflow of funds accounts.1 These data include direct holdings by households, along with the variousforms of indirect equity holding that involve professional management (such as investing throughmutual funds). If uninformed individuals have played a growing and direct role in the equity market, asthe paper argues, we might expect to see that direct holdings by households have become a largershare of the total equities outstanding. However, as Chart 1 shows, we see just the opposite. Thisresult may reflect the fact, as indicated in Chart 2, that over the past decade, households have beenreducing the portion of their equities that they hold directly and have increasingly invested throughmutual funds and variable annuities (which are essentially mutual funds combined with life insurance).That is, households have been handing over more and more of their equity portfolio to professionalmanagers, who tend to be relatively well informed investors.Household-level data on equity ownership paint a similar picture. It is true, as shown by Table 1 in thepaper, that the number of U.S. households owning equity in some form has increased substantially.However, this table also shows that relatively little of this increase reflects broader direct ownership ofequity. According to the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances - which is the original datasource for this table - only 19 percent of U.S. households owned individual stocks outside retirementaccounts in 1998, barely above the 17 percent share in 1989. Like the aggregate data, these figuressuggest that new investors have largely been putting their money in managed accounts.                                                     1Technically, these data combine nonprofit organizations with the household sector; however, the nonprofits are a small partof this aggregate, so we can safely regard the data as pertaining to households.
BIS Review 73/20013What do we actually know about the new investors who have chosen to buy individual stocks in recentyears? To my knowledge, the best source of such information is the “Equity Ownership in America”survey conducted in 1999 by the Investment Company Institute and the Securities IndustryAssociation. The following table uses these data to compare the households that first purchasedindividual stocks after 1995 with the households whose first purchase was between 1990 and 1995.2I’ve split the sample at 1995 to assess whether the increased access to information and sharply lowertrading costs since then have lured a cohort of clearly uninformed investors to the market.As the table shows, the two groups of investors appear to be similar in important respects. There isalmost no difference in median age (early 40s) or income (about $62,000) between the two groups,and investors in both groups tend to be well educated, although the proportion with a college orpostgraduate degree is a little lower for the new-investor group. With regard to their portfolios, themedian investor in each group held only a few stocks and did little or no trading in 1998.3 Thenew-investor group tended to have a higher self-assessed tolerance for risk, which might suggest thatthese investors gravitated more to technology stocks, which have had such a wild ride in recent years.However, it’s also noteworthy that this group had more exposure to the equity market through priorownership of stock mutual funds than did investors who first purchased individual equities between1990 and 1995.                                                     2This comparison is based on unpublished tabulations of the survey data that were kindly provided by the InvestmentCompany Institute.3However, there are some very active traders in both groups. The average number of stock trades for each group in 1998was seven, far above the median.

BIS Review 73/20015These observable characteristics are, of course, only crude proxies for what we really want tomeasure - the degree of market knowledge and sophistication. Still, this survey provides little reasonto believe that the new purchasers of individual stocks are especially likely to be duped by misleadinginformation. The survey results, combined with the data indicating a shift toward institutional holdingsof equity, cast doubt on the authors’ assertion that information technology has “broughtunsophisticated investors in droves to the stock market”.I would feel more comfortable with an alternative story, which goes as follows. The late 1990s were aperiod of optimism about the prospects for the U.S. economy, reflecting the pickup in productivitygrowth that was generated, in large part, by information technology. The resultant optimism about theeconomy’s growth prospects was accompanied by a complacent attitude toward risk, fed by the longbull market dating back to the early 1980s. In this environment, many investors - not merelynewcomers - purchased stock on the belief that business plans would become reality. The problemwas not, for the most part, that new investors came to dominate the market but that many investors’attitude toward and perception of risk changed markedly. This explanation of recent events, whichavoids the less-compelling aspects of the paper, appears to provide a stronger foundation for theauthors’ observations.Given the panel topic of finance in the information age, I would now like to broaden the discussion byconsidering the actual or likely effects of technology on product attributes, pricing, and welfare inmarkets for other financial products. Since I read the paper to be focused mainly on the retail market, Ishall continue in that vein.For a number of retail financial products, new technologies have surely led to a general increase inwelfare. New delivery technologies, such as the Internet, when combined with automated underwritingand credit scoring, have given borrowers the opportunity to select from a broader set of providers ofcredit cards, mortgages, and even some types of small business loans - one of the mostinformationally opaque financial products. Competition has been enhanced as new technology makesit easier for non-banking institutions to offer these products and for out-of-market financial firms tocompete with local financial institutions. In addition, securitization - which is also dependent onadvances in information technology - has broadened the pool of lenders by allowing loan originators topackage risk and then shift the risk to the parties best able to bear it.At the same time, automated underwriting and credit scoring are improving the ability of lenders toevaluate and price credit risk, which has allowed credit to be extended to a wider range of borrowers.The rapid growth in the market for subprime mortgages is but one example of the broader access tocredit. In effect, advances in information technology are helping to ameliorate a key imperfection inloan markets - namely, the outright denial of credit to relatively risky borrowers in the face of limitedinformation. Recent events indicate that this product market is still evolving.Automated underwriting and credit scoring are also substantially reducing the time and cost involved inmaking credit decisions. These savings contribute to the overall welfare improvement brought aboutby information technology. In the area of mortgage lending, for example, credit decisions today areroutinely made in minutes rather than days and at much lower cost than a decade ago. Freddie Macreports that the cost of originating mortgage loans processed through their system has fallen hundredsof dollars, helping to overcome one of the main barriers to homeownership - a lack of availablesavings to meet closing costs and downpayment requirements. Another benefit of automatedunderwriting is that credit decisions have become more transparent, to both lenders and potentialborrowers. Individuals can easily obtain their credit report and credit score, check whether anyinformation in the report is incorrect, and learn how they can improve their credit standing.In short, while the paper raises important concerns about equity markets, other areas of financeprovide evidence that the information age has brought significant benefits in the form of increasedtransparency and competition, lower costs, more appropriate pricing, and broader access to credit.Technology has also expanded the ways in which customers can conduct business with financialinstitutions, which has the potential to increase welfare. For example, the need for “in-person visits”has diminished as financial service providers have established centralized call centers to facilitatetelephone banking, developed web sites to allow Internet banking and software to permit PC banking,and promoted the use of direct deposits and pre-authorized debits. According to recent statistics,nearly 40 percent of all U.S. banks now provide some form of web site through which they cancommunicate with customers, and almost 15 percent provide web sites that can be used to conductbanking transactions. These numbers are growing rapidly. Of the banks with more than $500 million inassets, nearly 50 percent now provide web sites that can be used to conduct transactions. As the
6BIS Review 73/2001need for in-person visits declines, we might expect customers to broaden the geographic area withinwhich they search for providers of financial services, leading to increased competition. Clearly,mortgages and credit cards already fall into this category of financial product.Nonetheless, the implications of these newer delivery channels for banking products other thanmortgages and credit cards seem more potential than real for the vast majority of bank retailcustomers. For example, despite the expanded options made available to customers as a result oftechnological advances, data collected in the Federal Reserve’s 1998 Survey of Consumer Financesand 1998 Survey of Small Business Finances indicate that households and small businesses still relyvery heavily on in-person visits to carry out their financial transactions. Eighty-one percent ofhouseholds surveyed in 1998 indicated that they used in-person visits as a means for conductingbusiness with a financial institution, and 86 percent of small businesses indicated that during 1998they relied upon such visits as their most common method for dealing with their primary financialinstitution. Only 6 percent of households reported having used a computer to conduct business with afinancial institution in 1998. Electronic access to financial institutions, no doubt, will continue to grow,and the next Federal Reserve Survey of Consumer Finances will provide valuable data about thechanges through 2001. In the meantime, the facts I have highlighted and other data already availabledemonstrate that the use of electronic technologies for dealing with a financial institution deservesmonitoring and continuing analysis and evaluation.It is also worth noting that some technology-driven financial services have been commercial failures. Inthe world of payments, stored value cards are clearly technically viable but have yet to be widely used.The “cashless society” appears little closer today than when that phrase began to be used forty yearsago. One likely explanation is that network effects are important in determining which innovationssucceed or fail. In many retail payment experiments, too few consumers or merchants use a paymentnetwork or a new instrument for these technology-driven services to become economically viable.In concluding, the paper has added a note of caution to the discussions of the potential welfare-improving elements of finance in the information age. Though I have taken exception to some of thedetailed analysis in the paper and noted that other financial products likely have been enhanced bythe emergence of new technologies, it is clear that technology has not changed all elements of thedelivery of financial services or cured all market imperfections. Likewise, not all technology-derivedfinancial products have achieved commercial success. The authors are to be commended forreinforcing these common-sense lessons. By doing so they give further impetus to both financialliteracy and regulations that foster market experimentation and development while appropriatelyprotecting those that need to be protected and responding to market imperfections when they appear.
BIS Review 72/20011T T Mboweni: Recent economic and financial developmentsAddress by Professor T T Mboweni, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, at the University ofSouth Africa, Pretoria, 23 August 2001.*      *      *1.IntroductionLadies and gentlemen, honoured guests. I wish to thank you for the honour you have bestowed on meby choosing me as the recipient of your award for Excellence in Managing the South African FinancialEnvironment. In accepting this award and thanking you for extending it to me, I would like to make afew comments about the recent economic and financial developments in South Africa. I will touch onthe recent price developments, the exchange rate, and developments in other emerging markets.2.Recent economic developmentsTowards the end of 2000 the South African economy had not been seriously affected by the worldeconomic downturn. But by the first quarter of this year, it became clearer that we would probably beadversely affected by the slowing activity in the major world economies.As we mentioned in our latest Quarterly Bulletin, published in June, the recorded decline in exportvolumes contributed to a slowing down in domestic growth from 3 per cent in the fourth quarter of lastyear to 2 per cent in the first quarter of this year. Although growth had already slowed from 4 per centin the third quarter of 2000, the slowdown had largely been confined to the agricultural sector. But inthe first quarter of this year, the weakness spread to other sectors of the economy. Of some worry isthat the sector that bore the brunt of the slowdown was the manufacturing sector. The growth rate inthis sector slowed from an annualised 4.5 per cent in the fourth quarter to a mere 1 per cent in the firstquarter. This is somewhat puzzling because there appears to be strong demand for manufacturedgoods.Domestic demand remained strong in the first quarter with household and government consumptionexpenditure rising and growth in real fixed capital formation and inventory investment accelerating.The welcome acceleration in inventory levels followed a steep drop in net inventory investment fromthe third to fourth quarters of 2000. This suggests that producers are positive about South Africa’sfuture growth prospects and anticipate a sizeable increase in domestic demand.3.Price developmentsInflation in the prices of consumer goods and services moderated meaningfully in the first half of 2001.The year-on-year rate of increase in the consumer price index for metropolitan and other urban areasexcluding mortgage cost (CPIX) - the benchmark indicator for inflation-targeting purposes - hasdeclined from 8.2 per cent in August 2000 to 6.4 per cent in July 2001. This rate of increase is only0.4 percentage points above the upper limit of the inflation target range of between 3 and 6 per centset for 2002. When measured from quarter to quarter and expressed at an annualised rate, the short-term pace of CPIX inflation has almost halved from 7.8 per cent in the first quarter of 2001 to 4.5 percent in the second quarter.“Headline” CPI inflation or the year-on-year rate of increase in the overall consumer price index formetropolitan areas slowed down from 7.8 per cent in February 2001 to 5.3 per cent in July.Increases in the prices of consumer services decelerated quite significantly. In the case of housing-related services, price increases moderated from a year-on-year rate of 8.1 per cent in February 2001to 2.8 per cent in July. Housing-related services include mortgage rates, house rent and domesticworkers' wages. Expressed at a seasonally adjusted and annualised rate, the rate of increase in theprices of all consumer services fell from 13.4 per cent in the first quarter of 2001 to only 4.2 per cent inthe second quarter. Smaller increases in the prices of other services, apart from housing-relatedservices, also contributed to the decline in the inflation in the prices of all consumer services.The year-on-year rate of increase in the prices of consumer goods fell back from 8.7 per cent inAugust 2000 to 5.2 per cent in July 2001. Declines in the price of food, which had risen steeply in2000, helped to bring down the inflation rate.
2BIS Review 72/2001In contrast to the moderation in consumer price inflation, production price inflation has advanced at afirmer pace in recent months. Measured over periods of twelve months, the rate of increase in theall-goods production price index rose from 8.1 per cent in April 2001 to 8.6 per cent in May, June andJuly.The year-on-year rate of increase in the prices of domestically produced goods which had recededfrom 8.0 per cent in November 2000 to 6.9 per cent in April 2001, accelerated to 8.2 per cent in July.Rising food price inflation, though still at a modest level, contributed most to the pick-up in inflation inthe prices of domestically produced goods.The higher inflation in the prices of domestically produced goods has been partly offset by adeceleration in the rates of increase in the prices of imported goods in recent months. Importedinflation, when measured over periods of twelve months, declined from 15.0 per cent in December2000 to 9.2 per cent in July 2001. The decline in imported inflation over this period was primarily dueto lower international oil prices and the increase in the value of the rand in May and June 2001.Coupled with declining inflation in trading-partner countries, this contributed meaningfully to theslowdown in imported inflation.4.Exchange rate developmentsThe performance of the rand/dollar exchange rate has been disappointing in recent times. It hastraded between R8.01 on 4 July 2001 and R8.45 on 22 August. Whilst I have often said thatcommentators should focus on the trade-weighted value of the rand, as a deterioration in the value ofthe rand against the US dollar might merely reflect the strength of the US dollar on the internationalexchanges, the traded-weighted value of the rand has also succumbed to negative sentiment. It iscurrently around 8 per cent weaker than at the end of last year.Why is the exchange rate of the rand currently under pressure? The reasons cited in the market arethe following: in the first instance, currencies perceived to belong in the emerging markets asset classhave been adversely affected by, in particular, developments in Argentina and Turkey. There areconcerns in the market that, notwithstanding the official aid packages, with their accompanyingconditionalities, Argentina’s economic problems could prove difficult to resolve. Sentiment towards therand has been clearly affected by fears of contagion.Secondly, developments in Zimbabwe, in particular with respect to their land-reform programme, havealso been cited as explanatory factors. The impact of these developments was compounded this weekfollowing a report on Bloomberg. Mr Thami KaPlaatjie, Secretary-General of the Pan-AfricanistCongress of South Africa, reportedly supported Zimbabwe’s approach to land reform and criticisedthose who oppose it as negating the interests of Africans. Furthermore, he reportedly also toldjournalists that the problem of land in South Africa will, when it explodes, be of enormous proportions- “too ghastly to contemplate” were his words. (I believe Mr KaPlaatjie was not speaking in his officialcapacity but, I must stress, the damage was done.)I would like to repeat what I said yesterday at the Annual African Investment Conference held inStellenbosch. I am concerned that developments in Zimbabwe have tended to have an adverse effecton our markets, in particular our currency and bond markets. I would like to reiterate that firstly, theland question in Zimbabwe needs to be resolved in accordance with the law and in an orderly fashionwhich finds a solution that is beneficial to the political and economic imperatives of Zimbabwe and theregion.Secondly, the current state of restlessness in Zimbabwe should really be brought to an end to allowthe economies of Southern Africa to stabilise. Thirdly, our markets need to learn to differentiatebetween developments in one Southern African country and another. Here in South Africa the politicalleadership has consistently stated that land reform will take place according to the law as guided bythe Constitution and the need for historical redress and food production. I hope the market players arelistening to what is being said.Fourthly, from the Reserve Bank’s point of view we are highly appreciative of the efforts of theSouthern African Development Community in trying to assist in a resolution of the Zimbabweanquestion. And finally, we should always be aware that the financial markets are affected by amultiplicity of factors, not just one factor. Since developments in one emerging market will from time totime affect another, it is therefore important that emerging markets design their policies and
BIS Review 72/20013programmes to receive the maximum benefit from globalisation. An “injury to one tends to be an injuryto all”.The final factor which has been mentioned in the market has been the perceived increase in strikeaction and threatened labour unrest. Of course, the rand sometimes is pressurised by the perceptionthat it is a “commodity currency”, or concerns may emerge regarding the privatisation process in SouthAfrica, or regarding the so-called NOFP, the net open foreign currency position of the Reserve Bank.Movements in the value of the rand can also, of course, be exacerbated by pure speculative tradingactivity in the foreign exchange market. Undoubtedly, however, the first three factors I mentionedearlier have dominated market sentiment and commentary in recent days.I believe that the pressures on the rand are really, truly and honestly overdone. Cognisance has to betaken of South Africa’s sound economic fundamentals to allay these contagion fears which mightemerge if economic conditions in Argentina, Zimbabwe and Turkey deteriorate. Secondly, the SouthAfrican Government has given a clear and unequivocal commitment to the rule of law and has recentlybeen seen implementing court decisions without delay in respect of a land-occupation problem atBredell. Fears regarding any land-reform programme in South Africa are unfounded. The best defenceof a currency lies in the economic management of the country. South Africa pursues and will continueto pursue prudent macro-economic policies. I have no doubt that a carefully considered analysis ofSouth Africa will lead to a retracement in the value of the rand’s trade-weighted index.5.Developments in other emerging marketsThe increase of international financial transactions and international capital flows has brought with itan increase in the potential risks of a reversal. This sudden and large reversal of short-term capitalflows has caused international financial crises in Mexico (1994-1995), Asia (1997-1998), Brazil (1998-1999) and more recently in Argentina and Turkey.Argentina’s economic performance deteriorated significantly from mid-1998 in the aftermath of theAsia, Brazil and Russia crises. After a short-lived pickup in the last quarter of 1999, the economy againstagnated in 2000. This reflected the fiscal tightening on domestic demand, a drop in business andconsumer confidence, and the progressive hardening of financing conditions in international markets.The government responded with a strengthened growth-oriented economic strategy aimed atpromoting and ensuring medium-term sustainability of the fiscal and external financial situations. Itcentred on a strong commitment by the government to reduce fiscal deficits.The IMF supported this strengthened economic programme and increased Argentina’s access to IMFfinancing in January this year. Argentina also received new loan commitments from other sources.Favourable developments that followed the agreement on the programme and financing package wereinterrupted in early March 2001 by a new crisis. The principle catalyst was evidence of a majordeterioration in the fiscal performance, but internal political disagreements and increased uncertaintyin international markets were contributing factors.In June 2001, the government completed a nearly US$ 30 billion debt exchange with its majordomestic and international creditors. Argentina’s financial conditions improved somewhat but thisproved to be temporary and Argentina’s financial asset prices started falling in mid-July 2001 asanalysts questioned Argentina’s ability to meet payments on almost US$ 130 billion public debt.President Fernando De la Rua tried to reassure investors in July by announcing a series of strictmeasures to cut government spending and limit tax evasion. Argentina’s stocks, however, fell sharplythereafter as investors questioned President De la Rua’s proposed spending cuts and other economicmeasures designed to reduce Argentina’s ballooning deficit. This package of measures, designed toachieve a zero fiscal deficit, was finally approved by Argentina’s Congress at the end of July 2001after much debate.Fears of a regional crisis in Latin America, however, eased when Horst Kohler, the IMF’s managingdirector, this week informed the Executive Board of the Fund that he was prepared to recommend anaugmentation of Argentina’s current stand-by credit facility by approximately US$ 8 billion to aboutUS$ 22 billion.Similarly, Turkey’s economy experienced considerable growth since 1994 but had entered arecession by 1999 as a result of tight fiscal policies and the earlier Russian crisis. With high publicdeficits and a public sector making net payments of external debt after 1994, the pressure grew onTurkey’s financial markets. The lack of depth of these financial markets and the volatile inflation rate
4BIS Review 72/2001paved the way for sustained high real interest rates. The high real interest rate paid on domestic debttherefore increased the borrowing requirements of the public sector. All this created a vicious circle ofdebt and interest payments, pushing Turkey into an ever more difficult financial position.The deterioration of the public financial balance, the rise in domestic debt due to continued high realinterest rates, the acceleration of inflation rates and the continuing economic contraction made itnecessary to embark on a medium-term economic austerity programme. This programme wasdesigned to free Turkey from high inflation, restore macro-economic fundamentals and addressstructural weaknesses in the economy.For most of 2000, the government’s economic programme made good progress. Consumer priceinflation declined rapidly from 68.8 per cent in January 2000 to 33.4 per cent in February 2001, thelowest level since 1986. GNP growth also accelerated sharply from a contraction of 6.1 per cent in1999 to an expansion of 6 per cent in 2000.However, a severe banking crisis in late November 2000 was accompanied by a massive capitaloutflow. The crisis was triggered by liquidity problems in some medium-sized banks, which hadpositioned themselves aggressively for continued declines in interest rates. The underlying cause ofthe crisis, however, appears to be the significant deterioration in the current account and the delays inthe privatisation programme which were causing interest rates to rise from September, and moremarkedly from around mid-November 2000.The severe liquidity squeeze and growing bank distress was accompanied by pressure on overnightinterest rates and government bond yields. The capital outflow was only halted, and devaluation fearsallayed when the IMF announced in December 2000 an additional US$ 7 billion to alleviate thebalance of payment difficulties stemming from the recent crisis. Interest rates declined and there was amodest rise in capital flows in January 2001.In February 2001, a second financial crisis was triggered by a political dispute between Prime MinisterBulent Ecevit and President Ahmet Necdet Sezer. The dispute raised concern that the country’s three-party coalition government might collapse and raised doubts about the authorities’ commitment toreform. Market confidence in the system was shattered and the Turkish lira faced a fresh major attackin February 2001. The central bank spent US$ 4.5 billion, one sixth of its reserves, to defend the lira.These attempts, however, failed to restore confidence and the Turkish authorities decided on22 February 2001 to allow the lira to float freely.Turkey’s economic programme was again strengthened following the crisis that led to the floating ofthe lira. The new economic framework included increased transparency, accountability and goodgovernance in both the private and public sectors. The improved programme aimed to strengthen theprimary fiscal position of the public sector, reduce the government’s immediate borrowing requirementand address major bank restructuring. Market sentiment, however, again started to deteriorate in earlyJuly 2001 when the IMF postponed a portion of the Turkish loan. The differences between the IMF andthe Turkish authorities were fortunately resolved and the IMF approved the eighth review of Turkey’seconomic programme supported by the three-year Stand-By Arrangement on 12 July 2001.The IMF’s Executive Board also completed the ninth review of Turkey’s economic programme on3 August 2001. This decision will enable Turkey to draw an additional US$ 1.5 billion from the IMF.The IMF is convinced that there are encouraging signs that the economic downturn in Turkey isbottoming out, and that the targeted lowering of inflation is materialising, which could permit declinesin interest rates. The IMF is also encouraged by the considerable progress in the structural reformagenda, especially in restructuring the banking system. However, the Turkish lira has again started todepreciate rapidly since the beginning of August as confidence in Turkey’s ability to repayUS$ 26 billion of debt (before the end of this year) has been shaken by repeated disputes betweenmembers of the governing coalition. The Turkish authorities have also decided to formally make aninflation target the nominal anchor of Turkey’s monetary policy beginning in the fourth quarter of thisyear.The effects of the Mexican, Asian and Russian crises spread from one country to another in a processcommonly known as contagion. But in this case, the available evidence indicates no broad-basedcontagion from Argentina and Turkey to emerging markets in general at this stage. However,according to the IMF, the potential for broader-based contagion still remains. Concerns aboutArgentina did spill over into the region, notably to Brazil, which is also suffering from domesticdifficulties.
BIS Review 72/20015I once again appeal to our markets to judge South Africa on its performance and not on the basis ofemerging market perception.And once again, my heartfelt thanks to you.
BIS Review 72/20011Urban Bäckström: Sweden’s economy is slowing downSpeech by Mr Urban Bäckström, Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank and Chairman of the Board ofDirectors and President of the Bank for International Settlements, to the Social Democrats,Härnösand, 20 August 2001.*      *      *Thank you for the invitation to discuss economic developments in Sweden here in Härnösand.First let me say that conducting monetary policy in the past year has not been exactly easy. The reporate was raised 0.25 percentage points last December, from 3.75 to 4.0 per cent, and this has beenfollowed by an equally large increase to the present rate of 4.25 per cent. In June, moreover, theRiksbank intervened in the currency market in an endeavour to strengthen the Swedish krona andthereby avert a threat to the 2 per cent inflation target.This evening I shall be attempting to present the Riksbank’s actions as I see them in a widerperspective and convey my view of the challenges we will be facing.Before doing so, however, I want to underscore that a decision by the Riksbank to raise or lower therepo rate does not always appear completely self-evident. In order to avoid an unduly erratic monetarystance, these decisions have to be based on assessments of developments in the period one to twoyears ahead. The current consensus is that this is approximately the time it takes for an interest rateadjustment to exert its full effect and influence the economy in the desired direction. One alternativemight be to act in relation to a shorter time horizon, which would oblige us to adjust the interest ratemore markedly as well as more frequently. Both I and many others believe that would be bad foroutput and employment.As we all know, assessing the future is difficult and the predictions can almost always be questionedand debated. Interest rate decisions by the Riksbank’s Executive Board are preceded by extensivediscussions and our opinions sometimes differ. Disagreements are obviously not intrinsically desirablebut when a group of people have to decide about complex matters, they are liable to reach differentconclusions at times. That happens in business and it also applies to economic policy. The differenceis that the Riksbank is an open institution, which means that our task-masters - ultimately the Swedishnation - can, from the minutes of our meetings, see the basis for a decision, the preceding discussionand the positions Board members have taken. I see that as basically an advantage for people’sconfidence in Sweden’s monetary policy. Having said that, I also want to underscore the broadagreement among members of the Executive Board as to the fundamental framework for our efforts. Itis important to bear that in mind.After these preliminary remarks, I shall now turn to developments in the Swedish economy in recentyears.Sweden’s rapid economic expansion has slowedEconomic growth in Sweden has been strong for a number of years. And although demand has risenrapidly, inflation has been low. This is partly explained by cyclical factors. By this I mean the plentifulsupply of unutilised resources - not least all those who had lost their jobs during the economic crisisthat ravaged Sweden in the early 1990s. That lessened the risk of the upswing in production soonleading to the economy reaching its potential output. But as far as we can judge at present, the morefavourable trend also has to do with an economy that is functioning more efficiently.Sooner or later, however, demand growth that is unduly strong and persistent will generate economicimbalances, whereupon price and wage increases usually tend to accelerate. In time, such adevelopment is liable to turn into a recession, with falling output and rising unemployment. Rapidlyrising inflation is often - though not always - an indication that the economy has been expanding toorapidly and that economic policy has not been sufficiently tight. Economic overheating and risinginflation were in fact a recurrent problem in the 1970s and ’80s. Restricting economic activity whentimes are good has often proved difficult. But sooner or later it has had to be done in ways that werethen more dramatic. Production and employment have then fallen and unemployment has risen.
2BIS Review 72/2001Towards the end of last year we judged that it was time for economic activity in Sweden to startslowing down to the growth rate that is commensurate with a stable long-term trend. Continued growthat a rate around 3 to 4 per cent was not reasonable. Observers usually consider that the Swedisheconomy is capable of long-term growth at an annual rate of about 2 to 2.5 per cent. A similar situationhad been faced for a time by other central banks around the world. In the United States, for example,the Federal Reserve had raised its instrumental rate successively during 1999 and 2000 to 6.5 percent. In Europe, the ECB tightened its rate last year to 4.75 per cent, while the Bank of England’s ratewas raised to 6.0 per cent. The same type of reaction was also evident in other countries.I recall that in the course of last year many observers counted on relatively large interest rate hikes inSweden, too. They thought they saw clear signs that the Swedish economy was on the way tobecoming overheated and argued fairly strongly that the Riksbank should therefore act quickly toincrease its instrumental rate in keeping with other central banks around the world.But the Riksbank arrived at a different assessment and chose instead to proceed more cautiously withinterest rate increases. In our opinion, the relatively favourable inflation prospects last year simply didnot warrant a tighter monetary stance. We kept to the level of 3.75 per cent for practically the whole of2000.In December, however, we did raise the repo rate 0.25 per cent points, from 3.75 to 4.0 per cent. Inother words, a small increase from a level that was a good bit lower than in other comparablecountries. That applies not least in relation to the United States, which I take as an example becausethe central bank there has cut its instrumental rate markedly this spring, a development that of coursehas to be seen in the light of the relatively large increases earlier. It was only in the late spring that therate in the United States came down to the level in Sweden. And it is little more than a month ago thatthe Federal Reserve cut its rate so that this became somewhat lower than the Swedish rate. TheSwedish repo rate had in fact been lower than the American rate for almost five years, sinceSeptember 1996. That is something that is sometimes ignored in the public debate.So the Swedish economy was moving towards a situation where there was a risk of total outputultimately rising too rapidly. There was nothing dramatic about this. Considering the strength ofeconomic activity, it was to be expected. An adjustment of demand to the long-term growth path canoccur either as a spontaneous economic slowdown - for instance because Sweden is affected by aweakening of international activity - or as a consequence of a monetary policy adjustment; it can alsoresult from a combination of the two.We can note that economic activity in the rest of the world, not least in the United States, weakenedappreciably in the first half of this year. The Swedish economy has been affected by this, as is evidentfrom Statistics Sweden’s latest quarterly GDP data. The most recent figures for the national accountsare admittedly preliminary but the tendency behind them is clear: GDP growth fell back from an annualrate of 3-4 per cent in recent years to just under 2 per cent in the first half of this year.Thus, the world economic slowdown has helped to bring about a downward adjustment of demandgrowth in Sweden towards the long-term path without the Riksbank needing to lift the repo rate up tobetween 6 and 7 per cent, as the central banks in a number of other countries have been obliged todo.How does the krona come into it?But it is not only the interest rate that influences the development of demand and ultimately the rate ofinflation. The exchange rate also plays an important part. Among other things, a weak exchange ratetends to stimulate exports and other segments of Swedish production that are exposed to internationalcompetition. That could limit the impact of an international economic slowdown. Conversely, anappreciation of the krona can act as a brake and modify the pull from an economic improvement in therest of the world. Another effect of a weak exchange rate concerns the prices of imported goods andservices, with the risk of a pass-through to consumer prices.In the 1970s and ’80s, currency devaluation was frequently used as an instrument for stimulating theeconomy. The development of demand was boosted via production for export at the same time asimported goods became more expensive. In time, however, inflation began to move up. Now thatSweden has a flexible exchange rate regime, things work somewhat differently. If the krona weakensand firms and households perceive this as a transient movement, the effect on inflation will not be asstrong as before, when a currency write-down was seen as a more permanent measure. This has
BIS Review 72/20013contributed, for example, to an import price pass-through to consumer prices in the 1990s that wassmaller than earlier. But the magnitude of the effects on demand and inflation with a flexible exchangerate regime will obviously depend on how much the value of the krona changes. Even with such aregime, a large shift - upwards or downwards - in the value of the krona will have some effect ondemand and prices.Since last summer the Swedish krona has weakened by between 10 and 15 per cent relative to aweighted currency basket. All else equal and given that such a depreciation were to be permanent, thestimulus to the Swedish economy would be fully equal to the effect on the United States economy ofthe Federal Reserve’s interest rate cuts this spring. Against that background it is accordingly difficult toclaim that aggregate monetary conditions in Sweden have become tighter, even though the Riksbankraised the repo rate last December and, most recently, at the beginning of July.I should point out here that it is not the krona’s current value that features in the Riksbank’s overallinflation forecast and monetary policy. What we use instead, as described in our Inflation Report, is anassessment of the krona’s future path. The krona’s future path is invariably a major factor behind theRiksbank’s inflation forecast. And it is the inflation forecast that forms the foundation for monetarypolicy. Thus, the development of the exchange rate, demand, inflation expectations and so on allaffect the interest rate decision indirectly via the inflation forecast.It is never a simple matter to determine the path for the exchange rate in the coming one to two yearsthat ought to be used in the assessment of inflation. But as long as all reasonable assessments pointto the Swedish economy being in good shape, in the long term that should also motivate an exchangerate that is considerably stronger than we have seen in the past year. In other words, there have beengrounds for counting in the Inflation Report on a somewhat stronger krona even in the period one totwo years ahead that guides monetary policy. But when the krona began falling almost 5 per cent inthe course of only a fortnight early this summer, it ultimately became difficult to count on the exchangerate becoming as strong as the forecast envisaged in the coming two years. The weaker the initialposition, the larger the requisite appreciation. To quote the press release from 15 June, the ExecutiveBoard considered that “The krona’s depreciation since the latest Inflation Report is the most importantsingle factor that may lead to the inflation target being threatened 1-2 years from now”. The Riksbankhad then initiated currency market interventions with a view to strengthening the krona.When the Executive Board met on 5 July the krona was still weak. In the light of the current forecastsof resource utilisation, the exchange rate and demand, a majority of the Board members concludedthat the repo rate should be raised 0.25 percentage points, to 4.25 per cent, in order to avoid the riskof inflation exceeding the target 1-2 years ahead. The picture also included considerable priceincreases during the spring which, although mainly transient, were liable to influence inflationexpectations.The decision was not an easy one for the Executive Board. As the minutes show, it was preceded byan intensive discussion. Three members had a different view. In their opinion, the risk of rising inflationon account of a weak exchange rate was balanced by the risk of economic activity becoming moresubdued. The other members, of whom I was one, concluded, however, that when everything wastaken into account, the spectrum of inflation risks had shifted slightly upwards. The increase was aprecautionary measure. It was also considered important to send a clear signal that the inflation targetis taken very seriously.It was underscored that the decision did not imply anything about the repo rate’s future path. Thatwould be considered as usual at the Riksbank’s regular monetary policy meetings in the light of theoverall picture of inflation prospects.In view of some comments which suggest that the Riksbank’s action has been wrongly interpreted, Iwant to emphasise in particular that the interest rate increase in July did not have the aim ofstrengthening the krona. As I have indicated, an appreciation would be a good thing in itself but theinterest rate increase was actually motivated by a need to counter the risks of inflation that wereconsidered to stem from a weaker currency. Let there be no misunderstandings about that.During the summer the krona has become somewhat stronger, which is welcome. A major factor herehas been the weakening of the dollar. A continued appreciation of our currency would also bewelcome. In relation to the Swedish economy’s sound fundamentals, the krona is still weak.
4BIS Review 72/2001Looking aheadBefore I take a look at future tendencies, it may be in place to emphasise that the Swedish economy isfundamentally sound, with a good potential for growth and employment, accompanied by surpluses onthe current account as well as the public finances. The recent temporary increase in inflation at a timeof slowing activity is a problem that Sweden has in common with other countries around the world.Global economic growth has slowed, as I mentioned, during the spring. The fall-off has been deeperand more protracted than many observers counted on at the beginning of the year. Informationreceived during the summer confirms the impression of a somewhat more drawn-out course, with anupturn that looks like being delayed, in many respects because the key player in the global economy- the United States - is still limping. The imminent recovery presaged by signals early this summer,above all from the financial markets, now seems somewhat more doubtful. The outlook for theJapanese economy is still highly uncertain. And in Europe the growth forecasts for the leadingeconomies have had to be revised downwards.It is perhaps not surprising that after a series of years of strong growth it is taking time to overcome thetensions that arose in the wake of the economic euphoria in the United States. Neither is it odd thatwith an increasingly integrated global economy, the American slowdown is affecting many othercountries, too.After massive investments over a period of years, American companies are now having to cut backplans for expansion. With the abrupt weakening of demand, stocks have become somewhat too large.Share prices, above all in the IT and telecom sector, have fallen sharply during the past year, inkeeping with declining profit expectations. American households have had strong expectations aboutfuture income and wealth, as indicated by high consumption and rising debt in recent years; theseexpectations have now been scaled down and consumption has been affected.The U.S. Federal Reserve cut its instrumental rate six times during the spring, bringing it down to3.75 per cent. But even with this monetary stimulus, the slowdown still seems to be holding its grip onthe American economy. As we know, however, it takes time for interest rate cuts to exert their fulleffect on economic activity.In order to form a picture of what lies ahead, one can start from three alternative explanatory models.The first concerns the notion of the new economy and stresses the U.S. economy’s higher growthpotential, with a rising underlying rate of productivity growth and increased corporate profits that in turnunderpin a higher future return on assets, including listed shares. A more rapid expansion ofproduction capacity and better facilities for managing fluctuations in stocks pave the way for higherdemand and smaller cyclical fluctuations in the future. This is the view that favours a rapid recovery ora V-shaped decline and upswing.The second model is more traditional, with links to the Keynesian school. In the post-war era a longperiod of high demand has regularly given way to an economic slowdown. Historically speaking, thelatest upswing has lasted unusually long, so perhaps it is not so odd that we are now experiencing adecline. But sooner or later activity will pick up, though this will take time. On the other hand, theongoing downward phase will not be all that dramatic.The third model has its roots in the Austrian school and harks back to experience from the 1920s and’30s as well as from before the Great War. Proponents of this view are wont to point out that a periodof growth not infrequently ends in exaggerated optimism and over-investment. When profitexpectations ultimately become more normal, share prices fall and investment undergoes atroublesome adjustment. Sometimes the adjustment problems give rise to some form of financial crisisthat accentuates the downward trend. The economic difficulties in Japan in the 1990s are sometimescited as an example of this model. Another instance is the crisis in the 1930s. Other examples invarious countries are to be found in the period before 1913. This explanatory model suggests that therecovery will take time and it is conceivable that the global economic slowdown will continue for sometime to come.Turning now to the economic situation in Sweden, we can say that activity has slackened as aconsequence of the slowdown elsewhere. Swedish firms that are dependent on exports have been hitin particular, along with their suppliers. At the same time it should be noted that Swedish households,who account for around 50 per cent of demand, have lowered their consumption. Like theircounterparts in the United States, people in Sweden have reduced their expectations about futureincome and wealth. Infrequent purchases, such as cars and household appliances, have fallen in
BIS Review 72/20015particular. Sweden has been hit by the global slowdown in technological sectors such as IT andtelecom; firms are being compelled to undertake structural adjustments  and close down someproduction capacity. But although Sweden is affected more than other countries, on account of thedominance of IT and telecom firms, compared with earlier downturns the situation still looks relativelyfavourable, at least so far.The important thing now is to look to the future. It is not the most recent economic figures thatdetermine the course of events and it is not entirely clear what conclusions should be drawn withregard to developments in one to two years' time. One thing that is clear, however, is that resourceutilisation this year will be slightly lower than economic analysts have been counting on. If it turns outto be true that GDP growth only reaches a figure of just under 2 per cent this year, this willnevertheless be a fairly creditable result for the Swedish economy. This is more or less the growth ratethat characterised the Swedish economy during the period 1975 to 1990. What we are looking at nowis a single year following a period of very rapid expansion and during which the Swedish economy hasbeen exposed to a sudden global slowdown that has largely been concentrated on a sector of greatimportance for Sweden, namely the IT sector. All in all, it would seem reasonable to assume that theconditions for the near future look relatively good for a cautious economic recovery, combined with aninflation rate in line with the Riksbank's target. However, it is important to follow developments closelyin order to detect whether the course of events will strengthen or weaken.
BIS Review 71/20011David Carse: The changing landscape of banking in Hong KongSpeech by Mr David Carse, Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, to the HongKong Investment Funds Association, Furama Hotel, Hong Kong, 15 August 2001.*      *      *Ladies and Gentlemen,Thank you for inviting me to speak to you at the Association's luncheon. My topic today is thechanging landscape of banking in Hong Kong. I shall illustrate this by reference to two of the keyrecent events that are changing that landscape and are going to go on doing so in the years ahead. Iam referring to the deregulation of interest rates, the final phase of which took place on 3 July of thisyear, and the introduction of the Mandatory Provident Fund scheme. I will try to describe theimplications of these for the banking industry and for the regulators. I will also try to place them in thecontext of the broader trends and developments that are taking place in the banking industry.Current industry trendsYou are probably already familiar with some of these trends and developments. The most obvious oneis the increasing intensity of competition. This is a global phenomenon, whose full effects have onlyrecently hit Hong Kong. It has shown here up in the sharp decline in lending margins, particularly onresidential mortgages. It is a sobering thought that the interest rate on a 30-year mortgage in HongKong is now down to as low as 4.25%, more than 1 percentage point below the yield on a AAA-rated,US Treasury bond. It is no surprise that some banks are losing enthusiasm for the downward spiral inmortgage rates and are standing back. Among other things, this is showing up in an increasedappetite for investment in bonds.The fall in lending margins is a classic case of too much money chasing too little demand. The impactis, however, being softened to some extent by the favourable impact of the excess liquidity on depositmargins. Partly as a result, underlying profits seem to have held up reasonably well in the first half ofthe year despite the difficult operating conditions.We are, however, only part of the way through the reporting season and it will take a bit longer tocome up with definitive conclusions about the interim results. As always, some banks have done betterthan others, and it is worth looking at two of the factors that help to deliver a superior performance.The first of these is skill in asset-liability management. This is necessary to enable banks to widendeposit margins as lending margins shrink. It means, among other things, trying to reduce reliance onhigh cost deposits, trying to persuade depositors to consolidate deposits with your bank and lookingfor alternative funding sources, including long-term debt. Another objective is to reduce the basis riskthat arises from having liabilities in the form of time deposits that are linked with HIBOR and loans thatare linked to prime. The deregulated environment that banks now face will add new complications tothe process of managing interest rate and liquidity risks. I shall return to the subject of deregulation ina moment.A second prerequisite for success is the need for banks to develop new sources of income. It looks asif the days of easy profits from mortgage lending have gone, and the banks now need to work harderto generate income growth. The introduction of new fees and charges on deposit accounts is onemanifestation of this process. Another is the increasing shift of some banks into higher margin, butalso higher risk, products such as credit cards and other types of personal finance.Banks are also trying to become financial service providers rather than just banks. The aim is not justto broaden income sources, but also to reduce the volatility of income through more reliance onrecurring fees and commissions. One way of achieving this is to move into the realm of wealthmanagement, by which I mean securities, unit trusts, insurance, pensions and private banking. Theinterim results of some of the local banks showed a growing contribution from this area, includingparticularly sales of guaranteed funds. As a result, I understand that May of this year was one of thebest ever months for fund sales in Hong Kong.
2BIS Review 71/2001The impact of interest rate deregulationI have tried to show so far how interest rate deregulation fits into the broader industry trends. I will nowsay a bit more about what the impact of the latest, and final, round of deregulation has been. Thisinvolved removing the interest rate cap on Hong Kong dollar savings accounts and allowing interest tobe paid on current accounts. It was the end of a process that began in 1994 when we began toderegulate time deposits. Some would say that the process has been unduly protracted. But I thinkthat it was reasonable to be cautious, since experience elsewhere shows that liberalisation is all toooften accompanied by instability.As it has turned out, the final stage of deregulation probably could not have happened at a better time– at least from the point of view of protecting the regulator's peace of mind. The ample liquidity in thebanking system has reduced the risk of an aggressive price war for deposits, which was the HKMA'sprincipal concern. So we have ended up with a Little Bang rather than a Big Bang. But I shouldemphasise that less than two months have passed since the interest rate controls were finally lifted.Any conclusions about the impact of deregulation can only be tentative at this stage.Some of what has happened was predicted at the time the decision to deregulate was taken.Deregulation has been the catalyst – the more cynical would say the excuse – for banks to introducefees and charges on deposit accounts. Most banks have also introduced tiered savings accounts, withhigher interest rates being paid on larger balances. Sometimes the rate depends on the range of thebank's products and services that the customer uses. The converse is that some banks are nowpaying less than the standard rate on small deposits. A further innovation is that in a few cases thereare savings products that are linked to HIBOR.Banks have not rushed to pay interest on conventional current accounts, though some have offeredcombined savings and deposit accounts that pay interest. At least one bank offers an auto-sweepingservice from savings to current accounts. Such products are effectively offering interest on currentaccounts. Generally speaking, the amounts deposited in the innovative current and savings accountsare still quite small.Perhaps the biggest surprise so far has been that some of the banks have been able to lower theirbenchmark savings account rate to 1.75%, which is probably 25bp below what it would have beenwithout deregulation. A few years ago, when the debate about deregulation was taking place, theconventional wisdom was that the savings rate was artificially depressed and would rise closer to timedeposit rates after the cap was lifted. So far this has not been the case. Indeed, it appears that theinterest rate rules effectively imposed a floor as well as a cap.In the current liquid conditions, therefore, the large banks have been able to cut their standard savingsrate. They are therefore seen by some analysts as the winners from deregulation since they now haveanother lever to adjust their net interest margin. The unanswered question is whether they will be ableto get away without a significant erosion of deposits in savings and current accounts. A certain amountof switching of accounts has gone on. But there is not enough evidence at this stage to concludewhether deregulation has resulted in any significant redistribution of deposits among banks. So wecannot tell how interest elastic the demand for savings accounts may prove to be, particularly intoday's somewhat artificial conditions of high liquidity. However, what can be said is that deregulationdoes offer the smaller banks an enhanced ability to compete for savings accounts and for thosecustomers which the large banks may be less eager to retain. While the smaller banks may have topay a higher rate for their savings deposits, they will still benefit if they can substitute such funds foreven higher cost, and less stable, time deposits.Consumers will also benefit from deregulation through greater choice of savings products and, forthose with larger balances at least, from higher interest rates. However, we have to face the fact thatnot all depositors will be better off in the deregulated world. The harsh laws of economics mean thatthose with smaller balances may suffer disproportionately from new fees and charges and receive lesscompensation in the form of higher interest. Competition will help to address this concern to someextent since banks have adopted different charging and interest rate policies. Customers shouldtherefore be prepared to shop around for the best offer. Diversity of approach among banks shouldalso help to mitigate the risk that an increasing proportion of the population will be excluded from thebanking system by prohibitive costs. But this is something that both the Government and the banks willneed to keep an eye on as the effects of deregulation work their way through.
BIS Review 71/20013The Mandatory Provident FundThe Mandatory Provident Fund is another innovation that is bringing new challenges and opportunitiesfor the banks and their related companies. The opportunities come from the chance to earn a streamof annuity-type revenue stretching out into the distant future. The assets under management in MPFfunds are already building up faster than expected and amounted to about HK$22 billion at the end ofMay. This includes assets transferred from ORSO schemes. The combination of regular contributionsand long-term investment returns means that MPF assets may total several hundred billion dollars inten years time. This will earn the MPF participants an annual all-in fee of around 1.75% of the assets,though this will have to be shared among the various service providers.The challenges come from the cost and effort of putting in place the necessary systems and personnelto handle what is a complex business and which carries a high degree of reputation risk if somethinggoes wrong. Success in the MPF business also requires an established customer base, gooddistribution networks and strong brand image.All this means that the MPF is not a business where small players can hope to be successful on astand-alone basis. Even for the large companies that have captured the lion's share of the business,the start-up costs and the ongoing expenses mean that it will probably take a few years for them tobreak even and still longer to achieve a reasonable return of capital. However, this should not blind usto the strategic importance of the MPF for the banking and financial services industry in Hong Kong.This is why it was vital for the smaller banks to pool their resources in the Bank Consortium Trust. Thishas enabled them to establish a credible vehicle and win a market share that is probably larger thanthe shareholders could have achieved if they had acted independently.The strategic appeal of the MPF lies not simply in the long-term profit opportunities that it offersdirectly. It is also that it will help to build a relationship with both employers and their employees thatcan be used to generate cross-selling opportunities. This will be aided by the fact that the relationshipestablished via the MPF is likely to be a sticky one, and companies are unlikely to shift to anotherscheme unless there are good reasons to do so. This does not mean, however, that MPF providerscan afford to provide a bad service. If they do, they will destroy goodwill and make it more difficult tosell other products.The cross-selling opportunities provided by the MPF are not theoretical. There are already signs that itis making an impact on sales of other funds to individuals. As your Association recently announced,the fund penetration rate in Hong Kong has risen from 7.8% to 10% in a year. This is a creditableperformance in view of the weakness in the stock market. One of the reasons for the increasingwillingness to invest in funds is undoubtedly the low return now offered by bank deposits. However, italso appears that the marketing of the MPF over the last year has helped by focussing employees'attention on the attractions of funds for long-term savings purposes and on the need to plan forretirement.The role of the regulatorsI have talked so far about the involvement of the banks in MPF business. In practice, however, the roleplayed by banks themselves is mainly to act as intermediaries, selling and advising on MPF schemes.The various MPF services – trustee, administrator, custodian and investment manager – are generallyprovided by other companies which may be related to the bank. What this means is that the MPFbrings together a number of different companies and, along with these companies, their variousregulators: the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority, the Securities and FuturesCommission, the Insurance Authority and the HKMA.The involvement of four regulators creates an obvious need for clarity on their respective roles andcoordination of these roles. The MPFA is clearly in the driving seat as the lead regulator. It has theresponsibility to administer the MPF Ordinance and to ensure compliance with the legislation. Itapproves and regulates the trustees who have the central role in ensuring that schemes are properlymanaged.The MPFA has also produced a code of conduct for MPF intermediaries. However, the day-to-daysupervision of such intermediaries rests with the SFC, Insurance Authority and HKMA depending onwhich of us is the main regulator of the intermediary in question. The SFC also has a role to play inauthorising MPF funds and in the licensing and supervision of investment managers and advisers.
4BIS Review 71/2001This may seem complicated, but it seems to work. The arrangements have been cemented by aMemorandum of Understanding among the various parties and through the establishment of a MPFIntermediaries Regulation Coordinating Committee that comprises representatives of the fourregulators and the Financial Services Bureau. At a higher level, all the various parties are representedon the Council of Financial Regulators, which is chaired by the Financial Secretary and whose remit isto address cross-sectoral regulatory issues.Similar issues of division of responsibility and coordination arise in relation to the issue of supervisionof banks' securities business. As you know, this is a somewhat controversial issue because of theexemption that banks and other authorised institutions enjoy from much of the current securitieslegislation. Although this exempt status is retained in the new Securities and Futures Bill currentlygoing through Legco, the scope of the exemption will be drastically reduced and the banks will in factbe exempt in name only under the new legislation.In future, in respect of their securities business, banks will be subject to most of the same legislation,rules and standards of conduct that will apply to the brokers. These rules and standards will be set bythe SFC, in consultation where necessary with the HKMA. The HKMA will act as the front-lineregulator of the banks' securities business on a day-to-day basis. That way the banks should normallyhave to deal with only one regulator, which should make their lives simpler. But, like the MPFA inrespect of MPF business, the SFC will remain in the driving seat; and if problems arise in respect of abank's securities business, the SFC will have the right to conduct its own investigation and to exercisedisciplinary powers.There is much more that I could say on the subject of banks' securities business, but that is perhapsbest left to another speech. I will conclude, therefore, by noting again that economic pressures in thebanking industry are driving banks to try to diversify their income sources. This is contributing toerosion of the boundaries between different types of financial business. A consequence of this is thatnew approaches to financial regulation are also required. What we have done in Hong Kong is tocome up with a pragmatic approach that tries to strike a balance between institutional and functionalsupervision. We believe that, with the goodwill and cooperation of all concerned, this can, and will, bemade to work.
BIS Review 70/20011Pridiyathorn Devakula: Monetary policy in Thailand: current challenges andprospectsSpeech by M.R. Pridiyathorn Devakula, Governor of the Bank of Thailand, to the APFA 2001Conference held in Bangkok, 24 July 2001.*      *      *President of APFA, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen,It is an honour to address the 8th Asia Pacific Financial Association Annual Conference, and towelcome the distinguished members of the Asia Pacific financial community. Judging by theattendance I trust that this three-day event will prove most fruitful and rewarding for all participants.I would like to discuss today the current challenges facing monetary policy in Thailand and what we, atthe Bank of Thailand, have set out to do to meet those challenges.In so doing, I will briefly review the progress of the past few years, and look forward to some keyemphases of our current policies.The current situationOn July 2nd this year newspapers in Thailand ran headline stories to remind us of the four-year ordealsince the floating of the baht and the ensuing economic and financial crisis. These have been difficultyears as the economy fought hard to regain macroeconomic and financial stability, and the confidenceof financial markets.Economic growth shrank by more than 10 percent in 1998. Underlying this was a sharp correction inthe current account in response to the depreciation of the exchange rate. The correction wassubstantial. The investment-saving gap moved to surpluses averaging 10 percent of GDP in the firstthree years after the crisis, from the pre-crisis deficits average of 7 percent of GDP before 1997.Such magnitude of change is indicative of the depth of the adjustment Thailand had to go through.Although the initial imbalance in the lead up to the crisis was not small, the adjustment was amplifiedpartly by the wave of contagion effect in the early years of the crisis which brought pressure on thecapital account, the exchange rate, and growth.Now, while we can look back to the last two years of growth of around 4 percent, signs of fragility stillabound, with important issues remaining to be resolved. This includes the continued reform of thebanking sector and the resolution of the costs of financial sector restructuring. The main fragility in therecovery process at this time is the weakness in domestic demand. The problem is compounded bythe slow growth in bank credit and the weak corporate balance sheets, particularly the non-exportsector.Unfortunately, the current external environment does not bode well for the recovery, going forward.The global slowdown is posing strains on Thailand’s export, and is adding pressure to the currentaccount and external stability. Official GDP forecast this year is around 2.0-2.5 percent. Given thechange in external environment, this year will be more a time for consolidation than for expansion. Akey challenge confronting macroeconomic policy in Thailand is to safeguard the pace of recoverywhile maintaining macroeconomic stability and financial discipline, and at the same time continuingwith the essential reforms.Past recordsBefore moving on to discuss the challenges facing Thai monetary policy, I would like to review someof the notable progress of the last few years. There have been gains that should further be expanded.Macroeconomic and financial stability has been restored. Inflation remains low and stable. Thailand’sinternational reserve position is healthy.Surpluses in the external current account of these few years have been matched almost entirely byfalls in external debt, especially short-term debt. Such reversed flows have been instrumental inavoiding a real currency appreciation and loss of competitiveness.
2BIS Review 70/2001The surplus on the external current account is expected to continue this year, although at a somewhatlower level. This would allow the debt stock to fall further as scheduled repayments are made. About50 percent of the existing non-bank private debt stock represents debt contracted after the crisis,including some rollovers which were done under new contract. This means that private sector inThailand currently has no difficulties in gaining access to the international financial markets. Reflectingthis, the spreads of Thai Government bond yields over US Treasuries have narrowed while Thailand’ssovereignty credit ratings remain stable.The financial system has now stabilized, but much work still lies ahead.To restore stability to the financial system, the most immediate step taken was to ensure that financialinstitutions have adequate capital to withstand future risks. The sources of capital were to come fromthe private sector including the original shareholders and new partners, both Thai and foreign.As it turns out, in some cases, the authorities did eventually provide a recapitalisation scheme.Nevertheless, this scheme was not much utilized by banks. In fact, only 74 billion baht of the schemewas actually used.Another important step taken to stabilize the financial system was to raise the prudential andsupervision standards such as the rules on loan classification, provisioning, asset valuation, just toname a few examples, to be in line with international standards.As a result, commercial banks in Thailand have gradually recovered from the crisis. Here are somefacts and numbers.(cid:1) The banking sector now has a capital adequacy ratio of 11.9%.(cid:1) The Thai banks recorded a better result in the first quarter of this year. They turned in a profitof 1.9 billion compared to a loss of 39 billion baht in the same period last year, as loanprovision expenses declined significantly. This is partly due to the large provisioning and lossrecognition, which were already taken last year. In addition, there has been substantialprogress in debt restructuring the Thai banks recorded.(cid:1) Debt restructuring as well as some positive environment in the economy, especially buoyantexport growth in 1998 until the first half of 1999, together with the transfer of NPL to AMCand write-off alter full provisioning, helped NPL to decline from the peak of 48% of credit inmid 1999 to around 18% presently.The current challengesAgainst this background of achievements, I would now like to turn to the current challenges.The first is the challenge facing monetary policy.Key concern of macroeconomic policy in Thailand at this time is the weak domestic economy. Thisconcern has been met by an accommodative stance of fiscal and monetary policies. But the externalenvironment in which the Thai economic policy operates has changed considerably since the end oflast year. The global economy is now slowing with possible substantial impact on the growthperformance of the regional economies and on financial markets.Because of the strong dependency on exports, Asia will be one region most affected by the slowdown.Many countries have revised downward their export and growth estimates. Some have seen increasedpressure on the external current account and the exchange rate. A key risk to the current environmentis the global slowdown coinciding with a period of increased market volatility. This increase in marketvolatility could come about following possible further repricing of financial assets in the key marketsabroad.Because excessive market volatility is not supportive of businesses, monetary policy will have to bewatchful of financial developments abroad and to take account of the impacts that the globalslowdown might have on external stability.Under the managed float, Thailand’s monetary policy is operating under an inflation-targetingframework. As the economy slows, the current domestic inflation rates remain low. Going forward, ouranalysis shows that inflation will not pose a policy concern in the immediate future.
BIS Review 70/20013But with considerable uncertainty in the economic situations abroad, I believe monetary policy willneed to take heed of both internal and external stability. This balance of emphasis will provideThailand with some flexibility in dealing with the pressure that could stem from the external front. Inessence, I see the need for monetary policy in the period ahead to be vigilant and give due safeguardsto both internal and external stability.One question often asked is, “Does the continued emphasis on stability mean that monetary policy isabandoning growth?”The current policy preference for now is clear – stability ahead of growth. And to qualify this, I wouldlike to make three points.First, an important pre-condition for growth on a sustained basis is a stable macroeconomicenvironment. To this end, the best contribution that monetary policy can make to promote growth is toensure continuity of macroeconomic and financial stability. I remarked earlier that macroeconomic andfinancial stability are the gains we have made in the last few years. They are the gains that we mustcontinue to preserve.Second, the increased emphasis of monetary policy towards external stability so far has not put unduepressure on key domestic interest rates. They remain broadly accommodating. This is because of thelarge liquidity overhang in the banking system. I believe interest rates at the current levels areappropriate and consistent with the need to support the recovery of domestic demand, provideincentives for corporate debt restructuring, and maintain the economy’s cost competitiveness.And third, in addressing the issues of growth with stability, we must look for a proper coordination offiscal and monetary policies. At this time, fiscal policies will have a dominant role in reviving theweaknesses in domestic demand. The Government has been cautious to balance fiscal stimulusmeasures within the context of longer-term fiscal sustainability. The role of monetary policy is toensure the continuity of macroeconomic and financial stability.Ladies and gentlemen,One of the key concerns over Thailand’s long-term fiscal sustainability has been the issue of how theGovernment will find solutions to the remaining cost of financial restructuring. The cost, which includesthe remaining uncovered losses up to now plus the contingent losses for the next three years, iscurrently estimated at 774 billion baht or about 17.2 billion US Dollar.On this issue, yesterday, the Thai authorities announced a plan which would constitute acomprehensive solution to this problem. The solution centres on a programme of Governmentguaranteed bond issue that would provide for the full financing of the estimated cost. This programmeof bond issuance will run for a maximum period of twenty years, and the financings will be provided forin the Government budget. This incorporation is projected to keep the share of the debt-service ratio toan average of 13.6% of the Government budget in the first decade and 11.5% in the second decade.This means that there will be little crowding-out effects on the Government’s investment expenditure inthe period ahead, while the public debt stock-to-GDP is projected to trend down in the long term.With this programme, Thailand’s long-term fiscal sustainability is now assured.With monetary stability in place and fiscal stability enshrined in the Government’s long-term fiscalsustainability framework, I believe the operating environment in Thailand in the period ahead will bemore assured and remain conducive to growth. But to really put the growth engine back on its feet,notably the recovery of the domestic demand, more works will have to be done at the micro level toremove the bottlenecks that inhibits the real economy.This leads to our second challenge: to put the banking system back to normal lending.Our banking system is returning to health and profitability with strengthened capital base, and a muchlower level of non-performing loans. Yet, the growth in credit has been very minimal with depositgrowth rising and liquidity remaining ample. Finding solutions to this problem is not going to be easy.But this is where efforts to revive the domestic economy will need to focus on.New lending is perceived as risky given the current negative factors on the macro fronts and externalfactors, while NPL overhang preoccupied bankers’ attention and kept them from renewing their clientrelationship.To address this problem, the authorities have chosen to approach the problem in three ways:
4BIS Review 70/2001(cid:1) First, to further accelerate corporate debt restructuring by improving the legal frameworksand by setting up a national asset management corporation to deal with the remainingunresolved problem loans. Progress on this front is most visible. The law establishing theThai Asset Management Corporation, or TAMC, was passed and operations set to beginsoon with all asset transfer to be completed by September. A key benefit of TAMC is theadvantage of being a single creditor of the transferred asset. This would allow TAMC to dealeffectively and speedily with the unresolved debts that involve multiple creditors. Also, thevast executive powers given to TAMC by law would make it easier for TAMC to take acomprehensive approach to debt restructuring, and have the ability to deal with cases thatmight warrant corporate restructuring and change of management.(cid:1) Second, to introduce a scheme of credit guarantees which would provide a facility of risk-sharing between corporate borrowers, the Government, and banks based on marketmechanism.(cid:1) Third, to work with the management of the state banks and commercial banks to facilitatetheir resumption of lending without compromising the banks’ own risk management and theBank of Thailand’s own supervisory standards.On our part, the Bank of Thailand has improved the credit information system through fostering theestablishment of credit bureaus, which provide the much-needed infrastructure for the resumption ofnew credit. Meanwhile, we will continue to adhere to the best practices in prudential standards, andlook to further improving the standards.Let me now turn to the third challenge: Rebuilding our financial architecture.This is an area that the Bank of Thailand takes leadership role to strengthen the soundness andefficiency of the financial institutions. Our leadership must lead to outcome which makes practicalsense, measures up to international best practices, and must be market-oriented and suitable toThailand.So far, we have laid down necessary groundwork to tackle short-term difficulties, such as thepersisting non-performing loan problems, the lack of credit growth, or the restoration of financial sectorsoundness. Long-term prosperity however requires more. It requires a new financial architecture andcorresponding market infrastructures to foster competition and efficiency while ensuring a non-recurrence of past problems.Specifically, in the world where financial innovations, economic integration, and technologicaladvancements bring nations and markets closer and define a new paradigm for competition forfinancial service industries, the rebuilding of our financial architecture becomes vital for our long-termsuccesses, if not survival.Given such a challenge, which direction are we heading?(cid:1) Going forward, we must improve our financial architecture to raise efficiency and ensurenationwide access to financial services.(cid:1) In term of market competition, the opening up of our banking system has accelerated thetransfer of technical knowledge and ensured competition for our domestic financialinstitutions.(cid:1) In term of market structure, the new Financial Institutions Bill – currently at the Senate and isexpected to be passed in the course of this year – will provide a legal and formal frameworkthat accommodates the establishment of financial conglomerates. Financial institutions willbe allowed to offer varieties of financial services such as insurance or securities through theirsubsidiaries. Though this is still a step away from universal banking model where all financialservices will be offered under one entity but the draft law is flexible enough to make room forsuch eventuality, and in the meantime boost competition.(cid:1) Among the major milestone in the law are: consolidated supervision of financialconglomerates, unified legal framework for both banks and finance companies, and promptcorrective actions for weak financial institutions.(cid:1) As for the availability of our financial services and product qualities, our recent surveyof financial product availability within Thailand indicated that market participants are keen toexpand product range, thus structural impediments obstructing them need to be dealt with.
BIS Review 70/20015The Bank of Thailand has announced new rules for the Internet banking – simply what canbe done over the counter, will be allowed over the Internet. This should facilitatedevelopment of financial products in this area.(cid:1) And for the alternate forms of financial intermediaries, capital market, bond market, andequity market will play a greater role in the future. They will help increase the efficiency ofour banks’ operations by providing new instruments to help manage, mitigate and repackagerisks.(cid:1) The second agenda of the financial sector reform is enhancing our risk managementcapacity, particularly of the Thai regulatory bodies and financial institutions. On this front,our Supervision Group have moved from regulation and transaction-testing toward risk-based supervision early this year.(cid:1) From our preliminary assessment, these changes have fostered corresponding andencouraging changes in the Thai financial institutions. Several have hired foreign consultantsto transfer the know-how and adopted the best international practices on risk management,while many have imported several standard off-the-shelves risk management software tohelp improve their current practices. Of course, there remain several impediments to change;these include scarce and expensive human resource in this particular field, and it is evenmore difficult to re-engineer the business process to ensure that such resources areemployed productively.(cid:1) The New Accord is a major challenge and milestone in this area. The Bank of Thailand hasbeen working closely with the banking communities in Thailand, on how to implement it inpractices.(cid:1) Though we applaud the Basel Committee in their efforts to create a framework that is moresensitive to risk and incentive compatible, I believe there are many areas which wouldbenefit from closer consultation with the academia.(cid:1) First, to apply the Internal Rating-Based approach or the IRB approach of the New Accordrequires a substantial build-up of capacity: Human resource, Database, Business modelre-engineering, to name but few.(cid:1) As far as the data on the default probability on credit risk is concerned, most countries thatjust embarked on developing the required database will be at a disadvantage with a shorterand probably less representative series. Moreover, for those just recovering from crisis suchas Thailand, the implied risk from such series collected during the crisis period will be higherthan average over a complete business cycle. Thus, developing countries will find a highcost before emerging from crisis.Ladies and gentlemen,(cid:1) This pro-cyclical aspect of the default statistics may be an important issue for the globaleconomic recovery.(cid:1) Secondly, some technical aspects remain unclear. In many cases, capital is being calculatedto support both expected and unexpected losses, and overly costly.(cid:1) Thirdly, the proposed capital charge for operational risk needs to be made more refined,incentive compatible to risk management, and more practical and less cumbersome in itsapplication.The third aspect of our financial reform is market discipline.(cid:1) We recognise that sound corporate governance, both in banks and their borrowers, willprovide discipline from within, while public disclosure will allow market force to discipline thefinancial institutions from the outside.(cid:1) We will launch a new Directors’ Handbook for the financial community, which will furtherencourage understanding and motivation behind good governance, and we will alsoendeavour to improve the transparency of appointment and compensation.Ladies and gentlemen,
6BIS Review 70/2001The last challenge I want to share with you is the strengthening of the Bank of Thailand to meetfuture challenges.The crisis of 1997 brought to light weakness in Thailand’s financial management. The Bank ofThailand like most central banks in the region, have had to go through sea of changes in the wake ofthe crisis, and undergo intensive reform of its operation and organization.  Three areas of change inparticular that stands out as our major achievements are internal reorganization, strengthening theframework for monetary policy under inflation targeting, and enhancing communication andtransparency of operation.At the onset of the crisis, the Bank of Thailand underwent major restructuring in the organizationstructure, data management and work process. These were aimed to ensure the good foundation inour decision-making process particularly with monetary policy implementation and financial institutionsupervision. A risk management unit has been established to manage operational risks moreeffectively, by reviewing and monitoring areas of risks in central bank operations with a view to takingforward looking risk mitigation actions.Another important area that has been strengthened is in the process of monetary policy operation. Theinflation targeting framework adopted by Thailand provides sufficient flexibility to take care of thechallenges facing the economy. Through regular communication with the market and through opendiscussions on public policy issues, the central bank has fostered and enhanced the participation ofacademic and market interests.The Bank of Thailand’s monetary policy-making process was reformed to ensure a balance oftransparency, independence and accountability. This is with the belief that transparency of operationlimits discretion and leads to accountability. The Bank quickly moved towards greater openness in theprovision of data and timely economic information. It is our belief that public acceptance andunderstanding of monetary policy is most important. And this will come about only with greatertransparency and predictability.ConclusionLadies and gentlemen,In conclusion, I hope that I have given you some updates and direction of where we are heading inthis current environment. The experiences of Thailand are not significantly different from othercountries emerging from a crisis and I therefore welcome any comments and suggestions which youmay have.Before leaving you today, may I thank you once again for the honour to address this distinguishedforum. I would also like to congratulate the organizers, specially the Sasin Graduate School and theFaculty of Commerce and Accounting of Chulalongkorn University for successfully organizing a highprofile international conference. Our thanks also go to Professor Carl Chiarella, the current Presidentof APFA for his untiring efforts in guiding the APFA activities and a warm welcome the newly electedAPFA President, Dean Professor K.C. Chan.I wish you a successful and enjoyable term.Thank you for your attention.
BIS Review 68/20011Laurence H Meyer: Federal deposit insurance reformTestimony of Mr Laurence H Meyer, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem, before the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit of the Committee onFinancial Services, US House of Representatives, 26 July 2001.*      *      *It is a pleasure, Mr Chairman, to appear before this subcommittee to present the views of the Board ofGovernors of the Federal Reserve System on deposit insurance reform as proposed by the FederalDeposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) this past spring. At this point, the Federal Reserve Board’sviews are necessarily general because the FDIC’s recommendations were purposefully quite broad.That said, on behalf of the Board I want to compliment the FDIC for an excellent report that highlightsthe issues and develops an integrated framework for addressing them. We urge the Congress to usethat framework for promptly developing a detailed legislative proposal that addresses the mostimportant deficiencies in our current deposit insurance system. I hope my comments this morning willbe helpful in doing so.Benefits and costs of deposit insuranceAs background to our suggestions, the Board believes it is important first to understand the benefitsand costs of deposit insurance. Deposit insurance has played a key – at times even critical – role inachieving the stability in banking and financial markets that has characterized the past almost seventyyears. Deposit insurance, combined with other components of our banking safety net – the FederalReserve’s discount window and payment system guarantees – and with enhanced macroeconomicstability resulting from monetary and fiscal policies, has meant that periods of financial stress are nolonger characterized by depositor runs on banks and thrifts. Quite the opposite: Asset holders nowseek out deposits as safe havens when they have strong doubts about other financial assets.Looking beyond the contribution of deposit insurance to overall financial stability, we should notminimize the security it has brought to millions of households and small businesses. Deposit insurancehas provided a safe and secure place for those households and small businesses with relativelymodest amounts of financial assets to hold their transaction and other balances.These benefits of deposit insurance, as significant as they are, have not come without cost. The verysame process that has ended deposit runs has made insured depositors largely indifferent to the riskstaken by their banks because their funds are not at risk if their institution is unable to meet itsobligations. As a result, the market discipline to control risks that insured depositors would otherwisehave imposed on banks and thrifts has been weakened. Relieved of that discipline, banks and thriftsnaturally feel less inhibited from taking on more risk than they would otherwise assume. No other typeof private financial institution is able to attract funds from the public without regard to the risk it takeswith its creditors’ resources. This incentive to take excessive risks is the so-called moral hazardproblem of deposit insurance, the inducement to take risk at the expense of the insurer.Because of the reduced market discipline and moral hazard, there is an intensified need forgovernment supervision to protect the interests of taxpayers and, in essence, substitute for thereduced market discipline. Deposit insurance and other components of the safety net also enablebanks and thrifts to attract more resources than would otherwise be the case. In short, insured banksand thrifts receive a subsidy in the form of a government guarantee that allows them both to attractdeposits at lower interest rates than would be required without deposit insurance and to take more riskwithout the fear of losing their deposit funding. Put another way, deposit insurance misallocatesresources by breaking the link between risks and rewards for a select set of market competitors.From the very beginning, deposit insurance has involved a tradeoff. On the one hand, there arebenefits from the contribution of deposit insurance to overall financial stability and the protection ofsmall depositors. On the other hand, deposit insurance imposes costs from the inducement torisk-taking, the misallocation of resources, and the increased need for government supervision toprotect the taxpayers’ interests. The crafting of reforms of the deposit insurance system must struggleto balance these tradeoffs. Moreover, the Board urges, we should be reasonably certain that any
2BIS Review 68/2001reforms are aimed primarily at protecting the public interest and not the profits or market shares ofparticular businesses.The Federal Reserve Board believes that deposit insurance reforms should be designed to preservethe benefits of heightened financial stability and the protection of small depositors without at the sametime increasing moral hazard or reducing market discipline. This view underpins the response of theFederal Reserve Board to the FDIC’s recommendations. In addition, although at this time we areresponding to very broad recommendations, we urge that the implementing details be kept asstraightforward as possible to minimize the risk of unintended consequences that comes withcomplexity.Recommendations for reformThe FDIC has made five broad recommendations.1.Merging BIF and SAIFThe Board strongly supports the FDIC’s proposal to merge the BIF and SAIF funds. Because thecharters and operations of banks and thrifts have become so similar, it makes no sense to continuethe separate funds. Separate funds reflect the past, but neither the present nor the future. Equallyimportant, the insurance products provided to the two sets of institutions are identical, and thus thepremiums should be identical as well. Under current arrangements, the premiums could differsignificantly if one of the funds fell below the designated reserve ratio of 1.25 percent of insureddeposits and the other fund did not. Merging the funds would also diversify their risks and reduceadministrative expenses.2.Statutory restrictions on premiumsCurrent law requires the FDIC to impose higher premiums on riskier banks and thrifts but restricts itsability to impose any premium on well-capitalized and highly-rated institutions whenever thecorresponding fund’s reserves exceed 1.25 percent of insured deposits. The Board strongly endorsesthe FDIC recommendations that would (1) require that a premium be imposed on every insureddepository institution, no matter how well capitalized and well rated it may be or how high the fund’sreserves, and (2) eliminate the statutory restrictions on risk-based pricing.The current statutory requirement that free deposit insurance be provided to well-capitalized andwell-rated banks when FDIC reserves exceed a predetermined ratio maximizes the subsidy providedto these institutions and is inconsistent with efforts to avoid inducing moral hazard. Put differently, thecurrent rule requires the government to give away its valuable guarantee when fund reserves meetsome ceiling level. This free guarantee is of value to banks and thrifts even when they themselves arein sound financial condition and when macroeconomic times are good. At the end of last year,92 percent of banks and thrifts were paying no premium. Included in this group were banks that havenever paid any premium for their, in some cases substantial, coverage and fast-growing entitieswhose past premiums were extraordinarily small relative to their current coverage. We believe thatthese anomalies were never intended by the framers of the Deposit Insurance Fund Act of 1996 andshould be addressed by the Congress.The Congress did intend that the FDIC impose risk-based premiums, but the 1996 Act limits the abilityof the FDIC to impose risk-based premiums on well-capitalized and well-rated banks. And these twovariables – capital strength and examiner overall rating – do not capture all of the risk that banks andthrifts could create for the insurer. The Board believes the FDIC should be free to establish riskcategories based on any well-researched economic variables and to impose premiums commensuratewith these risk classifications. Although a robust risk-based premium system would be technicallydifficult to design, a closer link between insurance premiums and individual bank or thrift risk wouldreduce moral hazard and the distortions in resource allocation that accompany deposit insurance.We note, however, that significant benefits in this regard are likely to require a substantial range ofpremiums but that the FDIC has concluded in its report that premiums for the riskiest banks wouldprobably need to be capped in order to avoid inducing failure at these weaker institutions. We believethat capping premiums may end up costing the insurance fund more in the long run should these weakinstitutions fail anyway, with the delay increasing the ultimate cost of resolution. The Board has
BIS Review 68/20013concluded, therefore, that if a cap is required, it should be set quite high so that risk-based premiumscan be as effective as possible in deterring excessive risk-taking.3.Designated reserve ratios and premiumsThe current law establishes a designated reserve ratio for BIF and SAIF of 1.25 percent. If that ratio isexceeded, the statute requires that premiums on well-capitalized and well-rated banks must bediscontinued. If the ratio declines below 1.25 percent, the FDIC must develop a set of premiums torestore the reserve ratio to 1.25 percent; if it appears that the fund ratio cannot be restored to itsstatutorily designated level in twelve months, the law requires that a premium of at least 23 basispoints be imposed on the least risky category of banks.These requirements are clearly procyclical, lowering or eliminating fees in good times when bankcredit is readily available and fund reserves should be built up, and abruptly increasing fees sharply intimes of weakness when bank credit availability is under pressure and fund resources are drawn downto cover the resolution of failed banks. The FDIC recommends that surcharges or rebates should beused to bring the fund back to the target reserve ratio gradually. The FDIC also recommends thepossibility of a target range for the designated reserve ratio, over which the premiums may remainconstant, rather than a fixed target reserve ratio and abruptly changing premiums.We strongly support such increased flexibility and smoothing of premiums. Indeed, we recommendthat the FDIC’s suggested target reserve range be widened in order to reduce the need to changepremiums sharply. Any floor or ceiling, regardless of its level, could result in requiring that premiumsbe increased at exactly the time when banks and thrifts could be under stress and, similarly, thatpremiums be reduced at the time that depositories are in the best position to fund an increase inreserves. Building a larger fund in good times and permitting it to decline when necessary areprerequisites to less variability in the premium. In addition to widening the range, the Board wouldrecommend that the FDIC be given the latitude to temporarily relax floor or ceiling ratios on the basisof current and anticipated banking conditions and expected needs for resources to resolve failinginstitutions.4.RebatesSince its early days, the FDIC has rebated “excess” premiums whenever it felt its reserves wereadequate. This procedure was replaced in the1996 law by the requirement that no premium beimposed on well-capitalized and highly rated banks and thrifts when the fund reaches its designatedreserve ratio. The FDIC proposals would re-impose a minimum premium on all banks and thrifts and amore risk-sensitive premium structure. These provisions would be coupled with rebates for thestronger entities when the fund approaches what we recommend be a higher upper end of a targetrange than the FDIC has suggested, and surcharges when the Fund trends below what we suggest bea lower end of a target range.The FDIC also recommends that the rebates not be uniform for the stronger entities. Rather, the FDICargues that rebates should be smaller for those banks that have paid premiums for only short periodsor that have in the past paid premiums that are not commensurate with their present size and henceFDIC exposure.The devil, of course, is in the details. But this latter proposal makes considerable sense, and theBoard endorses it. There are over 900 banks – some now quite large – that have never paid apremium, and without this modification they would continue to pay virtually nothing, net of rebates, aslong as their strong capital and high supervisory ratings were maintained. Such an approach is bothcompetitively inequitable and contributes to moral hazard. It should be addressed.5.Indexing insured-deposit coverage ceilingsThe FDIC recommends that the current $100,000 ceiling on insured deposits be indexed. The Boarddoes not support this recommendation and believes that, at this time, the current ceiling should bemaintained.In the Board’s judgment, it is unlikely that increased coverage, even by indexing, today would addmeasurably to the stability of the banking system. Macroeconomic policy and other elements of thesafety net, combined with the current, still-significant level of deposit insurance, continue to underpinthe stability of the financial system. Thus, the problem that increased coverage is designed to solve
4BIS Review 68/2001must be related to either the individual depositor, the party originally intended to be protected bydeposit insurance, or to the individual bank or thrift. Clearly, both groups would prefer higher coverageif there were no costs. But Congress needs to be clear about the problem for which increasedcoverage would be the solution.DepositorsAt the Federal Reserve, we frequently receive letters from banks urging that we support increaseddeposit insurance coverage. But we virtually never receive similar letters from depositors, who are notshy about sharing their many other concerns. This experience may reflect the fact that, as our surveysof consumer finances suggest, depositors are adept at achieving the level of deposit insurancecoverage they desire by opening multiple accounts. Such spreading of asset holdings is perfectlyconsistent with the counsel always given to investors to diversify their assets – whether stocks, bonds,or mutual funds – across different issuers. The cost of diversifying for insured deposits is surely nogreater than doing so for other assets. An individual bank would clearly prefer that the depositormaintain all of his or her funds at that bank, and would prefer to eliminate the need for depositordiversification by being able to offer higher deposit insurance coverage. Nonetheless, the depositorappears to have no great difficulty – should he or she want insured deposits – in finding multiplesources of fully insured accounts.In addition, the singular characteristic of postwar household financial asset holdings has been theincreasing diversity of portfolio choices. The share of household financial assets in bank deposits hasbeen declining steadily throughout the postwar period as households have taken advantage ofinnovations that make available to them attractive financial instruments with market rates of return.There has been no break in that trend that seems related to past increases in insurance ceilings.Indeed, the most dramatic substitution out of deposits in recent years has been from both insured anduninsured deposits to equities and mutual funds. It is difficult to believe that a change in ceilings duringthe 1990s would have made any measurable difference in that shift. In fact, bankers’ comments andthe data indicate that the weakness in stock prices in recent quarters has been marked by increasedflows into bank and thrift deposits.Depository institutionsDoes the problem to be solved by increased deposit insurance coverage concern the individualdepository institution? If so, the problem would necessarily be concentrated at smaller banks thatgenerally do not have access to the money market or foreign branch networks for supplementaryfunds. Since the mid-1990s, banks’ U.S. assets have grown at an average annual rate of 7.7 percent.Adjusted for the effects of mergers, the smaller banks, those below the largest 1,000, have actuallygrown at a more rapid average annual rate of 13 percent. Uninsured deposits at these smaller bankshave also grown more rapidly than at larger banks – at average annual rates of 20.5 percent at thesmall banks versus 10.9 percent at the large banks, both on the same merger-adjusted basis. Clearly,small banks have a demonstrated skill and ability to compete for uninsured deposits. To be sure,uninsured deposits are more expensive than insured deposits, and bank costs would decline if theircurrently uninsured liabilities received a government guarantee. But that is a different matter, andraises the issue of a subsidy in its starkest terms. I might add that throughout the 1990s, small banks’return on equity was well maintained. Indeed, the attractiveness of banking is evidenced by the factthat 1,363 banks were chartered during the past decade, two-thirds since 1995, when bank creditdemands began to intensify.Some small banks argue that they need enhanced deposit insurance coverage to equalize theircompetition with large banks because depositors prefer to put their uninsured funds in an institutionconsidered too big to fail. As I have noted, however, small banks have more than held their own in themarket for uninsured deposits. In addition, the Board rejects the notion that any bank is too big to fail.In FDICIA, Congress made it clear that the systemic-risk exception to the FDIC’s least-cost resolutionof a failing bank should be invoked only under the most unusual circumstances. Moreover, theresolution rules under the systemic-risk exception do not require that uninsured depositors and othercreditors, much less stockholders, be made whole. Consistent with this view, the market clearlybelieves that large institutions are not too big for uninsured creditors to take at least some loss, withspreads on their subordinated debt larger than those on similar debt of large and highly rated nonbankfinancial institutions. Indeed, there are no Aaa-rated U.S. banking organizations.
BIS Review 68/20015Another argument often raised by smaller banks regarding the need for increased deposit insurancecoverage is their inability to match the competition from those large securities firms and bank holdingcompanies with multiple bank affiliates, offering multiple insured accounts through one organization.While the Board believes that such offerings are a misuse of deposit insurance, raising the coveragelimit for each account would also increase the aggregate amount of insurance coverage that largemultibank organizations would be able to offer, so the disparity would remain.ConclusionThe Board commends the FDIC for its review, analysis, and recommendations for reform of thedeposit insurance system. There are several aspects of that system that need reform. The Boardsupports, with some modifications, all of the FDIC’s recommendations except indexing of the current$100,000 ceiling. The thrust of our proposed modifications would call for a wider permissible range forthe size of the fund relative to insured liabilities, reduced variation of the insurance premium as therelative size of the fund changes with banking and economic conditions, and a premium net ofrebates.There may come a time when the Board finds that households and businesses with modest resourcesare finding difficulty in placing their funds in safe vehicles and/or that there is reason to be concernedthat the level of deposit coverage could endanger financial stability. Should either of those eventsoccur, the Board would call our concerns to the attention of the Congress and support adjustments tothe ceiling by indexing or other methods.But today, in our judgment, neither financial stability, nor depositors, nor depositories are beingdisadvantaged by the current ceiling. Raising the ceiling now would extend the safety net, increase thegovernment subsidy to banking, expand moral hazard, and reduce the incentive for market discipline,without providing any real public benefits. With no clear public benefit to increasing deposit insurance,the Board sees no reason to increase the scope of the safety net. Indeed, the Board believes the timehas come to draw the line on expanding government guarantees.
BIS Review 67/20011Lee Hsien Loong: Credibility, confidence, dynamism: MAS in the neweconomic and financial landscapeAddress by Mr Lee Hsien Loong, Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore and Chairman of the MonetaryAuthority of Singapore, at the MAS 30th Anniversary Conference, Singapore, 20 July 2001.*      *      *IntroductionIt is a great pleasure for me to welcome you to MAS’ 30th Anniversary Conference. We are honouredto have with us so many distinguished central bankers, financial supervisors, market participants andeconomists.A new economic and financial landscape is emerging. Financial markets are becoming globalised;cross-border capital flows are larger and faster; financial institutions are consolidating andrestructuring on a massive scale; and new and complex financial products are emerging, driven bytechnology and market pressures. Amidst these upheavals, MAS’ goals as a central bank remainunchanged: low inflation for sustained economic growth, and a sound financial sector for markets togrow and thrive.MAS is a unique organisation – it is the only institution in the world that combines responsibility formonetary policy with supervisory oversight of the entire financial sector – banking, insurance andsecurities. In addition, it has the task of promoting the development of Singapore as an internationalfinancial centre. I shall describe how MAS has met its responsibilities in these three areas over thepast 30 years, some of the key events that have shaped our policies, and how we intend to moveforward in the new economic and financial landscape.Building confidence and credibilityMonetary policyMAS was born in turbulent times. It was 1971. The US dollar was under intense pressure, due tomounting inflation and balance of payments problems brought on by the Vietnam War and GreatSociety programmes. In August 1971, just months after MAS was formed, the US suspendedconvertibility of the US dollar into gold, plunging international currency markets into turmoil. In June1973, the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates finally collapsed, and the Singapore dollarwas floated.Having witnessed these tumultuous events and the instability they caused, the Singapore Governmentenshrined a strong and credible currency as one of the key pillars of macroeconomic policy, andcharged MAS with the responsibility of ensuring it. Tight fiscal discipline, a healthy balance ofpayments, and a vibrant Singapore economy underpinned the steady strengthening of the Singaporedollar.A second defining moment in the evolution of MAS’ monetary policy came in 1981 when globalinflation accelerated in the wake of the second oil shock. Dr Goh Keng Swee, who took over asChairman of MAS, clarified low inflation as the key policy objective, and shifted the focus of monetarypolicy onto the exchange rate as the principal policy instrument. The high import content of ourdomestic expenditures meant that domestic inflation in Singapore was largely determined by changesin foreign prices and the exchange rate. Traditional monetary policy instruments such as moneysupply and interest rates were ineffective in controlling output and prices given the openness of oureconomy. As Dr Goh explained: “in 1981 there was a clearer recognition that the way to beat inflationis to have a strong Singapore dollar”.Internationally too, a hard currency was an important sign that the Singapore Government pursued adisciplined economic policy, and that Singapore was different from the many developing countrieswhich chronically outspent their revenues and depreciated their currencies.At the same time, a new international consensus on monetary policy had emerged with a greaterawareness of the costs of inflation. The notion that mild inflation might be good for growth had beendebunked by the experience of industrial countries in the 1970s. Instead, the industrialised countries
2BIS Review 67/2001with the lowest inflation such as Germany and Switzerland, had experienced the lowestunemployment rates. The simple Philips Curve, which implied a trade-off between inflation andunemployment, went out of fashion.In line with our emergence as an international financial centre, we progressively dismantled exchangecontrols in the 1970s, until the last restriction was removed in 1978. The absence of exchange orcapital controls made the conduct of an exchange rate centred monetary policy that much moredifficult. Our small and open economy was especially vulnerable to sharp swings in the exchange rateor speculative attacks. We could not afford to assume that speculation in international financialmarkets was invariably self-stabilising, and that speculators who bet wrongly against the Singaporedollar would automatically be punished.Therefore, MAS maintained an explicit policy of not encouraging the internationalisation of theSingapore dollar. It limited the extension of bank credit in Singapore dollars to non-residents except foreconomic activity, and buttressed this with some restrictions on interbank Singapore dollar derivatives,such as currency and interest rate swaps and options, which might have helped financial players toleverage or hedge their positions. This policy made it harder for would be speculators to short theSingapore dollar, and signalled unambiguously our disapproval of such speculation.This framework served us well. That we encountered very few speculative attacks in practice perhapsshowed that the policy was effective. The strength and stability of the Singapore dollar instilledconfidence and kept inflation low. Price stability provided the foundation for sustained economicgrowth, which in turn provided the basis for continued strengthening of the Singapore dollar.We benefited immensely from this virtuous cycle. Over the past two decades since 1981, theSingapore dollar has risen steadily by more than 70%, on a trade-weighted basis. Domestic inflationhas been among the lowest in the world, averaging 2.0% per annum compared to 6.5% for the OECDcountries. In real terms, GDP growth averaged 7.6% a year, while GDP per capita in 2000 was twoand a half times the level in 1981.Financial supervisionMAS’ second responsibility is oversight of the financial sector. MAS was an integrated supervisor longbefore this became internationally fashionable. When it was formed in 1971, MAS was responsible forboth monetary policy and the supervision of banks. It took over supervision of the insurance industry in1977, and the securities industry in 1984.From the beginning, MAS’ approach to supervising the financial sector was centred on a strictadmission policy, high prudential requirements, and rigorous enforcement. We sought not only tomaintain systemic stability, but also to protect individual institutions from failing, and the public andinvestors from losses. Lacking any track record, this approach was necessary to establish credibilitywith international financial institutions and their home regulators. When it emerged that Singapore hadbeen spared the fallout from the collapse of BCCI because MAS had steadfastly refused BCCI entrydespite persistent lobbying, MAS’ reputation as a thorough and uncompromising regulator went up.But despite our best efforts, we did have one major failure – the Pan-El crisis in 1985. Pan ElectricIndustries, or Pan-El, was a holding company with interests in hotels, property and marine operations.It went into receivership in November 1985, threatening the solvency of many stockbroking firms withwhom it had forward contracts. MAS closed the stock exchange for 3 days while a lifeboat fund wasorganised. The four major local banks agreed to provide a standby line of credit, to aid the affectedstockbrokers and restore market confidence.Pan-El showed up certain weaknesses in our regulatory framework. Following Pan-El, MAS revampedthe Securities Industry Act, raising standards and putting in place mechanisms for the properregulation of the market. MAS considerably tightened its supervision of the stock exchange and thesecurities industry. To some extent this tighter approach permeated beyond the securities industry toother parts of the financial sector, and continued right up to 1997, when we shifted course.Development of the financial industryMAS’ third responsibility was to promote the development of the financial industry. Singapore did notbecome a financial centre by accident or luck. The Government saw an opportunity to developSingapore as a regional financial centre. We had a time zone advantage, bridging the gap betweenthe close of markets in the US and the reopening of business the next day in Europe. We were also
BIS Review 67/20013well-placed, with our good infrastructure and political stability, to serve as a point of intermediation forfund flows in an industrialising Asia.We started by permitting banks to establish Asian Currency Units (ACUs) to accept non-Singaporedollar deposits. This paved the way for the creation of the Asian Dollar Market, the counterpart of theEurodollar Market in London. We attracted international banks to set up ACUs here, and abolishedwithholding tax on interest income earned by non-resident depositors. We introduced a lower tax rateof 10% for offshore income1. From these modest beginnings, the Asian Dollar Market expanded, toreach total assets of US$ 500 billion today.Another major initiative was the creation of SIMEX. In 1984, the Gold Exchange of Singaporeexpanded beyond trading of gold futures to include financial futures, and renamed itself the SingaporeInternational Monetary Exchange (SIMEX). SIMEX was the first financial futures exchange in Asia.Well before exchange linkages became the norm, SIMEX co-pioneered the world’s first mutual offsettrading link with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, facilitating round-the-clock trading. RenamedSGX-DT, the derivatives exchange today trades a broad range of interest rate, fixed income, equityand energy derivatives.A later initiative was the programme launched in 1994 to develop the fund management industry inSingapore. Our fund management industry was small compared with other financial centres. TheCentral Provident Fund (CPF) system was absorbing the bulk of the population’s long-term savings,and starving the private fund management industry of local funds. The Government liberalised therules to allow CPF savings to be invested in approved unit trusts and fund management accounts.MAS and GIC went on to give modest mandates to external fund managers, although these could onlybe the seed money to grow the industry. At the end of 2000, the total assets managed by Singapore-based financial institutions was $276 billion, four times the $66 billion in 1994 when we embarked onthe programme.New directionsThe approaches that we took in monetary policy, financial supervision and development have servedSingapore well. We maintained low inflation and a macroeconomic environment favourable to growth.Our capital markets have grown rapidly over the past few years, while our forex market is one of thelargest in the world. With over 200 banks and merchant banks, 150 insurance companies and160 investment advisors in Singapore, we have become a major financial centre.But past achievements will not extrapolate into future successes, unless we update our policies tomeet changing conditions. Policies that worked in the 1970s and 1980s needed rethinking by the1990s. In 1997, we began a comprehensive review of MAS’ policy framework and approach, whichhas led to fundamental changes. Our work is far from done, and we anticipate many challengesahead.Credibility and dynamism – MAS’ approach to future challengesMonetary policyIn monetary policy, certain verities are not likely to change. We will continue to manage the exchangerate as our principal policy variable. The primary objective will still be to maintain price stability and thepurchasing power of the Singapore dollar, over the medium term. We will continue to guard againstdestabilising speculation in the Singapore dollar.However, the international environment has changed. We are witnessing larger capital flows and morevolatile financial markets. G3 currencies have tended to undergo prolonged periods of misalignment,followed by sharp corrections. For a while after the Asian crisis, when currencies that were quasi-pegged to the US dollar collapsed in a disastrous contagion, a consensus was growing that the onlysustainable exchange rate regimes for emerging markets are either a hard currency peg or a totallyfree float.                                                     1In 1973, we reduced the corporate tax for ACU interest earnings from overseas loans from 40% to 10%. We extended thisto fees and commissions received by ACUs in 1976.
4BIS Review 67/2001These corner solutions are not suitable for Singapore. A free floating exchange rate would meanrelinquishing our most effective inflation-fighting instrument. On the other hand a fixed exchange rate,pegged say to the US dollar, would lock our economic fortunes to US monetary policy, with noassurance that it would be appropriate to the state of our economy. The intermediate option of amanaged float remains the best approach for us.In our experience, a managed float helps to buffer the adverse effects on the economy of short-termfinancial volatility, and to avoid sustained currency misalignments that can be damaging to our exportsector. Managing the float requires us to lean against the wind at times, but provided our exchangerate policy is aligned with economic fundamentals, and our ability and determination to counterdestabilising speculation is not in doubt, we need to intervene less than might be expected.Until recently, MAS did not reveal its view of the exchange rate, what it had done, or what it intendedto do. But going forward, MAS recognises the need to be more communicative and less opaque aboutits exchange rate policy. Hence we have been making half-yearly monetary policy statementsannouncing our prevailing policy stance. We have also published the movements of thetrade-weighted Singapore dollar, hitherto a closely guarded secret. We envisage that if marketparticipants and the public understand our policy stance better, there will be less uncertainty, andpolicy implementation will be more effective.We have also reviewed and refined our policy on the internationalisation of the Singapore dollar. Thebalance of risks between not relaxing the non-internationalisation policy on the one hand, and liftingsome specific restrictions in a progressive manner on the other, has shifted. With a more maturefinancial industry and a more internationalised economy, corporate players and financial institutionshave a greater need for Singapore dollars and its derivatives for commercial transactions. At the sametime, the economy and financial system have grown and become more resilient and our ability tomanage the exchange rate has strengthened.This is why MAS has liberalised the non-internationalisation policy, leaving only the most essentialrestrictions in place. This has enabled the bond market to take off, with foreign players raisingSingapore dollar bonds, but swapping the proceeds into a foreign currency before taking them out ofthe country. We will continue to fine-tune the non-internationalisation policy from time to time, but thepolicy is no longer a significant constraint on the development of our capital markets or financialsector.Financial supervisionMAS has also, since 1998, been reviewing and updating its approach to regulating and supervisingthe financial sector. First, we have instituted a fundamental shift in emphasis away from“one-size-fits-all” regulation of institutions to risk-focused supervision, and from merit-based regulationof products to a disclosure-based regime. Second, we have embarked on a programme to liberaliseaccess to all parts of the financial industry to stimulate greater competition and dynamism. Thesereforms are aimed at providing a more conducive environment for innovation and enterprise whilepromoting high standards of risk management, so as to help make Singapore a premier financialcentre in Asia.But these changes are just the beginning. MAS must continue to review and update its regulatory andsupervisory framework, to appropriately address the risks and exploit the opportunities presented bythe changing financial landscape. Let me outline three major challenges, and their implications for ourregulatory and supervisory framework.Future challengesThe first challenge is that institutions will be larger and more complex. Singapore banks are merging,in search of greater scale and efficiency. They are following a worldwide trend. Bigger banks arebetter-placed to attract high-calibre talent, invest in cutting-edge technology, and diversify their risks.But they will also require tighter management and closer supervision, and the systemic consequencesof difficulties in a large bank are more severe.Secondly, the soundness of Singapore’s financial system will increasingly depend on factors outsideMAS’ control. As our institutions expand their presence in the region, their financial strength will betested by their exposure to regional markets. At the same time, we are opening our markets further toforeign players. This will also increase the risk of contagion as the soundness of foreign institutions isdependent on their home market and global operations.
BIS Review 67/20015Thirdly, we have to cope with new business models and financial products that are emerging fasterthan ever. Technology and competition are transforming the way in which financial services areproduced and distributed, and driving the convergence of financial products and service providers.The traditional divides between banks, securities firms, and insurers are blurring. Securities firms areoffering deposit-like products; banks are selling insurance under the rubric of ”bancassurance”; andinsurance companies are offering investment-linked products as substitutes for unit trusts. AsMr Andrew Crockett, General Manager of the BIS, said recently, the challenge for regulators will be to”create rules of the game that are robust to fad, fashions and arbitrage”2.How should MAS respond?How should MAS respond to these challenges? Our objective remains to promote a sound andprogressive financial sector. Our approach to rule-setting must adapt to new developments, besensitive to the effects of regulation on industry, and be focussed in identifying and addressing risks.We have already broadened the limits within which institutions have free play. We must now aim todevelop a pro-enterprise supervisory framework that will encourage innovation and dynamism withoutcompromising the safety and soundness of the financial system. Such a framework will comprise thefollowing elements:(cid:1) risk-focussed, consolidated supervision;(cid:1) harmonised regulation;(cid:1) sound corporate governance; and(cid:1) effective market discipline.Let me elaborate on these elements of the new framework.Risk-focussed, consolidated supervisionWe are adopting a risk-focussed, consolidated approach to the supervision of financial institutions. Wewill place more emphasis on understanding and evaluating an institution’s risk management systemsand internal controls. And we will apply this approach on a consolidated group-wide basis across allconstituent institutions, local or overseas.At the micro-level, MAS is improving the processes and techniques it uses to systematically evaluate abank’s operations and risk profile to determine the key areas that require attention. At the macro-level,MAS is enhancing its financial surveillance capabilities, to help identify emerging vulnerabilities, andassess how they will affect individual institutions or business activities, so that we can devoteadequate supervisory resources to these areas.Harmonised regulationMAS will also develop a more harmonised and integrated approach to regulation. Consistency inregulation across similar financial activities and products will help level the playing field, lowercompliance costs, and reduce the scope for regulatory arbitrage. In this regard, MAS has begun tostreamline the licensing regime and put in place a risk-based capital framework across the financialsector.The new Securities and Futures Act will introduce a single, modular licensing regime for securities andfutures intermediaries. The Financial Advisors Act will provide a single licensing regime and a moreflexible and integrated regulatory framework, with consistent standards of business conduct for entitiesengaging in financial advisory activities for all investment products. But this is not a one-off process.As the industries and products continue to evolve, our laws and regulations will have to evolve withthem.We are making progress in applying the concept of risk-based capital. In banking, where risk-basedcapital standards already exist, MAS is working with the local banks to implement the proposed NewBasel Capital Accord. In insurance, securities and futures trading, we are revising the existingdisparate capital frameworks, to replace them with a consistent risk-based approach based oncommon principles and objectives.                                                     2 “Issues in Global Financial Supervision”, Remarks at the 36th SEACEN Governors' Conference in Singapore, 1 June 01.
6BIS Review 67/2001Effective corporate governanceOver time, we should rely more on corporate governance and market discipline to complementprudential regulation and supervision. Good corporate governance is critical to fostering a strong riskmanagement culture and effective internal controls. Going forward, MAS will further raise corporategovernance standards, particularly with regards to enhancing the independence of boards andinstitutionalising professional management. But this must be phased in judiciously. We cannot imposethese standards in a vacuum without regard to the institutional and cultural realities in our corporatesector.Effective market disciplineMarket discipline imposes external incentives on financial institutions to conduct their business in asound and efficient manner. For market discipline to work, there must be timely and accuratedisclosure of relevant information. Investors must be sophisticated enough to make good use ofdisclosed information, and make considered investment decisions appropriate to their needs and riskappetites. MAS will progressively raise disclosure standards in the financial sector to meetinternational best practice.Development of the financial industryMAS continues to be charged with the development of Singapore’s financial sector. In 1998, weestablished a new department to focus our efforts on actively promoting the industry, identifying areasof opportunity, and profiling Singapore as an international financial centre.The task ahead is daunting. External conditions are presently not favourable. The global economy isslowing down. Southeast Asia is taking longer than we had hoped to implement structural reforms thatare essential for sustained growth. Investors are waiting to see how events unfold. There are feweropportunities for institutions to service our immediate region, whether in offshore lending, mergers andacquisitions, or treasury operations.We can and must look beyond immediate problems, and press on to upgrade our infrastructure andcapabilities, so that institutions and investors will have stronger reasons to site activities in Singaporeand use our financial markets. Then as Southeast Asia recovers, which in time it will, we will be readyto play our part in its pick up.We have come a long way since 1968 when we started promoting the Asian Dollar Market. As weevolve into a full-service financial centre, it will become more difficult to identify individual projects orareas to pursue. Our approach is therefore to establish a conducive overall environment, within whichmarket forces can operate and private sector innovation can thrive. We have to:(cid:1) develop efficient, comprehensive and world-class infrastructure;(cid:1) put in place a sound but pro-enterprise regulatory framework; and(cid:1) attract, nurture and retain top talent, both local and foreign.Such a competitive and pro-enterprise environment will bring out the areas in which we have acompetitive advantage. We cannot predict in advance which activities will take off. But when someactivities succeed we can promote and encourage their development, always pushing in the directionof market forces, and not against them.ConclusionMAS has built a reputation for credibility, prudence and competence over the last 30 years. But majorchallenges lie ahead. We have to manage exchange rate policy in an increasingly volatile market,build a sound and responsive regulatory environment that allows the financial industry to thrive, andpromote Singapore as a financial centre even in the midst of adverse external conditions.It is always easy to shelter from change, to reject anything new and to adopt a risk adverse approach.But if the sole objective of a captain is to protect his ship, then his vessel would never leave port. Overthe last few years, we have altered our course – opening up to, rather than sheltering from, the windsof change.
BIS Review 67/20017To navigate in this dynamic environment, MAS will have to continue to strengthen its own capabilities.The pace of change is intense, and the demands on MAS’ resources, expertise and judgement willonly grow. We must broaden our contacts and consultation with market participants and fellow centralbankers and regulators. This is the way to keep abreast of the latest developments in the financialindustry, and evolving best practices in central banking and financial supervision.We must groom a corps of competent and committed economists, supervisors, and investmentmanagers within MAS. But this will not be sufficient. We also have to reinforce our team with talentfrom industry and abroad. We already have foreign and mid-career professionals among our ranks,but we must attract more such persons. Only by building a truly world-class MAS team, will wesucceed in our mission – to promote macro-economic stability, and a sound and progressive financialcentre.
BIS Review 80/20011Svein Gjedrem: Monetary policy and the outlook for the Norwegian economyAddress by Mr Svein Gjedrem, Governor of the Norges Bank, at a meeting of SparebankenNord-Norge, Tromsø, 25 September 2001.Please note that the text below may differ slightly from the actual presentation Summary and charts.The address is based on the assessments presented at Norges Bank’s press conference following theExecutive Board’s monetary policy meeting on 19 September.*      *      *Norway’s economic policy is based on new guidelines for fiscal and monetary policy. The newguidelines were published by the Government on 29 March 2001 in connection with the presentationof the Government’s Long-Term Programme. The inflation target for monetary policy came into forceimmediately. The guidelines for fiscal policy were discussed in the Storting in June and were approvedby a majority.Monetary policy is oriented towards low and stable inflation. The inflation target is set at 2½ per cent.In general, the direct effects on consumer prices resulting from changes in interest rates, taxes, exciseduties and extraordinary temporary disturbances shall not be taken into account.In the 1990s, monetary policy gradually moved further away from the fixed-exchange-rate regimewhich was practiced from 1986 to 1992.Low and stable inflation is the best contribution monetary policy can make to growth, prosperity andincome distribution. In the long term, monetary policy has little effect on the real economy.Low and stable inflation can, however, provide fertile ground for stability and growth. It reduces thepossibility of unsound investments and bubbles in the financial and property markets. Nominal stabilitywill also reduce the risk of sudden changes and shocks that may lead to cyclical turnarounds.Historically, economic growth has generally been strong in periods with relatively low inflation andweak during periods with especially high inflation. Hence, during the last 20 years, real wage growth,which over time reflects productivity trends, has been strongest when inflation was low. In the 1980s,nominal wage growth was strong without a basis for this in the real economy. The result was inflationand weak real wage growth. In the 1990s, more moderate nominal wage increases until 1998coincided with strong real wage growth because inflation was low.It takes considerable time before monetary policy has an impact. The effects of interest rate changesare uncertain. The key rate is set on the basis of an overall assessment of the inflation outlook. If itappears that inflation will be higher than 2½ per cent with unchanged interest rates, the interest ratewill be increased. If it appears that inflation will be lower than 2½ per cent with unchanged interestrates, the interest rate will be reduced. It is equally important to avoid an inflation rate that is too low,as it is to avoid an inflation rate that is too high.The expression "it appears that" refers to our best estimate of inflation two years ahead. Norges Bankpublishes its inflation projections in the Inflation Report three times a year (every four months). TheInflation Reports include both a point estimate and an uncertainty interval around the projection. In themost recent Inflation Report which was published in June, we believed that there was approximately a75 per cent chance that inflation would be between 2 and 3 per cent in 2003. We also believed thatthe probability that inflation would be higher than 2 ½ per cent was about the same as the probabilitythat it would be lower than 2 ½ per cent.Growth forecasts for the global economy this year have been lowered substantially. Earlier, a declinein some regions has often been counteracted by an upswing in other regions. The changes nowappear to be more concurrent than in 1975, 1982 and 1991. The summer months have brought agreat deal of bad news from the global community. After the tragic events on 11 September, theuncertainty is even greater than before.Industrial output is declining markedly in all major regions in the world economy. The situation hasshifted rapidly in the US, following strong growth throughout most of the 1990s.The contagion effect from the US to Europe has been more pronounced than expected. Channelsother than trade have probably had a greater impact than expected. Expectations can be affected
2BIS Review 80/2001quickly. High correlation between share prices in different countries may be an important carrier ofcontagion. Enterprises with worldwide operations may be another. The economic indicators show aclear slowdown in growth in Europe’s industrial output.The effect on the Swedish economy has been severe, resulting in a record-low exchange rate. OneSwedish krone now costs approximately 80 Norwegian øre. This is 30 per cent less than 10 years ago.Vulnerable emerging economies with high government debt must pay very high interest rates toborrow capital.Many central banks have reduced interest rates, most recently 17 and 18 September. Interest rateshave been reduced because of the prospect of a downturn in each of these economies. Real interestrates are low in many countries.The inflation component that is driven by domestic wage and price increases is still high. Growth inNorwegian labour costs has been around 5-6 per cent in recent years. This is 1½ - 2 percentagepoints higher than among our trading partners. The higher interest rate level in Norway reflects thisfact. At the moment, there is no clear indication of a marked slowdown in the Norwegian economy.The price of oil remained high for a long time, despite the international downturn, but fell more thanUSD 3 yesterday, 24 September. The price of aluminium has fallen somewhat but is still highcompared with the average price in recent years. The year-on-year increase in the export of metals,excluding iron and steel, was 0.7 per cent in the second quarter of 2001. The price of fresh salmonremains at the same level as in the last half of the 1990s. Exports of fish and fish products increasedby 3.9 per cent from the second quarter of 2000 to the second quarter of 2001. Due to internationaldevelopments, the uncertainties and the downside risks are now greater for many export industries.The krone has appreciated recently measured against our trading partners (trade-weighted exchangerate index). This partly reflects more than 20 per cent appreciation against the Swedish krone sincespring 2000. Measured by the trade-weighted exchange rate index, the krone is now about 2 per centweaker than in 1990 and on a par with the level in 1994-95.So far this year, the volume of traditional merchandise exports have increased more than in the sameperiod last year, but growth is levelling off. The exposure of Norwegian exports in the ICT sector,where the international downturn has been most severe, is limited. Norway’s manufacturing output hasdeclined somewhat this year, but less than in other countries. On the other hand, Norwegianmanufacturing industry did not experience the upswing in 1999 and 2000. The business sentimentindicator does not suggest a severe decline. The order situation is still satisfactory in many industries.This does not necessarily mean that the turnaround will not occur in Norway as well. A sharp fall inshare prices, tighter borrowing terms and an imbalance in international credit markets may quicklyaffect investment, prices, profitability and expectations. So far, however, it is difficult to draw anyconclusions except that uncertainty has increased.The Norwegian economy is operating at capacity limits and there are few if any available resources inthe labour market. Unemployment has declined throughout the country. Unemployment in WesternNorway, which increased marginally last year, has returned to its previous level. Unemployment hasrisen slightly again in Eastern Norway. This reflects lower employment in private services that may bea result of a slight downturn in the ICT industries and retail trade.The Government’s Long-Term programme for 2002-2005, which was approved by the Storting in June2001, states: "Considerable emphasis must be placed on stabilising fluctuations in the economy inorder to ensure appropriate capacity utilisation and low unemployment. Petroleum revenues willgradually be phased into the economy, approximately in step with the expected real return of thePetroleum Fund."Fiscal policy will contribute to stimulating activity in the economy because of the increase in spendingof oil revenues. The new guidelines imply that the non-oil deficit will increase in the years ahead. Thiswill provide a substantial fiscal stimulus every year.SummaryThe tragic events in the US on 11 September will contribute to a further dampening of activity in theAmerican, Asian and European economies. It is too early to predict the long-term effects. Reactions infinancial markets have been pronounced. Share prices have fallen sharply. The U.S. dollar hasdepreciated. Currencies of other economies such as Sweden have depreciated.
BIS Review 80/20013Central banks have ensured the smooth functioning of markets by supplying liquidity to the bankingsystem. Interest rates have been cut in the US, Canada, the euro area, Switzerland, Sweden, HongKong, Taiwan, Denmark, Japan, the UK, New Zealand, Korea and Malaysia. These cuts will contributeto mitigating the negative effects on demand, output and employment.The Norwegian economy is characterised by high capacity utilisation and strong cost inflation. Themainland economy appears to be expanding approximately in line with growth in output potential. Atpresent, we do not have sufficient evidence to assert that international developments will change thissituation. The announced increase in spending of petroleum revenues may lead to a moreexpansionary fiscal stance than in recent years. According to Norges Bank’s assessment, with anunchanged interest rate ahead, the probability that inflation two years ahead will be higher than 2½per cent is the same as the probability that it will be lower.
BIS Review 80/20011Eva Srejber: The role of the banking system in monetary policySpeech by Ms Eva Srejber, Second Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at Färs & FrostaSpüarbank AB, Lund, 25 September 2001.*      *      *Firstly, I would like to begin by thanking you for the invitation to come here. Today I intend to speakabout the role of the banking system for the Riksbank and in particular their role for monetary policy.The Riksbank has been assigned by law the task of safeguarding the value of money. We also havethe task of promoting a safe and efficient payment system. The banks play a central role in both ofthese tasks. The objective for monetary policy has been specified by the Executive Board as a CPIinflation rate of 2 per cent, with a deviation interval of plus/minus 1 percentage point. The instrument atour disposal for achieving the inflation target is the interest rate. Of course we also have the possibilityof using currency interventions as a means of achieving our objectives, but this is a monetary policytool we would not normally use in the current monetary policy regime.I have on previous occasions discussed in general terms the mechanisms that enable a central bankto influence price trends in its own economy. Here I would just like to start by very briefly runningthrough the channels through which we assume that monetary policy takes effect. Although we believewe know which channels these are, we have very little knowledge of the strength and time-scaleinvolved. There is clear empirical evidence monetary policy does affect inflation with some time lagand with a certain efficacy, but why monetary policy has an effect is more difficult to clarify.Within the Riksbank's way of thinking, consumer prices are influenced primarily by the degree ofresource utilisation, by import prices and by inflation expectations. Monetary policy is assumed to havean effect on these factors, and thereby on inflation, through many different channels. This is known inthe academic world as transmission mechanism. One usually talks of monetary policy having an effectvia the interest rate channel and via the exchange rate channel. This is the traditional description ofthe transmission mechanism.In addition, inflation expectations probably play a prominent role in price setting. And here confidencein the ability of monetary policy to meet the price stability target is extremely important. Stable, lowinflation expectations should have an effect on both company pricing behaviour and wage formation. Ifinflation expectations are stable, the consequence may be that the degree of resource utilisation in theeconomy can vary considerably without showing any impact on inflation. In this case, monetary policycan also influence, via the credibility of the price stability target, the exchange between growth andinflation.One way of maintaining credibility and support for the price stability target is, in our opinion, to show ahigh level of openness and clarity with regard to conducting monetary policy. Openness involves, forinstance, reporting which considerations we make with regard to prospects for the business climate,etc. when we make decisions regarding interest rates. However, it also means that we are transparentwith regard to the sources of knowledge we use as a basis for our decisions. Clarity is also oftenaimed at creating the right conditions for analysts in the banking sector to forecast how monetarypolicy will react to various types of new information. Consistent and symmetrical actions with regard tomonetary policy increases confidence in the price stability target, which in turn should have astabilising effect on inflation expectations.My speech today should be seen as part of our endeavour to achieve openness. In many cases, I willraise questions to which we do not have answers. Our ambition is to increase our knowledge both bystudying existing research and by stimulating our own and others' research in this field.The banks are important for the Riksbank's tasksI will now move on to speak about the significance of the banks for our capacity to maintain pricestability.The banks play an important role in enabling monetary policy to maintain price stability, in a number ofways. Firstly, the banks are central to the capacity to make payments in the economy generally. Allactivity in the economy leads to payments and it would not be possible to maintain price stability
2BIS Review 80/2001without a functioning payment system. It would be too lengthy to go into further detail here on the roleplayed by the banks in the payment system and the connections between the Riksbank's two tasks.But I would in any case like to point out here that financial stability is a necessary condition for pricestability. Secondly, it is through the banks that participate in the Riksbank's system for large payments- the RIX system - that we can in practice affect the interest rates companies and households meetwhen choosing between savings, investment and consumption. Thirdly, the banks' own credit grantingand their lending rates play an important role for activity in the economy.Thus, the banks play an important role in the interest rate channel. Here I will first describe how theRiksbank's steering of interest rates works through the shortest interest rate in the interbank market.After this I will discuss what significance this has for the banks' credit granting.The Riksbank steers the shortest market rateThe fact that the central bank has a monopoly on issuing money is usually stated as a necessarycondition for being able to determine price trends in its own currency - e.g. calculated by how manygoods can be purchased for a particular sum of money. It is intuitively easy to understand that theamount of money in the economy is a decisive factor for the price of the goods produced in thecountry. In modern economies, where payments are largely made electronically, the monopoly onissuing banknotes is no longer an equally evident condition for enabling monetary policy to determineprice trends. Today, it is instead the right to determine the terms in the systems for large electronicpayments between banks and the opportunity to influence how much the banks shall borrow ordeposit in the Riksbank that enable us to steer interest rates. For electronic payments to be able tofunction as money, it is necessary for the central bank to be perceived as guarantor for these meansof payment in the same ways as with banknotes. This role can only be fulfilled by a central bank and inthis way one can say that the possibility to determine price trends in the economy still lies with themonopoly on issuing money.The Riksbank governs the shortest interest rate in the interbank market, so that it normally remainsclose to the monetary policy-steered repo rate. The fact that the Riksbank can steer the interbank rateis primarily due to the fact that each individual bank participating in the system handling largeinterbank payments - known as the RIX system - always has an opportunity to borrow and depositmoney in the Riksbank overnight at the lending and deposit rates set by the Riksbank. These lie at75 points above and 75 points below the repo rate respectively. The difference between the lendingand deposit rates is sufficiently large for the banks normally to view it as more profitable to balancedeficits and surpluses in their payments at the end of the day on the interbank market, rather thanutilising the Riksbank's lending and deposit facilities. Both a bank with a surplus and a bank with adeficit win by depositing or borrowing in other banks at rates between the Riksbank's deposit andlending rates. The fact that the interbank rate normally lies at the centre of the corridor, i.e. close to therepo rate is because the Riksbank usually offers the banks the opportunity to borrow or depositsufficient funds at the repo rate so that no bank will need to utilise the more expensive alternativesoffered by the deposit and lending facilities. The condition for this is that the possibilities in theinterbank market have been exhausted.Outstanding notes and coins and other items on the Riksbank's balance sheet mean that the bankingsystem currently has to borrow from the Riksbank. To avoid the necessity of converting a large loanstock every day, the Riksbank every week offers the banks the possibility of borrowing via repurchasetransactions with a duration of one week at the monetary policy-steered repo rate. In addition, throughwhat are known as fine-tuning operations, the Riksbank normally offers the banking system financingor investment of the deficits or surpluses that can arise in the daily payment flows between the banksand the Riksbank at a rate close to the repo rate. The Riksbank uses its advertisement of the repo rateto provide signals regarding monetary policy. The repo rate is now usually changed only after themonetary policy meetings held by the Executive Board of the Riksbank, which means that the rateremains the same for 6-8 weeks. To summarise, therefore, the interbank market rate is steered so thatit closely follows the repo rate.The Riksbank's steering of interest rates – in common with that of many other modern central banks -differs from the models described in most macroeconomic textbooks. There the starting point is oftenthat the central bank affects the volume of money or liquidity in the economy by buying and sellingbonds on the market. According to the simple textbook model, the banks maintain a liquidity buffer inthe central bank in the form of a deposit with no interest compensation - known as reserves. When thecentral bank buys or sells bonds via the banks, the payments are made through the banks' deposit
BIS Review 80/20013accounts in the central bank– the central bank can thus steer the size of the reserves the banks haveinvested in the central bank. However, for the banks to be prepared to buy or sell the amount of bondsthe central bank desires - in exchange for money in their non-interest bearing deposit accounts in thecentral bank - the interest rate must be adapted. A lower interest rate will increase the general public'sdemand for means of payment and this leads to an increase in the banks' requirement for a liquiditybuffer, while the opposite will occur if interest rates rise. The textbook therefore assumes that thecentral bank affects the interest rate by influencing the banks' balance on non-interest bearing depositaccounts in the central bank.However, the design of our steering interest rates system and the terms in the payment system meanthat Swedish banks do not need to invest money as a reserve, i.e. liquidity buffer, in deposit accountsat the Riksbank. The banks can finance the deficits in payment flows arising during the day viainterest-free loans from the Riksbank against collateral in securities. Instead of holding a liquiditybuffer with no interest compensation, the Swedish banks can hold a liquidity buffer in the form ofsecurities that can be pledged to the Riksbank – at full yield. While the cost of the banks' liquiditybuffer in the textbook model is comprised of the nominal interest rate – the alternative is to invest inassets which provide interest- the cost of the liquidity buffer in the Swedish system is limited to theinterest rate difference between, for instance, treasury bonds and lending. The costs for the banks'payment services should thus, all else being equal, be lower in Sweden than in countries that applysystems similar to the textbook one. We can therefore say that our system is more cost-effective thanthe textbook's system.Following the tragic events in the USA the other week, some central banks announced that they wereprepared to supply liquidity to avoid a shortage of liquidity on the market. During periods of unease thedemand for risk-free investments normally rises. This leads to investors demanding highercompensation for taking credit risks. It can also lead, as a consequence, to an increase in the interestrate on the interbank market. In extreme situations, access to liquidity can be valued so highly thatbanks and other market participants are not prepared to lend money at any price. As a result of thegreat uncertainty prevailing, the daily lending market in US dollars functioned very poorly during thedays following the terrorist attack, daily rates rose and there were indications that some banks wereexperiencing difficulty in obtaining dollars at all. Given these developments, the Federal Reserveoffered the US banks increased opportunities to borrow dollars from the central bank. However, theEuropean banks were also affected, and therefore with the aim of maintaining the dollar marketfunction, a number of central banks, including the Swedish Riksbank, offered a dollar facility to themarket.In a corresponding manner, one can imagine a hypothetical situation where one or more Swedishbanks chooses to invest a surplus in kronor in the Riksbank at the deposit rate rather than lending themoney to other banks. Those banks that cannot find financing on the interbank market are then forcedto use the Riksbank's lending facility. Firstly, loans in the Riksbank are more expensive and secondly,they require collateral. To avoid the interbank rate rising, the Riksbank has recourse to a number ofdifferent measures. In certain strained situations, we have previously chosen to increase the supply ofloans at the monetary policy determined interest rate via our normal operations. If a bank shouldchoose to invest its surplus in the Riksbank instead of providing loans on the interbank market, whereloans are normally offered without collateral, the Riksbank might choose to offer the correspondingcredit volume on the interbank market at the rate we are aiming for. The condition is that a bankborrowing from the Riksbank can offer eligible assets as collateral. At the start of the new millenniumwhen, as some of you might remember, there was great unease over a possible liquidity shortagearising, the Riksbank extended its list of eligible collateral. In our system this can be said to mean thatwe increased the liquidity in the banking system, as this measure increased the possibilities forborrowing from the Riksbank. The extension of the list of eligible assets the Riksbank accepts ascollateral has now been made permanent, which should mean that liquidity in the Swedish bankingsystem is good.For a Swedish bank to choose to bear the cost of placing large surpluses in its deposit account at theRiksbank would assume that lending money on the interbank market was assessed to be a pooreralternative. One reason for this could be a fear that the bank wanting to borrow would not be able torepay in time, or at all. Another reason could be that the bank with a surplus was unwilling, or unablefor some reason, to provide loans requiring capital cover in accordance with capital adequacy rulesand therefore chose to deposit the money at no risk in the Riksbank. Normally, however, there wouldbe very little risk of this happening - firstly, Swedish banks have good solidity and secondly they are sofew in number that they have a good knowledge of one another.
4BIS Review 80/2001The Riksbank also has the opportunity - in situations where the financial system faces a risk of seriousdisruption - to provide loans at special terms to a bank that for some reason experiences suchunexpectedly large deficits in its payments during the course of a day that the bank is unable to offersufficient already approved collateral to borrow from the Riksbank at normal terms. However, thecondition is that the bank is considered by the Riksbank to be sound. The Riksbank has a crisisorganisation to enable it to make rapid decisions in this type of situation.The banks' lending is importantAnother reason why the banks are particularly interesting in monetary policy terms is that lending fromthe banks plays an important role for the impact of monetary policy interest rate changes. If theSwedish banks for some reason reduce the supply of credit, companies and households cannot fullyreplace this loss with financing for consumption and investment elsewhere. Smaller companies areparticularly dependent on the Swedish banks and the customer relations they have built up. Largercorporations, on the other hand, have access to other sources of financing, such as borrowing in thebond market, from foreign banks or via new share issues.The banks' supply of credit and their setting of interest rates can therefore influence how quickly andhow much monetary policy affects activity in the economy and thus inflation. We can begin by statingthat the repo rate is one important determining factor when the banks decide on their lending rates.When the lending rates are determined, the bank's own internal rate is crucial and it is normallydetermined by the repo rate. This is because the banks' financing of deficits and investment ofsurpluses arising at the end of the day can normally be done in the interbank market, where pricingdepends on the repo rate. If a bank lends money to a company, the loan could be financed in theinterbank market. Even loans with a longer duration could in principle be financed by short-termborrowing on the interbank market. The lending rate in the interbank market will thus comprise thebank's financing cost for this loan and is therefore an important factor when the bank decides thelending rate it will offer the company. For loans with a longer fixed term, expectations of thedevelopment of the repo rate during the duration of the loan will affect the financing cost and thus thelending rate the bank sets for a longer term loan. A bank that has a surplus to invest can in the sameway choose between investing it in the interbank market and lending money. The interbank rate willthus influence the lending rate the bank offers households and companies as it comprises analternative yield.In addition to the interbank rate, however, the banks' lending rates are determined by many otherfactors. When setting interest rates, the banks must of course compensate themselves for the creditrisks connected with the loan and at the same time reserve funds in their own capital to meet anyfuture losses. The fact that banks from time to time make differing assessments of borrowers' creditrating should not in itself affect how much the banks' lending rate changes when the repo rate israised. The impact from monetary policy should not, therefore, change merely as a result of the bankschanging their assessments of the credit risk.However, many theories indicate that monetary policy in itself can affect the banks' setting of interestrates over and above the channel that goes via the interbank rate. One theory is that when interestrates are at a high level, the percentage of unreliable borrowers increases – borrowers who are awarethat they will not be able to repay their loans and are therefore insensitive to high interest rates. Tocompensate for this, the banks can raise the interest rates on all loans more than is motivated by themonetary policy steered rates, or they can reduce the amount of credit they supply.Another theory suggests that borrowers' creditworthiness via their balance sheets is affected bychanges in interest rates. The idea is that a company that has, for instance, a high level of debt, will beless creditworthy if the interest rate rises. Actually profitable investment projects may thus not get offthe ground because the company applying for a loan for the project is already heavily in debt andtherefore has to pay a high credit risk premium, or is refused a loan.Yet another theory indicates that a hike in the interest rate increases the banks' financing costs whenthe general public's deposits decline. A larger percentage of the financing thus has to be obtained inthe bond market. The banks are also assumed in this case to have a motive to raise the interest ratesmore than the central bank does.Other mechanisms that in certain situations can reduce the impact of monetary policy from its normallevel include the banks tightening their credit standards - known as a credit crunch - because theycannot increase their credit risk exposure, for example, as a result of the capital adequacy rules.
BIS Review 80/20015Following a long period of a strong expansion in credit, based on lenders' expectations of continuedgrowth and high wealth levels, a severe downturn in the economy and falling asset prices can, forinstance, lead to the banks limiting their lending due to uncertainty over the quality of their existingloan stock. With hindsight, the banks can conclude that they have probably misjudged credit risksearlier and thus lent money at an interest rate that was too low, as well as failing to reserve sufficientfunds to cover future losses. Monetary policy relief can in such situations have less impact thanotherwise, as the banks are not prepared to make loans even to profitable investments.To summarise, there is good reason to try to learn more about what affects monetary policy's impact,for instance, via the banks, in different situations. Developments on the financial markets over timeand differences between various countries indicate that the impact on demand and inflation of aparticular monetary policy measure should differ between periods and between countries. It is difficultto estimate how the impact of a change in interest rate on growth and inflation will differ at differentpoints in time and in different countries, but the attempts to do so indicate major differences. Given thefact that the composition of households' financial portfolios, their method of financing theiraccommodation, the significance of bank lending for corporate investments and the formulation ofregulations and taxes differ substantially between different periods in time and different countries, thisis hardly surprising. As I pointed out earlier, inflation expectations probably also play an important rolein price setting. It therefore seems reasonable to assume that the exchange between interest ratesand inflation is less in countries where monetary policy has been aimed at stabilising inflationexpectations than in countries, and points in time, with large fluctuations in the inflation rate.There is also a monetary policy interest in being familiar with the banks' methods for creditassessment, to aid forward-looking assessments of growth under the assumption of unchangedmonetary policy. When the Riksbank makes decisions on the formulation of monetary policy, these arebased on, for instance, assessments of how households and companies will react to rising prices onshares and property. One important condition for enabling optimism regarding future growth andincrease in wealth to be converted into consumption and investment is that this can be financed. Thisis where the banks' assessment of credit risks comes in. The extent to which the banks are preparedto mortgage shares and property is of no minor significance. If the banks manage to capture the risksconnected with fluctuations in asset prices in their credit risk management, this reduces the likelihoodof such fluctuations also being reflected in variations in production and employment.I have mainly devoted my speech today to the role the banks play in monetary policy. Nevertheless,from what I have said it becomes clear that there are many, close links between the Riksbank's twotasks – to promote price stability and to promote financial stability. This is an area of analysis that weare endeavouring to develop further at the Riksbank. However, I shall have to return to this anothertime.
BIS Review 79/20011Einars Repse: Links between the Central Bank and financial markets after theestablishment of the Financial and Capital Market Commission in LatviaSpeech by Mr Einars Repse, Governor of the Bank of Latvia, at the Conference “Banking and Financein the Baltics 2001”, held in Riga, 19 September 2001.*      *      *Since 1st of July 2001, the Financial and Capital Market Commission (FCMC) has taken over theregulation and supervision of the Latvian banking system from the Bank of Latvia. It is widelyrecognized that banking supervision was handed over to the new institution in good shape. Thebanking sector in Latvia is solid, adequately capitalized and well regulated in conformity with theEuropean Union (EU) standards. This was confirmed by the joint International Monetary Fund andWorld Bank Financial Sector Stability Assessment that took place in the first half of this year.The FCMC is now the primary institution responsible for stability and development of the financialmarket in Latvia. However, this does not mean that the overall stability of the financial system as awhole has become less important for the Bank of Latvia. Both institutions will continue to cooperate, asadequate monitoring of financial stability requires a combination of ‘‘macro’’ and ‘‘micro’’ perspectives.In the future, the Bank of Latvia will concentrate more on macro-prudential analysis, while theCommission - on supervision and regulation at the micro level.Pursuant to the Law “On the Bank of Latvia”, the central bank has to implement monetary policy inLatvia by controlling the amount of money in circulation with the aim to maintain price stability.Robust health of the financial sector is essential to ensure an efficient monetary policy transmissionmechanism. Therefore, stability of the financial and banking system will remain an important issuefor the Bank of Latvia.Only a sound and competitive banking sector will be able to:• intermediate savings efficiently, thus contributing to the economic growth;• provide transaction services and payment systems that increase the efficiency ofeconomic activities;• ensure mutual confidence among banks, which is a precondition for smooth functioning ofmoney and securities markets, through which monetary policy is transmitted;• contribute to the accuracy of the data needed for the formulation of monetary policy;• and, last but not least - support exchange rate stability, as a sound banking system servesto stabilize foreign exchange market and diminish exchange rate volatility.The Bank of Latvia has the ability and possesses the necessary tools to influence the marketenvironment:• The commitment to maintain a fixed exchange rate has a favourable impact on savings andinvestments in Latvia, thereby strengthening the country’s financial system in the long run.• The central bank’s focus on price stability enhances long-term planning and henceimproves the process of resource allocation over time, thus contributing to a more efficientfunctioning of the economy. For these purposes it can use monetary policy instrumentsto smooth out excessive interest rate fluctuations and influence money supply in theshort run.Hence, the Bank of Latvia will influence and at a certain level control the financial system throughexisting monetary policy instruments:• First: Reserve requirements.Reserve requirements facilitate implementation of monetary policy and to some extentcreate liquidity reserves that help to stabilize interbank rates. On the down side, reserverequirements can act as a strain on commercial banks and thus limit financialintermediation.
2BIS Review 79/2001In line with Latvia’s economic development and to narrow the spread between deposit andlending rates, the Bank of Latvia has, step by step, lowered reserve requirements. As aresult, the required reserve ratio has been reduced to 6%, and in the future will be targetedto gradually reach the 2% level currently set by the European Central Bank.• Second: Open market operations.The Bank of Latvia currently has the same set of open market instruments as the ECB, andthe most actively used instruments are swap and repo operations. The widespread useof swap operations was dictated by commercial banks’ desire to use their foreign currencyholdings as a collateral for central bank’s loans. However, as the market for government andcorporate securities develops over time, it is expected that traditional repo operations willprogressively become more important.By regulating liquidity in the banking sector through open market operations, the Bank ofLatvia can influence interest rates in the interbank market. Insofar as the lending ratesto the non-banking sector respond to changes in the interbank market rates, the actions ofthe central bank can have implications for the real sector of the economy.• Third: Lender of last resort.If temporary economic difficulties of a financial institution can threaten the stability of thewhole financial system, the Bank of Latvia is entitled to provide emergency financialsupport.According to the Law “On the Financial and Capital Market Commission”, the Commission is“authorised to request the Bank of Latvia to extend a loan against collateral to any creditinstitution with short-term liquidity problems.”The Latvian law clearly separates the function of the lender of last resort from bankingsupervision. Although the law stipulates that the necessary coordination between theFCMC and the Bank of Latvia must take place, it is the Bank that has the final say in thismatter and therefore has to weigh the consequences of its decision.Effective functioning and security of payment and settlement systems is a crucial element of thestability of the banking system. Therefore, this is an issue to which the Bank of Latvia pays particularlyclose attention.In the domestic settlement systems, all interbank settlements are conducted through the Bank ofLatvia. Currently there are two systems in operation at the Bank of Latvia and both are used forinterbank settlement.From November 1998, the Electronic Clearing System replaced the previous, paper-based clearingsystem. Electronic clearing is used for processing retail payments. It can be regarded as anAutomated Clearing House system where payment processing is fully automated and only electronicdocuments are accepted.A year ago, in September 2000, the Bank of Latvia introduced the Real Time Gross SettlementSystem (RTGS). The RTGS system is designed for large volume, urgent payments related tointerbank market transactions, open market and other Bank of Latvia monetary policy operations. Thesystem enhances risk control and is an effective tool for the implementation of monetary policy. Withthe introduction of the RTGS system, the Bank of Latvia’s interbank payment systems have beenfully automated and harmonised with EU requirements.
BIS Review 79/20011Y V Reddy: Communications policy of the Reserve Bank of IndiaAddress by Dr Y V Reddy, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the 150th anniversary ofthe Reuters Group, Mumbai, 28 August 2001.*      *      *Mr. Green, Mr. Weetman, Mr. New and friends,I am thankful to the organisers and in particular Mr. New for giving me the honour of participating inthe 150th anniversary celebrations of the Reuters Group. In all innocence, I accepted the invitationonly soon to realise that there is no free lunch or free dinner in this world. I am assigned the task ofinaugurating the evening and addressing the guests on this occasion. I pleaded for some draft fromReuters, though informally. As you may be aware, as senior bureaucrats, we are good at reading outexcellent speeches drafted by others. But, the organisers insisted on giving me a free hand. It was apolite way, I presume, of suggesting that we do our homework diligently. So, a visit to Reuters Websiteand Websites of several central banks became necessary to select a subject and also to obtain somematerial for a suitable address on this occasion. Of course, I consulted several of my colleagues in theReserve Bank, including Ms. Alpana Killawala, the points person in our relations with the media.ReutersReuters is, perhaps, synonymous with online news but there is more to Reuters than purveying news.In 1850-51, Mr. Paul Julius Reuter, the founder had used a fleet of forty five pigeons to deliver newsand stock prices between Brussels and Aachen in Germany. Now, in 2001, besides serving thefinancial markets using state of art technology, Reuters information is read by an estimated 73 millionpeople each month. The Reuters website provides a long list of its impressive achievements over thelast 150 years. An aspect that is the most striking is the reach of its information to different parts of theworld. Reuters is a prime example of how the most modern available technologies can be harnessedto minimise information asymmetry. To quote from the Reuters website: “Over 5,58,000 professionalusers in 69,700 locations access Reuters information and news worldwide. Data is provided on morethan 9,40,000 shares, bonds and other financial instruments as well as on 40,000 companies.Financial information is obtained from 257 exchanges and over-the-counter markets. 5,047 clientscontribute prices, opinions, and analyses covering a wide variety of markets”.In this background, perhaps this is a proper occasion to share with the distinguished gathering todaysome of my thoughts on dilemmas faced by central banks in their communication policies and themultiple effects of the media. This will be followed by a brief narration of initiatives taken by selectcentral banks and then by a more detailed account of dissemination policies and practices of theReserve Bank of India.Central banks’ dilemmasThe functioning of the central banks has generally been considered highly secretive if not entirely tobe an ivory tower. In fact, a book by William Greider on the Federal Reserve published as recently as1987 is titled “Secrets of the Temple”. The situation has changed, however. For instance, theEuropean Central Bank (ECB) like most other central banks in the world, is laying greater emphasis onits communications policy, as acknowledged by Mr. Otmar Issing about a year ago. In fact, Mr. Issingexplained the communications problem in the context of “euro’s external exchange rate” and the rathermixed opinion of the ECB despite its success in its main task. It is clear that the approaches of centralbanks to communications have changed. What are the reasons for this change?Traditionally, central banking policy formulation has been associated with an element of secrecy, andfor good reasons, a central bank was considered to be an arm of Government. Furthermore, financialmarkets and entities were tightly regulated and functioned the way regulators would like them tobehave. However, with financial deregulation and increasing cross border flows, the central banks ofmost countries have gained some degree of autonomy and with it a sense of accountability. Hence,central banks do see some advantage in communicating in as transparent a manner as is appropriate,their policy intentions and operations. Well informed market participants enable, though not assure,improved functioning of markets. Of course, the policy maker cannot reveal policy cards as it is
2BIS Review 79/2001advisable to maintain an element of surprise or avoid anticipatory actions. Yet, in all cases, either ex-ante, or concurrent or at least ex-post, adequate communication of rationale for policies andoperations is expected now and, in my view, this is desirable.There are several dilemmas faced by central banks while designing an appropriate communicationspolicy. What should be communicated and to what degree of disaggregation, are one set of issues.The second set relates to: at what stage of evolution of internal thinking and debate should there bedissemination. The third set relates to the timing of communication with reference to its market impact.The fourth relates to the quality of information and the possible ways in which it could be perceived.Thus, alleged incoherence or an element of ambiguity at times on the part of central bankers inexplaining policies is as much a reflection of the complexity of the issues as it is of the differingperceptions of a variety of audiences to which the communication is addressed.Perhaps, the diversity in the audience needs to be explained. Broadly speaking, any communicationfrom a central bank is addressed to several constituencies namely, the regulated entities; participantsin financial markets; financial analysts; economists-cum-researchers or opinion makers in theacademia; the multilateral bodies including the International Monetary Fund; the World Bank and ofcourse credit rating agencies; the immediate stakeholder being the Government or Parliament; and theultimate stakeholder being the public at large. Each of these constituencies has its own concerns,time-frame, perception and technical expertise. While there is some scope for designing specificcommunications to be of use to a particular constituency on its unique requirements, a large part ofcommunications has to be addressed to all constituencies. In any case, all communications, unlessthey are very confidential in nature are rightly accessible to all the constituencies and selectivedissemination is almost impossible in modern days of high technology and vibrant democracy. So,often the practical issue is to design an array of instruments and a menu-approach keeping in view thesensitivities and complexities, recognising that the users and uses of a central bank’s communicationsare varied. An illustration is, how to craft a press release or website release that produces hardinformation to professionals but does not keep away the interests of general public.In designing and effectuating a communications policy, it is also necessary to recognise the variety inmedia. Traditionally the press, i.e., the print media has been the most dominant and perhapscontinues to be so especially to reach a wide audience and for analysis. The electronic media is amore recent phenomenon, which is becoming increasingly dominant.The speed with which wire agencies can impact the markets is of special significance to a centralbank. The visual impact is more in respect of television and of course, debates on televisions arelikely. An important means of communication in the recent past has been website and also e-mail. Theproblem before a central banker is to cater to the needs of the different means of communication withappropriate nuance while maintaining the quality of information and credibility of policy. In a sense, wehave two sets of problems in this regard, viz., the variety of target audience and the varying nature ofmedia through which communications occur. Briefly stated, if a central banker sounds confused attimes, he or she may be truly confused; and it is unlikely to be a pretence. But, there are moreoccasions when a central banker knows what to say but is confused when it comes to deciding on thedesign of communication or the appropriateness of media.Multiple effects of the mediaIn assessing the contribution of the media to public good, I would distinguish among at least four typesof effects. The first type may be characterised as the ‘news effect’, which would normally reflect factualor formal positions or events. In a sense, the media’s reporting would be faithful and non-controversial.A second type can be identified as ‘rumour effect’, and often rumours have a destabilising effect and insome cases have the potential to degenerate into self-perpetuating or self-fulfilling events. The rumoureffect often results in unintended losses or gains and people may suspect that there is some vestedinterest behind such rumours. Needless to say, the media’s role will, on the whole, tend to be negativein this channel. The third type is marked by the ‘survey effect’. It is not uncommon for the media toundertake opinion polls or surveys and these could have methodological and other problems in termsof reflecting the true picture. These surveys have a tendency to influence the perception of marketsand sometimes the general public. In such a case, the contribution of the media would depend onscientific methodology adopted, transparency of assumptions, and objectivity in presentation of theresults. Adequate care is a pre-condition to ensure a positive effect through this channel. The fourth isthe ‘interpretation effect’, where media tries to interpret the stand taken by policy makers or markets orcorporates. The interpretation effect may be positive or negative depending on professional skills as
BIS Review 79/20013well as commitment to objectives. Responsibility and accountability would be key to ensure positiveeffect through this channel.In brief, it is my submission that the media’s responsibilities are not confined to its shareholders or toits subscribers, but extend to the larger segment of the public. In this sense, the challenges anddilemmas before the media are perhaps no less than those before the central banks.Dissemination initiatives of central banksCentral banks use a variety of methods to disseminate information to the market. It could include dailypress releases, periodical policy announcements, regular and ad hoc publications, speeches by thetop management, interviews with the press, etc. More recently, central banks have been effectivelyusing the website for disseminating information. However, the critical change that can be observed inrecent years is that the electronic media such as the Reuters have enhanced the ability ofcommunication systems to allow instantaneous reach of information to market participants. The ITrevolution has transformed financial services by changing the speed, scope, nature of information andcommunication.A random survey of the websites of some central banks shows availability of a wide variety ofapplications such as quick dissemination of important policy communications; posting of pressreleases; disclosing information relating to financial markets; releasing economic indicators in variousformats; providing applications to extract statistics in the format desired by the user, equipping otherweb-based services to the financial sector such as facilitating submission of returns, advertising jobopportunities in the central banks, etc. There are increasing similarities in the type of information thatis released by central banks on their websites. The differences in availability of information, that doexist, come from the differences in institutional responsibilities, such as supervision being vested withan authority outside the central bank, etc.It is also observed that many central banks use the website as their primary medium of communicationand look forward to reducing or discontinuing the print media. Some central banks like the Bank ofEngland and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand have offered special initiatives in creating awarenessof their functioning among lay public including schools and colleges.The survey also brings out a universal recognition of four relevant issues, namely:First, in an increasingly deregulated market and enhanced credibility of central banks inmacro-policy, the effective articulation of policy by the central bank is important.Second, appropriate and transparent communications from the central bank helps themarket respond to policies with better information.Third, the perceptions of media are critical and act as a feedback mechanism to the centralbank.Fourth, while central banks are increasingly transparent, the extent of transparency from theregulated units and financial markets is still a matter of concern. This results in a type of informationasymmetry between public authorities and private sector, a factor that needs to be noted by the mediain the discharge of their functions.Communications policy of RBIAgainst this backdrop, I would attempt to explain the communications policy of RBI and bring onrecord the sources of information available to the media and the public from the RBI. Information onareas relating to the economy, banking and financial sector is released with stringent standards ofquality and timeliness. Dissemination of information takes place through several channels such aspress releases, publications - regular and occasional - notifications, Frequently Asked Questions,advertisements and website. The annual April and October monetary and credit policy statements andspeeches and interviews of the Top management articulate the RBI’s assessment of the economy andthe financial system. My presence here today is part of a fruitful and beneficial partnership betweenRBI and media in the broader context of creating public awareness, and obtaining continuousfeedback.
4BIS Review 79/2001The RBI makes efforts to provide quality data to the public at large, which emanates from a robuststatistical system established and strengthened over the years. The fundamental attributes of a goodstatistical system are credibility, timeliness and adequacy. The RBI endeavours to provide crediblestatistics for dissemination through the media through various ways – with updating of data on itswebsite, daily press releases, and its weekly, monthly, quarterly and annual publications. Thecommunications from RBI range from a daily press release on money market data at about 9.00 A.M.;details of repos and reverse repos as part of Liquidity Adjustment Facility at about 12.30 P.M.; the U.S.dollar-rupee reference rate at about 2.00 P.M.; monetary, banking and prices data through a WeeklyStatistical Supplement and the Annual Report of RBI, Report on Trend and Progress of Banking inIndia and the Report on Currency and Finance. Incidentally, you would have already seen the AnnualReport of the RBI for the year July-June 2000-01 on the RBI website at 5 PM today followed almostsimultaneously by wide coverage by the electronic media.The RBI brings out a number of Ad hoc publications, which contain a wealth of useful information onnational and international issues.Information on various facets of Indian Economy is disseminated through the RBI publications, suchas, Handbook of Statistics on Indian Economy, Statistical Tables relating to Banks in India, BankingStatistics - Annual and Quarterly. The document relating to Macroeconomic and MonetaryDevelopments issued along with the April Monetary and Credit Policy Statement is also an importantsource of background information. Incidentally, RBI is the only recognised source for the informationon the consolidated position of State Finances. These publications contain valuable information usefulto researchers and to the general public at large.The RBI also brings out special publications and monographs from time to time dealing with issuessuch as the problems of agricultural finance, company finances, balance of payments, etc., whichhave a unique place in the economic information system in the country. Available evidence oninternational comparisons of level of transparency as well as quality and timeliness of informationclearly shows that RBI comes out well in the top league. Professional standards and credibility of RBIare ranked very high. In fact, several of the speeches of Governor and Deputy Governors of RBI arecirculated to other central banks as part of the Bank for International Settlements Review, Basel,Switzerland. India is also amongst the first few signatories to the Special Data DisseminationStandards (SDDS) as defined by the International Monetary Fund for the purpose of releasing dataand the RBI contributes to SDDS in a significant manner. There has been an ongoing and steadyimprovement in the collection, compilation, coverage and publications of various economic andmonetary statistics.ConclusionIn the context of deregulation and liberalisation of financial markets, it is well recognised that widerdissemination of information by all economic agents and transparency of policy formulation andoperations on part of the Government and other regulatory authorities contribute significantly toefficient markets. Further, timely and relevant information is vital for efficient policy making andstabilising expectations. While opaqueness will lead to inefficiency, asymmetric information wouldcause segmented market behaviour and imperfections. RBI believes that information disseminationleads to minimisation of uncertainties about policy intentions and contributes to market stability. RBI,therefore, lays a great emphasis upon transparency and public availability of information. Agencies likeReuters have a significant role in providing on-line information to market participants. In fact, notmerely the financial market participants use such services and no doubt derive benefit out of it, but theRBI itself utilises such services and is by and large pleased with the benefits derived. In a veryimportant sense, therefore, RBI is not only a supplier of information and analysis but also an attentiveconsumer of media-services such as that of Reuters.In this background, dissemination of information should be authentic, properly classified, and shouldhave sufficient details so that it is understood in a homogenous manner by all participants includingcentral banks. In that sense, while information per se is neutral, if it is understood differently andinterpreted with any element of bias, the purpose of information dissemination may get distortedleading to destabilising influence and panic reactions in the market. There is, therefore, an enormousresponsibility placed upon the agencies viz., press, journals or any other media like Reuters to ensurethat authentic and properly interpreted information are provided to the market.
BIS Review 79/20015Correspondingly, the Reserve Bank of India has a responsibility to benefit from and contribute to theactivities of media such as Reuters.Confidence and mutual trust is the key to a productive role for all concerned. The fact that Reuters hasthought fit to call an official from the RBI on this important occasion is a testimony to the valuable andfruitful relationship between media and the RBI.Thank you.
BIS Review 78/20011Alan Greenspan: The condition of the financial marketsTestimony of Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem, before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington,20 September 2001.*      *      *I would like to begin my remarks this morning by noting how deeply saddened I and my FederalReserve colleagues are that so many talented and productive people from so many walks of life werelost or irreparably harmed last week. Although we are here today to discuss some of the immediateeconomic and financial implications of that tragedy, we are all too aware that the topic we discuss willbe a mere footnote.The terrorism of September 11 will, doubtless, have significant effects on the U.S. economy over theshort term. An enormous effort will be required on the part of many to cope with the human andphysical destruction. But as we struggle to make sense of our profound loss and its immediateconsequences for the economy, we must not lose sight of our longer-run prospects, which have notbeen significantly diminished by these terrible events.Over the past couple of decades, the American economy has become increasingly resilient to shocks.Deregulated financial markets, far more flexible labor markets, and, more recently, the major advancesin information technology have enhanced our ability to absorb disruptions and recover.In the past, our economy has quickly regained its previous levels following the devastation ofhurricanes, earthquakes, floods, and myriad other natural disasters that periodically batter variousregions of our country. Although the trauma of September 11 shares some characteristics with suchdisruptions, the differences are important. In contrast to natural disasters, last week's events are of fargreater concern because they strike at the roots of our free society, one aspect of which is ourmarket-driven economy. All modern economies require the confidence that free-market institutions arefirmly in place and that commitments made today by market participants will be honored not onlytomorrow, but for years into the future. The greater the degree of confidence in the state of futuremarkets, the greater the level of long-term investment. The shock of September 11, by markedlyraising the degree of uncertainty about the future, has the potential to result, for a time, in apronounced disengagement from future commitments. And that, in the short run, would imply alessened current level of activity. Indeed, much economic activity ground to a halt last week.But the foundations of our free society remain sound, and I am confident that we will recover andprosper as we have in the past. As a consequence of the spontaneous and almost universal supportthat we received from around the world, an agreement on a new round of multilateral tradenegotiations now seems more feasible. Such an outcome would lead to a stronger global marketsystem. A successful round would not only significantly enhance world economic growth but alsoanswer terrorism with a firm reaffirmation of our commitment to open and free societies.But before the recovery process gets under way, stability will need to be restored to the Americaneconomy and to others around the world. Arguably, that stability was only barely becoming evident inthe United States in the period immediately preceding the acts of terrorism. Aggregate measures ofproduction, employment, and business spending continued to be weak.That said, consumer spending moved higher in August and appeared to be reasonably wellmaintained in the first part of September. Industry analysts suggest that motor vehicle sales wererunning close to August levels, and chain store sales were only modestly lower. Purchasing managershad noted an improvement in the orders picture in August. Moreover, the dramatic rate of decline inprofits was slowing. To be sure, these signs were tentative but, on the whole, encouraging.During the past week, of course, the level of activity has declined. The shock is most evident inconsumer markets where many potential purchasers stayed riveted to their televisions and away fromshopping malls. Both motor vehicle sales and sales at major chain stores, some of our most currentinformation on consumer spending, appear to have fallen off noticeably. And, the airline and travelindustries have suffered severe cutbacks.The unprecedented shutdown of American air travel and tightened border restrictions have induceddramatic curtailments of production at some establishments with tight just-in-time supply chain
2BIS Review 78/2001practices. Automakers, for example, are reported to have pared production and even closed someplants in the past week, largely owing to supply shortages, though, doubtless, short-term demanduncertainties have also played a part.The effect on financial markets of the devastating attack on the World Trade Center was pronounced,as telecommunications and trading capacities were severely impaired. But the markets are mostlyfunctioning now, albeit in some cases using contingency arrangements, and, as in the past, theinfrastructure will be rapidly restored.For a brief time, the terrorist attack markedly disrupted payment transfers that are usually measured interms of trillions of dollars each day. Many obligators temporarily lost their technical ability to pay ontime, leaving those counting on receiving payments caught short. The pressures ultimately ended upconcentrated in banks. Those needs were met by the Federal Reserve, both through record lending atthe discount window and through an extraordinary infusion of funds through open market operations.To facilitate the channeling of dollar liquidity to foreign financial institutions operating in the UnitedStates, thirty-day currency swap lines were arranged with major central banks, again in recordvolumes. It was essential in such an environment to meet all appropriate demands for dollar liquidity.As the financial markets and payment infrastructure return to normal, loans are being repaid, and thetemporarily bloated balance sheet of the Federal Reserve is now shrinking back to normal.Nobody has the capacity to fathom fully how the tragedy of September 11 will play out. But in theweeks ahead, as the shock wears off, we should be able to better gauge how the ongoing dynamics ofthese events are shaping the immediate economic outlook.For the longer term, prospects for continued rapid technological advance and associated fasterproductivity growth are scarcely diminished. Those prospects, born of the ingenuity of our people andthe strength of our system, fortify a promising future for our free nation.
BIS Review 78/20011Y V Reddy: Reviving confidence in the Indian economyFirst Dr S Radhakrishnan Memorial Lecture delivered by Dr Y V Reddy, Deputy Governor of theReserve Bank of India, sponsored by University Grants Commission and organized by the Universityof Hyderabad, at Hyderabad on 5 September 2001.*      *      *Respected Vice-Chancellor, Professor Rama Rao, distinguished academics and friends,At the outset, I would like to express my grateful thanks to Professor Rama Rao garu for giving me theprivilege and honour of delivering the first Dr. S. Radhakrishnan Memorial Lecture sponsored by theUniversity Grants Commission and being organised by the University of Hyderabad on the occasion ofthe Teachers’ Days this year. So much has been written and said about Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan,that any narration by me would do little justice to one of the greatest philosopher-statesman ofindependent India. An eminent academician, a versatile writer, a brilliant orator, a renownedphilosopher, a respected diplomat and a remarkable President of India, Dr. Radhakrishnan had areputation of weaving a spell on those who heard him. In fact, Bertrand Russell remarked that he hadnever heard philosophy better expounded than by Dr. Radhakrishnan. Of particular relevance today isnot only that Professor Radhakrishnan was a great teacher but also the fact that he served in a vastnumber of Universities. He had his apprenticeship in Madras and Mysore, went to Calcutta and wellbefore he was forty lectured on invitation at American universities and also at Oxford. He set upAndhra University and was also Vice-Chancellor of Benaras Hindu University. The enormity of respectthat he commanded is evident from the fact that the British Government gave him a knighthood; hewas nominated to the League of Nations Committee on Intellectual Cooperation; was called to serveon the Constituent Assembly and had a memorable stint as Ambassador to Moscow. I had been luckyas a student to hear Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan in 1954, on a high school sponsored excursion toDelhi; and I still possess the photograph taken with him. Later, as sub-collector, Ongole, I madeelaborate arrangements at Chinaganjam railway station for him when he was proceeding to Madras in1967 after laying down his responsibilities as President. In brief, my personal contact was limited buthe remains one of the greatest men I ever met in my life, especially since I started my career as ateacher and once again, yearn to be a teacher.Speaking of teachers, let me confess that I am here because of an invitation from someone, who likeDr. Radhakrishnan has not only been a teacher but many more things – Professor Rama Rao. Aneminent and internationally renowned scientist, a respected head of a regulatory body, a Secretary toGovernment remembered even after a decade, a builder of institutions, a great contributor toadvancement of professional bodies and publications, and one of the finest human beings I havecome across. There is lot in common between Prof. Radhakrishnan and Prof. Rama Rao, though oneis from the field of philosophy and the other from the realm of science.Moving from teachers to teaching, the University and Reserve Bank of India (RBI) have assigned methe pleasant task of inaugurating the Master of Technology course in Information Technology, devotedto Banking Technology and Information Security - the first of its kind in India, and perhaps in the world.The pogramme is being jointly launched by the University of Hyderabad (UoH) and Institute forDevelopment and Research in Banking Technology (IDRBT). As per the continuing collaborativeactivities between the two institutions, a 2 Mbps leased line connectivity has been establishedbetween the UoH and the IDRBT with a view to facilitating better and easy communication betweenUoH and IDRBT, sharing library and other resources at UoH and IDRBT and also providing an avenuefor video conferencing. This programme, fully-funded by IDRBT, and open to both direct andsponsored candidates from the banking and financial sectors is a multi-disciplinary programme thatseeks to merge the new and emerging technologies in Information Technology with the domainexpertise in the ever-changing field of banking and financial services. Providing absolute InformationSecurity and IS Audit systems is a challenge, and is of immediate relevance and concern to banks,especially in the context of current as well as changing business environments in banking, likeelectronic payment systems, e-commerce, mobile banking, and Internet banking. Deploying of modernand evolving technologies would require the banks to get equipped with requisite skills on acontinuous basis. Thus, M.Tech. provides an excellent and right mix of the various aspects ofComputer and Information Security that is essential for banking technology to succeed and survive.The Reserve Bank of India, as a sponsor of IDRBT, is happy to be associated with the pioneering and
2BIS Review 78/2001path breaking collaboration between academia and practitioners and assures full support in its futureendeavours for mutual benefit.In fact, IDRBT has already established a Corpus Fund with a seed amount of Rs. 50 lakh to promoteHigher Education and Research in Banking Technology and Management as a core area. Banks andother financial institutions are expected to contribute significantly to the growth of this Fund.It is customary to devote a Memorial Lecture to a theme, which has fundamental significance andcontextual relevance. After consulting with the organisers and keeping in view the interests of the RBI,the subject chosen for this occasion is:”Reviving Confidence in the Indian Economy”. It is necessary torecognise that India remains one of the best performing economies in the world, in spite of the currentindications provoking a debate on the need for revival of the economy. It can be gathered from theanalysis that it is important to revive confidence in the economy in any attempt to improve theperformance. An approach in this regard can be discerned from the latest Annual Report of the RBI. Inthe true spirit of philosophical explorations and interpretations propounded by Dr. SarvepalliRadhakrishnan, the concluding part of the lecture will be devoted to select structural issues critical torestoration of confidence in the Indian economy.Performance of Indian economyIndia today is rated as the fifth largest economy in the world, measured in Purchasing Power Parityterms. Only the U.S., Chinese, Japanese, and German economies are larger than ours. In terms ofGross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rates, India was one of the ten fastest growing economies inthe world during the ‘eighties, and moved up to the eighth fastest during the period 1980 to 1998. Inregard to growth of GDP in per capita terms also, India's performance during the period is among thetop ten.Furthermore, on the basis of data on income or consumption distribution (World Development Report1998-99) for about 80 countries, and using both the ‘Gini’ coefficient and the share of the poorest 20per cent as a measure of distribution, there are only 15 countries in the world, which have a betterconsumption/income distribution than India.While growth is considered to be a key measure of macroeconomic performance, economic stability isindicated by inflation. In the ‘eighties, India’s average inflation rate was close to Asian developingcountries, above developed ones and lower than the average for all developing countries. In the‘nineties, inflation has been relatively low in the second half of the decade.In the external sector, India, along with China, has been described as “an island of stability amidstseas of turbulence” in international currency markets in the recent years.The ratio of debt to GNP in 1999 was 21.3, the only other developing country with a more favourableratio being China. India had the lowest proportion of short-term debt to total debt at 4.3, while forChina, it was 11.5.In regard to fiscal position, however, India’s fiscal deficit is currently among the highest out of 74 majorcountries with population more than 10 million. And of these only two are higher than India.Furthermore, public savings in the ‘nineties in India, which reached its peak of 2.0 per cent of GDP in1995-96, became negative 1.2 per cent of GDP by 1990-2000. The average rate of financial saving ofthe household sector and of private corporate sector generally moved up during ‘eighties and ‘nineties.There is also evidence of decline in the incremental capital output ratio (ICOR) from 4.2 in the 1980sto 3.9 in 1993-2000.There has also been an appreciable decline in poverty. The all-India poverty ratio fell to 27.09 per centin rural areas, 23.62 per cent in urban areas and 26.10 per cent at the all-India level in 1999-2000from 53.1 per cent, 45.2 per cent and 51.3 per cent recorded during 1977-78.Life expectancy has also moved up from 50.4 years in 1980-81 to above 61 years in the 1990s. Therehas been an improvement in the life expectancy at birth for males from 50.9 years to 60.4 years andfor females from 50 years to 61.8 years.The overall literacy has increased from 43.7 per cent in 1980-81 to 63.1 per cent in 1998-99.Moreover, for the first time in four decades, population growth has decelerated to below 2 per cent andthis has been accompanied by a decline in the mortality rate from 12.5 per 1000 in 1980-81 to 8.7 per1000 in the 1998-99.
BIS Review 78/20013Yet, there is a sense of impatience if not despondency at our economic policies. The reasons are fairlyobvious. We start from a low base of GDP from which impressive rates of growth are noticeable. Indiastill accounts for a very large concentration of poverty and of illiteracy, and hence fruits of developmenteither may not reach or are inadequate. While employment in organized sectors has virtuallystagnated, in recent times, insecurity in employment has crept in. Skill-irrelevance of most of themanpower to the emerging needs has a depressing influence, especially when coupled withdownsizing. Moreover, significant and accelerating expectations have been created. There iswidespread awareness of the capacity of the economy to grow rapidly and they see no apparentreason for slower than possible growth.There are, thus, discernible reasons for the current debate on revival of the economy, centeringaround the recent deceleration in the rate of growth, and certainly going beyond the simple exhaustionof animal spirits of the business community in the country.Why the current debate on revival of Indian economyFirst, the deceleration of economic activity for the second year in succession has raised someconcerns about the feasibility of rapidly moving the economy to a higher growth path in the mediumterm. Added to this is the public perception that India is not immune to the slowdown phase of theglobal business cycle.Second, the agricultural sector has exhibited considerable volatility and recorded absolute declines inthe last two quarters of 1999-00 and again in the first quarter of 2000-01. Agricultural productionregistered a negative growth on top of a decline in the previous year.Third, the growth of industrial production decelerated during 2000-01and further to 2.1 per cent in thefirst three months of 2001-02 from 6.1 per cent in April-June 2001.Fourth, services sector, which accounted for a major share of GDP, exhibited a lower growth of 7.5 percent in 2000-01 as against 9.4 per cent in 1999-00.Fifth, there has been lower off-take of nonfood credit from the banking system, especially sinceJanuary 2001.Sixth, imports declined by 0.2 per cent in 2000-01 as against an increase of 17.3 per cent during1999-00. Non-oil imports declined by 8.5 per cent as compared with the increase of 3.2 per cent in1999-00.Seventh, export growth decelerated sharply to 1.7 per cent in April-June 2001-02 from 26.6 per cent inthe three months of 2000-01.Eighth, considerable uncertainty, arising from turbulence in stock exchanges and apprehensions ofliquidity/payments problems, the problems in some cooperative institutions and the largest mutualfund, the downgrading of the rating of a major development financial institution and the repaymentproblems faced by another financial institution, has affected investor sentiment.There are, however, some favourable developments in the economy that need to be highlighted to getacross the major thrust of the argument viz., the current issue is significantly one of confidence,especially on the prospects.First, real GDP growth when viewed in the context of the growth of other countries, is still one of thehighest in the world.Second, inflation has remained stable and low.Third, the financial sector has experienced declining interest rate environment.Fourth, despite turbulence in the stock markets, the other segments of the financial markets haveremained stable and there have been no serious threats to systemic risks.Fifth, the external sector is clearly sustainable with the current account deficit continuing to be lessthan 1 per cent of GDP.Sixth, foreign investment sentiment does not seem to have been affected with FII inflows recordingabout $750 million during April-July 2001 as compared with $ 150 million during April-July 2000.
4BIS Review 78/2001Seventh, the record level of foreign exchange reserves at nearly $ 45 billion on August 24, 2001,stable exchange rate and money market rates provide less risky business environment.Eighth, foodstocks have reached an all-time high, improving food security and immunising theeconomy from transient supply shocks.An approach to revival of confidenceIt is customary for the Reserve Bank of India to present an Annual Report each year and that Reportfor 2000-01, was approved by its Board of Directors on August 16. The Chapter on Assessment andProspects sets out a carefully constructed statement of the RBI Board’s perspective and this providesa useful starting point to debate what needs to be done to revive confidence in the economy.While noting the comfortable position of external sector and the possible moderate impact of globaldevelopments, the need for addressing the predominantly domestic factors is flagged.The present state of the economy reflects a combination of cyclical and structural factors with differentweights assignable.The implication is that any solution should address both the cyclical and structural issues, though therelevant importance and sequencing of the various components will have to be well crafted.In regard to structural factors, a particular mention is made of the operation of the institutionalconstraints on growth. The suggestion is that the legal framework and institutional arrangementswould have to be accorded priority in the structural component.As regards the relative role of macro economic and micro economic considerations, it is made clearthat both require to be addressed, but the Report focuses on importance of micro economic aspects inas much as they are closely linked to institutional factors.The balancing of the reform in financial and non-financial sectors is also highlighted and theimportance of accelerating the reform in real sector, particularly agriculture, is stressed.More specifically, recognising that a large segment of the population is dependent on agriculture andits performance in the recent past has been of considerable concern, the importance of augmentingpublic investment in agriculture is emphasised.In particular, the advantage of shifting public expenditures from subsidies to investment as a means ofefficiency, equity and regional balance is pointed out. Furthermore, desirable measures for thecreation of an efficient system of market intermediaries, quality-enhancement, perhaps throughcertification, introducing insurance mechanisms, developing nation-wide multi commodity exchanges,etc., are listed out. In a sense, therefore, the emphasis is on attaining a quantum jump in theagricultural sector to meet global standards as a means of withstanding global competition and takingadvantage of emerging opportunities in international trade.With regard to industry, the fact that public sector enterprises still dominate the economy is noted anda strong plea is made to end uncertainties in regard to the future of public sector enterprises. Inparticular, the complementarities in public and private sector are emphasised.The thrust is that enhanced resources should be made available to select public enterprises, whichhave strategic significance or strong public purpose, while clearly and promptly disinvestingGovernment's equity in the other enterprises. At the same time, the creation of a conduciveenvironment for industrial revival warrants an appropriate regulatory framework to improveinfrastructure. By implication, one of the approaches advocated is that if labour has to becompensated, it should be done directly rather than incurring open-ended non transparent expensesin the name of revival, through tax concessions, sacrifices by financial institutions and incentives toinduce sickness.Finally, in the context of the new economy, the emphasis is on removal of procedural and institutionalconstraints, thus warning against bureaucratization in the name of creating enabling environment.In the external sector, there is considerable cause for comfort emanating from reasonable level ofreserves, low current account deficit and adequate level of capital flows, but the need for continuedcaution and vigil is rightly noted. Above all, in the current account, improving the export performanceand in the capital account, attracting FDI are highlighted as necessary for medium-term sustainability.By all accounts, the major constraints in regard to both these appear to be the institutional framework
BIS Review 78/20015and uncertainties in regard to the policy framework, both of which need to be tackled urgently as partof confidence boosting measures.On fiscal policy, the major thrust is towards fiscal empowerment in contrast to fiscal enfeeblement torealise the objective of durable fiscal consolidation. This would call for several steps to increase thetax revenues, abolish tax exemptions, enhance the non-tax revenues by ensuring cost recovery, etc. Acase is thus made out for either obtaining adequate return on investments in public sector enterpriseor for disinvestment, unless a specific purpose in the interest of the public at large is served better bypublic ownership.In regard to public debt, a point is made that the size of government borrowings, though most visible,is not the only one element in public debt management. Keeping in view the fact that only 80 per centof the central government’s liabilities are covered by assets even as per the government accountingsystem which is cash based, the health of public finances is linked to the both formal guarantees, andimplicit guarantees. In other words, wherever the government is owner, directly or indirectly, there isan inevitable obligation on the part of the government to the discharge of liabilities in order to avoidreputational risk while declaring a government owned enterprise as insolvent. In brief, a holistic view ofassets and liabilities as well as incomes and expenditures of the public sector as a whole is canvassedin the report, which would warrant significant importance to accounting practices, disclosurestandards, and a degree of transparency in public sector as a whole.In the matter of interest burden, the Annual Report makes a reference to several proposals underconsideration to focus on instruments that currently result in very high effective cost to theGovernment. Another area of concern, though not elaborated in the Report is the element of a Ponzischeme in small savings at high cost to the Government with a tendency to finance the ballooningfiscal needs of State Governments, while imposing serious mismatches in the asset-liability maturityprofile of the Central Government.The concept of fiscal impairment is clearly of special significance for States since the bedrocks ofsocio-economic welfare viz. law and order and social services are in the state sector. The actionsneeded would, therefore, be in terms of expanding public goods and social services includinganti-poverty programmes with concomitant roll-back of fiscal activism in commercial activities.In regard to monetary policy, the major emphasis is on flexibility of interest rates in the financialsystem as a whole. The global developments in terms of oil prices and the domestic developments interms of inflation emerge as important areas to monitor in the conduct of monetary policy. While anumber of instruments have been devised and operating procedures have undergone significantchanges, it is very clear that considerable sophistication and skill are essential in successful conductof monetary policy.As regards financial sector, several problems warranting attention are brought out. These relate toperception of implicit sovereign guarantee in regard to all financial intermediaries, and lack of armslength relationships and lack of clear demarcation between ownership and regulation. In particular,there is a reference to complexities arising out of existence of various types of financial intermediarieswith differing charters owing their origins to prereform strategies, which virtually calls for a thoroughrevamping of the interface of government and Reserve Bank with financial intermediaries that theyown. Above all, the inadequacies in the present banking system, particularly in the cooperative sector,in meeting the credit needs of agriculture as well as small and medium industries necessitate afundamental change in the systems of their governance and functioning.Exploration of some measuresThere is a strong consensus among international observers that there is a weak reform process inIndia, which expresses itself in the form of relatively slow implementation of policies. Another view isthat the “tyranny of ten per cent”, namely the workforce of the organised sector, continues to resist anychange. Yet another view is that in any democracy, reform is generally a slow process since thesacrifices of the vociferous minority come upfront while the benefits to the vast but relatively silentmajority accrue with a time lag. Perhaps, there are elements of truth in each of these views, butwithout doubt, the relevant issues are essentially in the nature of political economy and not merelymatters for technical analysis. Yet, there is merit in exploring some drastic measures, which coulddemonstrably improve the current sentiment.
6BIS Review 78/2001Reviving the economy requires boosting of confidence by combining both structural and othercyclically relevant measures. While the latter are desirable, such measures must be combined on acredible basis with structural measures. In this address, it is not proposed to elaborate on eithercyclically relevant measures or the process of integrating them with structural measures, but confine tostructural issues.It is possible to be illustrative and certainly not exhaustive even in regard to the structural measures.The intention is to express purely exploratory technical views in five of the areas that are critical,namely, financial sector, regulatory framework, public enterprises, delivery of public services, andoverhang issues. These do not in any way constitute the official position of RBI.Advisory on financial sector restructuringIt is useful to understand some features of the financial system in India. Most of the financial savingsstill comprise deposits to the banking sector, with some perceptible flow to life insurance, mutualfunds, government small savings and Provident Funds. About three quarters of the banking depositsgo to government owned banks that currently have invested over one-third of the assets ingovernment securities and a perceptible amount in PSU bonds, development financial institutionscooperatives and government guaranteed enterprises. This gives place to a criticism that governmentowned banks are operating as instruments to finance high public sector deficits. Similar argumentscan be advanced in respect of the largest mutual fund, viz., the Unit Trust of India and the insurancegiant Life Insurance Corporation of India not to mention the General Insurance Corporation. WhileIndustrial Development Bank of India is a public sector statutory corporation, Industrial FinanceCorporation of India’s major shareholding is by government owned Institutions. Industrial Credit andInvestment Corporation of India is a public financial institution and hence has a special statusaccorded by Government.While public tend to repose confidence in these institutions by virtue of their status asGovernment-owned or backed entities, there is corresponding implicit direct obligation on the part ofthe Government to protect the interests of depositors/investors. In other words, any vulnerability inregard to these institutions has an impact on government’s finances. Such a reasonable expectation isnot only justified on the consideration of the concept of "holding out" a backing, but also by theobligations discharged in the past by Government of India in several cases including the case ofCanFina through Canara Bank.The regulators of financial sector have some additional complexities in relation to public sector entities.First, in the case of statutory bodies including public sector banks, there are certain regulatoryconstraints. For instance, both for reasons of legality and reputational risk, the regulator cannot cancela licence, say to a public sector bank, even if it fails to meet capital adequacy norms. The recourseopen to the regulator in the case of owner’s unwillingness to inject capital to meet capital adequacystandards is unclear and this often leads to regulatory forbearance. Second, as in the case of UTI andDevelopment Financial Institutions, the legal basis of jurisdiction of regulators is somewhat ill-defined.Thirdly, Government tends to be closely involved in some operations of many of these institutions' andoverlapping of accountability is plausible. Fourthly, as long as these institutions function withoutreference to sound principles of corporate governance though consistent with their individual statutes,inherent weaknesses persist. In fact, where there has been disinvestment and consequently someshares are held by the public, minority shareholder interests are not seriously factored in. Fifthly, theGovernment expects the regulator to often function as an agent of owner (Government), which furthercomplicates accountability. Finally, the regulatory focus in respect of these institutions as set out byGovernment itself is not well defined and diffused. The issue is whether defining the respective rolesand making their transactions more transparent would improve confidence in the financial sector byavoiding the criticism that they often take recourse to lending, investment, rescheduling and bailouts,and extending guarantees as behest operations. It is against the above background that institutionstend to be somewhat less than responsive to regulatory regime as well as market discipline.Furthermore, the non-performing assets (NPAs) arising out of priority sector lending, which is in thenature of directed lending and those covered by the Bureau of Industrial and Financial Restructuring(BIFR) together account for well over fifty per cent of total non-performing assets of the bankingsystem. The number of companies referred to the BIFR by three major Development FinancialInstitutions (DFIs) stood at 694 with a total loan outstanding of about Rs.6,275 crore as at end-March2000. Above all, in view of their close interrelationships, the risks of contagion are high and hence theneed to overhaul them to inspire confidence.
BIS Review 78/20017It is essential to recognize the constraints under which these entities are operating in a highlycompetitive environment induced by the reform process. Apart from the issues of diffusedaccountability to the Government and regulator and multiple objectives to be pursued in order to justifypublic sector nature, their management style is occasionally cramped by extraneous interventions. Asa consequence of all these factors, at operating levels of these entities, there may be a strongincentive to inaction than action.It would be totally inappropriate to conclude that these institutions are more vulnerable now thanbefore. In fact, their vulnerabilities were neither defined nor measured in the past and the pressurebuilt on them by the financial regulators in the recent past has enabled them to improve theirfunctioning and disclose their real status. The dimension of the problem which were concealed isbeing revealed and there is perhaps a strong case for admitting and assessing the real status, andtake corrective actions to meet the overhang issues and design strategies to make the futureoperations efficient, stable and accountable.In regard to private sector banks including cooperatives, vulnerability of some of them is no longer animpossible contingency. Hence, an interesting question that can arise is the appropriate response thatis justifiable in case there is a run on such a bank. The primary responsibility of the regulator istwo-fold, viz., protection of small depositors and avoidance of contagion resulting in systemic risk. Incase of such problem, the regulator should attempt to identify whether it is due to illiquidity or aninsolvency problem. In case it is assessed as an illiquidity problem, the regulator may in exceptionalcases act as a Lender of Last Resort and consider infusing temporary liquidity to such a bank to tideover the problem of mismatch. In case it is assessed by the regulator that a bank is insolvent or thebank itself closes its branches for banking operations, the logical requirement would be liquidationunless a serious contagion resulting in systemic risk is anticipated. A prompt liquidation operation,whenever warranted by these considerations would ensure two aspects. First, retail or smalldepositors upto Rs. 1 lakh would be able to recover their deposits quickly (perhaps in matter of days)and secondly, depositors with over Rs. 1 lakh deposits would need to book losses. In particular,corporates or institutions that have placed deposits in banks may have vested interest in prolongingthe matter even at the cost of small depositors in order to avoid disclosure of losses in their balancesheets. Under these circumstances, the regulator has to make difficult decisions/judgments at shortnotice, often with incomplete information. Sometimes, liquidity and solvency issues get intermingledwith discomfort to the respective regulatory arms.In India, very often, in case of such banks, for a variety of reasons, a softer approach is taken andsometimes legal hurdles are faced. It is possible to argue that this soft approach has resulted in atypical situation of moral hazard when the management tends to become inefficient and depositors donot exercise adequate prudence. The depositors in banks should be encouraged to exercise at leastas much caution, attention and time when they place deposits as they do when they purchasevegetables. Thus, a clearer enunciation of effective policy in regard to vulnerable banks would enableswift action by the regulator and exercise of more caution by depositors. In this context, insistence ongreater disclosure and the regime of Prompt Corrective Action would be relevant.To put it differently, the current priority for policy should be to clarify the relationships between theregulator, regulated, owner and government as well as a well-defined regulatory focus to enablehealthy development of financial markets. Perhaps, this needs even more urgent attention than adebate on single versus multiple regulators. My experience as Chairman of Standing Committee onInternational Standards and Codes has provided a clue for this purpose in the form of AdvisoryGroups. On the same analogy, the highest level in the country say the Prime Minister or the NationalDevelopment Council could constitute an independent Advisory Group on Financial SectorRestructuring with eminent non-officials as members and the officials should be available only tofacilitate the work of such bodies. Such an advisory body should be able to produce a blue print withinfew months since substantial international experience and domestic research are already available inthis direction.Zero regulationAs mentioned, one of our major achievements in this decade has been the strength and successfulmanagement of the external sector. There are some lessons to be learnt from the experience. First,there was initially a fear that liberalisation of imports and delinking financing of imports with importlicensing would result in a surge in imports, but a few argued that such fears were unfounded and, infact, the import bill would be down. The results vindicated the views of the few liberalisers viz.,
8BIS Review 78/2001inventories went down as uncertainties in administration of import-regime were removed; moreover,users of imports could try out and experiment with domestic supplies without diluting their rights toimport (since import permit was both on entitlement and on commitment). Second, import of gold wasvirtually prohibited on the ground that gold is unproductive and hence precious foreign exchangeshould not be wasted on it. A few argued that there is a strong sentiment in favour of gold in India (formangala-sutra, for streedhan, as both a consumption and investment good) and hence was importedin any case through unofficial channels resulting in significant trade and currency transactions beyondthe pale of policy and law. The argument of the few that allowing of import of gold liberally willeliminate such unofficial transactions both on receipts and payments side of the current account,reduce the outflow of forex for transaction costs and improve the effectiveness of policy of exchangerate management has been fully vindicated. At the same time, the caution expressed by the very samefew in regard to capital flows has also helped India in withstanding the volatility of international flows. Itis not the case that there are no anomalies left in the management of the external sector. For example,while an Indian resident has the option of spending a generous amount of foreign exchange on aholiday abroad or liberally send gifts, a resident is not permitted to use the same entitlement to acquirea foreign financial asset. It must be relevant to recognise that the liberal regime for individual residentson current account has not revealed any major abuse of the facilities or any major drain in terms offoreign exchange outgo. Similarly, a tourist in India too is discriminated in airlines and hotels to theextent payment has to be higher and in foreign currency, thus giving a signal that the Rupee is not avalid currency for some transactions within India. The thrust of the argument is that appropriatederegulation and well crafted restrictions are key to successful policy, and in India such an approach isfeasible when policy makers and bureaucracy recognise that they are dealing with people with theirpreferences, prejudices, responses, etc., and that every regulation needs to be justified that itsdemonstrable benefits exceed the costs of administering regulation and overall costs of compliancewith regulation.It is heartening to note that the Prime Minister has recognised the enormity of the issue of institutionalimpediments in the revival of economy when he declared before the meeting of National DevelopmentCouncil on September 1, 2001 : “We must quickly identify and eliminate all perverse laws, regulationsand procedures which lead to unproductive activities, cost increases and sap the energies of theentrepreneurs".In order to operationalise the suggestion, Parliament or Government may consider establishing “ZeroRegulation Advisory”, a person or a Committee of eminent non-officials who would take on board anyquestioning of any regulation or Law as excessively intrusive or costly or unnecessary. It can alsoaccept suggestions for modifications or alternatives. The regulator concerned would have to justifycontinuance of such a regulation to the satisfaction of the Committee. The advise of the ZRA, whichshould be made public should be binding unless countermanded by a public speaking order by theauthority appointing the ZRA. The experience of Reserve Bank with Regulations Review Authority,though somewhat circumscribed, is very instructive in this respect. For example, ZRA could designateRegulation Review Outpost in each regulatory organisation, somewhat on the lines of the ChiefVigilance Commissioner designating vigilance officers in various Ministries and organisations, thoughthe reporting and work methods would have to differ. No doubt, the ZRA would have jurisdiction overthe regulatory organisations also. Such a system needs to be applied for legislation also since most ofthe enactments do not contain what are known as “sunset clauses”. While advocating zero regulationas a process at this juncture as part of general review, it is essential to devise and strengthenappropriate and credible regulatory framework wherever essential, such as in regard to physicalinfrastructure.Portfolio management approachAs explained in the current Annual Report of RBI, the public enterprises are uncertain about theirfuture and are starved of capital due to fiscal stress, both factors seriously affecting their morale. Theuncertainties in regard to the policy intentions as well as market response to disinvestment add to lackof capital formation and sub-optimal performance. Moreover, experience indicates that Ministries lackthe incentive to divest, and even when they do, lack the expertise to see through the process. Whilebudgetary compulsion appear to give a push to disinvestments, in the process, several distortions maytake place such as selling shares with assurances of monopoly, selling minority share-holding,intra-public sector transactions giving an erroneous impression of disinvestments, etc. Unfortunately,all these tendencies, especially delayed processes could lead to loss of output in public enterprises,reduced income to Government, adverse impact on workers, contagion to financial sector, especially
BIS Review 78/20019public sector banks and erosion of share holder value culminating in possible deterioration of familysilver into family junk.It must be noted that the functioning of the public enterprises impacts the fiscal situation both on acontinuing and contingent basis. The relationship between Government and Public enterprises as alsoamong the enterprises has followed and are still following what has been described as the joint familyapproach, which undermines transparency and accountability. The examples of input-outputrelationship between coal production, railways, steel making, power generation, public sector banksand insurance companies are enough to indicate the potential for operations at the behest of non-commercial considerations, many of which are not even properly accounted for in their respectivebalance sheets, profit & loss account etc. in a mutually consistent manner. Such linkages may havepersisted in the long process of disinvestment that has been undertaken. Considerable progress hasbeen made in imparting transparency and accounting for transactions on commercial considerations,but the process is far from complete.It is possible to enunciate some ground rules for defining the future of public enterprises (both financialand non-financial) on the basis of what may be termed as Portfolio Management approach. First,whenever a private operator is permitted to enter an activity and compete with an existing publicenterprise, the unique rationale for continued public ownership is eroded as such enterprises form partof commercial investment portfolio of government.Secondly, the Government should have the prerogative and obligation to elaborate and defineconsiderations that determine non-commercial characteristics warranting public ownership on asubsisting basis.Thirdly, all enterprises in commercial investment portfolio have to be operated on commercialconsiderations and shareholding may be continued, reduced or expanded on commercial (whichincludes financial) considerations alone. To ensure this, ownership of all such enterprises need to betransferred to what may be termed as Portfolio Management Company of India (PMCI). No doubt, theorganisational forms of all such enterprises would be companies under Company Law totally on parwith other competing entities. This procedure recognises that while Government or Ministry has theresponsibility to decide on public purpose of an entity, disinvestment or operations of a commercialentity require different set of expertise and processes.Fourthly, PMCI would assess the expected cash flow over the years with continued total or majority orminority ownership vis-à-vis the capital receipts expected from disinvestment, from time to time.Naturally, the cost of funds for Government and by extension to PMCI will be a consideration. In otherwords, the PMCI will replace the present advisory Disinvestment Commission and will operate as anindependent portfolio manager.Fifthly, public interest considerations such as strategic presence and protection of interests of labour inrespect of each enterprise will have to be specified and mandated by Government while transferringenterprises to the PMCI.Sixthly, PMCI will have the flexibility to provide financial resources to those enterprises which canperform well or those which have the potential to increase shareholder value.Clearly, while the decision as to whether any enterprise should be in public or private sector is a policydecision to be made by Government at higher level, in respect of those enterprises which are purely ina commercial but competitive environment, the process of expansion, strengthening or disinvestmentare essentially operational matters and hence best carried out by professionals with due regard todynamics of the market and securities regulation. This should ensure that the total investment portfolioof the commercial enterprises of the government is managed efficiently reconciling commercialobjectives and sound fiscal management. This in brief is the logic behind the proposed PMCI.Bypass and delivery of servicesThe importance of fiscal adjustment at State Level in enhancing the output and quality of services hasbeen recognised. The popular perception of effect of reform and thus confidence in the economyappears to have been undermined by the deterioration in the quality of public services be it educationor health or even drinking water. While a generation ago, most of these facilities were sought andprovided in the government sector, today, a large part of some of these facilities is available only oncommercial basis. Consequently, many, especially the poor are deprived of reasonable or in any caseequitable access to these services. In fact, even security of buildings is getting increasingly privatised
10BIS Review 78/2001in urban areas. In other words, there is a phenomenon of “bypass" of these public services since themain arteries appear choked, on which enormous sums are spent by Government. There issometimes a tendency to spend energies in regulating the bypass activities for ostensible publicpurpose than on improving the quality of services in public domain. While superfluous regulatoryaspects would be considered by the proposed ZRA, there is a need for assessing, on a continuousbasis, the cost of inputs and the quantity as well as quality of output in regard to delivery of thesepublic services. Perhaps, it is possible to devise mechanisms under the aegis of the Comptroller andAuditor General to make such assessments on a continuing and scientific basis, by outsourcing as isbeing done in respect of commercial audit of public enterprises. Indeed, the audit of delivery of suchpublic services deserve far greater energies and attention than many other sectors.It is hoped that media and academia would join in such efforts to assess these sectors, which arecritical to the nation’s well being.Overhang issuesIt is necessary to make a distinction between what may be termed as “flow” issues and overhangissues. There is merit in insulating the overhang problem from flow issues and demonstrably solve theflow problem upfront. For example, in regard to food stocks there is addition to buffer stocks virtuallyon a continuous basis and a policy needs to be evolved to tackle this flow. Any attempt to sort out theoverhang accumulated excess stocks on an ad hoc basis would obviously have limited success. Anysolution to the overhang problem of large magnitude is bound to be operational over the medium-termand may involve admission of the magnitude of possible losses to be incurred. Yet another examplerelates to the power sector, where addition to capacities to generate without ensuring cost recoveryadds to the problem of accumulated losses. Prima facie, the other major areas with considerableoverhang problems are financial sector, public enterprises, pension and provident liabilities and thecooperative sector. Since many of these issues require well crafted medium- to long-term actions, itmay be necessary to define the goals specifically and negotiate the process rather than move forwardin an ad hoc manner. In other words, disjoined incrementalism may not be mistaken for sequencing ofreforms and there is merit in coming clean, defining destination and negotiating as part of politicalprocess, the arduous but rewarding journey towards the sustainable and credible progress towards amodern, humane, prosperous and egalitarian society.Perhaps, Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, the philosopher – Statesman – teacher would have endorsedsuch a transparent but consensus based approach.Thank you!
BIS Review 77/20011I J Macfarlane: The movement of interest ratesGiblin Lecture by Mr I J Macfarlane, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, at the University ofTasmania/Economic Society of Australia (Tasmanian Branch), Hobart, 18 September 2001.*      *      *Let me start by thanking the University of Tasmania for inviting me to give this lecture, whichcommemorates one of Australia’s truly remarkable men. My choice of topic tonight was made longbefore the tragic events in the United States last week. Before moving on to the main body of myspeech, a few comments are in order about recent events.The first order of business for central banks at times such as this is to ensure that the financialmarkets and the payments system can operate effectively. This has been accomplished. The FederalReserve was open and the US payments system operating on the day of the attack. Central banksaround the world operated to assure market participants that there would be ample liquidity. We herein Australia did likewise, and have added substantial additional funds into the cash market, and arecontinuing to ensure that additional liquidity is available as required.Assessing the lasting economic impacts of the events will take longer. Much will hinge, obviously, onthe extent to which investors and consumers in the United States respond to the tragedy by scalingback their activities and plans. That is almost impossible to predict. In the United States, whereeconomic conditions were deteriorating and confidence waning prior to the attack, the FederalReserve has brought forward an easing of monetary policy. Some other countries already directlyaffected by the US weakness (Canada), or seeing unexpected weakness of their own (continentalEurope) have likewise eased monetary policy. These moves themselves will help, of course, toaddress the risks to global growth which already existed and those — as yet almost impossible toassess — which may result from the reaction to the attacks themselves.I know there were some who speculated about whether Australia might join this action today, easingfurther the already expansionary setting of monetary policy currently in place. We have, as usual,closely monitored events abroad and at home on a continuous basis. We have had better economicdata in Australia lately than observed in the United States or Europe. The weakness of globalconditions in the short term will affect Australia, as we said in our statement announcing an easing ofpolicy just two weeks ago. But we have not seen, in the past week, anything relating to Australianmonetary policy’s field of operation which was so urgent that it warranted the suspension of the normaltimetable of the deliberative processes of our Board.With that said, let me now return to the main body of my speech.Sometimes it requires an effort to find the complimentary remarks that usually preface a lecture suchas this. But not so in the case of Giblin. While he is remembered principally as an economist, he didnot take up this calling on a full-time basis until he was 47 years old, by which time he had alreadydone so much in other areas.1 After graduating from Cambridge, during which time he played rugby forEngland, he spent some time prospecting for gold in Canada, became a merchant seaman, aplantation manager in the Solomon Islands, an orchardist in Tasmania, a Member of the TasmanianParliament, and was decorated for bravery in World War I. As an economist, he made contributions ina number of areas and had a close association with central banking through his membership of theBoard of the Commonwealth Bank. But it is another aspect of this extraordinarily gifted man that Iwould like to commemorate tonight – his willingness to communicate difficult economic ideas to thebroader public.Giblin wrote a series of articles in 1930 called Letters to John Smith 2 in which he set out the economicissues facing Australia at the start of the Depression. This series faced economic issues head on, butdid not talk down to its readers. I will try to follow his example this evening. What I intend to do is toanswer three questions that are sometimes put to me by members of the public, rather than by regularparticipants in monetary policy debates. Because the questions are from “lay” people, they mayappear naive to a professional audience, but I often find that blunt untutored questions are the hardestto answer, and they can often force a re-examination of previously unquestioned assumptions. They                                                     1See Copland (1960).2ibid.
2BIS Review 77/2001can also open up some interesting historical and academic issues. I should also add that my choice oftopic tonight is not prompted by any current economic events, but is the outcome of some reflectionsgoing back a decade or two.The three questions are the following:1. Why does the Reserve Bank have to change interest rates at all: why can’t they be leftconstant?2. Why does the Reserve Bank have to be involved in the first place: why can’t thedetermination of interest rates be left to the market?3. Why do we need to set our own interest rates in Australia: why can’t we just accept the ratesof another country, e.g. the United States?Obviously these three questions come from quite different perspectives, and the people who ask themare making very different assumptions about how an alternative system for setting interest ratesshould work. But there is, I think, a common thread that connects them. That is the view that it wouldbe desirable to take away the element of discretion from interest rate setting, whether by making themconstant, by "leaving it to the market" in some sense, or by ceding the discretion to another country. Inother words, the questions arise out of a certain scepticism as to whether interest rate setting reallyrequires an active decision making role for the central bank.One preliminary point to be dealt with before going to the substance of these issues is what we meanby "the interest rate". There are, in fact, many interest rates – short-term, long-term, private,government, on loans or on securities, etc. – so which one do we mean? In this discussion, it makesmost sense to focus on the short-term interbank rate that is typically set by a central bank – inAustralia, the overnight cash rate (usually referred to as just the cash rate). The rest of the ratestructure can be thought of as keying off current and expected cash rates, and it is the cash rate that isthe main driver of movements in the interest rates that borrowers actually pay. So questions about theappropriate system of interest rate setting in this context really amount, in essence, to questions abouthow the cash rate should be determined.Let me turn now to the three questions I have just outlined.Question 1: Why do interest rates have to vary?A lot of people are unhappy about changes in interest rates. When rates rise, there are always a lot ofcomplaints in the media drawing attention to the plight of people with mortgages. When rates fall, themedia usually treat this as good news, but I get a lot of letters from retirees who take the oppositeview. One solution would be to instruct the open market desk at the Reserve Bank to operate in a waywhich kept interest rates at their current level indefinitely. Why would we not wish to do this?There are two answers to this question: one which is historical, the other more theoretical.The historical approach is to ask whether there has ever been a monetary system that did not involvevariations in interest rates. The answer is no. Interest rates have always moved up and down under allthe monetary regimes that have existed, whether the regime was a gold standard, a currency board, anormal fixed exchange rate, a monetary target, an inflation target, or a regime of pure discretion by thecentral bank. If someone can think of an example of a successful monetary system where interestrates never had to change, I would be very interested to hear of it.But while most people can instinctively appreciate this point, there are, no doubt, some who would liketo know what would be wrong with trying to hold interest rates permanently fixed, even if it has notbeen done before. This brings me to the second part of the answer, based on economics: a fixedinterest rate policy would be unsustainable because it would inevitably lead to either an inflationary ora deflationary spiral.This conclusion is well established in the theoretical literature,3 but it does not require any greatfamiliarity with monetary theory to appreciate how it is arrived at. Suppose, for example, that a centralbank attempted to set the interest rate at a low level which imparted a strong stimulus to demand and                                                     3The technical way of describing the weakness of permanently fixing the interest rate is to say that it is an unstable rulebecause it leads to indeterminacy of the price level. This point has been appreciated at least as far back as Henry Thornton(1802) who analysed the inflationary consequences of the fixed interest rate policy then favoured by the Bank of England.
BIS Review 77/20013activity. Over time, if that were maintained, it would cause inflation to rise, and, with a fixed nominalinterest rate, the real interest rate would decline, thus leading to further increases in demand andinflation. This process would continue through successive rounds resulting in an inflationary spiral.By a similar logic, if the initial level of the interest rate were set too high, a self-reinforcing process inthe opposite direction would ensue, culminating in a deflationary spiral and rising unemployment. Onlyif the interest rate could be set at an exact equilibrium point would these two extremes be avoided,and, even then, the equilibrium would be temporary. Any economic event that pushed the economyslightly away from its equilibrium would set off one of the two self-reinforcing processes I have justdescribed. One response to this line of argument might be to suggest that the central bank try tostabilise the real rather than the nominal interest rate, but this already concedes the main point: thatthe nominal rate has to be adjusted in response to information about current and prospective inflation.Having made this point, I have to concede that there are not many people who would advocate thatinterest rates should literally be kept permanently fixed. But there is a more subtle version of thisviewpoint which is much more widely held: that is the view that policy should always aim to keepinterest rates as stable as possible. Expressed in this way, the idea sounds more reasonable, and Ithink it is fair to say that it pervades some of the commentary that follows interest rate adjustments –the idea that changes in interest rates (and especially increases) should be avoided if possible. Weneed to be clear that this is an incorrect view, for the same reasons I have just outlined. If policy wereto give too great a weight to stabilising interest rates, as an end in itself, it would risk destabilising theeconomy, because it would fail to keep up with inflationary or deflationary pressures as they emerge.Of course, it would also be a fallacy to jump to the opposite conclusion, that more interest ratevariation is always better. Obviously, a policy which made large and hastily-decided changes ininterest rates would also be a destabilising force, so it has to be recognised that interest rates can bemoved by too much as well as too little. How much variation, then, is the right amount?This is not the sort of question that is open to a precise quantitative answer, but it is certainly possibleto give some general principles.• First, it depends on the size of the shocks that the economy experiences. Bigger interest rateadjustments will probably be needed the bigger the shocks to which you are responding.When the shocks and imbalances are small, interest rates do not need to move as much• Second, it depends on how responsive the economy is to a given change in interest rates.Arguably in the 1970s and 1980s, when inflation was high and variable, the economy wasless responsive to a given change in interest rates than it has been subsequently. Hence,larger changes in interest rates were needed to achieve a given effect. Since the early1990s, interest rate changes have generally been much smaller than in the earlier period.• Third, it depends on how much uncertainty there is. When you are very sure about yourreading of the economy and about the likely effects of a change in interest rates, it may bepossible to move rates very quickly in response to an important piece of information. Butwhen you are highly uncertain about how to interpret events, it pays to be more cautious andgradual in your approach. To use an analogy with driving — you should slow down in a fog.It follows from this that the "right" amount of movement in interest rates depends very much on thecircumstances. Sometimes rates will be highly variable, as they were in the 1980s, and sometimesthey will be quite stable, as they have been in the most recent decade. In all of this, interest ratestability should be seen not as a goal in itself, but as a by-product of a stable macro-economicenvironment.Let me turn now to the second of my three questions.Question 2: Why not leave interest rates to the market?This question, again, is based on a plausible-sounding premise, but the proponents of this view areoften rather unclear about what "leaving it to the market" would really mean in an operational sense. Itmight mean several things.4                                                     4One possible meaning, that will not be discussed here, is that open market operations should be directed actively tocontrolling growth of the money base and thereby letting interest rates be determined as a residual. Since this suggestioninvolves active intervention by the central bank, it is hardly in keeping with a "leave it to the market" approach. For those
4BIS Review 77/2001In its simplest form, leaving interest rates to the market would mean simply telling the Reserve Bank tocease all open market operations. It is worth exploring what would be the consequences of such apolicy.In a world where the Reserve Bank was undertaking no open market operations, the amount of cashthat underpins the money market (exchange settlement funds, or what the academics call "high-powered money") would depend on the Government’s fiscal balance, and it is not hard to see that thiswould be likely to result in monetary instability. Any government deficits not financed by an exactlycoincident issue of debt to the public, for example, would mean a rise in cash and a fall in interestrates. Similarly, a surplus not exactly matched by debt retirement would lead to a shrinkage of theamount of cash and an escalation of interest rates. In both cases, there would be much more short-runvolatility in interest rates than exists at present. This is because the day-to-day fluctuations in theGovernment’s position, which can be quite large, would no longer be smoothed out by Reserve Bankopen market operations.A further point to add here is that even maintaining a balanced fiscal position on a daily basis wouldnot ensure these effects would be avoided. Even with the fiscal position in balance, the system couldbe destabilised by changes in the public’s demand for currency. Because the public’s demand forcurrency expands with the growth of the economy, it could only be accommodated in this regime bysome other source of cash such as provided by RBA open market operations. Failing this, there wouldbe continuing upward pressure on interest rates and economic contraction.I have spelled this out in some detail because proponents of the "leave it to the market" view often donot have a clear idea of what their position really means. But if they mean simply ceasing ReserveBank operations, and leaving interest rates to the market in that sense, then it is clear that such asystem would not be workable. It would be a recipe for more interest rate volatility, not less.5To be fair to those saying rates should be left to the market, there are some who have a moresophisticated view. They would argue that I have made two assumptions that could easily be changed.First, if the Government did not bank with the central bank, then its fiscal position would not affecthigh-powered money. And second, if the central bank did not issue bank notes, but bank notes wereinstead issued by commercial banks, then it would not involve the central bank having to provide cashto the system. These changes would eliminate the central bank from the picture entirely, and bring usto the world of "free banking" so beloved of a small group of academics.Among supporters of the free banking ideal, there are at least two schools of thought as to how such asystem should work. One view is that money should be ultimately linked to a commodity such as gold,so that bank notes issued by commercial banks would essentially be "gold certificates" redeemable ingold on demand. Therefore, the supply of gold would act as a discipline against over-issue of notesand the system would ensure that interest rates were determined by the supply and demand for funds.While examples that resemble this outline do exist in early banking systems such as Australia before1910, they all eventually gave way to what are now conventional systems based around a centralbank.6 The reason was that such "free" banking systems were found to be prone to instability without acentral bank to manage liquidity and provide last-resort funding in a crisis. Banking systems tied to acommodity standard were simply not flexible enough to cope with periodic bank runs and liquiditycrises. No doubt, the true believers in free banking would argue that the theory was never properlytried, and that, if it were, the market would find a solution to the apparent problems. But that is to makethe theory unassailable by pure assumption.The other school of thought on free banking is an even more radical one.7 It proposes a system ofcompeting private currencies that would not have to be linked to any standard of value. The banksoperating in such a system would compete with one another to offer sound currencies on terms that                                                                                                                                                                     who would like to introduce money base targeting, see Macfarlane (1984 and 1989) and Goodhart (1995) for the contraryview.5Another interpretation of what "leaving it to the market" could mean is that the Reserve Bank should move the cash rate towhere the market expects it to be. This could mean, for example, moving the cash rate to where the 90-day rate currently is.The problem with this approach is that the current level of the 90-day rate is mainly a reflection of where the market expectsthe Reserve Bank to set the cash rate 90 days hence. The process then becomes completely circular.6See Pope (1989) for a discussion of "free banking" in Australia prior to 1910. The more commonly cited case of free bankingis in the 18th century Scottish banking system (see White, 1984). Note, however, that other writers such as Goodhart (1988)express scepticism that this was a true case of "free banking".7The best known proponent of this view is Hayek (1976).
BIS Review 77/20015were attractive to the public. In effect, a country operating such a system would depend uponcompetition between commercial banks to ensure stability in the financial system and low inflation.To my mind, these free-banking proposals really belong in the world of technical curiosities. They canbe argued to work in theory, but the fact is that there is no working example of such a systemanywhere in the modern world. So I have to conclude that those who say interest rates should be leftto the market are proposing something that is either not workable (if they mean simply shutting downcentral bank operations) or something that is much more radical than most people would be preparedto accept.This brings me to my third question.Question 3: Why not just accept US interest rates?The premise behind this question is that we could do away with the discretionary role of the ReserveBank by having a rule that interest rates would always be equal to those set by the US Fed. My firstcomment on this is that it is hard to see why anyone would see this as a particularly attractive goal. Itcertainly would not do away with central bank discretion, but only replace the discretion of one centralbank with that of another. And it would be a discretion tailored to meet US conditions, not to policyrequirements in Australia.But leaving aside the question of whether it would be desirable, the main question I want to focus onis: is it feasible? The answer is, it depends on how it is done. If the mechanism for achieving equalinterest rates with the United States was that we adopt the US dollar, or establish a fixed exchangerate, then it should be technically achievable. Interest rate convergence would then be a by-product offixing our currency to the US dollar, and, the more credible the exchange rate peg, the more closelyour interest rates would shadow those in the United States. That was how interest rate convergencewas achieved within Europe, though the same process is proving extremely difficult in Argentina. So ifthe people asking us to adopt US interest rates are really arguing for a change of exchange rateregime, then there is no dispute that it could probably technically be done. But this is really a differentdebate from the one about how to set interest rates.If, on the other hand, someone is arguing for adopting US interest rates under the existing exchangerate regime, I would have to say that such a strategy would not be workable. The reasons for this arequite similar to those I outlined earlier under question 1.Suppose we began such a regime in a position of equilibrium, in which Australia and the United Stateshad the same inflation rates and there were no imbalances tending to push the exchange rate in onedirection or the other. In these conditions, we could expect the level of interest rates in the twocountries to be the same. But if we then established a rule that Australian interest rates would alwaysbe equal to those in the United States, the system would be extremely vulnerable to any event thataffected the relative performance of the two economies. For example, if there were contractionaryforces operating on Australia, but not the United States, the level of interest rates would not be able torespond, and the result would be a downturn in the Australian economy, and in extremis, deflation. Anexpansionary shock would likewise destabilise the economy in the other direction. The strategy couldonly be maintained if, by a fluke, economic conditions in the two countries remained perfectlysynchronised.Having made this point, it is interesting to note that interest rates in Australia and the United Stateshave at times moved quite closely together in recent years. There is nothing wrong with that. We justneed to be clear that when this occurs, it is a result of the two countries experiencing similar economicconditions, not something that has been set up as an end in itself.ConclusionIn the history of monetary economics there has been no shortage of proposals to make the systemautomatic, and thereby to eliminate the need for central banks to be involved in setting interest rates. Ihave looked at three simple proposals of this sort, and tried to show why they would not be viable orwould have very different consequences from those imagined by their proponents. In a modernmonetary system, it is not possible to have interest rates on automatic pilot, and so a discretionary rolefor the central bank in setting interest rates cannot sensibly be avoided.
6BIS Review 77/2001All of this is a long way from saying how the decision-making process should work: what should be theobjectives and how the process should be governed. I have given my views on these matters in publicon many occasions, as have a number of my colleagues, so I will not go over the same ground againtonight. Here, I would just note that the most important modern advance is to ensure the decision-making takes place within a framework of well-defined objectives and clear accountability. This isindeed one of the strengths of the inflation targeting regimes that have been adopted in so manycountries during the past decade. They recognise the need for a decision-maker, so that interest ratescan be adjusted in response to unfolding events, but they also place the process within a framework ofclear objectives and accountability.BibliographyCopland, Douglas B.

BIS Review 77/20011Bank of Japan’s September report of recent economic and financialdevelopments1Bank of Japan, 20 September 2001*      *      *The Bank’s View2Adjustments in economic activity are becoming more severe, as the substantial decline in production,starting from a fall in exports, is beginning to have a negative influence on employment and incomeconditions.With regard to final demand, net exports (real exports minus real imports) continue to decline,reflecting not only a slowdown in overseas economies but also sluggish demand for IT-related goods.Business fixed investment is also decreasing noticeably while exporting conditions continue todeteriorate. Housing investment remains sluggish and public investment is declining. Meanwhile,private consumption remains flat on the whole, although there are some weak indicators.Industrial production continues to decline considerably, reflecting these developments in final demandand strong excessiveness in inventories of electronic parts and materials. Corporate profits andbusiness sentiment are also worsening, particularly in manufacturing. Affected by such developments,household income is weakening gradually.Turning to the outlook, public investment is expected to follow a declining trend. Net exports are likelyto continue decreasing for a while amid the deceleration in overseas economies and ongoinginventory adjustments in IT-related goods worldwide. Based on the developments in leading indicatorsand judged from the successive downward revisions of firms’ investment plans in the information andcommunications sector, business fixed investment is also expected to follow a downward trend.Private consumption is likely to become weak gradually while employment and income conditionscontinue to deteriorate. In addition to such developments in final demand, inventory adjustments ingoods such as electronic parts and materials will continue for the time being. Industrial production is,therefore, expected to follow a declining trend.As for IT-related goods, although the sluggish final demand of these goods worldwide has beenpreventing the progress in inventory adjustments, the view that the adjustments are likely to finish byaround next spring is prevailing. Therefore, the decline production in this sector is expected to ceasesome time in the future. However, uncertainty regarding the outlook for the recovery of overseaseconomies, particularly for the U.S., is growing further while the global economy continues todecelerate concurrently. At home, while the income-generating mechanism from corporate profits toemployment and wages is starting to work adversely, government spending is projected to follow adownward trend. Under these circumstances, it may take some time for overall production activity tostop declining.Overall, adjustments in economic activity, starting from the decline in exports, are expected to have anegative influence on domestic demand gradually and this in turn will possibly prolong the ongoingadjustments. Moreover, while the economy continues to be in a fragile state, attention should be paidto the growing risks of a negative impact on the economy induced by developments in foreign anddomestic capital markets via corporate and household confidence.With regard to prices, import prices are declining mainly reflecting the softening of internationalcommodity prices. Domestic wholesale prices are also declining somewhat faster because the effectsfrom the past high crude oil prices and the prior depreciation of the yen have abated, while prices ofelectrical machinery and materials continue to decrease. Consumer prices are weakening owingmainly to the decline in prices of imported products and their substitutes. Corporate service pricescontinue to decrease.                                                     1This report is based on data and information available at the time of the Bank of Japan Monetary Policy Meeting held onSeptember 18, 2001.2The Bank’s view of recent economic and financial developments, determined by the Policy Board at the Monetary PolicyMeeting held on September 18 as the basis for monetary policy decisions.
2BIS Review 77/2001As for the conditions surrounding price developments, with the ongoing adjustments in economicactivity, the balance between supply and demand in the domestic market is likely to exert downwardpressure on prices. Furthermore, in addition to the declining trend of machinery prices caused bytechnological innovations, the decreases in the prices of goods and services reflecting deregulationand the streamlining of distribution channels will continue to restrain price developments. Overall,prices are expected to follow a gradual declining trend for the time being. Moreover, given the highdegree of uncertainty regarding future economic developments, the possibility that weak demand willfurther intensify downward pressure on prices warrants careful monitoring.In the financial market, the overnight call rate declined further and is moving around zero percent asthe current-account balances at the Bank of Japan were increased to around 6 trillion yen due to thechanges in the guideline for money market operations decided at the Monetary Policy Meeting held onAugust 14.Interest rates on term instruments are declining further owing to the monetary easing by the Bank. TheJapan premium remains negligible.Yields on long-term government bonds are recently moving around 1.35 percent. The yield spreadsbetween private bonds (bank debentures and corporate bonds) and government bonds are mostlyunchanged.Stock prices are plunging reflecting the drop in U.S. stocks.In the foreign exchange market, the yen is currently being traded in the range of 116-119 yen to theU.S. dollar.With regard to corporate finance, private banks continue to be more active in extending loans, mainlyto blue-chip companies, while carefully evaluating the credit risks involved. However, the lendingattitudes of financial institutions perceived by small firms are becoming slightly more cautious.Meanwhile, the fund-raising conditions of firms in the markets for such instruments as corporate bondsand CP continue to be favorable owing to a decline in market interest rates and the more active stanceof investors to take credit risks.On the other hand, credit demand in the private sector is declining faster mainly due to a decrease inbusiness fixed investment while firms continue to reduce their debts.In view of this, the year-on-year rate of decline in private banks’ lending is expanding slightly. Thegrowth rate of amount outstanding of corporate bonds issued is about 2 percent on a year-on-yearbasis. Meanwhile, the amount outstanding of CP issued continues to be at a high level, significantlyexceeding that of the previous year due to the favorable environment for issuing CP.The growth rate of money stock (M2 + CDs) in August was slightly higher than that of the previousmonth due mainly to the inflow from postal savings.Funding costs for firms continue to be at extremely low levels.With respect to the recent financial environment, the effects of monetary easing are permeatingthrough the economy. This can be observed such as in the additional easing in the money marketconditions, further decline in short-term interest rates, higher growth in monetary indicators, and theimprovement in the fund-raising conditions of firms through the markets. However, against thebackground of deteriorating corporate earnings and the more cautious lending attitudes of financialinstitutions, fund-raising conditions of small firms seem to be becoming more severe. Hence, thedevelopments in the behavior of financial institutions and corporate financing need careful monitoring.In addition, it is necessary to carefully monitor the effects of the terrorist attacks in the U.S. on globalfinancial markets and economic activity.
BIS Review 76/20011Willem F Duisenberg: Testimony before the Committee on Economic andMonetary AffairsIntroductory statement by Dr Willem F Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, Brussels,12 September 2001.*      *      *Ladies and gentlemen,In the light of the unprecedented and tragic events that occurred in the United States yesterday, Ishould like to be as brief as possible today in my introductory statement. Firstly, I should like toexpress my deep sympathy with the citizens of the United States and, in particular the relatives andfriends of the victims of this brutal attack. Moreover, I should like to emphasise that the EuropeanCentral Bank and the national central banks are standing ready to support the normal functioning ofmarkets and relevant operational systems, if the need arises. Indeed, the ECB has been in closecontact with the other major central banks in the world since the events have unfolded.Let me now report to you on the recent monetary policy decision taken by the Governing Council ofthe ECB.1. Economic and monetary developmentsOver the last few months, the evidence available to the Governing Council has gradually pointedtowards an improvement in the outlook for price developments. This has been particularly apparentfrom the information stemming from what we call the second pillar of our monetary policy strategy,while the information coming from the first pillar of our strategy has remained consistent with afavourable outlook for price stability in the medium term. At this stage, I do not want to speculate aboutthe possible consequences of yesterday's developments in financial markets on economic andmonetary developments. We will have a first discussion on this issue tomorrow, at the meeting of theGoverning Council.As regards the first pillar, the three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 was 5.9% in theperiod from May to July 2001. This figure, however, has to be carefully analysed. First, the figureneeds to be corrected for holdings of money market paper and short-term debt securities by non-residents of the euro area. As already announced, the ECB intends to publish an M3 series which isadjusted for these non-resident holdings of negotiable instruments towards the end of the year. Atpresent, some preliminary estimates of the impact of these holdings on monetary aggregates areavailable. When these are taken into account, the three-month average of the annual growth of M3would turn out to be slightly above 5%, thus not very far from the reference value of 4½%.In addition, the increase in the annual growth of M3 in the recent past has to be interpreted withcaution, as several factors indicate that it might not necessarily imply risks to price stability. In fact, therelatively flat yield curve and the weakness in the stock markets appear to have made the holding ofshort-term deposits and marketable paper included in M3 more attractive, thereby temporarily affectingM3 growth. Furthermore, the recent increase in the money stock seems also to reflect the adjustmentin transaction balances in reaction to the past rise in energy and food prices. This, by itself, should beseen as a one-off level adjustment and should not indicate future upward pressures on inflation,provided that the rise in energy and food prices does not trigger second-round effects on inflation viawages. A further factor which suggests that the rise in M3 growth should be interpreted with caution isthat the annual rate of growth of loans to the private sector has continued to decline over recentmonths.Turning to the analysis from the second pillar of our monetary policy strategy, several developmentsclearly pointed to lower inflationary pressures coming from the demand side. Recent data on economicactivity indicate that real GDP growth in the euro area will most likely be lower than was expected afew months ago. This reflects the slowdown in economic activity in the United States and thepersistent economic weakness in Japan, which have both been more pronounced than was expecteda few months ago, and have also affected other areas of the world. On the domestic side, the paststrong increases in oil and food prices have counteracted the beneficial effects on households' real
2BIS Review 76/2001disposable income of the recent tax reductions in some Member States. All these factors have alsohad adverse effects on investment.Looking ahead, a gradual strengthening in growth of domestic demand can be expected as the pastincreases in inflation continue to unwind. Domestic demand should be further supported by thepositive impact on consumption of the recent tax reductions, and by the favourable financingconditions in the euro area.In the current environment, it is likely that the process of wage moderation which we have seen thusfar will continue in the period ahead. First, the slowdown in economic activity should contribute tocontaining inflationary pressure stemming from the labour market. In addition, the latest figures onproducer and consumer prices provide encouraging signs that the past increase in consumer priceinflation has been temporary and that, in the absence of further unfavourable shocks, HICP inflationwill return to levels of below 2% in the not too distant future. The expected falling trend in consumerprice inflation should contribute to containing the inflation expectations of economic agents andthereby have a positive influence on price and wage-setting behaviour. This view is confirmed by bondyields, which indicate that financial markets expect inflation developments to be in line with thedefinition of price stability in the medium term.Overall, in view of recent monetary, financial and economic developments, the Governing Council sawscope for a downward adjustment in key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points on 30 August 2001.The Governing Council considers the new level of key ECB interest rates to be appropriate for themaintenance of price stability over the medium term.Turning to fiscal policies, let me express my concern about the possible impact of the slowdown ineconomic activity on the willingness of the governments of some euro area countries to stick to theStability and Growth Pact and to their stability programmes. Any loosening of fiscal commitments, orinitiatives to "re-interpret" the Stability and Growth Pact itself, can only be counterproductive in thecurrent circumstances, since this could undermine the confidence in the determination of the euro areato stick to a stability-oriented fiscal policy. To avoid this, only countries whose budget positions areclose to balance or in surplus have scope to let the automatic stabilisers work fully in this phase oflower economic growth. By contrast, it would be advisable for those countries with remaining fiscalimbalances to limit the deviation from the nominal targets set out in their latest stability programmes.Looking ahead, it will be important that budgetary targets for 2002 be set in such a way that budgetarypositions close to balance or in surplus are either maintained or can be reached within the time frameset by the existing stability programmes. Indeed, a medium to long-term orientation is essential for theconduct of fiscal policies in all euro area countries. Short-term discretionary measures aimed atstrengthening domestic demand not only risk having an unwelcome impact on the economy, partly asa result of time lags, but may also affect the solidity of public finances and the consolidation process ina more lasting manner.Efforts to set the conditions for the further expansion of the production potential of the euro area mustremain a priority. While progress is being made in a number of areas, more ambitious market-orientedstructural reforms remain a challenge. Labour market reforms aimed at providing the right incentives toeconomic agents and the liberalisation of sectors still sheltered from competitive forces are areas inwhich progress is still needed. Fiscal reforms to diminish the adverse incentives provided by tax,benefit and pension systems need to be accompanied by ambitious expenditure restraint. It shouldalways be kept in mind that such reforms will be beneficial to employment growth in the euro area andwill help to improve the resilience of the euro area economy to potentially adverse shocks in the future.2. Preparations for the introduction of euro banknotes and coinsMadam Chairman, honourable Committee Members, as you are aware, in less than four months wewill enter the final stage of monetary integration, marked by the introduction of the euro banknotes andcoins. This will make the single currency a tangible reality for the people of Europe, and even more –the euro in its final visual appearance, as displayed in the star before you, is indeed a new symbol ofEuropean integration. Madam Chairman, honourable Committee Members, it is my pleasure to offerthis star to the European Parliament as a symbol of the achievements of European integration towardswhich we have all been working together and in the spirit of excellent co-operation that has alwayscharacterised the relations between our institutions.
BIS Review 75/20011Roger W Ferguson, Jr: The evolving financial and payment systemRemarks by Mr Roger W Ferguson, Jr, Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US FederalReserve System, at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, on 4 September 2001.*      *      *I am pleased to be with you this evening and I would like to thank Tony Santomero for inviting me toshare a few thoughts with you about my recent work on financial sector consolidation and paymentsystem issues. Changes in technology, business needs, and regulation are affecting both of theseareas in important ways, and in some cases with highly visible results.Deregulation of the US financial industry over the past ten years has helped to support dynamic andcreative financial markets. During the same time, accelerating changes in technology have creatednew financial products and services as well as whole new ways of conducting financial business.Outside the United States, similar forces have been at work, although the details depend on theparticular country or region. One of the largest recent changes has been the introduction of the euroand its effects on the structure of financial markets in Europe. The next step in this process will betaken next January when euro notes and coins will be put into circulation. In both the United Statesand overseas, there also have been a significant number of bank mergers, some of them very large,arising from these changing financial industry dynamics.G-10 study of financial sector consolidationAgainst this background of ongoing change in financial structure, the finance ministers and centralbank governors of the Group of Ten countries commissioned a major study of the possible effects offinancial consolidation. I was asked to oversee that study, whose key findings were published lastJanuary and covered thirteen developed countries, including the United States. The studydocumented the high levels of mergers and acquisitions among financial firms during the 1990s,including a noticeable acceleration during the last three years of the decade. Most of the consolidationwas within countries and within segments of the financial sector. Cross-border or cross-sectorconsolidations have so far been less frequent.The data we collected suggested a number of conclusions. For example, financial consolidation hasconcentrated payment and settlement flows among fewer parties. The risk implications of thisconsolidation deserve close monitoring. In addition, the study found that although consolidation hassome potential to improve the operating efficiency of the combined financial institutions and has doneso in some cases, the overall evidence in favor of efficiency gains is weak. The study also found thatthe effects of consolidation on competition and credit flows are very case specific and depend on thenature of the markets for specific products and services.While the study found that financial consolidation has not significantly affected either the conduct orthe effectiveness of monetary policy, we also concluded that central banks should remain alert to howfuture consolidation may affect the competitiveness of the markets that are most important tomonetary policy. Central banks should also monitor potential future changes in the transmissionmechanisms for monetary policy.Finally, the study concluded that existing policies appear adequate to address risks to the individualfirm and systemic risks now and over the intermediate term. Looking ahead, however, the studyidentified a number of areas that deserve careful attention by policymakers. For example, enhancedcontingency planning could reduce systemic risk should a large and complex financial institutionbecome seriously distressed. Because no institution is too big to fail, I believe that regulators shouldalso develop a clearer understanding of key factors such as the administration of bankruptcy laws andconventions across borders; the coordination of supervisory policies within and across borders; thetreatment of over-the-counter derivatives, foreign exchange, and other financial market activities indistress situations; the roles and responsibilities of managers and boards of directors; and theadministration of the lender-of-last resort function. Our study also helped clarify the need forinternational attention to contingency planning. In general, both crisis prevention and crisismanagement would improve with additional communication and cooperation among financialsupervisors domestically and among central banks, finance ministries, and other financial supervisorsinternationally.
2BIS Review 75/2001Evolution of the payment system and strategies for further changePayment systems, especially retail payment systems, have also been evolving over time, although notdramatically. Unlike the households of ten or twenty years ago, however, households now frequentlyreceive wages and salaries electronically and buy goods and services using credit or debit cards. Thepast few years have seen varied levels of development, both here and abroad, of new card-based andsoftware-based payment instruments and systems, such as electronic money and Internet paymentsystems. Yet cash and checks remain the mainstays of retail commerce in the United States; this is atestament to the broad convenience of these instruments, developed over a long period, and thepublic's confidence in them.But the payment system is continuing to evolve. At some point, it is likely that the use of checks willstart to decline, as it has in several other developed countries. One factor involved in this change isthe increasing use of debit cards as a substitute for some check payments, especially those made at amerchant's point of sale, or POS. In some countries, such as Canada and the United Kingdom, thissubstitution has progressed substantially, and consumers now use debit cards widely. In the UnitedStates, we have seen the use of debit cards grow strongly over the past few years, fueled by the useof signature-based cards developed by the credit card networks.Another recent development is the increasing adoption of programs to “convert” or “electronify” checksat the point of sale. These programs typically use a check, or information from a check, to generate anelectronic payment from the consumer to the merchant that is cleared through the automatedclearinghouse (ACH) or electronic funds transfer (EFT) networks. In a sense, these programs turn acheck into a disposable debit card. This analogy raises the question of what we can learn from the useof checks to initiate electronic payments and whether these programs are simply a transition stage to amore extensive electronic payment system. I believe these programs continue to deserve monitoringas we go forward.This evening I would also like to mention an old debate about the merits of check truncation, a debatethat goes back at least to the late 1960s and early 1970s, when many observers of the paymentsystem first began predicting the quick rise of a cashless and checkless society. In the past, thebanking industry and the Federal Reserve have studied suggestions for the widespread truncation ofchecks at the bank of first deposit or at an intermediary bank to reduce the costs of the check-collection system. The results of these studies have been sensitive to assumptions about technology,transition costs, implementation timing, discount rates, and other factors. In addition, assumptionsabout the storage and retrieval of truncated checks or their images can affect an analysis. Mostfundamentally, the degree to which banks and the public accept truncation and the associatedelectronic presentment of checks significantly affects the banking industry's ability to achieveeconomies of scale and standardization throughout a truncation and electronic collection system.Historically, sensitivity to these key assumptions has injected uncertainty into the business case forcheck truncation and electronic collection. As a result, the banking industry has faced difficultdecisions about whether to invest in the truncation of checks or to invest in fully electronic paymenttechnologies, such as the ACH or card networks, while encouraging their customers to initiateelectronic payments from the beginning of a payment process. To date, the industry has done some ofboth, with business strategies varying across banking organizations.With recent declines in technology costs and increasing consumer acceptance of check truncation,however, some banks have accelerated their efforts to truncate checks. The Federal Reserve Banksnow electronically present more than 20 percent of the checks they collect, of which one in four arealso truncated at the Fed. Several banks, including the Federal Reserve Banks, are also building dataarchives in which to store digital images of checks to replace microfilm technologies and to providemechanisms to process images of truncated checks. Some commercial banks also believe thatgreater automation of check data within their organizations, along with other customer information, cansignificantly speed and improve the overall quality of their customer service. These banks tend to seecheck truncation, electronic presentment, and check imaging as parts of a larger business strategylinked to automation, not simply as stand-alone, back-office operations. Other banks tend to analyzethese automation steps more narrowly as tools to reduce back-office costs, and they remainsomewhat skeptical about the business case for truncation and related activities.
BIS Review 75/20013Payments System Development CommitteeI would like to turn now to the Payments System Development Committee, which is working with theprivate sector to better understand the issues arising from the evolution of the retail payment system.The committee, which I co-chair with Cathy Minehan, President of the Boston Fed, was established bythe Federal Reserve Board in mid-1999 to (a) identify strategies for enhancing the long-term efficiencyof the retail payment system, (b) identify barriers to innovation and work to reduce or eliminate thosebarriers when doing so is in the public interest, (c) monitor market developments, and (d) conductworkshops and forums for focused discussions about the payment system with the private sector.One of the committee's key projects during the past year has involved working with the public andprivate sector on a long-run strategy for facilitating the market adoption of check truncation and greaterelectronic check processing when this makes economic sense. The basic idea is that if a bankbelieves that truncating some or all of the checks it receives makes business sense, it should be ableto do so without worrying about demands by other parties that the original check must be located andpresented. When such demands are made, a legally sanctioned paper copy of the original could beprovided in place of the original. A federal statute would provide the legal framework within which sucha paper copy - or substitute check - would be produced, along with safeguards against paying thesame check twice and other potential problems. The market theory of this approach is that byfacilitating the use of substitute paper checks when a paper check is preferred, larger investments intruncation and electronic presentment may become economical over the longer term. In short, throughthis approach, the demand of some for paper checks will carry less weight in the business decisions ofthe many. Moreover, those who want a paper check will be able to obtain it with a minimum ofinconvenience. With more electronic infrastructure, however, check collections potentially will be fasterand cheaper, and customer-banking platforms within commercial banks may become moretechnologically integrated. In the end, the goals are to reduce the social cost of the payment systemand to improve the technical foundation for providing financial services.The Payments System Development Committee also is working on various legal and regulatoryissues, standards, and the future of clearing and settlement. In the regulatory area, for example, thecommittee has encouraged the Board's staff to revise the commentary to Regulation E, whichimplements the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, to reduce residual barriers to electronic innovations.Revisions last March helped clarify the legal status of the various “check conversion” projects that Inoted earlier.In the standards area, we are closely following the work being done under the aegis of the AmericanNational Standards Institute (ANSI) on standards that would support the use of substitute checkswithin the context of both bilateral and multilateral industry efforts to pursue check truncation. Inaddition, this past June, the committee held a one-day workshop on the implications of XML(eXtensible Mark-up Language) for the payment system. This workshop, held at the Boston Fed,involved a variety of representatives from both the private and public sectors. The workshop's majorpurpose was to provide the committee with a number of different views on the significance of XML forthe payment system and the possibility of adopting a widely shared and flexible computer language forexchanging electronic payment messages and related information. Those discussions and otherinformation suggest that XML is becoming increasingly important in the financial markets and that itraises interesting possibilities for the future.In the clearing and settlement area, the committee is discussing how new technology and businessneeds will interact to affect the design and functions of clearing and settlement systems in the future.Some have observed that in the long run, new technologies, along with the needs of e-business, willlead to important changes in clearing and settlement systems. In addition, the use of new technologiesto conduct traditional payment system operations in more efficient and effective ways will also drivechange. Both banks and end-users of the payment system are now discussing many issues and ideas.The committee has asked a group of staff to conduct further discussions with interested organizationsand bring back to the committee a broader view of the current debate in this area.Finally, the committee is continuing to encourage survey research on the use of different paymentsystems. The Federal Reserve's Retail Payment Office is currently sponsoring several surveys toobtain more accurate data on both electronic and check payments being made in the United States. Itis particularly important that we have a better idea of how many checks are being written in order forthe banking industry and the public to understand better and plan for the evolution of the paymentsystem. The technical work of “cleaning the numbers” collected in the surveys is continuing, and wehope to publish data from the survey later in the year.
4BIS Review 75/2001ConclusionIn conclusion, I would like to emphasize that our financial system is continuing to evolve, as it must ina dynamic and competitive market economy. Financial consolidation at the national level has occurredrelatively quickly, although much less so at the level of individual banking markets. The recent G-10study did not find fundamental problems with developments to date. It did, however, outline somepractical steps the authorities can take to help better manage potential risk to the financial system andoutlined a number of areas that should be monitored and analyzed further over the longer term.Overall, the US payment system continues to evolve slowly, but there have been steady changes anda great deal of experimentation over the past few years. Although we are not likely to see paperpayment instruments disappear, electronic payment systems are being used more widely andcreatively than in the past. On-line banking and other services are giving bank customers new andconvenient mechanisms to initiate and receive electronic payments. However, simple ideas such aselectronic bill payment by consumers and businesses have turned out to be more of a challenge thanwe imagined a few years ago.In addition, as the market continues to experiment with new systems, the old themes of reliability,security, privacy, and confidence need to be repeated often. Speaking as a member of the PaymentsSystem Development Committee, I would also like to emphasize the willingness of the committeemembers and the Fed staff to discuss with private-sector organizations their new ideas, insights, andviews about the future of the payment system. I have found that our discussions so far have all beenvery productive in helping to broaden our thinking and to identify concrete steps that can be taken toimprove the payment system.Thank you for your attention.
BIS Review 75/20011Eva Srejber: Financial markets in a globalised worldSpeech by Ms Eva Srejber, Second Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at the SwedishMutual Fund Association, in Stockholm on 4 September 2001.*      *      *I should like to begin by thanking you for the opportunity to participate in your conference on mutualfund investments in Europe. Mutual fund investment is now a very important part of the financialsystem, both at a national level and at a global level. I therefore intend to take this chance to discussthe significance of the financial system for economic development, using mutual fund investment as abasis, and to take up some of the problems connected with the way the system functions.Rapid transformation of the financial systemOver the past few decades the financial system has been fundamentally transformed. Deregulationand technological achievements have made the Swedish financial sector part of a global networkwhere the sun never sets. Those of us who work in this sector cannot have a limited local, or evenregional, perspective. We have had to learn to live with the fact that events in countries such asIndonesia and Thailand can have a direct bearing on our operations. This is of course exciting,although it also makes our work more complicated. But that is the consequence of living in aglobalised world.Swedish savers have adapted to this development on a large scale. Whereas it was once natural toput money into a normal savings account, this is no longer the case. Today, an increasingly largeshare of savings is being invested in various securities and the rapid expansion in the mutual fundmarket is an important part of this development. One only needs to look at the Swedish Mutual FundAssociation's own report on mutual fund investment in Sweden to realise this. The statistics show thatnew mutual fund investment has increased gradually during the 1990s. In 1994 net investment inmutual funds totalled SEK 7.5 billion. Last year the corresponding figure was SEK 99.1 billion. This isan entirely natural development, as it has been possible to obtain a significantly higher yield fromsavings invested in various types of securities than from savings paid into a traditional savingsaccount. Swedish investors have not only realised this, they have also understood how to use thefinancial market to spread their risk by investing money both in fixed income funds and in shares indifferent types of companies within different sectors and countries.Many people, including me, see this development as a positive thing; others are critical and expressconcern over what they call an insensitive fund capital, shovelling money around the world and quicklywithdrawing from countries that show the slightest sign of problems. This criticism cannot becompletely dismissed, but I do feel that it often does not fully take account of the importance of thefinancial sector for economic development. In addition, the critics often speak of this sector as thoughit did not play any productive role, but was more or less disengaged from the rest of society. This is notthe case. The financial sector is very much an integrated part of society. We participate in it ourselveswhen we, for instance, choose between different pension funds, when we withdraw money from anATM, when we pay our bills or borrow money to buy a house or apartment. To begin with, therefore, Ishall briefly discuss the fundamental tasks carried out by the financial sector in society. When weeconomists try to mediate knowledge in this field, we usually talk about three tasks or roles, namelymediating payments, channelling money from those wanting to save to those wanting to invest, andfacilitating the management of economic risk.Easier payments and more investmentsThe financial sector as a mediator of payments is possibly the role where the sector's significance forsociety is easiest to understand. Try to imagine an economy without the type of payment systemoffered by, for instance, postal giro and bank giro. In a world like that we would need to carry largeamounts of cash around with us in order to make our daily transactions. We would have to rush off tothe landlord once a month to pay rent, visit the telephone company to settle the telephone bill andqueue in front of the TV building to pay our TV licence. Thanks to various payment systems, we canavoid this inconvenience. This not only has a value in making our everyday life easier; there is also a
2BIS Review 75/2001large economic value, as we are able to use our time for other things rather than queuing to pay bills.The Government Inquiry on the future of the financial sector presented last year estimated the value ofthis at more than 7 per cent of GDP, which corresponds to approximately SEK 150 billion. Thisindicates the importance of properly functioning, stable payment systems.Mutual fund investment plays an important part in the financial system's other role. This concernsconverting savings into investments. Without financial markets each investment would have to befinanced by the actual investor, whether it was a question of buying a house or starting up a company.The financial markets' economic contribution here is that they make it possible to distinguish betweenthe decision to save and to invest, so that the investor does not need to save all the necessary moneybefore making the investment. This enables the implementation of many projects that would nototherwise see the light of day. However, the financial sector does not merely make it possible todistinguish between these decisions; it also makes it possible to solve the conflict of interests thatoften prevails between the saver and the investor. A saver often wants to be able to get his moneyback quickly if the need arises. An investor, on the other hand, normally needs to have the money overa longer period of time, as it usually takes a while before an investment pays off. The financial sectoroffers two possible solutions to this conflict of interests. The investor can either turn to a bank, whichcan convert savings into long-term lending, or the investor can issue securities directly onto themarket. In both cases, the saver can normally regain his money at relatively short notice. In the firstcase, the money is withdrawn from the bank and this works painlessly, unless all the other savershave the same idea at the same time. In the second case, the securities are sold on a secondarymarket. Without these possibilities to quickly realise savings, there would be much less moneychannelled into investments, which are of crucial importance for economic development. A properlyfunctioning capital allocation is thus of major importance to a country's long-term growth, which is alsoconfirmed by several empirical studies made in this field. Mohsin Khan and Abdelhak Senhadji havemade a review of such studies for the IMF. I can recommend it for those who are interested.Facilitating risk managementThen we come to the third fundamental task of the financial sector; facilitating the management ofeconomic risks. As I mentioned earlier, Swedish savers have already realised the importance of notinvesting all their savings in the same place. When one distributes one's savings across a number offunds with different allocation, for instance to various industrial sectors, there is less risk, as one wouldnot suffer such great losses if one fund were to show a poor development. However, the financialmarkets also offer other opportunities for risk management. It is possible to pay someone else to takeover a financial risk. This can be done with the aid of various types of derivative. For example, inexport deals it is not unusual for payments to be made some time after the goods have beendelivered. To avoid negative effects of a change in the exchange rate, the exporter can enter into afutures contract that establishes the rate at which the future income will be exchanged to theexporter's own currency. These opportunities for risk management have crucial economic importance.Without them, many economic projects would be perceived as too risky and would never be realised.And this would lead to a slower development of the economy.Deregulation and the rapid developments in technology and finance have made it possible to transferthese roles to the international stage on a much larger scale than before. Thus, the financial markets'capacity to contribute to increased global growth has been strengthened. Countries importing capitalcan increase their rate of investment and gain access to more modern technology, while the countriesexporting capital can obtain a higher yield on it. Many people have claimed in this context thatcompanies in countries, which have recently deregulated their capital markets, have a tendency totake on more loans than they can manage. This does not appear to be the case. On the contrary,empirical research indicates that while non-financial companies with access to the international capitalmarket increase their borrowing, their equity increases at the same rate. It also appears that thesecompanies increase the duration of their loans. In this perspective, it is difficult to imagine that the riskof taking out excessively large loans increases as a result of deregulation. The various types of fundsmanaged by many of you make a contribution to this, by supplying share capital to companies in othercountries.
BIS Review 75/20013Economic policy content of crucial significanceAllow me to return to the criticism of developments on the financial markets. As I said, it cannot bedismissed out of hand. It is evident that there are some problems in the way these markets function.One only has to look at the Mexico crisis of 1995 and the Asia crisis of 1997-98 to see that. It is,however, important to remember that the origins of the crises lay in domestic problems in thosecountries that were hardest hit. In Asia, as was the case here in Sweden at the end of the 1980s, thecountries developed a financial vulnerability through rapid credit expansion, over-investment in certainsectors, grossly inflated asset prices and short-term borrowing abroad. This borrowing was in turnchannelled via domestic banks into projects with long-term funding. When foreign and domesticinvestors began to show concern over uncertainty regarding the growth potential of these countries,the course of events moved rapidly. This development shows how a misdirected economic policy cansoon have devastating consequences for a country. However, instead of focussing on the content ofthe economic policy, many critics have singled out the open capital markets as culprits. Some of thesecritics have therefore considered capital controls to be a good means of avoiding future crises. Yet theexperiences of the 1970s and 1980s show that these controls cannot counteract the effect of aninadequate domestic economic policy in the long term. Sooner or later it will be necessary to adapt theexchange rate. It is also very doubtful whether capital controls have contributed to increasingmonetary policy independence during these decades, which was one argument put forward in favourof the controls. In practice, it was probably the case that the arguments for keeping the controls wereoften used to postpone necessary macroeconomic adaptations and structural reforms.Nevertheless, while financial deregulation creates opportunities for increased welfare, it is importantnot to ignore the problems in the financial system. Over the years, authorities and organisations havetried to minimise these by producing various international standards and codes, and have continued todebate what more needs to be done to prevent as far as possible the emergence and spread of anynew financial crises. I shall not go into this work in any great depth here. Instead, I will discuss somefactors that could contribute to strengthening movements on the financial markets in an unhealthymanner, and where we need to find other solutions to improve the functioning of the markets. Thesefactors can also be more directly connected with mutual fund investment.Short-term evaluation and “follow the leader” behaviourThe first thing that comes to mind here is the way many of the operations on the financial markets areevaluated. All too often the focus is on the short-term result. This applies in particular to the evaluationof various securities funds. Although many of you manage long-term savings that people intend to liveon after retirement, you are nevertheless evaluated on the results you have achieved over the pastyear, the past few months or even the past few days. We have all seen the newspaper headlinesdeclaring the winners and losers in mutual fund investment. Media coverage of developments on thefinancial markets certainly plays an important role for the transparency of these markets, but the focuson short-term results can create a vicious circle where investors and companies are constantlychasing the best possible result in the short term, despite the fact that this is not a good long-termstrategy. Such behaviour can reinforce financial crises; for instance, through a fund manager not beinggiven scope to wait until the crisis has abated, which could be rational in a long-term perspective.Many players in the financial markets also appear to be governed by a “follow the leader” principle.There are probably some who avoid going their own way because of the risk of making badinvestments and being depicted as losers. It then seems simpler to follow the others, as if things do gowrong, at least the player is not the only one in disgrace. The reward structure in the fundmanagement field probably also reinforces this behaviour. As long as a person has not done a worsejob than the average among the competitors, he can look forward to a bonus. It would probably be abetter idea if the personal income were more closely connected to the absolute result achieved by thefund.However, the desire to follow others is probably also an expression of uncertainty. The players havetoo little information to really dare to act independently. It is doubtless the case that players in thefinancial markets, including the mutual fund investment companies, live in a complicated world. In thisworld it can be rational to do as the larger players do in the hope that they are better informed.However, this is not always the case, which means that the strategy of following the big players couldcontribute to worsening financial crises. When everyone rushes for the door at the same time, there isoften a crush. And in a crush, it is easy to panic.
4BIS Review 75/2001The broad use of statistical risk models can have a similar effect. It is, of course, a good thing to userisk models as an aid and we can conclude that they have enabled great progress in the managementof financial risks. However, there is an evident problem here. When an increasing number of playersare using the same models, they are also likely to react in a similar way when there is unease on themarkets, which can reinforce fluctuations and trigger new signals from the models, and so on. What isrational for one individual institute may in this case be irrational as a whole.Increased transparency reduces risk of herd behaviourSo is it possible to counteract this type of behaviour? Allow me to begin by emphasising that economicrisk-taking in itself is an important factor behind economic growth. However, risk-taking also meansthat not all investments will bear fruit. This is why we have created national bankruptcy regulationsenabling businesses to be liquidated in an orderly manner. For the same reason, we must assume thatfinancial crises will emerge even in the future. On the other hand, we must of course do all we can toavoid such crises spreading unnecessarily. I should also like to stress that I do not believe thatdifferent types of taxes aimed at reducing the turnover on the markets are a practicable route forward.They would probably result in further reinforcement of fluctuations, as activity - and thus liquidity - onthe markets would decline. As representative of a central bank, I would also like to point out that nordo I believe that monetary policy alone can counteract exaggerated movements on the financialmarkets. On the other hand, a clear monetary policy, aimed at price stability, is necessary in the workon maintaining financial stability. It facilitates economic decision-making in society.However, part of the solution must lie in breaking the pattern that causes players to behave in exactlythe same way as one another. Increased transparency with regard to countries' and companies'economic status is an important step in the right direction here. Developments in technology havedemolished many of the barriers that previously hampered the spread of this type of information.However, this requires that authorities and companies make use of the opportunity and actuallyrelease important information. We at the Riksbank, like many other Swedish authorities, have for quitesome time now made use of the advantages of the Internet in this context. All important information ispublished on our website, which is easily accessible to most people. This applies regardless ofwhether one is an analyst at a major bank or whether one is a private person. Information technologyhas thus created a powerful instrument, which can be used to counteract the 'follow the leader'behaviour. When information is no longer exclusive, it becomes easier to form an opinion of one's ownwith regard to developments and risks, and not merely to follow others in the belief that they knowsomething you don't. At the same time, it is important to remember that our insight into why financialcrises arise and spread is still limited. This means that increased transparency will not in itself be ableto solve all of the problems discussed. It must be combined with increased knowledge of these issues.Cautious use of risk modelsThe financial crises have exposed the failings in the various statistical risk models regularly used byplayers on the financial markets. These are nothing more than very simplified pictures of reality andare based on historical values. And history doesn't always constitute a good base for making forecastsfor the future. Financial players must therefore become better at taking into account less probableevents when they are analysing the risks of various investments. One example of how this could bedone is to supplement the risk models with “stress tests”. These tests are used to analyse how“stressed markets” - ie exceptional, but possible, outcomes or events - would affect the players'current positions. According to the latest quarterly report from BIS, use of stress tests is becomingmore widespread and many financial institutes now use them as an integrated part of their riskmanagement. Increasingly often, decisions on how to react when various risk limits are exceeded arebeing taken on the merits of the individual case, rather than being based on a mechanical rule.Greater transparency and less mechanical use of risk models could be contributing factors inimproving the functioning of the financial markets, but they will not solve the problem of short-termassessments of financial operations. Counteracting this requires clear information on the targets forthe financial operations. This is an important task for the authorities, the individual companies andvarious types of business association, such as the Swedish Mutual Fund Association. In connectionwith this, it is of course necessary to review the advice provided to clients. And, as I mentioned earlier,I also believe that a review of the reward structure in the mutual fund business would be useful, so thatincentives for fund managers are better adapted to the interests of the savers.
BIS Review 75/20015ConclusionThe rapid economic internationalisation has made daily life much more complicated for many of uswho work in the financial sector. Today, for instance, a person managing various securities funds inprinciple has the whole world on his or her desk. It is not enough to have good knowledge of aparticular type of company or sector, or of developments in an individual country. What is required is aconstant monitoring of the economic system, how its various parts are integrated and what possiblerisks there are that problems in one sector or country will spread to other sectors or countries.On a more comprehensive level, it can also be concluded that the internationalisation of recentdecades has given the financial markets greater opportunity to contribute to global economicdevelopment. Savings can now be channelled with relative ease into the sectors and countries wherethey will be of most use, while financial innovations facilitate risk management in economic life.Together, these advances have meant that more investments could get off the ground and improvethe welfare of millions of people in both rich and poor countries.At the same time, the strength of the recurring international financial crises has shown that thesemarkets do not always function entirely without problems. At times, there has also been considerablecriticism of the players on the international financial arena. Although this may sometimes bewarranted, unfortunately it all too often stems from the opinion that financial operations are a badthing. I have therefore tried to describe today the tasks carried out by the financial system in society.These not only make our daily life easier, but also provide a crucial contribution to economicdevelopment. It is therefore important that our solutions to the problems we see in the financial systemdo not destroy these welfare-creating mechanisms, but instead contribute to reinforcing them. For thesame reason, it is important that countries pursue a good domestic economic policy. Soundgovernment finances and sustainable price stability, combined with structural reforms that increase theflexibility of the economy, will reduce fluctuations in exchange rates and capital flows and thusincrease the financial markets' capacity to contribute to the development of the economy.Thank you.
BIS Review 74/20011Jarle Bergo: Inflation targeting in a small open economyAddress by Mr Jarle Bergo, Deputy Governor of Norges Bank, at the General Meeting of ACI Norge on31 August 2001.*      *      *The overview of the economic situation is based on the assessments from Norges Bank's monetarypolicy meeting on 8 August.IntroductionFirst of all allow me to thank you for the opportunity to provide this address on Norwegian monetarypolicy. Since Governor Gjedrem was here one year ago, the Central Bank of Norway has been givennew guidelines, and I therefore find it natural to start by providing an account of the new mandate formonetary policy. I will then talk about the implementation of monetary policy, with a closer look at therole of the krone exchange rate. I would also like to address the topic of the evaluation andtransparency of monetary policy, before concluding with a discussion of the basis for interest-ratesetting and the current economic situation.New mandateThis spring, the Government and the Storting (Norwegian parliament) adopted new guidelines foreconomic policy. The Government has announced that it will use the expected real return on theGovernment Petroleum Fund over the central government budget. The Government estimates that theguideline implies an average annual increase in the use of petroleum revenues over the centralgovernment budget of about 0.4 per cent of mainland GDP in the years between 2002 and 2010. Aclear parliamentary majority supports the Government long-term strategy for the use of petroleumrevenues.At the same time, the Government stresses, with the support of the Storting, that fiscal policy mustalso be used to stabilise economic developments. The annual budget resolutions will provide anindication of the emphasis placed on this consideration.
2BIS Review 74/2001The Government was also of the view that there was a need for a clearer anchoring of monetary policyto underpin economic stability. Norges Bank was thus given an operational monetary policy target,which means that the Bank is to use instruments to maintain low and stable inflation. The inflationtarget is set at 2½ per cent.The inflation target is linked to the annual rate of increase in consumer prices. The monetary policyregulation explicitly refers to factors that the Bank shall in general not take into account, such as thedirect effects on consumer prices resulting from changes in interest rates, taxes and excise duties.The regulation further stipulates that Norges Bank shall regularly publish the assessments that formthe basis for the implementation of monetary policy.Report no. 29 2001 "Guidelines for economic policy" also states:"Consumer price inflation is expected to remain within an interval of +/-1 percentage point around thetarget "This must not be misconstrued to mean that the inflation target is an interval. Norges Bank aims at aninflation rate of 2½ per cent two years ahead. Should any significant deviations between actualinflation and the monetary policy target occur, the Bank will provide an assessment of the reasons forthis.
BIS Review 74/20013Even though there was confidence in the implementation of monetary policy prior to the change inregulation, the communication of Norwegian monetary policy was clearly facilitated by the Governmentquantifying an inflation target. However, in our view the most important aspect of the shift to aninflation target is that political authorities clearly recognise that low inflation is a benefit in itself. Historyhas shown that high inflation does not lead to sustained higher economic growth or lowerunemployment. This recognition and the positive inflation track record in Norway since 1990 providethe Bank with a sound basis for conducting monetary policy.ImplementationIn the light of the orientation of monetary policy in recent years, the new guidelines have been appliedwithout any significant change in the conduct of monetary policy.The key rate is set on the basis of an overall assessment of the inflation outlook. Higher interest ratescurb demand for goods and services and reduce inflation. Lower interest rates have the oppositeeffect. If evidence suggests that inflation will be higher than 2½ per cent with unchanged interest rates,the interest rate will be increased. If it appears that inflation will be lower than 2½ per cent withunchanged interest rates, the interest rate will be reduced. There is symmetry here. It is equallyimportant to avoid an inflation rate that is too low, as it is to avoid an inflation rate that is too high.
4BIS Review 74/2001A change in interest rates is not expected to have an immediate effect on inflation. Our analysesindicate that a substantial share of the effects of a change in interest rates will occur within two years.1Two years is thus a reasonable time horizon for achieving the inflation target of 2½ per cent. Hence,the key rate is set with a view to achieving an inflation rate of 2½ per cent two years ahead.In some situations, where unexpected events lead to an inflation rate that is too high, it may beappropriate to apply a longer time horizon than two years. For example, reducing inflation to 2½ percent within this time horizon may be associated with unnecessary real economic costs. A preconditionfor applying a longer time horizon is that there is clear evidence of strong confidence in low and stableinflation over time on the part of economic agents. Gradually, as we gain experience with settinginterest rates according to an inflation target, the possibilities for placing emphasis on stability in thereal economy will probably increase.Low and stable inflation is a necessary precondition for stability in the foreign exchange and financialmarket and the property market. However, there have also been episodes where bubbles haveaccumulated in these markets, in the form of sharp increases in asset prices, while inflation has beenlow. The situation in Japan in the 1980s is an example. Price increases in property and financialmarkets may have a considerable impact on wage growth and consumer price inflation after a period.When the bubbles burst, the result may be an economic downturn. In this way, developments infinancial and property markets may be a source of a more unstable inflation environment. In principle,it would be appropriate to use the interest rate to counter this. In practice, however, it is difficult toassess whether price trends in property and financial markets are sustainable.When Norges Bank concludes that the key rate should be changed, the change will in most cases bemade gradually. This is because there is normally uncertainty about the situation in the economy,potential disturbances to the economy and how fast an interest rate change will affect price inflation.2But we will not always take a gradualist approach. A rapid and pronounced change in the interest rateis appropriate if monetary policy credibility is threatened. If special circumstances prompt Norges Bankto apply a different time horizon than two years, the Bank will provide an assessment of this. We willalso do so if developments in financial markets or the property market warrant particular attention.The role of the krone exchange rateWith the new operational target of monetary policy, Norges Bank will aim to maintain low and stableinflation. We no longer have a specific exchange rate target for the Norwegian krone. Nevertheless,developments in the krone exchange rate are still very important when Norges Bank sets the interestrate. This is due to a number of factors:• Changes in the krone exchange rate affect prices measured in NOK for imported consumergoods and services. Bearing in mind that imported goods are used in Norwegian production,the rise in prices for imported goods and services combined determines nearly 40 per cent ofconsumer price inflation.• Developments in the krone exchange rate have an influence on the earnings of companiesthat compete with foreign enterprises and that traditionally also negotiate first in the incomesettlements.• Changes in the exchange rate affect the competitiveness of Norwegian business andindustry as well as demand at home and abroad. Thus, the activity level in the economy isaffected.• As the Norwegian and international money and capital markets become more integrated,changes in the exchange rate will be increasingly important. Changes in the exchange rategenerate wealth gains and losses for Norwegian households and companies.                                                     1See box in Inflation Report 4/2000. ”Effects of a change in interest rates”, December 20002See for example Jan F. Qvigstad. ”Monetary policy in real time”, Working Paper 2001/1, April 2001.
BIS Review 74/20015The value of the Norwegian krone will vary, as exchange rates do in most countries. There are manyreasons for fluctuations in the exchange rate.3 Changes in the exchange rate are often due todisturbances to the economy. One example is a change in the terms of trade, which measure pricesfor exported goods and services in relation to prices for imported goods and services. Commoditiesaccount for a substantial share of Norwegian exports. Prices fluctuate widely. As a result, Norway isexposed to fairly large variations in its terms of trade. A decline in commodity prices results in lessfavourable terms of trade. This reduces our source of revenues and experience shows that theexchange rate will weaken. On the other hand, an increase in commodity prices improves terms oftrade and often results in a strengthening of the exchange rate.It is desirable for the krone exchange rate to fluctuate in pace with developments in the terms of tradeor demand for Norwegian products. If prices for our export products decline, a weakening of theexchange rate will dampen the income loss for internationally exposed industries. The exchange ratecan therefore be seen as an automatic stabiliser, or buffer, that shelters the economy to some extentfrom changes in the terms of trade.Oil and gas are the commodities that account for the largest share of Norwegian exports. A substantialportion of the revenues from the sale of oil and gas is invested in foreign equities and bonds throughthe Government Petroleum Fund. As a result, short-term fluctuations in the oil price have less impacton the domestic use of petroleum revenues. In the last 20 years, fluctuations in the terms of trade                                                     3See for example Tom Bernhardsen and Øistein Røisland. ”Factors that influence the krone exchange rate”, EconomicBulletin no. 3/2000, November 2000.
6BIS Review 74/2001have been three to four times greater for the Norwegian economy including the petroleum sector thanfor the mainland economy. The Petroleum Fund thus relieves pressure on the krone exchange rate.Changes in the krone exchange rate may also be due to interest rate changes. Higher interest ratesnormally make it more attractive to buy NOK-denominated assets and reduce NOK-denominated debt,leading to an appreciation of the krone. In contrast, a decrease in interest rates will normally result inlower demand for the krone and a weaker exchange rate. Experience shows that the interest rate onlyhas this predictable effect on the krone exchange rate when it contributes to stabilising inflation.The exchange rate constitutes an important channel through which monetary policy operates.Changes in the exchange rate are both desirable and intended when they contribute to stabilisinginflation. However, fluctuations in the exchange rate can also be a source of economic disturbances.Sentiments in the foreign exchange market may induce market participants to be excessively positiveto a currency for a time while at other times they are overly negative. This may lead to unnecessaryand wide swings in the exchange rate, which may spill over into other parts of the economy. Low andstable inflation will also strengthen expectations of stability in the krone exchange rate over time.However, we must be prepared for fluctuations in the krone.Norges Bank's reaction to a change in the exchange rate will depend on its assessment of the effecton inflation. The reasons for the change must be assessed, as well as how long the change isexpected to persist. Evidence suggests that short-term fluctuations in the krone exchange rate havelittle impact on inflation. When the changes are potentially more permanent and thus may be assumedto have a greater impact on inflation, the Bank will set the interest rate with a view to stabilisinginflation. However, it is difficult to establish whether exchange rate fluctuations are permanent ortemporary. As a rule, Norges Bank will thus be cautious about responding with interest rate changes tomovements in the exchange rate. A special situation arises if strong turbulence in the foreignexchange market indicates that confidence in monetary policy is in jeopardy. It may then beappropriate with a marked change in the key rate.In addition to the interest rate, exchange market interventions are a possible monetary policyinstrument. However, our experience has been that heavy and sustained interventions have littleinfluence on the exchange rate, and hence inflation. Exchange interventions, whether they involveselling or buying currency, are not an appropriate means of influencing the exchange rate over time.If Norges Bank intervenes heavily in the market, a game situation may arise where market participantsperceive central bank interventions as an interesting opportunity to make a profit. Market participantsknow that interventions cannot be sustained. This tempts operators to take positions against thecentral bank, thereby intensifying the pressure on the krone. Under the European currency crisis in1997-1998, and probably during the currency turbulence in 1997-1998 as well, these mechanismsappeared to be at work. Norges Bank does not intend to act in a way that prompts such gamesituations.
BIS Review 74/20017Other countries that conduct monetary policy using an inflation target also use the interest rate as themain instrument, and interventions are used only by way of exception. Over the last year, however, theECB and Sveriges Riksbank have intervened in the foreign exchange market. The ECB intervened forthe first time in September last year. The interventions were undertaken in concert with several centralbanks, including the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan. The ECB intervened again on threeoccasions in the beginning of November, but this time unilaterally. The ECB subsequently maintainedthat the interventions had been successful. At a US Congressional hearing, Peter Fisher of theFederal Reserve qualified the interventions as successful because they had contributed to improvingmarket psychology and reducing the implied volatility in the options market.Sveriges Riksbank intervened in the foreign exchange market in June with the aim of strengtheningthe Swedish krona. The Riksbank found that the Swedish krona was weaker than implied byfundamentals. This was followed by an increase in interest rates. The Bank of England has seldomintervened in the exchange market after the UK left the ERM in 1992. The currency crisis in 1992appears to have reduced their faith in interventions as an instrument. However, the Bank of Englandhas made it clear that interventions remain an instrument at their disposal. Canada has had a floatingexchange rate for 30 years, and has used intervention operations actively in the 1970s, 1980s and1990s. However, in 1997 the Canadian central bank was not able to prevent the depreciation of theCanadian dollar, and since then has not intervened. Australia still uses interventions, and the ReserveBank of Australia maintains that they have benefited substantially from their intervention operationsduring the period with a floating exchange rate. New Zealand has not intervened after introducing aninflation target in 1990. An evaluation report on monetary policy in New Zealand, written by ProfessorLars E. O. Svensson, supports the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's assessment that interventionswould hardly have made a significant contribution to increasing stability in New Zealand's economy inrecent years.4Internationally, a number of empirical studies have been conducted on the effectiveness of exchangemarket interventions. The studies of interventions in the 1990s find that they were more effective thanstudies conducted in the 1980s.5 This may be due to shifts in monetary policy regimes and greateremphasis on transparency. It is probably easier to win credibility when market participants know thatinterventions are anchored in stabilisation policy considerations rather than a short-term exchange rateobjective. However, this presupposes market confidence in the ability of economic policy in generaland monetary policy in particular to deliver nominal stability. It is first and foremost the signal effects ofinterventions that have been found to be effective and particularly when interventions are madepublicly known and justified by the central bank.                                                     4Lars E.

8BIS Review 74/2001For Norges Bank, it may be appropriate in special situations to intervene to a limited extent to stabiliseinflation, should the krone move to a level that we do not consider reasonable on the basis offundamentals, and if this could contribute to stabilising inflation. However, Norges Bank will not act in away that prompts unilateral bets against the krone. As a main rule, the Bank is likely to considerintervening only when we see a clear profit opportunity for the central bank. This may also beappropriate in the event of extensive short-term fluctuations in thin markets. In such situations, the riskof a loss-making game against foreign exchange operators will be limited.Any interventions and the background for them will be clearly communicated to market participants.Evaluation and predictabilityToday's inflation rate is partly the result of the interest rate that was set one to two years ago. Currentinflation figures do not provide an adequate basis for determining the level at which interest ratesshould be set today. Monthly figures for the consumer price index are also influenced by random andtemporary factors that have little impact on inflation over time. Precipitation levels influence electricityprices. Changes in indirect taxes have an immediate impact on the consumer price index. The directeffects of such factors on inflation will be exhausted after a year. Hence, they will not have any
BIS Review 74/20019significance for the interest rate, which is normally set with a view to maintaining inflation at 2½ percent two years ahead. However, automatically adjusting inflation figures for the direct effects of one-offfactors may be associated with pitfalls. Increases in indirect taxes and energy prices may be sourcesof rising inflation as a result of spillover effects on other prices and wages.However, it is still interesting to adjust monthly inflation figures for temporary effects to determinewhether developments are broadly in line with our projections. Norges Bank analyses and presentsfigures for consumer price inflation where the effects of some temporary factors are excluded. Thechart shows developments since 1995 in the CPI, the CPI excluding the direct effects of changes inexcise duties (CPIX) and the CPI excluding the direct effects of changes in excise duties and energyprices (CPIXE). As the chart shows, the CPIXE will normally be more stable than the CPI and theCPIX. This is because energy prices have historically been among the most volatile components of theCPI. Since energy prices have a substantial weight in the CPI, wide fluctuations in these prices willhave an impact on the total CPI. However, measured since 1996, CPIXE inflation is not systematicallylower or higher than CPI inflation. Substantial changes in inflation as a result of extraordinary swings inprices for certain products or changes in direct and indirect taxes may occur on occasion. The effectsof such random and temporary factors on developments in consumer prices are analysed in theInflation Report.Norges Bank's forecasts two-three years ahead may be perceived as projections for consumer priceinflation excluding the direct effects of changes in interest rates, direct and indirect taxes andextraordinary temporary disturbances. However, there are seldom any reasons for substantialdeviations between estimates for the total CPI and the other CPI measures in this context. As a rule,these estimates coincide.Norges Bank places considerable emphasis on the transparency and communication of monetarypolicy. Norges Bank’s analyses and the background for the Bank’s interest rate decisions arepublished regularly. The inflation outlook is presented three times a year in Norges Bank’s InflationReport. Further assessments are presented every six weeks in connection with the Executive Board'smonetary policy meetings. The Bank also reports on the implementation of monetary policy in itsannual report. If there are significant deviations between actual price inflation and the target, the Bankwill provide a thorough assessment in its annual report. Particular emphasis will be placed on anydeviations outside the interval +/- 1 percentage point.Transparency about the intentions, strategies and implementation of monetary policy make it easier foreconomic agents to evaluate monetary policy. If monetary policy is predictable, an important source ofuncertainty is reduced and the interest rate that is necessary to achieve the inflation target - all otherthing being equal - is lower. A predictable monetary policy can thereby contribute to enhancing theefficiency and impact of monetary policy. Even though there is not necessarily a one-to-onerelationship between transparency and predictability, some degree of transparency is probably aprecondition for achieving monetary policy credibility.
10BIS Review 74/2001In Norway at least it appears that transparency in Norges Bank's interpretation of the mandate and inthe implementation of monetary policy has contributed to a somewhat more predictable monetarypolicy. The chart shows that Norges Bank’s changes in the key rate have less impact on moneymarket rates now than earlier.In recent years, there has been an international trend towards increased focus on the need formonetary policy transparency. Under the auspices of the IMF and others the "Code of Good Practiceson Transparency in Monetary and Financial Policies" was drawn up, which emphasises theimportance of clarity, transparency and evaluation in monetary policy.This view of transparency and predictability contrasts sharply with the earlier practice of playing on theelement of surprise. In monetary policy, this was associated especially with control of the exchangerate. In many countries, this approach was met with deteriorating credibility and high premiums foruncertainty. The effects of changes in monetary policy instruments became increasingly uncertain.Nevertheless, the consideration of predictability must not overshadow Norges Bank's obligation to setthe interest rate at the level deemed appropriate by the Bank. The expectations of other economicagents must not control the setting of interest rates. There are a number of examples from countrieswith "transparent" monetary policies where interest rate changes have come as a surprise. This may
BIS Review 74/200111be partly due to the fact that the central bank had a different view of the outlook for economicdevelopments.Norges Bank has sought to promote transparency, for example by publishing our interpretation of themandate for monetary policy and our assessment of the implementation of monetary policy. Inaddition, we have been open about our response pattern, our analyses of economic developmentsand our assessment of monetary policy performance. Others are bound to judge the Bank in a criticallight, not least this assembly. I hope and believe that you will find that our words and actions arecompatible, and that in retrospect it will not be difficult to see the rationality in what we do, although itmay on occasion seem surprising then and there. If we manage this, confidence in monetary policyshould take firm hold and strengthen ahead.The basis for interest-rate setting and the present economic situationBy way of conclusion, I would like to address the basis for interest-rate setting and the presenteconomic environment. The projections and analyses in the Inflation Report, in conjunction with ourcontinuous assessment of the inflation outlook and developments in the money and foreign exchangemarket, form the basis for our decisions concerning interest rates. In the last Inflation Report publishedon June 20, price inflation was projected at 2½ per cent in 2003 on the assumption that interest ratesremain unchanged. Norges Bank's assessment of the economic outlook was last presented in
12BIS Review 74/2001connection with the Executive Board's monetary policy meeting on 8 August. Both the analysis in theInflation Report and developments since its publication indicated that at today's interest rate level, it islikely that the inflation target will be reached in the course of two years.However, the balance of risks is complex. The Norwegian economy still features high capacityutilisation. The rate of increase in consumer prices was slower than expected in July, at a year-on-yearrate of 2.7 per cent. Measured from June, the total index fell by 1.4 per cent. The decline, however,primarily reflects the decrease in excise duties, notably the reduction in VAT on food and petrol taxes.Excluding changes in excise duties and energy prices, the rate of increase in prices, as calculated byNorges Bank, was about 2.6 per cent. At the same time, there is a shortage of labour and labour costsare rising at a fairly rapid pace. The rise in service prices where wages are a dominant factor movedup from 6.3 per cent in June to 6.9 per cent in July. Credit growth is also high and growth in householdloan demand is still on the rise. Against this background, there is a risk that domestic pressures maytranslate into stronger inflationary impulses than we have projected.On the other hand, growth in the world economy has slowed markedly, with the risk of even slowergrowth and a longer recession. Around the beginning of the year, most forecasters expected that theslowdown in the US economy would be relatively short and that the effects on the rest of the worldwould be limited. This picture has now changed. In the US, the slowdown in growth has been morepronounced than expected by most observers when the first signs of a turnaround emerged lastautumn. Industrial output has declined over the last 10 months and business investment has shrunk byalmost 14 per cent, annualised, in the second quarter. Moreover, the impact on Europe and theemerging economies in Asia has been substantially greater than expected. The shift in perceptions ofthe outlook is reflected in the estimates from Consensus Forecasts.Since the beginning of the year, growth forecasts have been revised downwards by 2 percentagepoints in Japan, 1½ percentage points in Germany and 1 percentage point in the US. Not since 1974has GDP growth been below 2½ per cent in all three countries. Growth among our trading partnershas been revised downwards by 1 percentage point to a little less than 2 per cent, which is the lowestrate recorded since 1993.Growth forecasts for 2002 have also been adjusted downwards somewhat, but growth is still expectedto pick up next year. However, there is substantial uncertainty associated with these forecasts.
BIS Review 74/200113The forecasts are to a large extent based on the assumption that household consumption will continueto fuel growth in domestic demand, as has been the case in the US and Europe so far this year. Thisis expected because of the solid financial situation of the household sector in most industrial countriesafter many years of rising employment and real wage growth. Another important factor is thatproductivity growth in the US is expected to secure sound profit trends over the longer term, with thedecline in corporate investment turning up slightly next year.Although business and industry have been sheltered so far from the slowdown in the world economy,the Norwegian economy may gradually be more strongly affected.Slow growth in the world economy may lead to lower demand for Norwegian produced goods and curbthe pressures in the Norwegian economy. In addition, slower growth in the world economy may pushdown imported price inflation, which may imply that price inflation will be lower than we have projected.Our forecasts provide an indication of the scenario we consider to be the most likely, given that keyvariables such as interest rates, the exchange rate, public demand, wage formation and oil prices arein line with our assumptions. If these variables deviate from our assumptions, the real economy andnominal developments may also show a different path.
14BIS Review 74/2001The Norwegian economy is balancing on a tightrope. It will not take much to throw the economy offbalance. While the overall global situation suggests that consumer price inflation may be somewhatlower than anticipated in the period ahead, the domestic economic situation points in the oppositedirection. Growth in domestic labour costs may turn out to be higher than estimated.According to an overall assessment of the inflation outlook, our conclusion at the Executive BoardMeeting on 8 August was that with an unchanged interest rate ahead the probability that inflation twoyears ahead will be higher than 2½ per cent is the same as the probability that it will be lower.Thank you for you attention.
BIS Review 73/20011Alan Greenspan: Capital gains trends in the United StatesOpening remarks by Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem, at a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Jackson Hole,Wyoming on 31 August 2001.*      *      *The rapid technological innovation that spurred the advancement of the “information economy” hasresulted in some dramatic capital gains and losses in equity markets in recent years. Theseremarkable developments have attracted considerable attention from economists and frommacroeconomic policymakers. At the same time, movements in the prices of some other assets in theeconomy - changes in house prices, for example - have been steadier, less dramatic, but perhaps noless significant.There can be little doubt that sizable swings in the market values of business and household assetshave created important challenges for policymakers. After having been relatively stable for a numberof decades, the aggregate ratio of household net worth to income rose steeply over the second half ofthe 1990s and reached an unprecedented level by early last year. That ratio has subsequentlyretraced some of its earlier gains.But we must ask whether the aggregate ratio of net worth to income is a sufficient statistic forsummarizing the effect of capital gains on economic behavior or, alternatively, whether the distributionof capital gains across assets and the manner in which those gains are realized also are significantdeterminants of spending. To answer these questions, we need far more information than we currentlypossess about the nature and the sources of capital gains and the interaction of these gains withcredit markets and consumer behavior.Analysts have long factored changing asset values into models that seek to explain consumption andinvestment. Indeed, in recent years, household wealth variables have become increasingly importantquantitatively in endeavors to track consumer spending. The importance of household balance sheetvariables for explaining consumption and the possibility that not all these variables influence spendingidentically suggest the need for greater disaggregation than is typically employed in most models.Observing that, over the past half century, consumer spending has amounted to about 90 percent ofincome, it might appear that income is largely sufficient to explain consumption. However, econometricevidence suggests that such numbers may be deceptive. Wealth by itself now appears to explainabout one-fifth of the total level of consumer outlays, according to the Board’s large-scale econometricmodel, leaving disposable income and other factors to explain only four-fifths of consumption. Indeed,if capital gains have any effect on consumption, the propensity of households to spend out of incomemust be less, possibly much less, than 90 percent.If income and wealth moved tightly together over time, the distinction between them might not bemeaningful for predicting the future path of consumption. And, over very long periods of time, capitalgains on physical assets are not independent of the trends in disposable income. But the relationshipof wealth to income is demonstrably not stable over time spans relevant for the conduct of policy. As aconsequence, a statistical system that augments income as a determinant of consumer spending withinformation about wealth can significantly assist our understanding of this key economic relationship.Conventional regression analysis suggests that a permanent one-dollar increase in the level ofhousehold wealth raises the annual level of personal consumption expenditures approximately 3 to5 cents after due consideration of lags. Arguably, it would not be important to draw distinctions amongvarious types of wealth if all assets were engendering similar rates of capital gains. Owing tocollinearity in such instances, all wealth proxies would produce similar estimates of overall wealtheffects on consumer spending.At times, however, the rates of change in key asset prices have diverged. For example, over the pastyear and a half, home values have appreciated, whereas equity values have contracted significantly.In such circumstances, differences in the propensities to consume out of the capital gains and losseson different types of assets could have significant implications for aggregate demand.Assuming that the underlying propensities are, in fact, stable and given enough time-series data withsufficient variation, standard regression procedures should be able to extract reasonably robust
2BIS Review 73/2001estimates of any differential in spending propensities - for example, out of stock market wealth andhome wealth. But, in practice, these circumstances do not prevail. As a consequence, we at theFederal Reserve Board are in the process of developing balance-sheet disaggregations that shouldhelp us infer the propensities to spend out of capital gains across different classes of assets.In carrying out this analysis, we have been especially mindful of the possibility that the amount bywhich a capital gain affects spending may well be a function of whether or not the gain has beenrealized. On the buyer’s side, when an asset is transferred, the acquisition cost is its new book valueand, by definition, its market value. On the seller’s side, the proceeds from the sale are available forasset accumulation, debt repayment, and consumption. In this way, a capital gain is realized andmade liquid, with the potential to affect spending, assets, or debt. The capital gain in the processdisappears as an element in the householder’s balance sheet.Unrealized gains, to be sure, can be borrowed against, and the proceeds of the loan can be spent orused for repayment of other debt. Alternatively, the unrealized gain could induce households tofinance additional outlays by selling other assets or by reducing their saving out of current income. Butunless, or until, this gain is realized or is extinguished by a fall in market price, it will remain on theasset side of the householder’s balance sheet, exposed to price change and uncertainty.Equity extraction through realized gains creates liquid funds with certain value. Indeed, a significantproportion of sellers do not purchase another home. In contrast, extraction of unrealized gains doesnot reduce the householders’ uncertainty about their net worth or their exposure to market pricechanges. This suggests that the propensity to spend out of realized gains is likely to be greater thanthe propensity to spend out of unrealized gains.Although our asset-class analysis of detailed disaggregated data is still at an early stage, preliminaryexamination finds that the data are consistent with the hypothesis of differential spending propensitiesby asset type and by whether or not capital gains have been realized. For example, purchasers ofexisting homes, on average, appear to take out mortgages about twice the size of the unamortizedmortgage that the typical seller cancels on sale. After accounting for closing expenses, the remainingunencumbered cash is available for debt repayment, acquisition of financial and nonfinancial assets,and spending.We have no direct evidence, of which I am aware, on the way that such funds are used. However, wecan make use of several surveys that have explored how cash-outs associated with mortgagerefinancing and home equity loans are expended. Typically, these surveys indicate that householdsallocate so-called cash-outs - that is, the amount by which a refinanced mortgage exceeds thepre-refinanced outstanding debt - to repayment of nonmortgage debt, acquisition of financial assets,outlays for home improvement, and personal consumption expenditures in roughly equal proportions.Our interest, of course, is primarily on spending; extracting home equity to repay debt or to purchasefinancial assets merely reshuffles balance sheets and, at least immediately, does little to affecteconomic activity. If these survey results are taken at face value and are applied to the case in whichthe home changes hands - as distinct from, say, a refinancing - the amount of personal consumptionexpenditures generated from realized capital gains on the sale of homes, financed through themortgage market, represents approximately 10 to 15 cents on the dollar.1Of course, in addition to realized capital gains from the turnover of existing homes, there is aconsiderable amount of cash that is extracted from home equity without a home sale, principally fromrefinancing cash-outs and from home equity loans. Both types of equity extraction have risenconsiderably in recent years, in line with the marked rise in unrealized capital gains on homes. Somepreliminary calculations suggest that the total of equity extractions from unrealized capital gains onhomes that is spent on consumer goods and services per dollar of capital gains is a fraction of the                                                     1The realized capital gain on a home sale in recent years has engendered a net increase in the mortgage debt (that is, netequity extraction) on that home averaging nine-tenths of the capital gain. Of the net equity extraction, almost half has beenexpended on closing and related expenses. The remainder, we assume, is distributed as indicated by the consumersurveys.
BIS Review 73/20013spending engendered by the gains realized through the sale of a home.2,3 This difference occurs, to alarge extent, because the net extraction of equity is much higher among homes that have turned overthan among those that have not.While data on home mortgage debt and house turnover can be used to analyze the particularchannels through which capital gains on homes spur consumer outlays, the financing linkagesbetween stock market capital gains and consumer spending are less clear. Homeowners typically ownone home, which they hold, on average, for nearly a decade. Financing is almost exclusively throughthe mortgage market, and equity extractions for spending, accordingly, are readily identified. Stocks, incontrast, tend to be held in portfolios that have far greater rates of turnover than homes, and financingsources are much more diverse and changeable. Moreover, although gains in defined contributionplans, IRAs, and other tax-deferred accounts almost surely affect consumer spending, the complicatedtax treatment and restrictions on the use of those funds make the connections between capital gainsin these accounts and spending quite indirect.Nonetheless, even setting aside all pension-type assets, household capital gains on directly heldequities and mutual funds in recent years have been two to four times the size of overall gains onhomes. The sheer size of such gains suggests that capital gains on equities have been a more potentfactor in determining spending than gains on homes. In fact, if we accept a total net wealth effect onconsumption of 3 to 5 cents on the dollar, and if further analysis supports the larger net spendingpropensities from capital gains on homes suggested by mortgage and survey data, then thepropensity to spend out of each dollar of stock market gains would be less than the propensity tospend out of a dollar from gains on homes, but still larger in overall dollar magnitude.Of course, these quantitative magnitudes are tentative, and a great deal of additional work will benecessary to better understand and to confirm the nature and magnitudes of the relationships betweencapital gains on houses and stocks - realized and unrealized - and consumer spending.* * *No matter how one differentiates the effects on consumer spending of capital gains on stock marketand housing wealth, it is clear that the massive increase in capital values over the past five years hada profound impact on output and income. The influence of capital gains on economic behavior also islikely to be of substantial consequence for the prospective performance of the economy.That influence also can be seen in our national income and product accounts (NIPA). By design, theseaccounts measure the market value of the output of goods and services and its distribution to thefactors of production. As such, they exclude capital gains and losses. This exclusion is especiallyrelevant for personal saving, where our accounting conventions result in capital gains having a largeeffect on the published figures. In part, the reason is that the NIPA deduct taxes paid on realizedcapital gains from personal income and treat them, in effect, as a transfer to the government sector,even though the capital gains that generated those taxes are excluded from income.4 This issue is nottrivial. As best we can determine, of the 4.6 percentage point decline in the personal saving ratebetween 1995 and 2000, a full percentage point is attributable to the increase in federal and statecapital gains taxes paid over that period.                                                     2However, the consumption financed through mortgage debt extension somewhat overestimates the net influence of housingcapital gains on consumption. Debt must be repaid, and presumably, consumption is reduced as a consequence of therepayment. In the absence of capital gains, borrowing merely moves up a purchase rather than augmenting total purchasesthrough time.However, in the presence of increased capital gains, unrealized but still perceived as permanent, debt capacity and levelsare likely to rise. The consequently lowered debt repayment relative to debt extensions suggests that the rate of offset to theinitial consumption expenditures at the time of repayment is also likely to be a good deal less. Our preliminary estimates, infact, suggest that such subtractions from the gross effects on spending are modest.3The time sequence of the emergence of capital gains and their effect on consumer spending is a function of the channelthrough which equity is extracted from homes. For sales of existing homes, equity extraction is generally concurrent with arealization of a capital gain. Presumably, however, the cash extracted influences consumer spending only over time.Unrealized gains can build up over time without any obvious effect on spending. But a cash-out refinancing or a home equityloan is presumably initiated for a specific current purpose. Thus, the lags between the emergence of a capital gain andspending may be a function of the degree of gains realization and the particular mortgage vehicle employed for equityextraction. Another means of equity extraction of unrealized gains for which data are scarce outside of decennial censusesare long-term first lien mortgages on residences previously free of debt.4Capital gains, however, have not been fully stripped from personal income. The capital gains embedded in exercised stockoptions, for example, are included in compensation of employees (and as a charge against profits) in the NIPA. These gainsare taxed as regular income.
4BIS Review 73/2001Capital gains have also significantly influenced the measured personal saving rate as a result of theNIPA treatment of the pension fund sector. In particular, because defined-benefit pensions areconsidered part of the “personal sector”, employer contributions to such plans are included indisposable income, as are the interest, dividend, and rental incomes received by these plans. Incontrast, benefit payments to individuals are not part of personal income because they are consideredintrasectoral transfers.Neither households nor corporations, however, are likely to view their own financial activities in thatmanner. Surely, for defined-benefit pensions, it is the benefit payments to retirees rather than theemployer inflows into the pension sector that individuals perceive as personal income. For their part,businesses have often viewed defined-benefit pension plans, in effect, as business-sector profitcenters because capital gains affect corporate defined-benefit pension contributions and, hence,earnings.This consideration is relevant in the measurement and interpretation of the personal saving rate. Inrecent years, contributions to private defined-benefit plans have declined significantly as an increasingpart of these plans’ accrued benefit liabilities have been met through a rise in the market value of theirequity holdings. Offsetting this decline, to some extent, has been an increase in dividend and othercapital income.If private and state and local defined-benefit pension plans had been separated from the personalsector, the personal saving rate would have fallen about 3/4 percentage point less from 1995 to 2000,all else being equal.All told, if households viewed taxes on capital gains as a subtraction from those gains and not fromincome and, further, if households viewed benefit payments received from defined-benefit plans asincome rather than their employers’ contributions (as well as the investment income of the plans),perceived disposable income in 2000 would have been higher as would the personal saving rate.In short, roughly two-fifths of the measured decline in the personal saving rate since 1995 reflects theforegoing NIPA income-accounting conventions.I should emphasize that any accounting adjustments made to personal saving because of changes inthe definition of disposable income are exactly offset in business and government saving so thatnational saving is unaffected. The increment to personal saving associated with a treatment of theprivate defined-benefit pension sector as a business profit center would be offset by a decline incorporate profits and business saving. In addition, a designation of taxes on capital gains as capitaltransfers (in a manner similar to estate and gift taxes) would raise measured personal saving andlower overall tax receipts and, hence, government saving.5 Thus, while total national saving would beunaffected by these specific accounting adjustments for capital gains, the distribution of NIPA savingamong households, businesses, and governments would be significantly influenced.One must recognize that no single way to array information on income, production, and capital gains isbest. The particular array employed depends on the specific purposes to which the data set is to beapplied. The treatment of capital gains in the NIPA, for example, is intended to allow the accounts tomost accurately attribute national saving to the various sectors in the accounts. Indeed, when that isthe objective, the removal of capital gains is essential. For analysis of issues related to consumerspending, though, the NIPA personal saving rate presents an incomplete picture of the financial stateof the household sector in the aggregate, and an adjustment along the lines previously suggested maybe informative.In addition to the effect of income-accounting conventions, of course, we must consider the realeconomy influence of capital gains on the level of consumption. The estimates of the effect ofhousehold capital gains on consumer spending of 3 to 5 cents on the dollar suggest that, directly andindirectly, capital gains easily account for the remainder of the measured five-year decline in thesaving rate.Obviously, this is not to say that had asset prices been flat for an extended period the personal savingrate would have been unchanged, on net, over the past five years. If asset prices had not risen, realincomes would surely have been altered, and the vast array of secondary and tertiary effects of asset-price changes would have been different. Nonetheless, this exercise fosters additional important                                                     5This is not done in the NIPA owing, in part, to a desire by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) to conform withinternational standards for national accounts.
BIS Review 73/20015insights into the dynamics of household behavior and the relationships among asset prices, income,and consumption.The complexity of these relationships underscores the potential usefulness of developing separatesets of accounts to track capital gains. These accounts could supplement the income and productaccounts, the flow of funds accounts, and the balance of payments accounts. The last two currentlyexhibit, in part, the effect of capital gains and can be separated into special accounts. Asupplementary set of detailed tables on capital gains exclusions from the national income and productaccounts also would be a useful addition to our overall system of economic accounts.* * *This morning I have not endeavored to discuss the effects of capital gains, other than peripherally, oninvestment in plant and equipment, home improvement, tax revenues, and government surpluses, andtheir obvious significance in tracking international economic flows. Clearly, these also are relevant toany evaluation of macroeconomic events and warrant further study.* * *In closing, accounting systems are not ends in themselves. We construct them because they have afunction in aiding our understanding of some particular aspect of a business operation at a companylevel or for an economy as a whole. As we endeavor to better understand how changes in the leveland composition of wealth affect economic behavior, new accounting systems may be required tosupplement those that have long served us so well. Technology has facilitated the production ofinformation at a far faster rate than at any time in the past. But in the information economy, it remainsup to us to organize and use that information in ways that improve the quality of decision making.
BIS Review 72/20011Svein Gjedrem: Monetary policy and the outlook for the Norwegian economyAddress by Mr Svein Gjedrem, Governor of the Norges Bank, at the Wage Bargaining Conference ofthe Electricians and IT Workers' Union in Vestfold and Telemark counties, Drangedal, 24 August 2001.*      *      *The objective of monetary policyIn spring this year, the Norwegian Government and the Storting (Norwegian parliament) laid down newguidelines for economic policy. The Government has announced that it will use the expected realreturn on petroleum revenues in the Government Petroleum Fund over the central government budget.The Government stresses that it will nevertheless use fiscal policy to smooth fluctuations inemployment and activity levels. At the same time, Norges Bank was given a new operational mandatefor monetary policy. Norges Bank shall set the key rate with a view to maintaining low and stableinflation. The inflation target is set at 2½ per cent.Low and stable inflation is the best contribution monetary policy can make to growth and prosperity.High and varying inflation weakens growth potential. The function of prices as a vehicle for informationis impaired. Many choices will be based on a false foundation. Pay increases may be cancelled out byhigh price inflation. With high and varying inflation, it is difficult to determine whether higher houseprices, for example, entail a real increase in the value of property, or whether the rise in prices ismainly due to a decrease in the value of money. In an environment of substantial uncertainty, bothhomeowners and homebuyers make wrong decisions more frequently. Lenders protect themselves byimposing high risk premiums on loans for which enterprises and individuals in the start-up phase paydearly. Uncertainty has a price. High and variable inflation leads to an arbitrary redistribution of wealthand income. Thus there is no conflict between distribution policy objectives and the objective of lowand stable inflation.Unexpected swings in the price level may easily lead to fluctuations in the real economy and instabilityin financial and property markets. Experience shows that high inflation does not result in more jobs orlower unemployment, and that the booms associated with high inflation are followed by recessions.Since the beginning of the 1990s, inflation has been low and employment has grown sharply. Payincreases measured in kroner have been lower than in the 1980s, but low inflation has neverthelessgenerated stronger growth in purchasing power for wage earners than in the previous decade.The implementation of monetary policyPrice and cost inflation are influenced through a number of channels. When interest rates rise, itbecomes more costly to take up loans and more profitable to save and to postpone consumption andinvestment. A rise in interest rates will also reduce demand, because the value of houses, leisurehomes, cars and shares decreases. Household wealth declines. A rise in interest rates may alsostrengthen the krone. A stronger exchange rate will curb the rise in prices for imports, which directlyand indirectly account for 40 per cent of goods and services in the consumer price index. A strongerkrone weakens earnings and reduces activity in enterprises in the internationally exposed sector. Thishas an impact on enterprises’ capacity to pay, wage growth and price inflation.We do not expect a change in interest rates to have an immediate effect on inflation. Our analysesindicate that a substantial share of the effects of an interest rate change occurs within two years.Hence, the key rate is set with a view to achieving an inflation rate of 2½ per cent two years ahead.The social partners will take account of the inflation outlook in their wage negotiations. If there areprospects of higher inflation, the nominal wage increases will be higher. At the same time, higher wagegrowth means higher inflation. Developments in the labour market and wage formation are thereforeimportant for interest rate setting in Norges Bank. It is also important to be aware that developments inlabour costs may influence inflation, growth and employment differently in a system with a floatingexchange rate that in a system with a fixed exchange rate. In our open economy, with a floatingexchange rate, it can be assumed that an increase in wage growth of one percentage point without
2BIS Review 72/2001any monetary policy response will gradually translate into a corresponding increase in price inflationunless wage increases are anchored in higher productivity.1When Norges Bank concludes that the key rate should be changed, the change will in most cases bemade gradually. This is because there is normally uncertainty about the situation in the economy,potential disturbances to the economy and how fast an interest rate change will affect price inflation.But we will not always take a gradualist approach. A rapid and pronounced change in the interest rateis appropriate if, for example, heightening turbulence in financial markets or a cost-push shockresulting from negotiations indicates that confidence in monetary policy is in jeopardy.Norges Bank analyses the inflation outlook in separate inflation reports, which are published threetimes a year. Further assessments are presented every sixth week in connection with the ExecutiveBoard's monetary policy meetings.Higher interest rates curb demand for goods and services and reduce inflation. Lower interest rateshave the opposite effect. If evidence suggests that inflation with unchanged interest rates will behigher than 2½ per cent, the interest rate will be increased. If it appears that inflation with unchangedinterest rates will be lower than 2½ per cent, the interest rate will be reduced. There is symmetry here.It is equally important to avoid an inflation rate that is too low, as it is to avoid an inflation rate that istoo high.The situation in the labour marketThe supply of labour is limited in the Norwegian economy at present. We have a tight labour market.The labour force participation rate is high. Extensive use of disability and sickness benefits is limitingthe supply of labour. Reforms such as contractual pension schemes, which were expanded throughthe 1990s, cash allowances for families with small children and an increased number of vacation daysthis year and next also contribute to reducing the labour supply. Recently, unemployment has declinedagain. Adjusted for normal seasonal variations, the number of registered unemployed now stands at59000, or 2.5 per cent of the labour force. Of these, about ¾ percentage point, or about 16 000, havebeen unemployed for more than 6 months. The tight labour market is the result of a high activity levelin the Norwegian economy. Growth in household and enterprise debt is strong. The phasing in ofpetroleum revenues in the years ahead will keep demand for labour at a high level.The centralised income settlements in Norway have been an arena of coordination, whereconsiderable emphasis has been placed at times on overall employment. This has contributed to lowunemployment levels in our country. But we have also experienced that the income settlements maybe a source of economic disturbances. The income settlements in 1974/75 and 1986 in particular, butalso the settlements in 1998 and 2000, contributed to higher cost inflation and weaker demand forlabour.We have seen that income formation is affected by labour market conditions and profit trends in thebusiness sector. This is also true of wage and income developments among managers, salariedemployees and the liberal professions. The structural changes that now seem to have occurred inincome determination for these groups has probably also been important for the outcome of theordinary wage settlements.Through the last part of the 1990s, factor income rose as a share of labour costs. Over time, a balancewill probably be reached between labour costs and the portion of income that goes to servicing capital.To some extent the process will be self-regulating. High profits tend to lead to stronger growth inwages. Lower earnings prompt companies to cut costs. This may take the form of increased workeffort, or possibly workforce reductions, in order to increase productivity. Companies may also reducegrowth in business fixed investment.Since 1997, price inflation has been higher in Norway than among our trading partners. The mostimportant reason for higher price inflation in Norway is that we have had a tight labour market for manyyears. This has also led to high growth in wages and labour costs. In the light of higher price and costinflation in Norway than in other countries, it has been appropriate to maintain higher interest rates inNorway than in most comparable countries. Norges Bank increased the sight deposit rate - which isour key rate - by a total of 1½ percentage points last year. So far this year, the key rate has remained                                                     1 The relationship between wage growth and price inflation was also discussed in the Annual Address in February this year.
BIS Review 72/20013unchanged. As a result, the difference between short-term rates in Norway and other countries hasincreased.The economic outlookThe Bank last analysed the outlook for the Norwegian economy in the June 2001 Inflation Report.Price inflation is projected to fall to 2½ per cent by next year already.The risk picture is mixed. The Norwegian economy is still characterised by high capacity utilisation.The labour market is tight. There is a risk that domestic pressures may gradually translate into astronger price impetus than we have projected.The consumer price index has risen by 2.7 per cent since July 2000. The consumer price indexexcluding the direct effects of changes in excise duties and energy prices (CPIXE) has risen by 2.6 percent since July last year, as calculated by Norges Bank. Statistics Norway publishes a consumer priceindex excluding electricity prices and a consumer price index excluding energy prices. They have abroader definition of energy prices than we use in our calculations. Statistics Norway has not adjustedfor the direct effects of excise duties in their indices, but projects that the combined effect of changesin excise duties in January and July will depress the year-on-year rise in the CPI by0.5-0.6 percentage points in July. According to Statistics Norway, the CPI excluding energy prices andexcise duties can then be estimated at 2.2-2.3 per cent.Whereas the activity level and pressures in the Norwegian economy are high, there is growinguncertainty about developments in the global economy. The Norwegian business sector has so farlargely been protected from weaker growth in the global economy, but this may change. Low growth inthe world economy may reduce demand for Norwegian products and pressures in the Norwegianeconomy. It may also help to curb imported price inflation. This could also result in lower price inflationthan we have projected.Against this background, Norges Bank has expressed its view that with an unchanged interest rateahead, the probability that inflation two years ahead will be higher than 2½ per cent is the same as theprobability that it will be lower.
BIS Review 72/20011Bank of Japan’s August report of recent economic and financial developments1Bank of Japan, 15 August 2001*   *   *The Bank’s view2Adjustments in economic activities are intensifying further, reflecting a substantial decline in exportsand production.With regard to final demand, private consumption remains flat on the whole. Housing investment isdeclining and public investment is also starting to decrease since the implementation of thesupplementary budget for fiscal 2000 has peaked out. Net exports (real exports minus real imports)continue to decline, reflecting not only a slowdown in overseas economies but also sluggish demandfor IT-related goods. Business fixed investment is also decreasing while exporting conditions continueto deteriorate.Industrial production continues to decline sharply, reflecting such developments in final demand andstrong excessiveness in inventories of electronic parts and some materials. Corporate profits andbusiness sentiment are also worsening particularly in manufacturing. Affected by such developments,household income seems to be weakening gradually.As for the outlook, public investment is expected to follow a declining trend. Net exports are likely tocontinue decreasing for a while amid the deceleration in overseas economies and ongoing inventoryadjustments in IT-related goods worldwide. Judged from leading indicators and investment plans offirms, business fixed investment is projected to follow a downward trend. In addition, inventoryadjustments in goods such as electronic parts and materials will continue for the time being. Industrialproduction is, therefore, expected to follow a declining trend.There still exist such general views that around the end of this year, ongoing inventory adjustments inIT-related goods worldwide are likely to peak out and overseas economies, particularly the UnitedStates, will start to recover. Based on these preconditions, exports are expected to pick up sometimein the future and thus underpin industrial production. However, cautious views on global demand inIT-related goods and developments in overseas economies for both their timing and pace of recoveryare recently growing. At home, under the prolonged adjustments in economic activities particularly inproduction, household income, which is the basis of private consumption, is likely to be weakeninggradually along with the decline in corporate profits.Overall, it seems to be inevitable that adjustments in economic activities, starting from the decrease inexports, will continue for the time being. Moreover, the substantial decline in production would causedomestic demand to decrease and in turn generate the risk of adjustments in economic activities tospread even further. Also, attention should be paid to the risk a negative impact on the economyinduced by developments in foreign and domestic capital markets via corporate and householdconfidence.With regard to prices, import prices are mostly unchanged. Domestic wholesale prices are weakmainly due to the decrease in prices of electrical machinery and materials. Consumer prices continueto be somewhat weak owing to the decline in prices of imported products and their substitutes.Corporate service prices continue to decrease.As for the conditions surrounding price developments, the past yen depreciation is exerting upwardpressure on prices. However, with the ongoing adjustments in economic activities, the balancebetween supply and demand in the domestic market is likely to exert downward pressure on prices.Furthermore, in addition to the declining trend of machinery prices caused by technologicalinnovations, the decreases in the prices of goods and services reflecting deregulation and thestreamlining of distribution channels will continue to restrain price developments. Overall, prices areexpected to be weak for the time being. Moreover, given the high degree of uncertainty regarding                                                     1This report is based on data and information available at the time of the Bank of Japan Monetary Policy Meeting held onAugust 13 and 14, 2001.2The Bank’s view of recent economic and financial developments, determined by the Policy Board at the Monetary PolicyMeeting held on August 13 and 14 as the basis for monetary policy decisions.
2BIS Review 72/2001future economic developments, the possibility that weak demand will further intensify downwardpressure on prices warrants careful monitoring.In the financial market, the overnight call rate is basically moving around zero percent under theguideline for money market operations to maintain the current-account balance at the Bank of Japanat around 5 trillion yen.Interest rates on term instruments are basically level on the whole. The Japan premium remainsnegligible.Yields on long-term government bonds rose temporarily to 1.40-1.45 percent, but are recently movingaround the range of 1.30-1.35 percent. The yield spreads between private bonds (bank debenturesand corporate bonds) and government bonds are contracting somewhat.Stock prices are declining around the lowest level since the start of the year.In the foreign exchange market, the yen is currently being traded in the range of 121-124 yen to theU.S. dollar.With regard to corporate finance, private banks continue to be more active in extending loans, mainlyto blue-chip companies, while carefully evaluating the credit risks involved. However, there are somesigns indicating that the lending attitudes of financial institutions perceived by small firms arebecoming slightly more cautious. Meanwhile, the fund-raising conditions of firms in the markets forsuch instruments as corporate bonds and CP continue to improve owing to a decline in market interestrates and the more active stance of investors to take credit risks.On the other hand, credit demand in the private sector seems to be declining slightly faster due to adecrease in business fixed investment while firms continue to reduce their debts.In view of this, private banks’ lending remains sluggish. Meanwhile, the growth rate of amountoutstanding of corporate bonds issued is on the gradually rising trend, reflecting the favorableenvironment for issuing corporate bonds. The amount outstanding of CP issued is well above that ofthe previous year and marking the highest level to date.The growth rate of money stock (M2 + CDs) in July was slightly higher than that of the previous monthdue mainly to the inflow from postal savings.Funding costs for firms continue to be at extremely low levels.In this financial environment, the lending attitudes of financial institutions and corporate financingconditions remain easy as a whole. For the time being, attention should be paid to the effects of themonetary easing measures taken by the Bank, while careful monitoring is required for the effects ofstock price developments and corporate profit conditions on the behavior of financial institutions andthe fund-raising conditions of firms.
BIS Review 71/20011Mervyn King: The international financial system: a new partnershipSpeech by Mr Mervyn King, Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, at the 20th Anniversary of theIndian Council for Research on International Economic Relations, New Delhi, 9 August 2001.*      *      *IntroductionIt is both a great honour and a real delight to make my first visit to India in order to commemorate the20th Anniversary of ICRIER. I feel especially honoured to be invited to deliver the first K. B. LallLecture. The theme of my lecture will be the international financial system, and the need for a newpartnership between those countries exporting capital, in normal circumstances the developedeconomies, and those countries which import capital, the emerging market economies. Theinternational financial institutions set up at Bretton Woods over 50 years ago were designed to dealprimarily with problems of current account imbalances. In recent years, however, major financial criseshave originated in the capital account. Why have these occurred, and how can we make them lesslikely in future and improve our ability to deal with them when they do occur?I can think of no better place to discuss this subject than ICRIER. The links between international flowsof private and public finance, and the need for a restatement of the role of the international financialinstitutions and a clearer understanding of their modus operandi, are subjects at the heart of the workof ICRIER. Your Founder Chairman, Dr K B Lall, whom I am delighted to say is with us this evening,worked tirelessly over the years in so many areas of international economic policy, including a periodas Chairman of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Your current Chairman, Dr I G Patel,served India not only as Governor of the Reserve Bank but also at the International Monetary Fund. Itis a great personal pleasure to see I G, as we all know him, here tonight because I owe him a greatdebt for his help and support at the London School of Economics during his period as Director in the1980s. And the new Independent Evaluation Office of the IMF, an important development in improvingthe accountability of the Fund, will be led by Mr Montek Singh Ahluwalia, one of India's mostdistinguished economists, and the husband of your Director, Dr Isher Judge Ahluwalia.India was one of the 44 countries which participated in the meetings at Bretton Woods which led to thecreation of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The Bank of England archivescontains some fascinating material on the Bretton Woods Conference and, in particular, on the role ofthe Indian Delegation. Sir Chintaman Deshmukh, the Governor of the Reserve Bank, was reported tohave made a big impression on the delegates at Bretton Woods. A cable from the Foreign Office to theBritish Embassy in Washington on 1 June 1944 argued that there were strong grounds for giving Indiaa seat on the Agenda Committee. The reply reported US opposition to this idea, in part becauseCanada and Australia were already represented on the Committee. The resulting compromise was theproduct of bureaucratic genius. An Indian representative was allowed to participate on the Committeeprovided that there was no public announcement of the fact. In the end, common sense prevailed andIndia received an official invitation to attend the Agenda Committee.Recent international financial crisesPerhaps the key difference between the world of Bretton Woods and the world today is the size andvolatility of private capital flows. Then, as now, it was recognised that no system could ensure thecompatibility of:(i)Domestic monetary autonomy;(ii)Stable exchange rates;(iii)Free capital mobility.This "impossible trinity" has been at the heart of the debate on the international monetary and financialsystem for many years. A sustainable system must sacrifice one of these three objectives. Somecountries have decided to abandon the first leg of the tripod, namely domestic monetary autonomy. InEurope, twelve countries have formed a monetary union, and elsewhere, such as in Argentina andHong Kong, currency boards, linked to the dollar, have replaced discretionary monetary policy. Othercountries have abandoned the attempt to maintain rigidly fixed exchange rates, and adopted a
2BIS Review 71/2001combination of domestic monetary management based on an inflation target and a floating exchangerate. Examples include both developed economies, such as the UK and Canada, and emergingmarket economies, such as Brazil and South Africa. There are arguments for and against both ofthese approaches. But what is clear is that both in theory and practice there is now a recognition thatpegged (fixed but adjustable) exchange rates do not provide a viable long-term middle course. Moreinteresting, perhaps, is the absence of serious debate on the merits of the third position, namely thewillingness to forego freedom of capital movements in order to retain domestic monetary autonomyand stable exchange rates. That is perhaps surprising in the light of the experience of the two majorcountries in Asia that escaped the financial crisis of 1997-98, namely India and China, which had incommon the presence of capital controls.The willingness to impose controls on capital movements, at least temporarily, was certainly evident atthe Bretton Woods Conference. Mindful of the weakness of Britain's national balance sheet, LordKeynes, urged on by the Bank of England, argued that there should be no legally binding obligation tomake the sterling balances convertible into dollars. The vulnerability of countries to financial criseswhen private capital is freely mobile was uppermost in the mind of officials then, and has recentlyreturned to prominence in the wake of recent crises.Capital flows do, however, bring real economic benefits. They enable savings from around the world tomove to those countries with the most profitable investment opportunities, benefiting lenders andborrowers alike. And such capital flows also transfer knowledge and expertise. The most importanttask of any financial system is to guide the allocation of scarce capital. As Larry Summers, the formerUS Treasury Secretary, said earlier this year, "If you are looking for reasons why some countriessucceed and why other countries do not succeed in the new global economy, a very large part of itgoes to the greater success of the successful countries in channelling capital into the right places, andthen making sure that it is used in a disciplined way."At Bretton Woods it was thought that post-war reconstruction could be financed by capital provided bythe new World Bank, the twin of the International Monetary Fund. Hence it would be possible tofinance reconstruction from long-term investment supplied by official institutions, without the necessityof allowing free movement of private capital that might raise the problem of the "impossible trinity".Soon, however, the demand for capital imports exceeded the ability of international institutions tosupply loans. Private capital markets came into their own. The expansion of private capital flows wasgradual, and, until about ten years ago, was primarily concentrated on flows among the developedeconomies. It is only in the past ten years that the explosion of private capital flows to emergingmarket economies has taken place. Data from the World Bank suggest that annual capital flows toemerging markets were less than $10 bn in the early 1970s, rising to around $300 bn in the late1990s. At their peak, capital flows to emerging markets were around 5% of those countries' GDP.Unfortunately, capital flows on this scale can reverse themselves as suddenly as they appear. Theresult of such sudden and large reversals of short-term capital flows has been a series of internationalfinancial crises, in Mexico in 1994-95, Asia in 1997-98, Brazil in 1998-99, and, more recently in Turkeyand Argentina. The frequency and scale of these crises, if they were to continue, would be a seriousimpediment to the evolution of the international capital market. Unless we can both reduce thefrequency and severity of such crises, and improve our techniques of crisis resolution, then thedemonstrators against globalisation will be provided with unnecessary ammunition.The costs of recent crises have been large. Between 1996 and 1998, the reversal of private capitalflows to the five Asian countries primarily affected (Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines andThailand) was almost $150 bn, equivalent to about 15% of the pre-crisis level of GDP. Changes in thecapital account imply equal and opposite swings in the current account. Inevitably, a change in thecurrent account on that scale is likely to mean a deep recession. And during the Asian crisis, real GDPfell by 1% in the Philippines, 7% in Korea and Malaysia, 11% in Thailand and by 13% in Indonesia.Several years of economic growth were wiped out, leading in some cases to political instability. Arecent study by Robert Barro shows that countries that experience financial crises can expect to returnto their pre-crisis rate of economic growth only after about five years on average. Although therecovery of the afflicted Asian economies in 1999-2000 was more rapid, the fall in investment is likelyto affect their level of output for several years.It is clear, therefore, that it is dangerous for countries to sail unprepared into the deep waters ofinternational capital markets. One of the important lessons of recent crises is that not all capital flowsare equally dangerous. Most of the reversals in capital flows to the Asian countries were in the form ofswings in short-term debt finance – about 80% resulted from changes in the net flows of finance from
BIS Review 71/20013commercial banks. A build-up of short-term debt creates vulnerabilities in a country's national balancesheet. Where there are significant mismatches in either maturity and currency obligations, then acountry is vulnerable to a liquidity run. In such a situation sudden reversals of capital flows can occuron a huge scale. That is the hidden cost of debt finance. In contrast, equity capital does not involve therisk of crises that are associated with the possibility of interruptions to payments on debt finance. Thisis because equity investment has a self-stabilising mechanism. Investors cannot withdraw from theequity market without finding a buyer to replace them. The market price adjusts in order for the sellerto attract a buyer. Of course, the market price may move sharply and rapidly, and impact spendingdecisions. But crises resulting from payment interruptions are a feature of debt finance. Lenderswhose bonds mature or who choose to withdraw their deposits do not have to find a buyer. Insteadthey simply exit, and, if they do so on a sufficiently large scale, countries can find themselves facing aliquidity run.Interest rates on lending to a country vulnerable to a run can rise to extremely high levels. If themarket anticipates that a country may allow inflation to rise, or the exchange rate to fall, to alleviate theburden of domestic currency debt then interest rates on debt can rise rapidly. It is only ten years agosince overnight interest rates of several hundred percent were seen during the ERM crisis in Europe.But even on foreign currency borrowing, a country may find that the spread of the interest rate atwhich it can borrow over the interest rate charged to "safe" countries, such as the United States, canreach extremely high levels. And where that interest rate is markedly higher than the growth rate of theeconomy, the debt burden rapidly becomes unsustainable unless the interest rate can be broughtdown quickly. Before the Russian default and devaluation of 1998, the average spread on emergingmarket sovereign debt was around 500 basis points, in itself a sizeable addition to the burden ofborrowing in international capital markets. That spread then rose sharply to levels of between 1000and 1500 basis points. At these levels debt burdens were clearly unsustainable. Since then,macroeconomic reform in many of the affected countries, with the help and support of the IMF, hasreduced average spreads to a range of between 600 and 800 basis points, although there has been afurther rise recently following the difficulties in Turkey and Argentina.Emerging market spreads are currently around 900 basis points over interest rates on US Treasurybonds. It is not easy to reconcile spreads at this level with the fact that sovereign debt defaults onbonds are running at historically low levels. In part, the low level of defaults may reflect the increase inthe number of exceptionally large loans made by the IMF in recent years. So what does account forthe high level of emerging market spreads? There appears to be a good deal of uncertaintyconcerning the conditions surrounding the availability of official finance. It could be that investors aredemanding higher interest rates to compensate for that uncertainty. There is also uncertainty amongmarket participants about what would happen in the event of a debt restructuring and the expectedrepayments that would ensue. One role for the official community is to try and mitigate theseuncertainties through greater clarity about the criteria for official lending and its crisis resolutionpolicies – a theme I return to below. If successful, one outcome of these reforms would be lowerborrowing costs for emerging markets.Investors are also starting to differentiate among borrowing countries more clearly than before. Thishas led to a greater dispersion of spreads on emerging market debt. Before the Russian crisis thesespreads were tightly compressed with the central 50% of the distribution of emerging market spreadscovered by a range of only around 100 basis points. At present, the range covered by the central 50%of the distribution is over 500 basis points. Correspondingly, there has been a sharp fall in thecorrelation between changes in emerging market spreads. The rolling 26 week correlation betweenchanges in emerging market spreads reached a peak of around 0.8 at the time of the Russian crisis.Since then it has steadily declined, reaching a level of only 0.2 before the recent rise to around0.35 following adverse developments in Turkey and Argentina. This differentiation in spreads is awelcome development. It shows that the possibility of contagion from a country affected by a crisis toothers initially unaffected is less than might have been the case only a few years ago. Of course, if acountry did default then correlations might rise significantly, but the focus of attention on recent crisesand their causes has led investors to appreciate that many have been country-specific. Although thereis no room for complacency, the lower correlation of spreads and the greater differentiation of riskassessments represents an increase in the efficiency in the way capital markets operate.The experience of recent crises prompts two questions. First, what can countries do to protectthemselves from the risk of further financial crises? Second, what should be the responsibility of theinternational community towards emerging market economies?
4BIS Review 71/2001A new partnershipIn describing a new partnership between emerging market economies and developed economies, it isuseful to distinguish between measures to improve economic performance and prevent financialcrises, on the one hand, and ways to resolve crises once they have occurred, on the other. In thissection I deal only with the former. Crisis prevention should be at the heart of the policies of bothemerging markets and the international financial institutions.In terms of prevention, recent experience suggests five lessons for the future.1. First, it is important that borrowing countries, especially those without a track record ofinternational borrowing, monitor and manage the maturity and currency composition of theirnational balance sheet. This is not a trivial matter. Most countries have inadequateinformation on the composition of their external liabilities, especially those of the privatesector. Nevertheless, monitoring and managing the exposures of the public and financialsectors are important to avoid a build up of potential vulnerabilities. In this respect, the IMFcan play a helpful supportive role by providing assessments of vulnerability as part of theArticle IV process, the new joint IMF/World Bank financial sector assessment programmesand debt management guidelines, and technical assistance on the data requirements impliedby the need to monitor national balance sheets.2. Second, limitations on official finance mean that countries should think carefully about theprovision of self-insurance against a liquidity crisis. A simple, but often expensive, way to dothis is to build up large foreign currency reserves, a strategy taken to heart by a number ofemerging markets, including China and also Korea following its crisis. A potentially superioralternative is the creation of contingent credit facilities with both official and private sectorcreditors. So far, even at the high spreads on emerging market debt, these facilities have notproved attractive, and the CCL facility created by the IMF has lain dormant. The next fewyears will be a test of the value of such facilities.3. Third, experience has shown the value of borrowing countries establishing goodrelationships with creditors well before any possibility of difficulty in repayment arises. Thecreation of investor relations programmes and the regular briefing of creditors aboutdevelopments in economic policy can play a role in providing the information which themarket requires to assess the riskiness of sovereign loans. It is never too early to build arelationship with actual or potential creditors. The IMF, in collaboration with the privatesector, have recently drawn up a set of guidelines that countries might usefully follow whensetting up an investor relations programme. The second aspect of relationships withcreditors is the insertion of collective action clauses in sovereign debt contracts. Thisproposal, advanced originally in a G10 Deputies' report in 1996, has gradually becomeaccepted as a sensible step forward. The UK has introduced collective action clauses into itsforeign currency debt instruments. And just last month, the G7 Finance Ministers agreed onthe importance of introducing collective action clauses into debt contracts to facilitate crisismanagement. Again, time may be on the side of reform.4. Fourth, in the long run, the best way to avoid the problem of liquidity crises is for thecomposition of capital flows to emerging markets to move away from debt, both bank andbond, finance towards portfolio equity and direct investment. Shocks to the borrowingcountry would take the form of a fall in equity prices, not a liquidity run with its associated riskof a financial crisis and the need for external finance. Encouragingly, the pattern of capitalflows to emerging markets is already evolving in that direction. Bank lending representedaround 80% of capital flows to emerging markets during the 1970s. But by the end of the1990s, FDI accounted for around 80% of emerging market capital flows, with portfolio equityaccounting for much of the remainder. As Ken Rogoff, the new Economic Counsellor to theIMF, pointed out in 1999 there are still several biases towards debt rather than equity financein capital flows to emerging markets. One of these is deposit insurance in both creditor anddebtor countries which makes it more difficult for the authorities to avoid being seen asproviding some implicit support to international loans by domestic banks. There is no easyanswer to this problem, but a shared concern in both borrowing and lending countries is theimplicit insurance which both sides are giving to large parts of the financial system. Themoral hazard so created is not restricted to international lending, but it does affect theincentives for the form of investment in emerging markets. We need also to guard againstinstitutional or regulatory mechanisms – both international and domestic – which favour
BIS Review 71/20015short-term over longer-maturity capital flows. In the long run, the solution is for emergingmarkets to create legal structures and a stable economic policy environment that provide theconfidence to support inward equity investment in their economies.5. Finally, greater transparency allows better informed decisions by both borrowers andlenders, and reduces the risk of contagion by allowing markets to differentiate amongborrowers. Much has been said, and, more importantly, achieved in the area of transparencyin recent years. There has been an explosion of codes and standards on different aspects ofeconomic and financial policy in recent years. So much so, that some countries are claimingthat the process needs to slow down. It is certainly important to recognise that theappropriate codes and standards for a country at one stage of economic development maynot be appropriate to countries at other stages. I say advisedly "may", because in eachindividual case the argument has to be made. But if it is accepted that codes and standardsare likely to reflect different stages of development, then it is even more important thatcountries make clear to which codes and standards they are actually adhering. That is whycountries should not be able to opt out of "transparency about transparency". Following theproduction of pilot transparency reports on a number of countries, including the UK andArgentina, the IMF has now made rapid progress in producing reports on the observance ofstandards and codes (ROSCs). As of April 2001, 110 ROSC modules had been completedfor 43 countries, of which 76 have been published covering 31 countries. India has recentlyhad a ROSC published on fiscal transparency. It is critical that monitoring of the observanceof standards and codes be fully integrated into IMF surveillance under Article IV. Hereimplementation is urgent.In the field of transparency, the key elements of the new partnership are, first, a commitment byemerging market economies to implement transparency about transparency by publishing ROSCs,and, on the part of the international community, new opportunities for emerging markets to engage inthe process of constructing and developing codes and standards. There is encouraging evidence ofgreater collaboration and consultation between developed and developing countries in the design andimplementation of the core standards – for example, on banking, securities and insurance regulation,data, payment systems, insolvency and transparency of monetary, fiscal and financial policies. That isall to the good and there is further to go. It is crucial that we find new ways of involving emergingmarket countries in the process of designing and implementing standards and codes.In this area, ownership is all. Transparency cannot and should not be imposed on any country.Countries themselves benefit most from being transparent and releasing the reports of assessmentsby the IMF about their financial systems. And the enthusiastic embracing of transparency by a numberof emerging markets has paid off in terms of better relations with creditors. Ultimately, the mostsuccessful route to enhance the influence of emerging markets on the development of standards andcodes is to strengthen the role of the IMF and the World Bank, the twin institutions that can claimlegitimacy through the membership of 183 countries. Under British Chairmanship, efforts have beenmade to increase the effectiveness of the meetings of the IMFC which represents all countries aroundone table.Private finance and public fundsThe second main area in which further progress is required is the resolution of crises. The problemwould be easier to solve were it possible to distinguish between two rather different sources ofcrises – a liquidity-based problem caused by a currency or maturity mismatch in a country's nationalbalance sheet despite a sustainable macroeconomic and debt position; and a fundamentals-basedproblem which means that the debt burden is unsustainable or the exchange rate or other keymacroeconomic policies need to be altered. In the former case, the provision of liquidity support by theinternational community might help to bridge to a position in which the country could re-engage with itsprivate creditors. In the latter case, the main requirement is not liquidity support but a change inmacroeconomic or debt management policies. Recent crises have seen examples of both types ofproblem.Liquidity runs typically occur because of a co-ordination failure among creditors. There are twosolutions to this co-ordination problem. The first is a lender of last resort that is able to provide liquiditysupport quickly and on a large – indeed, potentially unlimited – scale for a short period to enable theaffected country to meet its obligations. Such loans would normally be short-lived, and should bemade available at an above-market interest rate such that this sort of finance is seen as last not first
6BIS Review 71/2001resort. The second solution to the co-ordination problem is for the borrower to impose a temporarysuspension of payments to create a "time out" during which the borrower can negotiate directly withthe creditors, and so arrange a new profile of repayments of debt. Both approaches, if understood andimplemented consistently over time, can provide an efficient solution to the co-ordination problem andeliminate the incentives for a liquidity run.But, as Ken Rogoff pointed out in 1999, the lender of last resort approach carries with it the risk ofintroducing significant moral hazard into the loan market. If lenders believe that sovereign borrowersare likely to be bailed out, then their incentive to assess the riskiness of their loans will diminish.Equally, borrowing countries will find it more attractive to claim that the measures necessary tocontinue servicing their debt are "politically impossible" if they believe that there is an internationaldeep pocket willing to extend loans and defer the moment when the national balance constraint isbinding.There are two good reasons for the IMF not being able to play the role of an international lender of lastresort, at least for the foreseeable future. First, the moral hazard created by both lenders andborrowers cannot simply be assumed away. It is not easy to quantify, but it is noteworthy that thenumber of sovereign defaults has declined quite sharply during the 1990s. If sovereign risk ismis-priced by private capital markets, this sows the seeds of future crises. The increased provision ofofficial finance would proceed hand-in-hand with an increased incidence of crises.Second, to be effective, a lender of last resort must have the ability to extend sufficient resources thatthe market has no doubt whatsoever about the ability to provide whatever it takes to deal with theimmediate crisis. The IMF is not in that position. There is no political commitment to provide the IMFwith unlimited funds. As the finance ministers and central bank governors representing all IMFmember countries said in their communiqué of the IMFC last September in Prague: "The Committeenotes that Fund resources are limited and that extraordinary access should be exceptional …".In practice, however, exceptional access has often been more the norm in recent years. Normalaccess is typically defined as 300% of IMF quota. During the Asian crisis, Korea's programme wasalmost 2000% of quota and Thailand's over 500%. More recently, Turkey's programme was over1500% of quota and Argentina's 500%. If creditors and debtors continue to believe that exceptionalaccess is readily available, then international credit will be over-extended and the incidence of crisiswill increase.One reaction to these extremely large packages – "bailouts" – and the accompanying moral hazard issimply to say that the official sector should have no part to play in what is essentially a privateinternational capital market. Official lending is now small relative to private capital flows. Over the lastthree years, private flows have been around 7.5 times greater than official flows, according to IIF data.Against that backdrop, some have argued that the IMF should be abolished. This would be to throwout the baby with the bath water.What is needed is a "middle way" between full IMF insurance and no insurance at all. This middle waywould comprise IMF lending but within strong presumptive limits. A key principle underlying thisapproach is that the international community needs to set out as clearly as possible the criteria that willgovern the size and scope of IMF lending. Since most agree that there are limits on IMF lending, thereis merit in explaining those limits to both potential borrowing countries and their private creditors. Thiswould enable debtor countries better to plan their policies. It would also allow creditors to assess riskmore accurately. Indeed, put more controversially, how can sovereign risk be accurately assessedwithout clarity about the Fund's role? A lack of clarity about the likely response of the internationalcommunity to potential crises is a recipe for inaccurate assessments of risk. Such uncertainty wouldadd to the (already high) cost of borrowing by emerging markets.So far, the "middle way" seems a statement of the obvious – namely that there are limits to IMFlending and that there is merit, for debtors and creditors, in having clarity about those limits. The otherside of this coin is that, on occasions, there will be countries that have run up unsustainable debtburdens, or face severe liquidity pressures, and who have little alternative but to restructure orreschedule their debt. Perhaps this is why the international community has moved significantly in thedirection of giving "private sector involvement" a greater role in the resolution of financial crises thanwas typically the case in the late 1990s. The IMF communiqué in Prague last year, the G7 FinanceMinisters statement last month, recent joint work by the Bank of England and Bank of Canada, and,significantly, speeches by the new Managing Director of the IMF, Horst Kohler, have all emphasisedthe need to move further in the direction of greater private sector involvement. As one example theReport of the G7 Finance Ministers to the Heads of State and Government only last month stated that,
BIS Review 71/20017"While the IMF has an essential role to play, official resources are limited in relation to private financialflows. The engagement of private investors is thus essential for the resolution of payment imbalancesin crises… the official sector needs to avoid creating expectations that private creditors and investorswill be protected from losses or that official resources would be used to finance large, sustained capitaloutflows. … We underscore the need for further progress".The opponents of this approach raise two important questions. First, is it possible to define limits onIMF lending? Second, is it acceptable for the official sector to countenance default by a sovereignborrower when the consequences for both the country and the international financial system could bedevastating? I shall try to provide answers to both of these questions.It is true that recent crises have been the result of developments in the capital account rather than thecurrent account. As capital flows have grown, so too have the potential demands on the officialcommunity as they attempt to fill capital account financing gaps. That is why so many moreprogrammes have involved "exceptional" access in relation to quota. So perhaps, in a world of capitalaccount crises, exceptional access should become the norm?This argument is superficially quite attractive. But its implications need to be assessed carefully. Itwould mean that IMF resources would need to increase in line with private capital flows even for theIMF to maintain its current role. And since 1970, capital flows have grown around four times as fast asworld incomes. The share of world GDP devoted to resourcing the IMF would grow rapidly over time.In fact, as private capital markets came to understand this, the scale of private capital flows couldincrease to an even greater extent. Private creditors and debtors would accumulate ever largerbilateral debts, safe in the knowledge of a multilateral insurance mechanism. The logical end point ofthis game is that the international community would be locked into providing ever increasing sums ofmoney to countries in difficulty – in short, an international lender of last resort would be created bystealth. There is no evidence that anyone wishes to go down this route.To guard against this, it is crucial that there be some clearer presumption about the scale of "normal"access. That scale may well be higher than was the case in a world of current account crises. And theapproach of defining limits in terms of multiples of quota may be unsatisfactory because the size ofquotas in some cases needs to be revisited. But that is not an argument against the principle ofpresumptive limits; it is a case either for reconsidering quotas or, in a more practical vein, relatingaccess to finance to some other metric.The key to limiting lending is not strict rules but stronger presumptions. These presumptions thenprovide the backstop for debtor-creditor negotiations and help condition expectations in financialmarkets. Exceptional lending above this presumptive limit would be possible in order, to provideoperational flexibility in extreme cases – for example, those threatening systemic stability. That is whythe framework is one of presumptive limits rather than strict rules. But granting exceptional accessshould require much greater ex ante justification and ex post accountability. For example, exceptionalaccess programmes should be automatically referred to the new Independent Evaluation Office of theIMF. This would raise the hurdle for granting exceptional access and provide greater clarity to debtorsand creditors about the support countries could expect from the official community.The logical consequence of limited official finance is that inevitably there will be times when areprofiling of sovereign debt may be necessary for some countries. Some have argued that sovereigndebt restructuring or default is potentially too disastrous to contemplate, for the country or indeed forthe world economy. The Russian default in 1998, and the disruption to world markets that followedfrom it, is often cited as evidence for the prosecution.More careful analysis suggests two rather different conclusions from the Russian experience. First, theRussian default was disruptive in part because it came as a surprise to market participants. Privatecreditors had planned on one assumption – exceptional IMF financing, or the "moral hazard" play as itwas labelled by the market – and were surprised when their comfort blanket was removed. Greaterclarity and stronger presumptions about the size and form of Fund financing would have reduced thesurprise and the accompanying contagion. Expectations of debtors and creditors would have beenconditioned ex ante and the severity of the crisis thereby reduced ex post.Second, the Russian experience illustrates the importance of having orderly default mechanisms inplace. In assessing the costs of default, the maxim should be: "it's not what you do it's the way thatyou do it". In Russia, it was not that they defaulted but the way that they did it. The default wasdisorderly – neither efficient, nor equitable, nor expeditious. And that contributed importantly to thedisruption to Russia and more widely. But default need not be like that. There are dead weight costs to
8BIS Review 71/2001disorderly default. So there are lump-sum gains – to both debtors and creditors – to having orderlymechanisms in place.This is where the official sector has a role to play. A key principle of any crisis resolution framework isthat decisions on a sovereign's debt are the responsibility of the borrowing country, in consultation withits private sector creditors. Neither the IMF nor any group of countries should tell a country torestructure its debt. There are a range of options open to debtors in dealing with their creditors attimes of crisis. Countries with a good track record of repayment and long standing relationships withtheir creditors may be able to borrow more from the international market. Others, facing more severeliquidity pressures, may seek to undertake voluntary rescheduling or rollover of debt by bringingtogether all or some of their major creditors, as in the cases of Korea and Brazil. Those facingunsustainable debt positions may seek to negotiate market-based write-downs of their debt, as in thecases of Ukraine, Pakistan and Ecuador. And in yet another set of cases, a country may find itnecessary to impose a temporary timeout on payments to all creditors, to give themselves somebreathing space to address macroeconomic or co-ordination problems. The decision on exercising anyof these options must rest with the debtor country.The role of the official sector is to ensure that the full menu of financing options is made known andavailable to the debtor, from which it then chooses. This menu should include both the easier options– such as raising new private sector money – as well as the harder ones – such as suspendingpayments. Each of these options is backstopped by limits on IMF lending, so that the "pure bail-out"option is heavily circumscribed. Indeed, it is this backstop which helps provide the incentive forcreditors and debtors to seek alternative, market-based solutions sooner.The IMF should stand ready to assist countries, whichever of these options debtors choose toexercise, provided the appropriate prior conditions are satisfied. For example, should a country facingsevere liquidity pressures decide to suspend payments temporarily, then the IMF should be willing tosupport that decision while remedial policy measures are put in place. This support could take the formof bridging finance – so-called IMF lending-into-arrears. The pre-conditions of lending-into-arrearscould be designed to ensure that payments suspensions are handled in an orderlyfashion – for example, that they are time-limited and equitable, and the debtor is negotiating in goodfaith. This would reduce uncertainty on the part of both debtors and creditors as to how the end gamewould be played out, thereby reducing borrowing costs.These sets of procedures represent evolution in, rather than revolution of, the international financialarchitecture. They are about ensuring the official sector's own actions are clear, consistent andaccountable, so that they contribute effectively to the resolution of financial crises. These proceduresare fully consistent with the principles of private sector involvement outlined in the IMFC communiquélast September and more recently by the G7 Finance Ministers last month. The framework set outhere is an attempt to begin to add some operational colour to those overarching principles.To sum up, both borrowing countries and private sector creditors must expect that, except inexceptional cases of systemic concern, the limits on official finance means that they and they alonewill be responsible for dealing with a resolution of problems concerning debt repayment. Standstillsand debt restructuring will be only one of many options open to negotiation between debtors andcreditors. The IMF should not attempt to impose a solution on borrowing countries. It should be willingto lend into arrears in circumstances where countries have chosen the route of a standstill and itsassociated conditions. But it should not create expectations that exceptional access is the norm.ConclusionsProgress can be made only by closer co-operation between the developed and developing countries.The development of standards and codes, the design of IMF lending and the wider agenda of tradeliberalisation and international co-operation are examples of the new partnership of which I havespoken. The closeness of the relationship between Britain and India is a compelling reason for ourworking together in the various international fora to improve the international financial system. In hisfinal report to the British Government on the creation of the Bretton Woods system, Maynard Keyneswrote that "the excellence and closeness of our relations with the Indian delegation deserves specialcomment. Sir Chintaman Deshmukh handled his case with high dignity, ability and reasonableness;we always supported him on his interests and he always supported us on ours". Perhaps our jointwork on international financial architecture will recall the common architectural heritage of the Bank ofEngland and official buildings in New Delhi. Herbert Baker, who, with Lutyens, was responsible for the
BIS Review 71/20019design of early New Delhi also rebuilt the Bank of England in the inter-war period. In the upper storeysof the Bank he placed pavilions which are derivatives of the ends of the Secretariat blocks in NewDelhi.As Lord Keynes said in his speech at the closing plenary session of the Bretton Woods Conference on22 July 1944, "it has been our task to find a common measure, a common standard, a common ruleapplicable to each and not irksome to any. We have been operating, moreover, in a field of greatintellectual and technical difficulty. We have had to perform at one and the same time the tasksappropriate to the economist, to the financier, to the politician, to the journalist, to the propagandist, tothe lawyer, to the statesman – even, I think to the prophet and soothsayer. … We have shown that aconcourse of 44 nations are actually able to work together at a constructive task in amity andunbroken concord. If we can continue in a larger task as we have begun in this limited task, there ishope for the world." The IMF is still the only international body with the legitimacy, as well as staff andexpertise, to build and defend a successful international financial system. It is important, therefore, thatwe not accept uncritically the way it has developed, and we must examine closely how far changes ininternational financial markets require us to understand the consequences of limits to IMF lending andthe implications of those limits for borrowing countries and private creditors alike. We need neither agrandiose new plan nor another Bretton Woods Conference. But we do need greater clarity and lessfudge about how the present system is supposed to operate.
BIS Review 70/20011Laurence H Meyer: The securities activities of banksTestimony of Mr Laurence H Meyer, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem, before the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit and theSubcommittee on Capital Markets, Insurance and Government Sponsored Enterprises of theCommittee on Financial Services, US House of Representatives, 2 August 2001.*      *      *I appreciate the opportunity to present the views of the Federal Reserve on the interim final rulesissued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC or Commission) to implement the banksecurities provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLB Act). The manner in which these rules areimplemented is extremely important to banks and their customers and well deserves your attention.As the banking agencies detailed in our official comment to the Commission on the rules, we believethey are, in a number of critical areas, inconsistent with the language and purposes of the GLB Act,and create an overly complex, burdensome, and unnecessary regulatory regime. The rules ascurrently drafted would disrupt the traditional operations of banks and impose significant andunwarranted costs on banks and their customers.In our comment letter, the banking agencies also objected to the Commission adopting the rules infinal form and making them effective beginning October 1 of this year. The banking agencies urgedthe Commission to treat the interim final rules as proposed rules and to give banks sufficient time aftermodified rules are adopted by the Commission to implement systems and make other changesnecessary to comply with the rules.We support the Commission's recent actions to extend the public comment period on the rules untilSeptember 4, 2001, and to extend the effective date of the interim final rules and the statutoryprovisions that they implement until at least May 12, 2002. We also support the Commission'sstatement that it will further extend the effective date for an appropriate period of time to provide bankswith a sufficient transition period to come into compliance with any revised rules the Commissionultimately adopts. We believe these procedural steps are both necessary and appropriate to ensurethat the public comment process, which is so critical to the development of fair and effective rules,allows for meaningful comment and the collection of much needed information regarding the practicaleffects of the SEC's rules on the traditional activities of banks. Most importantly, we look forward toengaging in a constructive dialogue with the Commission and its staff and to assisting them inmodifying the substance of the rules in a manner that both gives effect to the Congress' intent anddoes not disrupt the traditional customer relationships and activities of banks.Before highlighting some of the most significant provisions of the interim final rules that we believemust be modified, a brief background of the treatment of banks under the Securities Exchange Act of1934 and the purposes of the GLB Act's bank securities provisions is useful.History of the bank exception and bank securities activitiesIn 1934, the Congress first adopted a federal scheme requiring all entities that act as securitiesbrokers or dealers to register with the SEC. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934, however,specifically exempted all banks from the definitions of "broker" and "dealer" and, accordingly, did notrequire banks providing securities services to their customers to register with the SEC as broker-dealers. Although the ability of banks to underwrite, deal in, and purchase securities was limited by theGlass-Steagall Act of 1933, banks continued to have the ability to buy and sell securities for theaccount of their customers and to buy and sell securities for their own account when specificallyauthorized by law. The Congress recognized that these permissible securities activities were alreadysupervised and examined by the appropriate federal and state banking authorities and that subjectingthese activities to an additional layer of regulation was not necessary or appropriate. In fact, one of theprimary purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 was to subject nonbank stockbrokers andsecurities traders to the type of government supervision and examination that was already appliedunder the banking laws to banks.Long before 1934 and since, banks have offered their customers securities services in a variety ofcircumstances in connection with their banking activities. For example, banks have long bought and
2BIS Review 70/2001sold securities for their trust and fiduciary customers. These services are an essential part of the trustand fiduciary operations of banks-operations that have long been considered a core banking function.Banks that have discretionary investment authority over a trust or fiduciary account purchase and sellsecurities for the account to ensure that the account is properly diversified and managed in themanner required by the governing trust agreement and applicable fiduciary principles. Banks alsoprovide investment advice concerning securities, real estate, and other assets to non-discretionaryfiduciary accounts, and have long been able to execute securities transactions for these accounts.Another core banking function is providing custody and safekeeping services. The five largest globalcustodians are banks, and banks, both large and small, act as trusted custodians for the securities,real estate, and other assets of customers. One of the most recognizable custody services providedby banks is for Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs). Under applicable Internal Revenue Serviceregulations, banks may act as custodians for IRAs, and bank-offered custodial IRAs provideconsumers throughout the nation with a convenient and economical way to buy and sell securities forretirement purposes on a tax-deferred basis. Banks, as part of their customary banking activities andas an accommodation to their customers, also have long permitted customers that hold securities incustody accounts at the bank to buy and sell securities related to the account. These services allowcustomers to avoid the unnecessary expense of having to establish a separate securities account at abroker-dealer to effect such trades. Other securities services traditionally offered by banks include"sweeping" deposit funds into overnight investment vehicles, such as money market mutual funds,privately placing securities for customers, and providing transfer agency services to issuers andbenefit plans.Banks have offered these services to their customers without significant concerns for years. It isimportant, moreover, to highlight that these activities are not unregulated – they are supervised,regulated, and examined by the relevant federal and state banking agencies. In the trust and fiduciaryarea, these protections are enhanced and supplemented by well-developed principles of state andfederal trust and fiduciary law that provide customers with strong protections against conflicts ofinterests and other potential abuses. Bank examiners regularly examine a bank's trust and fiduciarydepartments for compliance with these fiduciary principles. These examinations frequently areconducted by examiners who have received special training in trust and fiduciary law and practice,and the federal banking agencies assign banks engaged in fiduciary activities separate ratings underthe Uniform Interagency Trust Rating System. These ratings are based on an evaluation of, amongother things, the capability of management; the adequacy of the bank's operations, controls, andaudits; the bank's compliance with applicable law, fiduciary principles and the documents governingthe account; and the management of fiduciary assets.GLB ActIt was in the context of this existing regulatory framework that the Congress, during consideration ofthe GLB Act, reviewed the blanket exception for banks from the definitions of "broker" and "dealer" inthe Securities Exchange Act. This review of the blanket exception was not undertaken becauseabuses or concerns existed concerning the traditional securities activities of banks. In fact, banksgenerally have conducted their securities activities responsibly and in accordance with bank-regulatoryrequirements and other applicable law, including the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.Rather, the review of the bank exception was undertaken to address a concern that, if the blanketexception for banks was retained at the same time that the barriers hindering the affiliation of banksand securities broker-dealers were removed, securities firms might acquire a bank and move thesecurities activities of the broker-dealer into the bank in order to avoid SEC supervision andregulation. Some parties also expressed concern that banks might in the future significantly expandtheir securities activities outside the services traditionally provided customers under the blanketexception. The Congress sought to balance these concerns with the desire to ensure that banks couldcontinue to provide their customers the securities services that they had traditionally provided as partof their customary banking activities, without significant problems, and subject to the effectivesupervision and regulation of the banking agencies.The end result, the GLB Act, replaced the blanket exception for banks from the definitions of "broker"and "dealer" with fifteen exceptions tailored to allow the continuation of key bank securities activities.These exceptions were broadly drafted and were intended to ensure that banks could continue toprovide their customers with most, if not all, of the services that they traditionally had received frombanks. For example, these statutory exceptions permit banks, subject to certain conditions, to continue
BIS Review 70/20013to (1) buy and sell securities for their trust and fiduciary customers, (2) buy and sell securities for theircustodial clients as part of their customary banking activities, (3) establish so-called "networking"arrangements with registered broker-dealers to offer securities services to the bank's customers,(4) sweep deposit funds into shares of no-load money market mutual funds, (5) privately placesecurities with sophisticated investors, (6) issue and sell to qualified investors securities that arebacked by assets predominantly originated by the bank, its affiliates or, in the case of consumer-related receivables, a syndicate formed by the bank and other banks, and (7) broker securities in up to500 transactions per year that are not otherwise exempt.Interim final rules adopted by the SECThe interim final rules as currently written are, in many respects, not consistent with the language orpurposes of the GLB Act and would impose unnecessary costs and burdens on banks and theircustomers. In the interest of time, I will focus only on some of our most significant concerns with thesubstantive provisions of the rules. A more detailed discussion of our numerous concerns is includedin the comment letter issued jointly by the Federal Reserve, the OCC, and the FDIC.Trust and fiduciary activitiesWe are most concerned with the provisions of the interim final rules that implement the statutoryexception for the trust and fiduciary activities of banks. In our judgment, these provisions wouldsignificantly disrupt the trust and fiduciary customer relationships and activities of banks. As I notedabove, trust and fiduciary activities are part of the core functions of banks, and banks have longbought and sold securities for their trust and fiduciary customers under the strong protections affordedby fiduciary laws and under the supervision and examination of the banking agencies.In light of this history, the GLB Act specifically permits banks to effect transactions in a trusteecapacity, and to effect transactions in a fiduciary capacity in any department of the bank that isregularly examined by bank examiners for compliance with fiduciary principles. To ensure that banksdid not attempt to operate a full-scale brokerage operation out of their trust department, the GLB Actestablished two limitations. First, a bank relying on the trust and fiduciary exception must be "chieflycompensated" for the securities transactions it effects for its trust and fiduciary customers on the basisof certain types of traditional trust and fiduciary fees specified in the act. Second and importantly, theact prohibits the bank from publicly soliciting securities brokerage business other than in conjunctionwith its trust activities. The Congress did not expect that these compensation requirements andadvertising restrictions would interfere with the traditional trust and fiduciary activities of banks, norwere these provisions intended to grant the SEC broad authority to regulate or "push-out" the trust andfiduciary activities of banks. In fact, the Conference Report for the GLB Act specifically states that the"Conferees expect that the SEC will not disturb traditional bank trust activities" under this exception.1The interpretation of this exception currently reflected in the interim final rules, however, wouldsignificantly disrupt the customary trust and fiduciary activities of banks and is at odds with both thelanguage and purposes of the exception. Most importantly, the interim final rules provide that a bankqualifies for the exception only if each of its trust and fiduciary accounts independently meets the act's"chiefly compensated" requirement. We strongly believe that the act's "chiefly compensated"requirement was intended to apply to a bank's aggregate trust and fiduciary activities and not on anaccount-by-account basis. An approach focused on the bank's aggregate trust and fiduciary activitiesis consistent with the nature and operations of bank trust departments and would – in conjunction withthe act's prohibition on banks publicly soliciting brokerage business apart from their trust and fiduciaryactivities – effectively prevent banks from running a full-scale brokerage operation out of their trustdepartments.The account-by-account approach adopted by the interim final rules, on the other hand, is bothunworkable and overly burdensome. First, this approach appears premised on the notion that anindividual trust or fiduciary account that engages in a significant number of securities transactionsduring a year is not a traditional trust and fiduciary account. This premise is flawed, however. It isentirely natural for a bank to engage in numerous securities transactions for a trust or fiduciaryaccount. For example, there may be numerous securities transactions for an account when a trust isinitially established and the assets provided by the grantor are initially invested or when the investment                                                     1 See H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 106-434 at 164 (1999).
4BIS Review 70/2001strategy of a fiduciary account is altered to reflect changes in the beneficiary's investment objective.An account-by-account approach also does not accommodate the complex, multi-accountrelationships that a bank's trust department is frequently called upon to establish to achieve theindividualized wealth preservation and transfer goals of its customers.The account-by-account approach also proves too much. To put this in context, a moderately sizedtrust department may have on the order of 10,000 separate trust and fiduciary accounts and a largetrust department may have more than 100,000 such accounts. Under the account-by-accountapproach adopted by the interim final rules, changes in the amount of compensation received during ayear from a single trust or fiduciary account could cause a bank and its entire trust operation tobecome an unregistered broker-dealer, thereby opening the bank to the threat of enforcement actionby the SEC and, after January 1, 2003, suits by private parties for the rescission of securities contractsentered into by the bank. Such a result is unreasonable, especially because a bank would not be ableto determine an account's compliance with the rules' "chiefly compensated" requirement until the endof a year, and then may have only a single day to restructure its operations if the compensation fromone account did not meet the rules' requirements.The proposed account-by-account approach also would impose significant and unnecessary burdenson banks. Most banks do not have the systems in place to track the various categories ofcompensation that they receive from each individual trust and fiduciary account. In order to complywith the rules, and to continue providing traditional trust and fiduciary services, banks would have toestablish complex and costly systems and procedures for monitoring the amount and types of feesreceived from each trust and fiduciary account and these costs likely would be passed on toconsumers.The Commission recognized the significant burdens imposed by the rules' account-by-accountrequirement and used its discretionary authority under other provisions of the securities laws to adoptan exemption for banks that comply with certain conditions established by the Commission. Theseconditions, however, require the bank to establish procedures to ensure that each trust and fiduciaryaccount complies with the rules' chiefly compensated requirement, effectively maintaining the account-by-account approach from which the exemption was supposed to provide relief. In addition, a bankmay take advantage of the exemption only if it significantly limits its receipt of fees that wouldotherwise be permissible under the GLB Act.The rules also impose restrictions on the trust and fiduciary activities of banks that simply are notfound in the statute and that are not consistent with the nature of the trust and fiduciary operations ofbanks. For example, although the statutory exception is, by its terms, available for all accounts wherea bank acts as trustee, the rules suggest that the SEC will review bank-trustee relationships and maydetermine that some of these relationships do not qualify for the exception. Accordingly, the rules notonly cast doubt on whether banks may continue to effect securities transactions for a wide variety oftraditional trust accounts, such as self-directed personal trust accounts and charitable trusts, but alsosuggest that the SEC intends to review and regulate the types of trust relationships that banks mayhave with customers. The interim final rules also place restrictions on when a bank will be deemed tobe acting in a "fiduciary capacity" that were not included in the statute or contemplated by theCongress.Finally, the rules interpret the statute's examination requirement in a manner that will effectivelyprevent many banks from taking advantage of the statutory trust and fiduciary exception at all. As Imentioned earlier, the Congress required that any securities transactions under the exception beeffected either in the bank's trust department or in another department that is regularly examined bybank examiners for compliance with fiduciary principles and standards. These requirements ensurethat the customer's relationship with the bank continues to be subject to the fiduciary examinationprograms of the banking agencies that have effectively protected customers for years.The interim final rules, however, allow a bank to effect transactions for a trust or fiduciary account onlyif all aspects of the transaction – including associated data processing and settlement – occur in adepartment regularly examined by bank examiners for compliance with fiduciary principles andstandards. Many bank trust and fiduciary departments outsource securities settlement and processingfunctions to a third party or affiliate, or delegate these functions to other departments of the bank toachieve cost and operational efficiencies. The customer relationship is fully protected by trust andfiduciary principles in this case, while the mechanics of the transaction are handled in the most cost-efficient manner. However, banks that have structured their operations in these ways would beprohibited by the rules from taking advantage of the exception granted by the Congress, even though
BIS Review 70/20015their relationships with customers are maintained in a trust or fiduciary department and regularlyexamined by bank examiners for compliance with fiduciary principles.In our view, the end result of these narrow interpretations and burdensome requirements is that bankswill be forced to significantly restructure their traditional trust and fiduciary activities, and some banksmay well be required to cease providing these traditional banking services to customers. In addition,customers that have chosen to establish relationships with banks will be forced to terminate theserelationships or have duplicate accounts at the bank and a broker-dealer, resulting in increased costsand burden.2 We do not believe that this was the result intended by the Congress.Custodial and safekeeping activitiesAnother of the exceptions included by the Congress in the GLB Act was designed to protect thecustodial and safekeeping services that banks have long provided as part of their customary bankingactivities. In particular, the act allows banks, as part of their customary banking activities, to providesafekeeping and custody services with respect to securities and to provide custodial and other relatedadministrative services to Individual Retirement Accounts and pension, retirement, and other similarbenefit plans.3 In this area, as well, the Commission has interpreted the exception in a manner that isinconsistent with the language and purposes of the act and that prevents or significantly disrupts thecustomary banking relationships and activities that Congress sought to preserve.In particular, as I noted a moment ago, the act explicitly permits banks to continue providing custodialand related administrative services to IRAs and benefit plans. This language was added to the billduring the House-Senate Conference to resolve any ambiguity concerning the ability of banks tocontinue to provide securities execution services to their custodial IRA customers and to benefit plansthat receive custodial and administrative services from the bank. Bank-offered custodial IRAs provideconsumers throughout the United States with a convenient and economical way of investing forretirement on a tax-deferred basis, and banks have long executed securities transactions for theseaccounts subject to IRS requirements and the supervision and regulation of the banking agencies.Banks also provide benefit plans with custodial and administrative services, including securitiesexecution and recordkeeping services, under the direction and supervision of the plan's fiduciaries.These bank-offered services allow plan administrators to obtain securities execution and otheradministrative services in a cost-effective manner, thereby reducing plan expenses and benefiting planbeneficiaries.The Commission, however, has stated that the custody exception does not allow a bank to effectsecurities transactions for its custodial IRA or benefit plan accounts. This position essentially reads theexplicit authorization adopted by the Congress out of the statute, is completely contrary to thepurposes of the act, and would disrupt long-standing relationships between banks and theircustomers.In addition, the interpretation of the custody exception adopted by the Commission would prohibitbanks from executing securities transactions for their custodial customers on an accommodationbasis. Banks, as part of their customary banking activities, have for many years effected securitiestransactions as an accommodation to their custodial clients. These customer-driven transactions occuronly upon the order of the customer and allow the customer to avoid having to go through theunnecessary expense of establishing a separate account with a broker-dealer to effect occasionalsecurities trades associated with the customer's custodial assets at the bank.In an effort to mitigate the adverse impact of these interpretations on the banking industry, theCommission proposed two exemptions that would permit small banks, on one hand, and all banks, onthe other hand, to continue to accept orders from their custodial clients. These SEC-grantedexemptions, which could be revoked or modified by the SEC at any time in the future, would not benecessary if the rules gave effect to the language and purposes of the custody exception adopted bythe Congress. Furthermore, these exemptions are subject to numerous and burdensome restrictionsthat were not contemplated by the act and that will make it difficult, if not impossible, for many banksto take advantage of the exemptions.                                                     2 The GLB Act already requires that banks send any U.S. securities trades for a trust or fiduciary account to a registeredbroker-dealer for execution. See 15 U.S.C. § 78c(a)(4)(C).3 See 15 U.S.C. § 78c(a)(4)(B)(viii).
6BIS Review 70/2001Third-party networking arrangementsThe GLB Act also permits banks to establish so-called "networking" arrangements with registeredbroker-dealers, under which the broker-dealer makes securities brokerage services available to thebank's customers. One provision of the statutory exception permits bank employees who are notregistered representatives of the broker-dealer to receive a nominal, one-time cash fee for the referralof customers to the broker-dealer so long as payment of the fee is not contingent on whether thereferral results in a securities transaction.This exception was intended to reflect and codify the arrangements that the SEC staff has sanctionedin no-action letters issued to the banking and securities industries concerning networkingarrangements.4 These letters, like the statutory exception, permit bank employees to receive anominal, one-time fee for the referral of customers to the broker-dealer, and do not attempt toestablish a rigid mechanism for determining what constitutes a "nominal" fee in every circumstance.This flexible approach has worked well for both the banking and securities industries and has not, toour knowledge, caused significant problems.Despite the success of this flexible approach, the interim final rules establish a rigid and complexapproach for determining whether a referral fee is "nominal." In addition, the rules impose, or requestcomment on, other restrictions on referral fees that were not authorized by the Congress. Forexample, the rules provide that a referral fee is nominal if it does not exceed one hour of the grosscash wages of the employee receiving the fee. By pegging permissible fees to the hourly wage ofeach employee, the rules create significant administrative problems and may conflict with state privacyrequirements that restrict access to information concerning an employee's salary. Although the rulesalso allow a bank to pay referral fees in the form of "points" in a bonus program, the rules require thatany points awarded must not only be nominal, but also must be the lowest amount awarded for anyproduct or service covered by the bonus program. Thus, for example, the points awarded for asecurities referral could not exceed the amount of points awarded for a safe deposit referral, even ifthe points awarded for the securities referral were nominal in amount.Failure to address all exceptions or adopt cure or leeway periods The interim final rules also fail to address the scope of a majority of the exceptions to the definitions of"broker" and "dealer" that were adopted in the GLB Act. Given the fact that the Board believes thatmany of the SEC's interpretations of the scope of the exceptions it has chosen to address do notcomport with the unambiguous words of the GLB Act and the legislative intent of the Congress, we areconcerned about the manner in which the SEC will interpret the other exceptions. The Board fears thatif the SEC does not adopt rules concerning the scope of all of the exceptions, it will aggressivelyinterpret some of the exceptions through enforcement actions and no-action letters, without banks andother members of the public having the opportunity to comment on these interpretations.The interim final rules also fail to provide any cure or leeway periods to banks that are attempting ingood faith to comply with the exceptions when they discover that some of their securities transactionsdo not comply with the exceptions due to inadvertent errors or unforeseen circumstances. Given thecomplexity of the exceptions, it is expected that banks that are attempting to conform their securitiesactivities to the exceptions will identify some securities transactions that do not meet the terms of theexceptions. In some circumstances, banks will not even be able to confirm that their securitiestransactions will comply with an exception at the time they are conducted. For example, banks will notbe able to confirm that they meet the "chiefly compensated" standard in the trust and fiduciaryexception until they review all of their compensation earned at the end of the year. For these reasons,the Board believes that the SEC must provide banks that have adopted policies reasonably designedto comply with the exceptions a reasonable period of time to cure any inadvertent or unforeseenviolations. This period of time must at least be long enough for a bank to establish an affiliatedbroker-dealer to which nonqualifying securities activities can be transferred.Preserving regulatory roles established by the CongressOn a broader level, we also are concerned that several aspects of the rules appear to reflect anattempt by the Commission to regulate the banking activities of banks. For example, as I mentionedearlier, the interim final rules seek to limit the traditional trust, fiduciary, and custodial activities of                                                     4 See Chubb Securities Corp., 1993 SEC No-Act. LEXIS 1204 (Nov. 24, 1993).
BIS Review 70/20017banks and would indirectly give the Commission the ability to regulate the scope and nature of theseactivities. Similarly, there is language in the adopting release concerning the networking exception thatwould appear to impose restrictions on employee bonus programs operated by banks in general, evenwhere the affected employees have no connection with any networking arrangement established witha broker-dealer.In addition, NASD Rule 3040, which is referenced in the preamble to the rules, purportedly providesthe Commission and the NASD the authority to review all the securities activities engaged in by anemployee who is both an employee of a bank and a broker-dealer, including those securitiestransactions that are conducted as part of the bank's traditional banking activities and protected byone of the GLB Act's exceptions. We anticipate that such dual employee arrangements will becomemore common, as banks seek to modify their activities to ensure compliance with the GLB Act. Webelieve that subjecting these activities, which the Congress has identified as part of the business ofbanking, to dual regulation by both the banking agencies and the SEC would be inconsistent with theprinciples of functional regulation and subject banks to unnecessary and duplicative regulation.ConclusionThe Board believes that the manner in which the bank securities provisions of the GLB Act areimplemented is critically important to the ability of banks to continue to provide high-quality bankingservices to their customers. We appreciate the steps the SEC has taken to extend the public commentperiod on the interim final rules and delay the effective date of the rules and the statute. However, theBoard believes that significant substantive changes must be made to the interim final rules so thatthey reflect the words of the statute and the intention of the Congress. The Board stands ready to workwith the SEC and the banking industry in revising the interim final rules.
BIS Review 69/20011Donald T Brash: Faster growth? If we want itAddress by Dr Donald T Brash, Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, to the “Catching theKnowledge Wave” conference, Auckland, 2 August 2001.*      *      *Fundamentally, this conference is about economic growth, and how New Zealand can get more of it.Many New Zealanders do not see increasing growth as a high priority objective. What we want is tohave access to better housing, better health-care, and better education. What we want is to protect therelatively egalitarian society of our past from increasing income disparities. What we want is moreattention paid to preserving our natural environment. What we want is less stress and more leisuretime.But the reality is that if we want better housing, better health-care and better education, we certainlyneed economic growth – we have difficulty funding our collective desire for health care and educationnow, and those costs look certain to rise in the years ahead. If we want to retain a relatively egalitariansociety, we absolutely need economic growth – without it, too many of our highly skilled people willleave our shores, forcing up the relative incomes of the skilled people who choose to stay. Perhapssurprisingly, even if we want more attention paid to preserving our natural environment, we needgrowth – international experience suggests that it is the relatively affluent countries which can afford tospend resources on protecting the environment.So a conference on economic growth is not "just about money" but concerns many of the issues ofvital relevance to all of us. It also concerns issues which go well beyond the statutory responsibilitiesof the Reserve Bank, and for this reason I must stress that my comments this morning reflect personalviews, and not necessarily those of the Bank.Our growth performance: much improvedHow have we been doing in the economic growth stakes? Unfortunately, not too well if we judge fromthe last three decades. Over that period, our growth in GDP per capita has averaged 0.8 per cent perannum, compared with an average of 2.0 per cent per annum in the countries of the OECD.1 As aresult, we have slid from 9th in the OECD "rankings" in 1970 to 20th in 1999 (comparisons made on apurchasing power parity basis, rather than at market exchange rates), and have also been wellsurpassed by some countries which are not OECD members at all (Singapore being the bestexample).As recently as 1990, New Zealand's GDP per capita was roughly on a par with Ireland's andSingapore's. By 1999, both countries had very considerably surpassed us. In 1990, Australia's GDPper capita was only some 5 per cent above New Zealand's; by 1999, it was nearly 40 per cent aboveNew Zealand's.2What should we make of these figures? The first thing to say is that for a whole range of reasons GDPper capita is not a very precise measure of human well-being. We New Zealanders have more carsper capita than people in all but a tiny handful of countries. We have substantially more EFT-POSterminals per capita than any other country in the world. We have easier access to uncrowdedbeaches and countryside than people in most other countries. We spend much less time commuting,even in Auckland, than people in many other countries. Our life expectancy at birth is the same as thatin, say, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States, and infant mortality is identical to thedeveloped country average. As Paul Carpinter recently observed, quality of life measures often showAuckland in the top ten cities world-wide3, something hardly consistent with New Zealand's beingtowards the bottom of the OECD "ladder".                                                     1 "Climbing the OECD ladder: what does New Zealand have to do?", a memo written by Grant Scobie and Peter Mawson toAlan Bollard, New Zealand Treasury, 4 April 2001.2 Ibid.3 Speech to the annual conference of the New Zealand Association of Economists, Christchurch, 28 June 2001.
2BIS Review 69/2001But having said that, there can be little doubt that there has been some relative decline in our livingstandards in recent decades.At first sight, our relatively slow growth seems surprising. We have many characteristics which makefor rapid economic growth. For more than a decade, we have had macroeconomic stability, with asound fiscal position and monetary policy delivering consistently low inflation. We have a competentand corruption-free judiciary implementing a legal system based on British common law. We have acivil service which is also competent and corruption-free. We have a stable political environment, witha substantial measure of consensus across political parties on the important aspects ofmacroeconomic policy. We are an English-speaking society, and one where people tend to be highlyreceptive to the adoption of new technology. On several indices, we are ranked among the freesteconomies in the world.And we've had an extensive period of economic reform, specifically designed to help us to grow morequickly. Doesn't our poor growth performance suggest that the reforms were seriously flawed? Not atall. I don't think there is much doubt that the reforms of the mid-eighties and early nineties have helpedour growth potential a great deal. I have mentioned the decade of macroeconomic stability – whichalso delivered a huge reduction in the net public sector debt, from over 50 per cent of GDP in the earlynineties to under 20 per cent at the present time. The reforms also delivered a very big improvementin the quality of service in areas such as banking, retailing, telecommunications, postal services,health-care, and airlines.Recent years have also seen very rapid growth in a whole host of relatively new industries – wine,mussels, software, furniture, specialised manufacturing, education services – to say nothing of a rapidincrease in the sophistication of some of our traditional industries.Moreover, while GDP per capita grew at a rate of only 0.8 per cent per annum over the last threedecades on average, it grew at almost 1.7 per cent during the nineties, virtually identical to theaverage OECD per capita growth over the same decade.4 So the reforms seem to have arrested ourrelative decline, but not, as yet, enabled us to begin the process of reducing the gap in per capitaincomes which emerged over earlier decades. We are now keeping up, roughly, but not catching up.Why have we not done better still?Given that many of our reforms were, at the time, regarded as world-beating, why haven't we donebetter? I don't think anybody has a totally satisfactory answer to that question, but let me suggest afew factors which seem relevant.First, New Zealand is a very long way from all of its export markets, and there is a growing awarenessthat this imposes a considerable handicap on our performance. As The Treasury observed in itsBriefing for the incoming Government in 1999, "Draw a circle with a radius of 2,200 kilometres centredon Wellington and you capture within it 3.8 million New Zealanders and rather a lot of seagulls. Draw asimilar circle centred on Helsinki and you capture within it a population of over 300 million, from39 countries."5 And for Helsinki, The Treasury could equally well have said Dublin or Singapore.Second, our natural resource endowment makes us extremely efficient at producing some things thatwe are effectively banned from selling to many of the consumers of the world. Thus for example,although we are one of the world's largest cheese exporters, and have developed a range ofsophisticated cheeses in recent years, we are limited to a tiny quota of about 0.6 per cent of the UScheese market. If New Zealand producers want to sell butter to Japan, they find that Japan has limitedtotal butter imports, from all sources, to less than 2,000 tonnes each year, with sales beyond that tinyquota facing a tariff of more than 500 per cent.Our distance from world markets and a resource endowment which favours the production of goodswhich face major obstacles in international markets are facts of life. To make matters worse, we havecompounded matters by creating some of our own obstacles to economic growth.For example, as a country we squandered a large amount of capital investing in projects of very low ornegative value in the late seventies and early eighties, most as a result of strong governmentencouragement – the Clyde dam, NZ Steel, and the synthetic petrol plant to name just three.                                                     4 Scobie and Mawson, op. cit.5 Towards Higher Living Standards for New Zealanders: Briefing to the Incoming Government 1999, The Treasury.
BIS Review 69/20013Second, because of very high effective rates of protection in many parts of the manufacturing sector,we probably squandered even more capital over several decades by investing in industries whereNew Zealand had no prospect of ever being internationally competitive. (Many studies have suggestedthat economic growth tends to be fairly closely correlated with the degree of openness of theeconomy, and, while New Zealand is now a very open economy, that was not true until about adecade ago.)Third, we have paid a high price for years of encouraging investment in real estate while discouraginginvestment in plant and equipment – the result of the interaction between a period of high inflation anda tax system based on the assumption that prices are stable6, plus perhaps the bitter memories of the1987 share-market crash.Fourth, we have paid a high price for not encouraging the acquisition of education and skills – theresult of decades of protection for industries requiring only a modest level of skill and, perhaps, awelfare policy providing benefits of unlimited duration.Fifth, we have paid a high price for tolerating an education system which produces too many peoplewith inadequate literacy and numeracy skills, unable to fill the jobs available in a modern economy.And we have paid a price too for disdaining commercial success, with the consequence that too few ofour youth aspire to make money growing a business and too many of our most able entrepreneurshave chosen to leave our shores. (It has to be a strange society which cheers somebody being paidmillions of dollars for a few minutes of belting the daylights out of his opponent in the boxing ring, orsomebody who wins millions in a highly regressive game of chance; but criticises somebody paid onemillion dollars for a year of running a complex company providing services to hundreds of thousandsof customers, or somebody else paid $300,000 for running a large hospital with hundreds of staff andthousands of patients.)What about the future?Can we be optimistic about the future? There are clearly some factors adversely affecting our growthrate which we can never change. Most obviously, we will always be thousands of kilometres from ourmajor markets, and it will take years before the high protection impeding our agricultural exports iseliminated. We can not avoid the fact that, as a country, we have squandered large amounts of capitalon projects which have only a minimal benefit for future growth.But perhaps the significance of our distance from major markets is diminishing as transport andcommunications systems become ever cheaper and more efficient (I suspect that there are both costsand benefits for New Zealand in that development), and barriers to our exports continue to reduce,though painfully slowly.Moreover, within New Zealand we have eliminated the protection and the subsidies which caused somuch misallocation of resources in the past. Inflation no longer interacts with the tax system to steerinvestment into real estate and out of investment in plant and equipment. And most of the other factorswhich have adversely affected our growth are ones which we ourselves can change, if only we havethe will to do so.In recent times, many political leaders have suggested that as a country we should be aiming to returnNew Zealand's income levels to the top half of the OECD. As far back as 1990, the TradeDevelopment Board, now Trade New Zealand, proposed that that goal be achieved by 2010.Would it now be feasible to raise New Zealand's per capita GDP to the median OECD level by 2010?What such a goal would imply in terms of growth rates over the next decade would clearly depend inpart on how fast other OECD countries themselves grow over the decade, but plausible numbers –which assume that other OECD countries achieve the same per capita growth rates over the next10 years as they did in the nineties – would require GDP per capita growth in New Zealand of about                                                     6It is not hard to see why a tax system that allows the deductibility of nominal interest payments in full – even when much ofthe interest paid in a high inflation environment is, in reality, a compensation to the lender for erosion in the capital value ofthe loan – but does not tax the increase in the nominal value of the asset strongly encourages people to borrow heavily toinvest in real estate in an inflationary environment. It is also the case that, in allowing deductions for depreciation based onhistorical cost and taxing profits on inventory on the basis of the historical cost of acquisition, the tax system, in aninflationary environment, over-taxes, and thus discourages, investment in other kinds of businesses.
4BIS Review 69/20013.6 per cent per annum, somewhat more than double the growth in per capita GDP achieved by NewZealand in the nineties.7Can a doubling of our per capita growth rate, as compared with the average of the nineties, beachieved? I am sometimes surprised to hear people argue that such a goal should be easy toaccomplish. Why, it is occasionally argued, some companies have grown by 10 per cent annually foryears! Even whole regions sometimes grow at rates which are well above the growth rates suggestedas being necessary to raise per capita income levels to the median of the OECD. But what is oftenoverlooked in making such comments is that a company may grow at a high rate for years because itcan absorb resources of people and capital from outside itself; regions can similarly grow rapidly byabsorbing people and capital from other areas. New Zealand as a whole may increase its gross outputmore rapidly by bringing in lots of additional people and lots of additional capital, but that increase ingross output may produce only a modest increase in the per capita incomes of New Zealanders.No, doubling the growth in per capita incomes would be extremely difficult. But perhaps it would not beimpossible. Some other small countries – Finland, Ireland, and Singapore are the most frequentlycited examples – have achieved similar or even greater increases in per capita income, but it hasbeen a very rare achievement, sometimes made possible in part by starting from a situation ofeconomic collapse (Finland), and sometimes made possible in part by being able to bring very largenumbers of unemployed people into the workforce (Finland and Ireland). Finland and Ireland alsoderived substantial benefits by being inside the European Union. We do not start from a position ofeconomic collapse, and our unemployment rate is already low compared with that in many otherOECD countries. We do not have large numbers of unemployed people with appropriate skills andattitudes waiting to leap into the workforce. We are not part of a very large market of 300 millionpeople. To have any chance of doubling our per capita growth rate we will need to see quite radicalchanges in people's attitude and behaviour, and quite radical changes in public policy to encouragethose changes in attitude and behaviour. Minor changes at the margin simply won't do the trick.Even major changes might not do the trick, since we seem to have some deeply-engrained culturalcharacteristics which are not conducive to rapid growth – surprisingly widespread disdain forcommercial success, no strong passion for education, and a tendency to look for immediategratification (as reflected in our very low savings rate and strong interest in leisure) – and it usuallytakes years, and perhaps generations, to change such cultural characteristics.Indeed, this attitudinal change is probably the most important single need if we are to radicallyincrease our per capita growth rate. We need to want faster growth or, in personal terms, higherincome. This may sound like a rather odd comment, but many of us know people who, having starteda successful business, were happy to sell out of it for a few million dollars because that was more thansufficient to buy a nice house, a bach by the sea, a boat, and a decent car. And let's not criticise thosewho make that choice – after all, economic growth is a means to an end, and not an end in itself – butrecall that retiring to enjoy the good life is not usually the attitude of entrepreneurs in the United Statesor other more successful economies.But let’s assume that most New Zealanders do in fact want to see faster economic growth, so that ourmore able children will not feel obliged to leave as soon as they can afford a one-way air-ticket toSydney or London, so that we can keep and attract able people without creating Latin-American-styleincome disparities, and so that we can afford the health-care and quality of life which our Australiancousins will increasingly enjoy.What might be required?Increasing per capita GDP is about increasing the proportion of the population who are contributing tothe production of goods and services in the market economy, and about increasing the productivity ofthose people.What scope is there for increasing the proportion of the population who are contributing to theproduction of goods and services in the market economy? Not very large. Certainly, not nearly aslarge as was the case in Ireland and Finland when they began their period of rapid growth, with veryhigh levels of unemployment. Participation in the workforce by those between 15 and 64 is currentlyaround 66 per cent in New Zealand, not far below participation rates in Singapore and Ireland (68 to                                                     7Scobie and Mawson, op. cit.
BIS Review 69/2001570 per cent) currently, and unemployment, while higher than anybody feels comfortable with, isalready approaching levels which are relatively low by OECD standards.Getting still more people into employment in the market economy may involve making some difficultsocial and political trade-offs. For example, does the present welfare system – with largely unrestrictedaccess to benefits of indefinite duration, and with a very high effective marginal tax rate for thosemoving from dependence on such benefits into paid employment – provide appropriate incentives toacquire education and skills and to find employment?Nobody that I have ever met in New Zealand wants to deny those who are temporarily down on theirluck sufficient income support to enable them to get back on their feet. In that respect, we are notwilling to pay the price which Singapore paid to achieve very high growth, a society almost devoid oftaxpayer-funded income support. But increasingly it is recognised that we will not achieve a radicalimprovement in our economic growth rate while we have to provide income support to more than350,000 people of working age – 60,000 more than when unemployment reached itspost-World-War-II peak in the early nineties – to say nothing of the 450,000 people who derive most oftheir income from New Zealand Superannuation.This is partly because of the huge fiscal costs of these transfer payments – amounting to an estimated$13 billion this financial year, or some 11 per cent of estimated GDP (both figures include the fiscalcost of New Zealand Superannuation). This cost substantially constrains the government fromdevoting more resources to education, law and order, research and development, and tax reduction.Indeed, it is probably fair to say that there is no other part of the government budget which can provideresources for these things. Certainly, it is hard to see scope for big reductions in the health oreducation budgets, the only other really major categories of government spending.But I mention these transfer payments and the very high effective tax rates faced by those trying to getoff them at this point not simply to draw attention to the fiscal costs but mainly because thesepayments have an influence on the numbers of those contributing to the production of goods andservices in the market economy.Are there ways in which we can change the incentives facing people now receiving such transferpayments? There are clearly a number of alternatives to the present way in which we provide incomesupport short of adopting a cold-turkey Singaporean approach, and there is no single "right" way ofdoing it. Could we, for example, drop all benefits to the able-bodied and scrap the statutory minimumwage, so that pay rates could fall to the point where the labour market fully clears, but simultaneouslyintroduce a form of negative income tax to sustain total incomes at a socially-acceptable level? Couldwe introduce some kind of life-time limit on the period during which an able-bodied individual couldclaim benefits from the state? Could we, perhaps, gradually raise the age at which people becomeeligible for New Zealand Superannuation, reflecting the gradual increase in life expectancy andimproved health among the elderly? One of my colleagues has suggested the idea of abolishing theunemployment benefit but introducing some kind of "employer of last resort" system, perhaps run bylocal authorities with support from central government, under which every local authority would berequired to offer daily employment to anybody and everybody who asked for it. Clearly, there would behuge benefits not just to economic growth but also to social cohesion if we were able to achieve aradical reduction in the number of those dependent on income transfers from the state.Increasing productivityBut even more important than increasing the proportion of the population who produce goods andservices in the market economy is increasing productivity. Ultimately, it is productivity – output perperson – which mainly determines the standard of living, and it is clear that increasing GDP per capitaby 3.6 per cent per annum means at least trebling the rate of productivity improvement which NewZealand has achieved in recent years (not much above 1 per cent).How might we move in this direction? Before attempting to answer that question, let me stress that,while the Reserve Bank makes a useful contribution to the economy's performance, it can never makethe difference between 1.7 per cent per capita growth and 3.6 per cent per capita growth. TheReserve Bank can and does operate monetary policy to maintain stability in the general level of prices,and that is a necessary condition if New Zealand is to maximise its growth, but it won't produce adoubling of our growth rate. The Reserve Bank can and does promote the stability of the financialsector, and that too is a vital contribution to maximising New Zealand's growth, but it won't produce adoubling of our growth rate.
6BIS Review 69/2001No, most of what now needs to change if we want to double our growth rate involves policies andbehaviour which fall well outside the Reserve Bank's areas of responsibility, as I have already noted.The second point I want to make is that it is important as we talk about all the opportunities affordedby the "knowledge economy" not to forget that for many years to come most New Zealanders will notbe employed in software companies or biotechnology research firms. They will be employed in "the oldeconomy". But that does not mean that they will be employed in industries which lack scope forimproving productivity. On the contrary: it is useful to recall that over the last 15 years, with averageproductivity improving by little more than 1 per cent per annum, productivity in agriculture improved byalmost 4 per cent per annum – a rate of productivity growth which, if achieved across the economy asa whole and sustained for a decade, would easily see our per capita incomes reach the OECD medianwithin a decade.Improving productivity involves a whole host of things which can be loosely grouped under threeheadings – improving human capital, improving physical capital, and improving technology.Improving human capitalTo improve our human capital, we urgently (I almost said "desperately") need to improve the quality ofour education system. And I say "improve the quality of our education system" rather than increase theresources devoted to our education system. We might need to increase the resources devoted toeducation, but we already spend a higher fraction of our national income on government support foreducation than the great majority of other developed countries. Despite this, international surveys ofeducational achievement suggest that we are not getting educational outcomes consistent with thishigh level of expenditure.It must be a source of grave concern that so many of the people coming out of our high schools haveonly the most rudimentary idea of how to write grammatical English; and that while Singapore, SouthKorea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong occupied the top four places for mathematics in the Third InternationalMaths and Science Study, New Zealand ranked only 21st (out of the 38 countries in the study).8 It cannot be good for our economic growth, or for the employment prospects of many of our young people,that, according to an OECD report released in April 1998, nearly half of the workforce in New Zealandcan not read well enough to work effectively in the modern economy.9 It must be a matter for particularconcern that 70 per cent of Maori New Zealanders, and about three-quarters of Pacific Island NewZealanders, are functioning "below the level of competence in literacy required to effectively meet thedemands of everyday life".10The University of Auckland is one of the two main hosts of this conference, so you would be surprisedand disappointed if I did not stress the importance of doing more to improve the quality of tertiaryeducation in New Zealand. And clearly, I believe that that is vitally important, though whether thatmeans even more public sector resources going into the tertiary sector or other kinds of reform I amnot in a good position to judge.But I strongly suspect that improvements in pre-school, primary, and secondary education are evenmore important for our long term growth, and for the long-term social cohesion of our society, than areimprovements in tertiary education. Indeed, it may well be that improvements in these pre-tertiaryareas are the fundamental prerequisites for improving the quality of tertiary education in New Zealand.But although there can be little doubt that improving our human capital by securing improvededucational outcomes would contribute to New Zealand's long-term growth, the higher-growthdividend from improved educational outcomes would almost certainly accrue well into the future, notwithin the next few years, or possibly even within the next decade. Indeed, it is sobering to reflect thatsome of the countries which have had particularly good economic growth in recent years, such asAustralia and the United States, have literacy levels not significantly higher than New Zealand's. It maywell be that better educational outcomes would be more important in ensuring that more of our peoplehave access to higher paid jobs, and thus in assisting social harmony, than in assisting economicgrowth directly.                                                     8 IEA Third International Mathematics and Science Study, 1998-1999.9 Human Capital Investment: an International Comparison, OECD, 1998.10 Adult Literacy in New Zealand, Ministry of Education, 1998.
BIS Review 69/20017Improving physical capitalOne obvious way of increasing the output per person employed is to give people more physical capitalto work with. (And by "physical capital" I mean not just plant and machinery but also roads and otherinfrastructure.) Of course, more physical capital is of no use whatsoever if it is the wrong sort ofphysical capital, and that points towards the huge importance of "getting the signals right" – by which Imean ensuring that investment takes place in areas which maximise the goods and services producedby that capital. As the Japanese have discovered in recent years, all the investment in the world willnot encourage growth if the extra capital produces few of the goods and services which peopleactually want. Happily, as I have mentioned, we now have most of the signals right – businesses areno longer encouraged by high levels of protection to invest in industries where New Zealand will neverbe internationally competitive; the financial sector is free of the regulation (and the irrationalexuberance which immediately followed the removal of that regulation) which used to distort theallocation of resources; and the misallocation caused by the interaction of inflation and the tax systemis also now a thing of the past.Under these circumstances, what might we do to encourage investment in more physical capital?At very least, we need to seek and destroy those obstacles to investment which are within our owncontrol. There is little doubt, for example, that businesses, especially small and medium-sizedbusinesses, find the compliance costs of many public sector rules and regulations a significantobstacle to more investment. The recent report of the Ministerial Panel on Business Compliance Costshighlighted these issues, and noted that complying with a multiplicity of rules and regulations stifledthe ability of businesses "to expand, innovate and compete". Businesses saw the biggest singleproblem as the way in which the Resource Management Act was being implemented, and describeddealing with that legislation as being "cumbersome, costly and complex". It should not require twoyears to get all the approvals needed to set up an early child-care facility catering for only 30 children,or ministerial intervention to cut through the red-tape involved in setting up a boat-building yard. Mostof us know similar horror stories.We may also need to look at whether there are deficiencies in our national infrastructure which areacting as a deterrent to investment. Do we, for example, need to improve the transport infrastructure insome parts of the country – perhaps in some of the areas where forests are reaching maturity byupgrading roading systems, perhaps in Auckland by completing the originally-planned motorwaysystem and by introducing more appropriate congestion charges?Could we do more to encourage investment by expanding the size of the market? If the small size andisolation of the New Zealand market discourage investment in New Zealand, should we be doing moreto encourage those with the skills and attitudes which can assist our growth to immigrate to NewZealand? Should we more vigorously seek economic integration into a much larger market? We havemade a great deal of progress through our free trade arrangement with Australia, and the bilateral freetrade arrangements with Singapore, and potentially Hong Kong and other countries in the region, aregreatly to be welcomed. But if we really want to encourage investment in New Zealand for a muchlarger market, perhaps we should be devoting every effort to negotiating a free trade arrangement andgreater economic integration with the United States also. There can be little doubt that one of themajor reasons for the recent economic success of both Ireland and Finland is their membership of theEuropean Union, as I have mentioned. A closer economic integration with the United States would notmake New Zealand any closer physically to California, but it would carry potentially enormouseconomic benefits.It is in this context that the time may have arrived when we need to give serious consideration to thepros and cons of alternative currency arrangements. Far be it from me to advocate the abolition of theReserve Bank of New Zealand and, as I have said on a previous occasion, any decision to abandonthe New Zealand dollar in favour of some other currency is finally a political decision, not a decision forcentral bankers. And frankly, I do not know whether there would be net economic benefit in adoptingsome other currency arrangement, but if we are to have a no-holds-barred discussion on how toimprove New Zealand's economic performance, one of the issues which should be looked at is this.Another matter relevant to how we might encourage more investment in physical capital is the taxregime. Do we need a substantial change in the tax structure to encourage investment in NewZealand by New Zealanders, by immigrants, and by foreign companies? And if so, what might thatchange look like? This isn't the place to go into detail, but it would probably involve a significantreduction in the corporate tax rate (it is disturbing that New Zealand's corporate tax rate is now thehighest in the Asian region). The rate of company tax is rarely the only factor determining the location
8BIS Review 69/2001of a new investment, and indeed it is not often even the dominant factor. But it is a relevant factor, andis one of the issues to look at if we are serious about encouraging more investment in New Zealand.Improving technologyAnd finally, how might we increase the growth rate of productivity, or of GDP per capita, by furtherincreasing the rate at which we adopt new technology from abroad, and develop new technology ofour own? Roger Ferguson, Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, cites research done by Fedeconomists which suggests that "the consolidated influences of information technology investmentsaccount for about two-thirds of the acceleration in (US) productivity since 1995".11 And there can belittle doubt that a radical improvement in New Zealand's productivity growth rate will require a morerapid adoption of new technology than has been the case in recent years.To some extent, we would see more rapid adoption of new technology if we saw more investment inhuman and physical capital. The three things often go together. But there are some things weprobably need to do to encourage this.To begin with, we should at least try to ensure that there are no obstacles to the development andadoption of new technology. In particular, we need to ensure that our regulatory framework does notclose off developments in biotechnology, an area where we must surely have the potential to be worldleaders. This does not, of course, mean that there should be no restrictions whatsoever onexperiments in this area, but it does mean that we should remember that every restriction has a costas well as a potential benefit, and sometimes the cost can be very substantial.Do we need to go further, by providing positive incentives to undertake research and development inNew Zealand? Our unhappy experience with governments providing incentives to particular privateactivities inevitably and rightly makes us nervous about such a suggestion, but might the "externalities"associated with research and development – the economic benefits which the individual firm can notitself capture and retain – justify an exception in this case? Recent OECD data suggest that Australianbusinesses spend about double what New Zealand businesses spend, relative to GDP, on researchand development, while those in Ireland spend about three times as much, those in Finland spendabout six times as much, and those in Sweden spend about nine times as much. Even allowing forsome over-statement arising from businesses having an incentive to re-classify expenditure as R & Dwhere there are tax benefits from doing so, New Zealand businesses seem to be spendingsubstantially less on R & D than do businesses in other successful economies.12Do we need to take steps to encourage the adoption of new technology by encouraging a moreentrepreneurial, a more risk-taking, culture? At a minimum we may need to try to make entrepreneursfeel more loved – if not our only national heroes at least among our national heroes! We also need tofoster an understanding of financial matters, and an interest in business activities, in our schools,through programmes such as those run by the Enterprise New Zealand Trust.We need to consider whether the personal income tax structure provides appropriate encouragementto entrepreneurial New Zealanders to stay in New Zealand, and encouragement to entrepreneurialpotential New Zealanders to come here. Our top rate of personal income tax is not particularly high bythe standards of other developed countries, but it cuts in at a level of income below that in manycountries and our tax system allows relatively few deductions. Compared with the rapidly growingeconomies of Hong Kong and Singapore, our top rate of personal income tax is very high.Perhaps we also need to think of some more innovative moves in the tax area. The United Kingdomattracts many entrepreneurial people from all over the world to live and work in that country byexempting from UK tax all income generated outside the UK for people not born in the UK. Iunderstand that Switzerland effectively "negotiates" the tax to be paid by wealthy foreigners who wantto live in Switzerland. It may be no accident that many entrepreneurial New Zealanders have moved tothese countries in recent years.Another idea was suggested in the discussion paper issued by the McLeod Committee recently,namely establishing a maximum amount of income tax to be paid by any individual during the course                                                     11 "The productivity experience of the United States: past, present, and future", a speech at the US Embassy in The Hague, 14June 2001.12 A new economy? The changing role of innovation and information technology in growth, OECD, 2000, page 29.
BIS Review 69/20019of a year. The McLeod Committee suggested that that might be $1 million.13 Even a maximum of$500,000 per annum would be more than enough to cover 10 times over the cost of public serviceslikely to be used by a person paying that much tax, but would be a level of tax which would seem veryattractive to many expatriate New Zealanders and other entrepreneurial people in the US, Europe andAsia, from whom we are currently collecting no tax revenue at all. I strongly suspect that establishingsuch a maximum would actually generate significantly more tax revenue for the New Zealandgovernment than the present tax structure does.Yes, it would offend our traditional New Zealand values to waive income tax once $500,000 had beenpaid, but what if very few current New Zealand residents pay more than $500,000 in tax each year?And if such a regime encouraged 1,000 entrepreneurs to come to New Zealand and the governmentwere to gain, say, an extra $500 million a year in tax revenue to finance more early-childhoodeducation and tax incentives for research and development, who amongst us would be worse off?Indeed, the likelihood is that such an injection of entrepreneurial drive might well play a major role inchanging the rate at which New Zealand business adopted new technology, and so in improving thegrowth in New Zealand productivity.More savings?Before concluding, let me talk briefly about the role which increased national savings might play inhelping us to increase New Zealand's economic growth rate. "Briefly" because I am not at all surewhat role national savings play in economic growth in a world where capital is free to move fromcountry to country. We know that Japan has one of the highest savings rates in the world, but has hadone of the worst growth records in the developed world for more than a decade. We know that theUnited States and Australia have had rather low national savings rates in recent years, but bothcountries have grown strongly. We certainly know that savings which are channelled into investmentswhich yield little or no growth are of no benefit.On the face of it, our own national savings performance has been poor over several decades, and thathas been reflected in persistent balance of payments deficits over more than a quarter of a century –and very high private sector levels of indebtedness to foreign savers as a result. We know that,because of our heavy dependence on the savings of others, a significant fraction of the total outputproduced within New Zealand now accrues to those foreign savers. We know too that we probably allpay somewhat higher interest rates than would otherwise be the case because of the risk premiumwhich foreign lenders charge as a result of our heavy dependence on the savings of others.But even if we were sure that improving our savings performance was a vitally important ingredient inimproving our growth performance, or our standards of living more generally, nobody knows for surehow best to do that.In recent years, successive governments have sought to contribute to an improved national savingsperformance by running fiscal surpluses, though there is no certainty that that increases nationalsavings in total – the possibility is that increased public sector savings may be offset by reducedprivate sector savings, perhaps because of enhanced public confidence that taxpayer-fundedretirement income is assured.What about special tax incentives for retirement saving? Alas, there is little evidence that suchincentives have any significant effect on national savings – to the (limited) extent that they increaseprivate sector savings, they may well simply produce an offsetting reduction in public sector savings(because of the reduction in tax revenue required to provide the incentives). They also tend to be quiteregressive, in that most of the benefit of the incentives goes to those on the highest incomes, whomight well be savers even without the incentives.It is possible that some form of mandatory savings scheme might produce an increase in nationalsavings. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that Singapore's breath-taking savings performance overseveral decades is related to the very high level of mandatory savings required by that country'sCentral Provident Fund. But on the other hand, it is not yet entirely clear that Australia's more modestmandatory savings scheme is having a marked effect on Australia's savings performance, although itis clearly having an effect on developing a pool of institutional savings.                                                     13 Tax Review: Issues Paper, June 2001.
10BIS Review 69/2001On balance, I would probably be a supporter of some kind of mandatory savings scheme as onecontribution to improving our growth performance. But the case is not yet conclusively proven, and Iwould prefer to see more informed debate on the subject (as distinct from the substantially ill-informeddebate of the kind we saw when this matter was last on the public agenda in 1997).One thing is clear however: we can not afford to lament the extent of foreign investment in NewZealand, and more generally the extent of our dependence on the thrift of foreign savers, unless weare also willing to save more ourselves. Our high level of dependence on foreign capital, year afteryear, is simply the other side of our lousy savings performance.ConclusionMr Chairman, let me conclude by reminding you that we have some huge advantages in terms ofeconomic growth – macroeconomic stability, a substantial measure of consensus on economic policyacross the political spectrum, a competent and corruption-free judiciary and bureaucracy, anEnglish-speaking population. After some decades of growing substantially more slowly than otherdeveloped countries, we have recently picked up our growth performance and during the ninetiesachieved per capita growth at a rate closely similar to average growth in other OECD countries.There are, therefore, plenty of reasons to be optimistic. Getting ourselves back to around the middle ofthe OECD pack in terms of GDP per capita within a decade – indeed, even within two decades – willstill be a major challenge to all of us. Fortunately, our history suggests that we thrive on majorchallenges.
BIS Review 68/20011Sakuya Fujiwara: Challenges for Japan’s economy and monetary policyRemarks by Mr Sakuya Fujiwara, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan, at the ForeignCorrespondents’ Club of Japan, Tokyo, 25 July 2001.*      *      *IntroductionI am honored and grateful to have been given this opportunity to address members of the ForeignCorrespondents’ Club of Japan.Given the present economic situation and that members of this esteemed Club are well known for theirbarrage of sharp questions you may think it brave of me to address you. But I immediately acceptedthe Club’s invitation without any hesitation because I saw it as a golden opportunity to candidly explainthe difficulties the Bank of Japan is facing under the current severe economic situation.As you are no doubt aware, there are various arguments in Japan regarding the management ofmacroeconomic policy and how to promote structural reform. Until the first quarter of this year, furthermonetary easing and how to promote the disposal of non-performing loans had been activelydiscussed almost every day. Indeed, many held that Japan’s economy could only get out of thestagnant state if monetary easing were effected or if non-performing loans were disposed of. Sincelate April, following the formation of the Koizumi government, structural reform has taken center stageand a ‘basic plan’ which proposes wide-ranging reform agenda was determined by the cabinet at theend of June.Looking back at all the numerous discussions within only the past six months, the central issue hasbeen whether to first effect macroeconomic policies such as monetary policy and fiscal policy orimplement structural reform measures which include the disposal of non-performing loans,deregulation, and review of roles between the public and private sectors.However, these points have been repeatedly discussed since the bursting of the bubble and thus arenot new. The question of what kind of policy measures are desirable in order to bring Japan’seconomy back to a sustainable growth path is not one that can be easily answered, especially whentaking account of the political economy. The difficulty lies in that you simply cannot make a clear-cutdecision and choose either macroeconomic policy or structural reform. Today, I will explain my viewson the roles monetary policy and structural reform should play under the current harsh circumstances.1.Current monetary easing measuresAs a starting point, I will explain current monetary easing measures.Current monetary policy managementAs you all know, the Bank of Japan took successive monetary easing measures during February toMarch this year, and the March decision was a decisive one. There are three points whichcharacterize this series of monetary easing measures.First, the Bank changed the main operating target of monetary policy operations from theuncollateralized overnight call rate to the outstanding balance of current accounts held at the Bank ofJapan. In addition, the Bank increased the average outstanding amount of such accounts by about25% from some 4 trillion yen to 5 trillion yen.In response to this ample provision of funds, nominal short-term market interest rates declined tovirtually zero percent. In addition, if considered necessary for the smooth provision of liquidity, theBank will increase its outright purchase of long-term government bonds from the previous 400 billionyen per month subject to certain conditions.Second, the Bank has clearly stated that it will continue to pursue the new monetary policy frameworkuntil the Consumer Price Index registers stably a zero percent or an increase year on year. This aimsat guiding longer term interest rates to decline by promising the continuation of monetary easing intothe future, and is thus often called the ‘commitment effect’ or ‘policy duration effect’.
2BIS Review 68/2001Third, the Bank introduced a ‘Lombard-type lending facility’, through which the Bank extends loans atthe request of counterparties under certain conditions at the official discount rate. Thanks to thisfacility, even when there is turmoil in the market, counterparties can flexibly borrow funds from theBank as long as they have eligible collateral. As a result, the official discount rate shoulders a new roleof setting a ceiling to the short-term money market rate. This facility plays a big role in nurturing asense of security among market participants with respect to their financing and also stabilizes interestrates, thus strengthening the effects of monetary easing.Effects of monetary easingThese monetary easing measures, unprecedented in central bank history both at home and abroad,were received with considerable surprise when announced. Though such initial surprise tends to fade,these monetary easing measures have potentially powerful effects as is evidenced by the initialsurprise. At the same time, however, it is also true that there are limits to the effects. We hope that allconcerned will correctly and with balanced judgement recognize both the favorable effects and thelimits of current monetary easing measures.Let me begin with the favorable effects of the current measures. Since monetary easing in March,various interest rates have substantially declined to levels below the lowest levels seen during thezero interest rate policy period. For example, the overnight call rate is 0.01%, the yield on 1-yeargovernment bonds 0.01-0.02%, and that on 5-year government bonds once declined to 0.3% and hasrecently been just over the 0.4% mark. Yields on 10-year government bonds have been moving at thelow level of 1.1-1.4%. In addition, the difference between the yield on corporate bonds or CP andyields on government securities, namely the ‘credit spread’, has also been narrowing, implying acontinual improvement in fund raising through the market.As such, there is abundant liquidity in financial markets. What typically reflects such abundant liquidityis the phenomenon of ‘under-subscription’ for Bank of Japan operations to provide liquidity to themarket. For example, in competitive yield auctions on May 21st to provide liquidity, while the Bankoffered one trillion yen, financial institutions’ bids were less than 400 billion yen even at a rate of0.01%, virtually zero percent. In other words, under-subscription is an expression of financialinstitutions’ views that “liquidity has already been provided sufficiently so that there is no need foradditional liquidity even at the rate of 0.01%.” Under-subscription was frequently observed from thebeginning to the middle of May, and the Bank responded to such situations by reducing the unit forevery bid to 0.001%. As a consequence, the lowest interest rate the Bank would accept was alsoreduced to 0.001%, and, thanks to such efforts which some market participants have termed‘nano-technology’, under-subscription ceased thereafter. However, this does not guarantee thatunder-subscription will not occur again in the future. In any event, liquidity is being amply provided tomarkets and discussion is now geared toward focusing on the marginal difference between 0.01% and0.001%.Limits to monetary easing measuresSuch experience also implies that there might be a practical limit such that a central bank cannotunlimitedly provide liquidity beyond the demands of financial institutions.Despite such a practical limit, there would be no problem if liquidity reached corporations which resideoutside the financial markets and contributed to rejuvenating economic activity, but regrettably this hasnot been the case so far.Let me quote some plain numbers which typically illustrate this. In the last five years, current accountdeposits which private financial institutions hold with the Bank of Japan increased 12% on anannualized basis. The expectation here is that developments in such accounts affect the creditcreation function of financial institutions. Monetary base, which is the sum of Bank of Japan currentaccounts and banknotes issued, increased as high as 8% a year. However, despite such extremelyample liquidity provision from the Bank, the lending of commercial banks declined by half a percent ayear and money supply grew only 3%.The decline of bank loans compared with the increase in money supply means, on the part of financialinstitutions, that assets other than loans have been increasing, which turned out to be mainlygovernment bonds. Despite the increased provision of liquidity by the Bank of Japan to the moneymarket, financial institutions only increased investment in credit risk-free government bonds andlending to firms rather declined. As such, under the circumstances where the credit creation function
BIS Review 68/20013of financial institutions is inactive, economic activity cannot be robust, as evidenced by nominal GDPgrowth of only 0.6% a year and the Consumer Price Index being almost flat. Such figures illustrate thefact that even if the Bank of Japan provides ample liquidity to the market and guides nominal interestrates to an extremely low level of virtually zero percent, such action itself cannot lift economic activity.Keynes once used the term ‘liquidity trap’ to point out the possibility that the effectiveness of monetarypolicy might be hampered, and the current state of Japan’s economy is quite close to such a situation.Policy duration and quantitative easingHowever, even though Japan’s economy is in a situation close to a liquidity trap, a central bank cannotbe a bystander when the economy is anticipated to deteriorate further. Against this backdrop, theBank thus took decisive monetary easing measures in March.In this regard, let me bring your attention to two points.First is the rationale behind having the outstanding balance of Bank of Japan current accounts as themain operating target and increasing it.The target of increasing the outstanding balance of current accounts to around 5 trillion yen issubstantially more than required reserves of around 4 trillion yen. As previously mentioned, undersuch ample provision of liquidity, short-term interest rates will move close to zero percent undernormal circumstances.In addition to a decline in interest rates, it is hoped that the quantitative increase in Bank of Japancurrent accounts itself will have positive effects. If financial institutions hold excess no-risk no-returncurrent account balances, an incentive will emerge to increase the holding of such assets as loans,corporate bonds, stocks, and foreign currency-denominated assets which generate some returns eventhough accompanied by some risk. In addition, the quantitative increase itself might affectexpectations of the public. Of course, under a situation where both long- and short-term interest ratesare quite low and the credit intermediation function of financial institutions is also hampered, sucheffects might not be large. However, under the circumstances where room for a further decline ininterest rates is almost exhausted, and bearing in mind the severe outlook for the economy, the Bankjudged it necessary to dare decide to take such measures.Second is the commitment effect.As I previously mentioned, the Bank of Japan adopted a policy which incorporated a so-called ‘policyduration effect’ in that the Bank is committed to continuing monetary easing into the future. Thisshould be regarded as best efforts in a situation where the central bank is trying to hammer out furthermonetary easing effects despite conventional monetary policy instruments having almost beenmobilized to their limit. With such a commitment in place, the public’s expectations with respect towhen prices will start to rise will be adjusted if the economy further deteriorates. In such a case, thepublic will anticipate that monetary easing will surely be protracted, leading to a more flattened yieldcurve, thereby strengthening monetary easing effects. As such the current commitment can be said tohave a sort of automatic adjustment function against changes in economic conditions.2.Role of structural reformAs such, while potentially powerful monetary easing has been in place both in terms of interest ratesand quantity, it is essential to resolve structural problems facing the financial system and industry inorder to allow such monetary easing to permeate the real economy to the fullest extent possible.Structural reform is, put simply, to establish a function which more effectively allocates resources suchas labor and both physical and financial capital, and raises productivity of the economy as a whole.The content of structural reform will be shaped from now on and at this juncture points of emphasisdiffer. Here, I will not go into specific measures in any depth but take up two points with respect to thebasic thrust of structural reform.Importance of expectationsThe first point is what are the conditions for successful structural reform. There could be various waysof looking at this, but my view is that the key for successful structural reform is how to positively affectthe expectations of economic agents.
4BIS Review 68/2001At present, the expectations of firms and households are bearish. When I say we have to work onsuch expectations and change them I mean we have to restore a situation in which economic agentscan hold such a normal expectation that the economy will grow in the future. However, theexpectations of private economic agents are far from being in a normal state. Making a rough back-of-the-envelope calculation, if the expenditure of firms and households increased an additional 2%, thennominal GDP growth would be 2% higher. According to a household survey, the monthly consumptionexpenditures of the average Japanese household in fiscal 2000 was 317,000 yen, so a 2% increasewould be about 6,000 yen. And, taking account of the multiplier effect, the expenditure necessarywould be less. But things are not so simple.How expectations are formed is a difficult question. For example, while it was realized that the ITboom in the US would eventually come to an end, relatively bullish views were still dominant until lastautumn. In fact, at the last November meeting of the FOMC, which is responsible for setting the short-term interest rate, inflationary concern was pointed out as a potential risk factor for the US economyrather than economic weakness, and it was in November that private forecasters revised theirforecasts downward. Subsequently, the FOMC has on successive occasions since Januarysubstantially reduced its target FF rate, though it has not yet succeeded in revitalizing the activities ofIT-related firms which once drove bullish expectations. Looking back at the experience of Japanduring the bubble period, the expectations of economic agents became extremely bullish, to an extentwhich seems incredible in hindsight, and now we are facing a completely opposite situation.Then, how do the expectations of firms and households become bullish?At this moment, I do not have a clear answer. But if one believes bullish expectations naturally emergewhen an economy grows, then I think the key is simply to make efforts to raise productivity. Measuresto this end were outlined in the cabinet’s ‘basic plan’ for structural reform which was announced thisJune. What is important is to make clear that emphasis will be on market mechanisms, that the publicunderstand that the government is directing its efforts toward increasing productivity of the economyas a whole through such mechanisms, and implementing policy measures consistent with such adirection.Speed of structural reformThe second point concerns the speed of structural reform.In this regard, economists abroad have voiced concern that if various structural reforms areimplemented simultaneously, there would be a substantial deflationary impact on the economy in theshort run and the deflationary gap in Japan’s economy, which is already suffering from lack ofdemand, might become wider.We can certainly understand the background to such concern. Indeed, looking at examples ofstructural reform overseas, there seem to be many cases where there was a deflationary impact in theshort term. And, in contrast with the US and UK, the economy cannot expect to receive additional‘dividends’ such as a substantial decline in long-term interest rates accompanying fiscal consolidation,since in Japan there is little room for any further decline in interest rates. However, the bond market isnot the only market which assesses structural reform. If the stock market favorably evaluates specificefforts toward the resolution of structural problems, there might be positive effects on the economyfrom this channel even in the short run.Moreover, it should be noted that, in the case of Japan, delay in effecting structural reform has madethe problem of weak demand all the more serious.In this context, I would like to refer to the fact that private consumption has been very slow to increase.Of course, various factors might be behind this, one being uncertainty with respect to pensions andthe tax burden in the future because of the rapidly aging population. Therefore, in order to stimulateprivate consumption, it is essential to reduce future uncertainty as much as possible.According to textbook Keynesian economics, the expansion of fiscal expenditure financed by theissuance of government bonds will stimulate an economy unless taxpayers hold back consumptionreflecting expectations of a future increase in the tax burden. However, if public investment generatedby a fiscal deficit is inefficient, production capacity of the economy as a whole will not increase and the‘wealth’ which generates future income and consumption will not accumulate. And, if such investmentclearly suggests an increase in the future tax burden and delay in structural adjustment, then it wouldhave an adverse impact on current consumption.
BIS Review 68/20015From this viewpoint, once it became clear that the content of fiscal expenditure was going to be shiftedfrom less efficient to more efficient objectives, resulting prospects of an increase in future ‘wealth’might have a favorable effect on the economy. Compared with a situation where there is little room tomobilize conventional monetary policy instruments, room for effecting policies which focus more on the‘quality’ of fiscal expenditure seems to be significantly large, as mentioned in the ‘basic plan’.Nevertheless, what I have just said does not mean that I am optimistic enough to consider that thepromotion of structural reform will immediately ignite an improvement in the economy. Presumably, inthe process of reform, we cannot deny that there might be ‘pains’ such as increased bankruptcies andheightened unemployment in the short run. However, at the same time, it is not appropriate to singleout and emphasize only the short-term deflationary impact on the economy from among the variousmacroeconomic effects of structural reform. In short, as long as protracted stagnation of Japan’seconomy is rooted in structural problems, we are now at a stage where it is not so productive todiscuss in general terms whether structural reform is deflationary or not. What is important is, basedon specific structural reform measures which will be presented in the future, to make a well-balancedassessment with respect to the economic consequences of such measures.3.Relationship between structural reform and monetary policyI have explained the roles of monetary policy and structural policy, but what is the relationshipbetween these roles? Some would say that pains stemming from the adverse impact on the economyas structural reform progresses should be mitigated by further monetary easing, or emphasize that inthe process of pursuing structural reform it is mainly the role of monetary policy to ensure economicstability. Bearing these views in mind I will now explain how I see the relationship between monetarypolicy and structural reform.At the start I would like to say that the monetary easing policy currently being pursued by the Bankwill, because of effects I have previously explained in detail, also give considerable support tostructural reform.First, the current monetary policy framework was determined by taking into account a scenario that theeconomy might substantially deteriorate, including a short-term deflationary impact stemming fromstructural reform. In the process of discussion to reach the monetary easing decision in March,because of cyclical adjustment in IT-related areas worldwide coinciding with Japan’s structuraladjustment, I could not help but forecast that the economy would worsen considerably in the future.Based on this recognition, I felt strongly, from the viewpoint of forward-looking policy making, that itwas necessary to make moves ahead of the foreseeable economic developments and to vote fordecisive monetary easing.Second, even if deflationary pressure intensifies in the short run as a result of structural reform,current monetary policy has an automatic adjustment function such that the easing effects strengthenthrough the policy duration effect.Third, in the process of structural reform, liquidity concerns might increase in financial markets whennon-performing loans are disposed of. In this regard, the previously mentioned Lombard-type lendingfacility will have the effect of driving structural reform by containing such liquidity concerns.And fourth, when corporate and household confidence with respect to the future strengthens andeconomic activity picks up parallel with the progress of structural reform, current monetary easing willprovide very strong support. Put differently, the benefits of recent decisive monetary easing willsurface in full when the private sector decides to take advantage of the opportunities.While the relation of the current monetary policy framework with structural reform is such as I have justmentioned, if I dare to add one more thing, it is that when I voted for monetary easing in March, I didso with the strong hope that since we are stretching ourselves almost to the limit in adopting suchdecisive monetary easing measures, structural reform ought to be implemented expeditiously. I had astrong feeling such that we should exert some leadership in promoting structural reform efforts invarious areas. Looking back, it seems that this desire for structural reform was, and is, also held by thepublic. Viewed from conventional monetary policy thinking, such a view might be regarded asunconventional, but I have no doubt that decisive monetary easing has contributed to the progress ofstructural reform.
6BIS Review 68/20014.Central bank responsibilitySo far I have discussed the roles played by monetary policy and structural reform. In the last part ofmy speech, I would like to address the issue of central bank responsibility by considering theargument that since Japan’s economy is in such a worrisome state the Bank of Japan should mobilizeall measures at its disposal even if they might not be the choice in normal times.When we consider the outlook for the economy, as shown in our April Outlook and Risk Assessmentof the Economy and Prices, there are various risk factors. Bearing in mind every possible eventuality,including these risk factors, the Bank of Japan will carefully examine, without any presumptions, theeconomic outlook and pursue appropriate monetary policy. This is the responsibility that a centralbank should discharge.At the same time, in terms of monetary policy management, it is also a responsibility of a central bankto underline the fact that it has almost exhausted such conventional monetary easing measures asreducing nominal interest rates. The reason I say this is because when listening to debate concerningmonetary policy, we are somewhat puzzled that many seem to consider that interest rates can befurther substantially lowered. Of course, even at the current level where nominal interest rates arevirtually zero percent, we have managed to devise ways to create monetary easing effects. However,such efforts have obvious limits. Among various monetary policy options proposed, some argue thatthe Bank can freely increase money supply at its discretion as if raining money from the sky. However,as evidenced by figures I have previously introduced, this is not the reality.Then, how should we address the assertion that since both inflation and deflation are monetaryphenomenon, it is only the Bank of Japan which can prevent a price decline. As one who considershow actual monetary policy should be conducted by watching actual economic developments, I have avery mixed feeling when I hear such a view.For sure, if one takes an extremely long period of time, the relationship between goods and services,and the quantity of money will be a major factor in determining the price level. The fact that pricestability is the goal of the Bank of Japan’s monetary policy is based on such an understanding.However, at the same time, it is also true that the price level will be considerably affected in the shortand medium term by various factors such as costs and changes in productivity.In fact, the Bank of Japan has eased monetary conditions to the utmost both in terms of interest ratesand quantity such as current accounts at the Bank of Japan and monetary base. In addition, as notedin our March statement, current monetary easing was determined to illustrate the Bank’s firmdetermination to prevent prices from declining continuously. However, as figures I previouslymentioned show, so far the effects of monetary easing have not been able to lift economic activity andprices continue soft. Our agony as monetary policymakers lies exactly here.Now, if we focus solely on raising prices and pursuing monetary operations such as buying any type ofasset, then prices will eventually start to rise, though we cannot say when for sure. However, it isuncertain whether such a price rise would lead to sustainable economic growth. The questions wehave to answer are: Would such extraordinary measures be desirable for Japan’s economy as awhole? Would they be consistent with the pursuit of price stability that contributes to the sounddevelopment of the national economy, which is the Bank’s mission as stated in the Bank of JapanLaw?Of course a central bank always has to be open-minded in examining new policy measures. In fact,both at the time of adopting the zero interest rate policy and decisive monetary easing in March, Ibelieve the Bank adopted an innovative posture. At the same time, however, we cannot make a quickdecision to pursue extreme policy when the effects are uncertain simply because some think it isbetter to do something than nothing.For example, while an increase in the outright purchase of government bonds by a central bank mighthave some effects, if it induced market uncertainty with respect to future fiscal discipline, it would leadto an interest rate rise by way of increase in risk premiums and thus entail a risk of having an adverseimpact on the economy. In fact, when looking at the recent development of long-term interest rates,they often sensitively responded to views concerning the future issuance of government bonds suchthat they rose recently reflecting budget discussions. Of course, such a recent rise in interest rates canbe regarded as within the range of extremely low interest rates and thus we do not have to worryabout any adverse impact on economic activity. However, it is necessary for a policymaker toremember that market participants are sensitive to uncertainty over future fiscal management andresulting bond supply and demand conditions.
BIS Review 68/20017In March, the Bank decided to increase its outright purchase of long-term government bonds ifdeemed necessary for the smooth provision of liquidity, on the condition that the outstanding amountof long-term government bonds held by the Bank be kept below the outstanding balance of banknotesissued. And this decision was arrived at by taking full account of what I have so far mentioned.In sum, it is because monetary policy has entered uncharted territory that responsible policymakersare required to conduct a careful examination of all the possible favorable effects and side-effects ofall likely policy responses. In doing so, it is important to recognize that, with increasingly globalizedfinancial markets, policy in Japan is exposed to harsh assessment by market participants both athome and abroad. In this sense, in conducting monetary policy, not only policy action such asindividual policy measures but also the principle behind every policy action becomes important. In away, such principles might constitute policy.At present, as production is declining substantially reflecting a fall in exports, economic adjustmentsare intensifying. Needless to say, the Bank of Japan will continue to carefully examine overalldevelopments in the economy, including adjustments in IT-related areas and the effects of structuralreform, and conduct appropriate monetary policy. At the same time, I would like to emphasize that,during such process, ensuring monetary policy credibility as a whole becomes critical for realizingsustainable economic growth.Thank you for your attention.
BIS Review 67/20011David Clementi: Debt workouts for corporates, banks and countries: somecommon themesSpeech by Mr David Clementi, Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, to the INSOL InternationalSixth World Congress held at the Hilton Metropole Hotel in London on 19 July 2001.*      *      *IntroductionI am delighted to have the opportunity to speak at this, the Sixth World Congress of INSOLInternational. The Bank has a long-standing interest in insolvency arrangements. As the keepers ofthe London Approach, we have a direct, if informal, role in corporate workouts. This is in parthistorical, but it is no accident. Development of a satisfactory framework for corporate workouts isintegral to the Bank’s core purposes of maintaining financial stability and seeking to ensure theeffectiveness of the UK financial system. The Bank is more commonly associated with the MonetaryPolicy Committee and the pursuit of monetary stability. But financial stability is an important corollaryto this; it is difficult to achieve one without the other. The Bank in particular is closely involved with thedesign of regulation and financial infrastructure, such as payments and settlement systems, to ensurethat these are robust and the system is, as a result, better able to withstand a crisis. Our interest ininsolvency arrangements is similar. Without a framework that is predictable, equitable and transparent,designed to maximise value for all interested parties, the costs and wider economic disruption fromunnecessary corporate liquidations may be enormous.My speech this morning, therefore, provides an opportunity to signal the Bank’s support for INSOL’smission to take a leadership role in international insolvency and credit issues and to bring aboutgreater international co-operation among the main players. The growing interest by a number ofinternational organisations in the design of orderly and effective corporate insolvency regimes, and inthe encouragement of greater co-operation in cross-border corporate insolvencies, suggests you havebeen successful in that objective. I think this has been greatly assisted by the important work whichthe INSOL Lenders Group has been co-ordinating in developing a set of principles governingcorporate workouts at the pre-insolvency stage.But corporate workouts represent just one strand in financial restructurings more generally. There aretwo others I want to cover; and these are, first, restructurings of financial institutions, including banks,and, second, sovereign debt workouts. Indeed, in many instances, restructurings in the corporatesector will need to proceed in tandem with those in the financial and sovereign sectors. I would arguethat, in all three cases, a collective approach by the different participants in the private and publicsectors, and effective co-ordination among creditors and debtors, should help to preserve value. So Iwould like to consider today the extent to which these differing approaches raise common themes, andalso whether there are distinguishing features which could affect the interactions between the threestrands.I recognise, of course, that more progress has been made in the corporate context than in the area offinancial institutions or sovereign debts; and I think that reflects great credit on many individuals andorganisations represented at this Congress. So I will start by offering a few thoughts on corporateworkouts, linking these to the Bank of England’s long-standing involvement in the London Approachand our responsibility for the maintenance of financial stability. I will then turn to look at how thedesirable features, incorporated into the agreed principles governing international corporate workouts,might be applied to financial restructurings; and finally in a similar way look to whether these principlescan be carried across into the field of sovereign workouts. This raises the issue of the role of thevarious different parties to debt restructurings, including the official sector. By drawing out somecommon themes, I hope to put INSOL’s work on the corporate sector into the broader context ofdiffering approaches to resolving debtor difficulties.Corporate workoutsLet me start then with corporate workouts; and let me begin by saying a few words about the Bank’sinterest in this issue. As I noted a moment ago, it arises mainly from our financial stabilityresponsibility, although I would argue that our role in promoting the efficiency and effectiveness of thefinancial system is also relevant. Episodes of incipient or actual financial instability are often
2BIS Review 67/2001accompanied by failures in the corporate sector which may lead more generally to losses throughoutthe financial system. In some cases, the corporate failures reflect an inability to resolve temporaryliquidity problems affecting a company that remains viable in the longer-term. Creditors may actwithout the benefit of all available information on a company’s solvency. This imbalance in informationavailable to company and creditors can be compounded by conflicts of interest between different typesof creditors, or between banks, bondholders and other financial institutions. The end-result is often thesame: the unnecessary liquidation of viable companies, which represents a market failure capable ofamplifying financial instability. That, in a nutshell, explains the Bank’s interest and involvement in thisarea.A country’s insolvency regime should seek to limit the costs arising from potential market failure, forexample by supporting effective private sector mechanisms for reorganising viable companies. I wouldsay it should do so partly by providing incentives for debtors and creditors to negotiate workouts at thepre-insolvency stage. This will hopefully reduce the risk of unnecessary corporate liquidations andavoid benefiting one group of creditors at the expense of others.Most of you, of course, will know that, guided by these principles, the Bank took the lead in developinga framework governing corporate workouts in the 1980s and early 1990s – the ”London Approach” or”London Rules”. We are not jingoistic about this; we are equally supportive of variants whether HongKong Guidelines or Jakarta Initiatives. We draw the line, however, at Aussie Rules; references toAustralian sports jangle a few nerves at the Bank! In any case, ”rules” is definitely the wrong word,since the London Approach has no legal or statutory backing – it is merely an informal codification of aset of practices that had come to be widely accepted in the vast majority of large corporate workoutsundertaken in the UK in recent years. This includes arrangements for an informal standstill while anindependent review of the company’s long-term viability and financing needs is carried out. But what isperhaps less well-known is that, in developing the London Approach, the Bank built on a tradition ofinvolvement in industrial restructuring dating back to the 1920s. Indeed, a cursory glance atR S Sayers’ excellent history of the Bank from 1891-1944 reveals that Montagu Norman’s involvementin corporate restructuring in the inter-war period probably took up more of his time than any of hisother duties, often to the consternation of some of his more conventional colleagues!Since the recession of the early 1990s, and reflecting the more stable macroeconomic conditions inrecent years, the Bank’s direct participation as a mediator in corporate workouts has declined. We do,however, remain willing to take on that role again if invited to do so and where this appears necessaryto help resolve the potentially conflicting problems of a company’s creditors. Where we have tried toadd value in recent years has been in promulgating the London Approach abroad and in working todevelop the framework in the light of recent innovations and developments in global financial markets.Several issues have loomed large. One is the applicability of the unanimity requirement given theproliferation in the number and type of creditors in any large international workout. Another is the lackof a formal moratorium over all or part of the period of resolution of a company’s problems, as distinctfrom the informal standstill of the London Approach during the initial period of collecting all availableinformation and evaluating the company’s long-term prospects. More broadly, the extent to which theApproach is affected by developments such as securitisation, loan trading and credit derivatives isexercising our minds and those of others closely involved in corporate workouts.These issues raise potentially very tricky questions. For example, loan trading arguably makes thecreditor co-ordination problem more challenging, but at the same time provides an exit route for thoseunwilling to be involved in the restructuring and an entry for specialist turnaround investors.Credit derivatives raise a different set of issues, because they need not involve transfers of thecompany’s debt until, in the case of physical settlement, a credit event occurs. The knowledge thatdebt will change hands following a credit event might, however, affect the incentives facing thecompany, its ”pre-credit event” creditors and its potential ”post-credit event” creditors in unpredictableways. One possibility is that a bank which has purchased credit protection via a credit derivative mayhave an incentive to put an ailing company into liquidation in order to obtain a payment from itscounterparty rather than participate in a restructuring, the results of which are uncertain. For manybanks, such an approach would be incompatible with building banking relationships, but the recentdebate as to whether restructuring, rather than failure, constitutes a credit event for the purposes of acredit derivative contract shows the matter is highly topical. At the very least, active markets in creditderivatives and secondary loans might make it more difficult to identify and organise creditors in orderto negotiate any debt workout.
BIS Review 67/20013These are, as I have noted, awkward issues. But I am encouraged to see that the INSOL LendersGroup has attempted to address some of them in the course of drawing up its Statement of Principlesfor a Global Approach to Multi-Creditor Workouts. I am also encouraged that discussions on thePrinciples involved not only the largest global banks, but also a range of other finance providers,including insurance companies, institutional investors, hedge funds and secondary market debtproviders. As the Governor noted in providing the Bank’s endorsement of the ILG’s initiative inOctober 2000, past experience suggests that a collective approach by the major creditors to a debtorcompany in financial difficulties can help to preserve value, to the benefit of the creditors as a wholeand of others with an interest in the company. Although I know there have been tricky issues toresolve in the negotiations – notably those relating to the standstill, debt trading and the provision ofnew money – in the end, the Principles seem broadly consistent with the London Approach, based asthey are on the enlightened self-interest of all the creditors. Ultimately, although some debt providersmay be able to gain in individual cases by striking out on their own, in the long run a co-operativeapproach will ensure greater recoveries for creditors, including bondholders, in aggregate.Just as greater international co-operation can produce net gains at the workout stage, so that needs tobe backed up by greater co-ordination in cross-border corporate insolvencies. That is why wewelcome the UNCITRAL Model Law on cross-border insolvencies, which, as most of you will know,has been implemented into UK insolvency law. The Model Law is consistent with the UK insolvencyregime and contains many helpful provisions relating to co-operation between insolvency courts indifferent jurisdictions, and to the granting of recognition to foreign insolvency practitioners. We wouldtherefore urge other countries to enact the UML.In this context, we also welcome the ongoing work by international organisations, including the IMFand World Bank, on the design of efficient and effective insolvency regimes worldwide. It is, of course,difficult to establish international standards in this area, because the approaches adopted by differentcountries reflect not only different legal traditions but also different policy choices, most especially onthe extent to which the system should favour debtors or creditors. Indeed, this is a debate that is live inseveral countries, including the UK where new measures were announced last month in the Queen’sSpeech, and I am sure is occupying minds at this Congress. But the IMF work argues, rightly in myview, that any insolvency regime, whether debtor- or creditor-oriented, will enhance financial stabilityeffectively only if it protects value for the benefit of all interested parties and the economy in general;and this requires the allocation of risk among market participants to be done in a way that ispredictable, equitable and transparent.Financial sector restructuringsLet me turn now to my second area: financial sector restructurings, and I would like to start by notingthe importance of confidence in the smooth running of a financial system. Confidence is important inmost industries, but it is at the heart of the financial industry. It is confidence that permits banks tooperate, as a matter of course, with gearing many times capital, and with a maturity mismatchbetween their assets and liabilities, often concentrated in short-term or sight deposits. They are thuspeculiarly vulnerable to a loss of confidence, individually and as a group. The potential forcontagion – the threat that trouble in one bank will result in a run on others that might endanger thesystem as a whole – makes monitoring banks’ solvency and liquidity a core activity for central banks.Whether responsible day-to-day for supervision or not, central banks still need to stand ready to act aslender of last resort. However, any such operation must be carefully considered. Any decision tosupport an institution, particularly in circumstances of underlying insolvency, creates a moral hazardthat undermines market discipline. Designing effective arrangements for restructuring financialinstitutions is thus a particular challenge – there is a need to act quickly and finally; intermediatearrangements are much more difficult to sustain.The challenge is complicated by the degree to which financial markets are now global and financialgroups operate in a number of different jurisdictions. The G30 report on international financialinsolvencies, published in March 1998, raised several themes that are rather similar to those relatingto cross-border corporate insolvencies. In particular, it emphasised that a close degree of internationalco-operation was necessary to prevent the disorderly failure of a bank or insurance company.Effective co-operation would help to bring about a reorganisation or if necessary an orderly disposal ofassets, and avoid the delays, uncertainties and loss of value often associated with formal legalproceedings. If the financial institution does fail, in my view some of the provisions of the Model Law,
4BIS Review 67/2001especially those relating to judicial cross-border co-operation, are potentially helpful in providing astarting point for negotiations.There used to be a clear distinction between banks and securities houses, fund management andinsurance, and financial institutions of different nationalities. Restructuring could be to some extentcontained within one market or one jurisdiction. Now the distinctions between different markets andtypes of firm have become blurred and the increasing consolidation of financial groups has given riseto a range of large complex financial institutions or LCFIs. Restructuring one of these groups would befar from straightforward. The steps involved with winding up an LCFI have been the subject of recentdiscussion among central banks. This has involved not only co-ordination and information sharingarrangements but also how the wider risk to the system would be assessed in these circumstances.Winding up a firm on this scale could be a large undertaking in itself. But the wider repercussions interms of dislocation of markets could be enormous.Thankfully, as yet, we have had little if any experience of restructuring or winding down an LCFI. Aswith corporates, however, the first step would be an assessment of the long-run viability of theinstitution prior to the restructuring. This will determine whether liquidity support to the LCFI may bejustified, or whether it should be closed, in much the same way as the independent review in acorporate restructuring will determine whether the company should be reorganised or liquidated. Withfinancial institutions, the time available to make an assessment and reach a decision on providingsupport may be limited.Other common themes in the two strands are the need for co-operation between all the relevantparties, based on full exchanges of information, and the need for equitable treatment of similar classesof creditors, investors and depositors. It may also be possible to envisage, in the winding down orrestructuring of an LCFI, the authorities playing a facilitating role in a private sector solution, raisingparallels with the Bank’s role in the London Approach.There has, as yet, been little in-depth exploration of the linkages between corporate sector andfinancial sector restructurings. I believe that efforts to explore the complementarities between the twoapproaches would reap dividends. A well-designed corporate restructuring framework, byrehabilitating viable companies facing short-term problems, should maximise the value of creditors’claims if it preserves the going concern value of the companies. By providing for an orderly recognitionand allocation of losses, it should also improve banks’ ability to assess the value of impaired assetsand determine the appropriate level of loan loss provisions. As the IMF has noted, this shouldencourage more accurate and predictable pricing of distressed claims, assisting the development of adeeper secondary market in which financial institutions can trade distressed claims and therebytransfer loans to specialist turnaround investors.Of course, some of these complementarities may be difficult to exploit in countries, especiallyemerging market economies, in which banks are facing major problems arising from their corporateloan books. Banks with inadequate loan loss provisions and low capital ratios may be reluctant toparticipate in corporate workouts, because they may then be forced to recognise actual losses. Therole of the public authorities is often crucial in such cases. In practice, bank restructuring programmeshave often transferred distressed corporate sector debt to separate government agencies. Indeed, thishas happened in recent years in some G10 countries, notably the US, Japan and Sweden. This canlead to tensions between maximising short-term debt recoveries to limit the public costs of bankrecapitalisation and preserving longer-term corporate value. Effectively, the public authorities mayliquidate companies prematurely, in an effort to secure immediate cash recoveries, when alonger-term restructuring of these companies might be a more effective way to preserve value in boththe corporate sector and the wider economy, including the banking sector. To avoid this conflict,corporate and banking sector restructurings need to be more effectively co-ordinated. I would arguethat this can lead to synergies by facilitating the rehabilitation of viable companies in a mannerbenefiting all the creditors – including the public authorities – in the longer term.Having said all that, there is no doubt that financial restructurings and insolvencies do contain severaldistinguishing features compared with corporate reorganisations, besides the importance ofconfidence with which I started. Indeed, that probably explains why much of the debate on the ModelLaw is on whether its principles can be applied to the insolvencies of banks and other financialinstitutions. Different views on this meant that the Law had to contain an effective opt-out for banksand insurance companies. I would certainly agree that depositors or policyholders are in a differentposition from ordinary creditors. They are likely to have less information, be greater in number, and beless well organised to recover their assets than professional creditors. So any application of corporate
BIS Review 67/20015workout and insolvency principles to international financial insolvencies would have to allow fordepositor and policyholder protection schemes.The role of supervisors would also, of course, need to be recognised explicitly. In particular, theprinciples underlying corporate workouts and insolvencies would have to be consistent withinternationally recognised principles of banking and insurance regulation. In the EU framework, thatrequires consistency between cross-border corporate sector initiatives such as the Model Law and ILGPrinciples and the EU passport system and principle of home state responsibility for banking andinsurance supervision. Relevant EU directives would also need to be taken into account.All this strengthens my view that although synergies should be realised through consistency in theapproaches to corporate and financial sector workouts, we need to recognise that banks (andinsurance companies) are different. I have noted that, in corporate insolvencies, countries may differ inthe extent to which their legal and statutory arrangements favour the debtor or the creditor. But theywill also differ in the extent to which their insolvency laws embody a universal or territorial approach tocross-border insolvencies. Exactly the same distinction is relevant in an international financialinsolvency. In the ”single-entity” approach, a bank with branches in several jurisdictions will be woundup according to universal principles, so that creditors and depositors worldwide are entitled to an equalclaim on the bank’s worldwide assets. By contrast, a ”separate-entity” (or ”ring-fencing”) approach toliquidating an LCFI proceeds according to territorial principles, so that creditors and depositors of anindividual bank branch in a particular jurisdiction take precedence in the distribution of all the LCFI’sassets within that jurisdiction, before the local liquidator is authorised to turn over any excess assets tothe home country liquidator.This implies that, in both corporate sector and financial sector insolvencies, banking supervisors andinsolvency practitioners will be subject to varying legal responsibilities that may make the co-ordinationproblem more difficult. I would argue that initiatives such as those of the ILG and UNCITRAL are moreconsistent with the spirit of a universal approach. In fact, I would go further and suggest that theapplication of these initiatives to international financial restructurings and insolvencies is only possible,in all respects, if a country adopts a single entity approach to the liquidation of international banks.Continued adherence to separate entity approaches could therefore make it more difficult to achievegreater consensus on the principles governing cross-border corporate workouts and internationalfinancial insolvencies.Sovereign debt workoutsI would now like to stray into even more uncharted territory and turn to my third area, sovereign debtworkouts. I hope I have already said enough to clarify that the establishment of an effective frameworkgoverning the relationships between non-sovereign debtors and their creditors provides a means ofinvolving the private sector in the resolution of financial crises. But how does this relate to the currentvery live debate about private sector involvement (PSI) in sovereign debt workouts? The potentiallinkages between the three strands of financial restructurings are amply illustrated by the Asian crisisof 1997-98, which involved widespread defaults by the corporate sector on both its domestic liabilitiesand its obligations to foreign creditors. This impacted not only on the banking sector’s balance sheetsand capital positions, with further feedback effects on the corporate sector, but also on the sovereignsector, through its need to involve itself in bank recapitalisation and corporate sector restructuring. Ontop of that, there were contagion effects on public and private sector holdings of sovereign debt at atime when public finances in many countries were themselves deteriorating independently.I think it is important to appreciate that the existing framework governing sovereign debt workouts inemerging market economies (EMEs) evolved in a world where official financing dominated and privatefinancing was provided by a relatively small number of developed country banks. But private claimsnow outweigh official claims on the major EMEs – by a ratio of 70:30 in recent years. And theseprivate claims are increasingly to bond investors rather than banks – direct and portfolio investmentflows now dwarf bank lending as a source of finance for EMEs. Bondholders are dispersed and oftenanonymous, so there are potentially greater creditor co-ordination problems. To contain the potentialsystemic consequences of future crises, both the public and private sectors have an incentive todevise a new framework that can deal more effectively with sovereign debt workouts, and mostespecially with the role of PSI, when private claims, particularly bondholdings, are substantial.This is very similar in kind to the challenge of adapting the London Approach, whose original principleswere most relevant where the creditor group largely consisted of a fairly small group of relatively
6BIS Review 67/2001homogeneous banks, to a world where creditor groups had become much more disparate andinternational, involving large numbers of bondholders and other financial creditors. It seems sensible,therefore, to consider to what extent the sovereign sector can borrow from the ideas11 discussed bythe ILG and others in developing principles governing multi-creditor global corporate workouts that aremore appropriate to modern financial markets.I take considerable encouragement from the fact that, in recent months, a number of different privatesector groups have published views on ”best practice” principles that might underlie sovereign debtworkouts. Although there are inevitably differences between the various groups, in all cases acollaborative framework to facilitate negotiations and co-operation between a sovereign debtor and itscreditors, and also to overcome possible co-ordination problems between different creditor groups,seems to be envisaged. These general principles seem to me to have much in common with thethemes underlying the ILG’s corporate workout principles. They also include several other suggestionsto enhance creditor co-ordination, such as the inclusion of collective action clauses in bond contractsand, more widely, the use of ”creditor country clubs” as a conduit for information exchanges.The key to all this is, in my view, the creditor co-ordination issue. A failure of creditor co-ordination inthe sovereign context can lead to cancellation of longer-term investment projects and protractedexclusion from international capital markets. The private sector groups argue that, when a sovereignencounters financial difficulties likely to trigger a debt default, it should encourage a process ofdialogue between the affected creditors and the sovereign. That should involve co-operation tofacilitate a full exchange of information and analysis relating to the current financial situation andprospects of the sovereign. This will be easier if the country has already taken the necessary action toimprove data availability and transparency and to meet relevant IMF data standards and codes. Thereis a close parallel with the way in which corporate and financial sector restructurings are governed byindependent reviews based on full exchanges of information on the corporate’s or bank’s financialposition. In both cases, it is essential that those analysing the debtor’s financial position (the IMF in thesovereign context and the independent accountants in a corporate case) are able to distinguishbetween different types of default. More effective monitoring should improve the discipline on thedebtor and facilitate the extension of more lending by the private creditors in both cases.Another area where sovereign debt workouts could borrow from corporate and financial restructuringsis in possible recourse to a neutral mediator, charged with facilitating a co-operative creditor solution.In the sovereign context, one possible facilitator might be the IMF. It would certainly have theresources and expertise to do the job, although one possible drawback is that the IMF, unlike anarbiter in a corporate workout, will sometimes itself have claims on the debtor, in this case thesovereign. And this raises a separate issue of whether, or in what circumstances, the IMF mightprovide financial support during a sovereign debt workout – so-called lending into arrears. Such anapproach would have to be designed to limit the moral hazard implications, incorporating strictconditionality. But it can be useful as a means of supporting a country as it takes remedial policyaction through bridging finance.The issue of the standstill is, as many of you will know, controversial in the sovereign context,notwithstanding the fact that an informal standstill plays a crucial role in corporate workouts. Voluntarydebt rollover agreements with creditors or bond restructurings are, I believe, useful aspects of effectivePSI. But historical experience of involuntary sovereign debt standstills, in the form of paymentssuspensions, has not exactly been encouraging – the process has often been inefficient andinequitable. Nevertheless, there are circumstances in a sovereign debt crisis where the immediatepayments relief provided by a standstill may make an important contribution. An example would bewhere capital flight is pervasive because immediate policy adjustment is insufficient to bring aboutadequate voluntary private sector refinancing.In these circumstances, a standstill may realise the same advantages as in a corporate workout if itprovides breathing space for remedial policy measures to be evaluated and put in place; if it promotescreditor co-ordination and avoids unjustified creditor preference by treating creditors of the same typeequitably; and if it provides incentives to both creditors and debtors to reach a voluntary arrangementsooner rather than later. That is a lot of ifs and, as I have noted, a further provision is that if thestandstill is supported by IMF lending into arrears, it would need to be subject to strict conditionality.But again these conditions could usefully borrow from the corresponding provisions attached tocorporate workout standstills. In both cases, the standstill should be subject to a strict time limit; itshould allow for a full release of all relevant information from debtor to creditors on a timely basis; itshould facilitate equitable treatment of similar types of creditors (for example through the formation of
BIS Review 67/20017bank creditor and bondholder committees); it should provide for the seniority of any new money; andabove all it should deliver the rapid presentation of a restructuring plan to creditors.What this means is that any sovereign debt standstill would need to be orderly, efficient, equitable andexpeditious. Easier said than done, of course, especially given the fact that generally no singleorganisation represents the disparate group of private creditors. But, as with corporate workoutstandstills, the key is to reduce the incentives for creditors to rush for the exits.Of course, some have argued that attempts to negotiate a standstill could have the opposite effect, inother words they could prompt a rush for the exits. But longer-term investors benefit from country runsbeing forestalled, so the net effect might be a beneficial switch from short-run to long-run investors.Others have suggested that standstills create moral hazard and alter debtor incentives in the processby undermining the primacy of debt contracts. But, as I have noted before, a well-designed frameworkfor sovereign debt workouts, involving a voluntary standstill where that is thought to be helpful, mightbe no more likely to provide perverse incentives for sovereign debtors to default than insolvency lawdoes for corporate debtors. But it would have to be clear that the standstill option would be usedsparingly and in tightly-defined circumstances; otherwise, it could be self-defeating.Having highlighted all these common themes, I could be accused of wearing rose-tinted spectacles if Idid not also acknowledge that there are important distinguishing features between sovereign andcorporate workouts. Unlike a company, a sovereign, of course, cannot be liquidated. Public policyapproaches to crisis management recognise that there is an argument for sovereign debt restructuringin cases where the crisis arises from poor performance and policy. In such cases, as more generally,crisis management will involve a careful combination of official finance, policy adjustment by thedebtor and PSI. This is rather different to the corporate case, where the creditors might well decide toliquidate, rather than restructure, a company whose problems arose solely from poor management.The lack of a corresponding insolvency law back-up in the sovereign case might mean that theincentives to repay are weaker, and that the moral hazard effect inducing a voluntary default is morecommon, than in the corporate case.Such factors might be compounded by other differences between the corporate and sovereignframeworks, including the lack of collateral (or the means to acquire it) underlying sovereign debt, andthe greater uncertainties in the sovereign case on issues such as creditor seniority, assessing ongoingdebt sustainability and burden sharing. This latter point also raises the thorny issue of Paris Clubcomparability, which could be regarded as imposing a form of involuntary PSI on the private creditors.The sovereign case will also generally be subject to political factors that are simply not present in thecorporate case.The uncertainties surrounding these questions explain why progress has been slow in devising aframework governing sovereign workouts that is capable of commanding widespread support. Ibelieve there is great scope in developing such a framework to draw heavily on the principlesgoverning corporate and financial sector restructurings, where they are relevant, withoutcompromising the distinct features of sovereign workouts. I am pleased to see that this seems to bethe approach being taken by the various private sector groups, and I wish them well in their efforts.ConclusionLet me try to bring my remarks to some conclusion. In a financial system that has become ever moreglobal and inter-connected, central banking increasingly involves spotting linkages betweendevelopments in different countries, sectors or markets. Usually this is a matter of identifying anddealing with threats before they emerge. But there is also an opportunity to take ideas developed toaddress one set of problems and apply them elsewhere. I have tried to give you a flavour of thesynergies that I believe exist in debt workouts affecting, first, companies, then financial institutions andfinally sovereign countries. But I hope I have also not underestimated the difficulties in realising thosesynergies, especially as the number and type of players involved in workouts has increased.Significant progress towards a global approach to corporate workouts has been made, however,thanks to the efforts of many of you. I am convinced that this has laid the foundations for furthermoves towards more effective frameworks governing bank and, especially, sovereign debt workouts.Thank you.
 BIS Review 101/2001 1 Bruno Gehrig: Review of the Swiss economy: end-of-year media news conference Introductory remarks by Prof Dr Bruno Gehrig, President of the Swiss National Bank, at the End-of-year Media News Conference, Zurich, 7 December 2001. *      *      * Financial markets characterised by economic slowdown Development on the financial markets during the current year was characterised by a surprisingly significant weakening of the economy affecting all the major economic regions around the world. The slowdown was most pronounced in the US, but Europe is experiencing a considerable setback in growth as well. Inflationary pressure, already weak, thus eased further. The central banks took advantage of the rapidly increasing flexibility and lowered their key rates, in some cases down to historical lows. Up until the middle of the year, the prevalent opinion in the financial markets was that - buoyed by the Fed's marked interest rate cuts - the US economy, along with the global economy, would stage a fairly swift recovery from the deterioration in the technology sector and the associated weak investment activity. For this reason, the second quarter was characterised by a recovery on most stock markets, increasing bond yields and a US dollar defying gravity. By mid-year it became clear that the cyclical decline was likely to be more serious and to last longer. This reversal of opinion led to investors gradually becoming more risk averse. Equities portfolios were regrouped and invested in the money market and in bonds. Growing pessimistic sentiment vis-à-vis the economy led to lower capital market yields, declining stock valuations and a weaker US dollar. The general pattern of activities on the financial markets was and still is characterised by a marked parallelism in price fluctuations. On the one hand, this is a reflection of the synchronisation of the current and expected economic development which has been apparent for several quarters and which in turn leads to parallel monetary policy reactions. On the other hand, the widespread globalisation of capital market processes has considerably intensified - at the expense of country-specific differentiations - the impact of the valuation factors effective worldwide. The shock of 11 September The attack of 11 September hit the world economy and the financial markets in a state of instability. It did not trigger any new trends, but magnified developments which were already under way. Business and consumer confidence suffered a severe blow, which further dimmed economic prospects in the US and in Europe. The sudden increase in risk aversion led to drastic corrections on all major stock exchanges and to a veritable flight into the Swiss franc. The record highs the Swiss franc reached on 21 September went in tandem with the stock markets hitting record lows. In response to the rapid and marked appreciation of the Swiss franc, we cut interest rates in an extraordinary move on 24 September. Following this step, and in the course of a broader normalisation of the financial markets, the euro rebounded somewhat vis-à-vis the Swiss franc. Our currency nevertheless remained strong against the euro. At the end of November, it was quoted at 3.5 % above its average rate during the first eight months of the year. The euro-Swiss franc rate was somewhat more volatile as well. Its volatility in additional currencies now stands at about the same level as previously against the D-mark. On the stock markets, a distinct corrective movement set in even before the end of September. Meanwhile, most stock indices are above the level obtaining on 10 September. Bond yields have increased a little in the last few weeks as well. Both effects can be interpreted as a sign of renewed optimism concerning the economic development in the medium term. In the days after the terror attacks, the resiliency of the financial system was put to a test never before described or even considered in any emergency plan. Payment transactions in US dollars were affected directly. Faced with the possible breakdown of individual banks and parts of the system which are crucial for carrying out transactions, the Federal Reserve - by way of the discount window - pumped massive amounts of liquidity into the system. On the basis of a swap agreement, the European Central Bank supplied banks in the euro area directly with dollar liquidity. The National Bank 
 2 BIS Review 101/2001 was in close touch with the Swiss banks and - should this have been necessary - we would have been in a position to lend support as well. The demand for Swiss franc liquidity also rose sharply. Naturally, we made the necessary amounts available to the full extent. As was to be expected, it became evident that only a part of this liquidity was needed, and we were able to reabsorb it through repo transactions as early as 12 September. On the two days following the attacks, repos totalling approximately Sfr 40 billion were turned over. The experiences gained in the aftermath of 11 September have shown three things. Firstly, that the financial system - even in this unique and completely unexpected situation - still managed to function relatively smoothly. Different players contributed to this, but it was mainly the banks themselves which supported one another with creative flexibility in the interest of the situation as a whole. Secondly, our repo system enabled us to take the necessary steps without problems. Had we still been dependent on foreign exchange swaps with US dollars, conducting monetary policy under the given conditions would have been eminently more difficult. Thirdly, these experiences prove how vulnerable the highly integrated global financial system really is. They clearly underscore that securing the stability of the financial system must constitute an important part of the role of central banks. The Swiss franc on the foreign exchange and capital markets We do not expect that the introduction of euro cash, which is upon us in a little less than a month, will have any significant impact on the financial markets. However, it will be interesting to see if, to what extent, and in what areas people in Switzerland will use the euro as a means of payment. Certain structural effects of the euro have already become evident for quite a while, for example on the primary bond market, where the Swiss franc is losing in weight while the euro capital market is enjoying growing popularity due mainly to its excellent liquidity. According to the survey conducted by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) for the trading days of the month of April, the trading volume in international foreign exchange transactions dropped by nearly 20% within three years. Another contributing factor to this development was the advance of electronic trading and the discontinuation of trading between the euro's predecessor currencies. Roughly 6% of all global foreign exchange transactions include the Swiss franc. This share still amounted to 7% three years ago and to just over 8% nine years back. The fact that the Swiss franc has lost relative significance in foreign exchange trading is probably largely attributable to institutional conditions for trading in additional currencies having improved. By far most of the Swiss franc transactions were effected against the US dollar. This currency pair was traded approximately five times as frequently as the Swiss franc-euro pair. This volume ratio, however, is likely to be subject to strong fluctuations depending on specific exchange rate developments. At any rate, the National Bank will be pleased to see the historic, special role played by the Swiss franc as a foreign exchange trading currency continuing to diminish.

 BIS Review 101/2001 1 Niklaus Blattner: Review of the Swiss economy: end-of-year media news conference Introductory remarks by Prof Dr Niklaus Blattner, Member of the Directorate of the Swiss National Bank, at the End-of-year Media News Conference, Zurich, 7 December 2001 *      *      * 11 September 2001: a test for the global financial system For a number of years now so-called systemic risks have received increasing attention from the central banks and from banking and financial market supervisory authorities. In extreme circumstances, systemic risks may ultimately lead to a breakdown of the financial system. They have their origin either in a transmission of liquidity and solvency problems between banks and other financial service providers or in the fact that numerous market participants are simultaneously affected by the same non-diversifiable risks. Examples of such risks are sudden, widespread and massive losses in the value of financial assets (stock market crash), serious malfunctioning of major financial market infrastructures, large-scale natural disasters or terror attacks which obstruct markets and market participants in economic or technical and physical respects. The consequence may be a substantial disruption of economic activity. The damage caused to the affected economies is liable to be correspondingly large. The terror attacks of 11 September 2001 hit the central nerve of the global financial system - New York, the major trading centre for the world's leading currency and the preferred location of the international banking and financial services industry. Allow me to recapitulate the consequences in a few words: various banks, stock brokerage firms and securities houses lost part or even all of their staff, their business premises, their backup facilities and their lines of communication. The markets remained closed on the following day, the equity markets even until the end of the week. From a systemic point of view, of even greater consequence than the closing of the equity market was the fact that the two markets for US government paper and for commercial paper, the main vehicles for short-term liquidity equalisation between market participants, had ceased to operate. Payment and settlement systems started to break down. Securities and credit balances totalling billions were thus blocked at some banks while lacking at others. Even though the terror attacks were concentrated on New York and Washington, in the beginning they not only paralysed Wall Street but they also threatened to undermine significant parts of the international financial system. It is much too soon, and this is not the proper place, to make an assessment of the profound human, social and political implications of the terror attacks. The resilience of the banks and the financial markets must be emphasised, however. A week after the attacks, business was almost back to usual again. In most cases, the banks and securities houses affected managed to solve their problems, some of which were immense. Neither a stock market crash nor a breakdown of parts of the financial system set in either in the United States or anywhere else. It was precisely under the extreme pressure that the financial system proved its stability. The market participants mastered the crisis situation spontaneously and networked their efforts: for example, the tasks that would normally have been performed in downtown Manhattan were carried out in New Jersey or in London. Or they agreed to extend the settlement period to five days and to conclude general money market trades at the official Fed rate (instead of fixing prices via brokers, some of whom could not be reached due to the collapse of technology). Furthermore, market participants practised restraint in stock sales and abstained from taking personal advantage of the general state of emergency. Creditors, notably the banks, also endeavoured to fulfil merely implicit commitments as far as possible and to ensure the functioning of the markets. All this would not have been possible without the tireless creative and networked efforts of thousands of shocked and grieving staff of the enterprises concerned and of the international financial community. The private measures for overcoming the crisis were also actively supported by the central banks, first and foremost by the Fed, which had fully retained its capacity to act from the outset despite being located in the immediate vicinity of "Ground Zero". It injected additional liquidity into the market and allowed the rate for one-day repos to fall to 1%. It also opened its counters to foreign banks operating in the United States and, when necessary, offered foreign central banks one-month dollar swaps. In particular, the Fed communicated clearly from the very beginning that it would meet the increased requirements for dollar liquidity at any time. 
 2 BIS Review 101/2001 Against this background it is not surprising that the terrorist attacks on the United States failed to seriously impair the functioning capacity of the financial markets either in Switzerland or in the rest of Europe. Even though the global financial system had been hit in its very core, the extensive transmission of problems that was theoretically possible did not take place. This is not least due to the fact that the institutions concerned on both sides of the Atlantic comported themselves in an appropriate manner, as did the central banks. The biggest immediate problem for some Swiss banks is likely to have been the inability to act of a major correspondence bank in New York that was hit by a simultaneous power failure in the main supply and the backup system. In such cases, liquidity requirements soar. The Fed's generous supply of USD liquidity to the market also benefited Swiss banks. We did not, however, observe a similarly higher demand for Swiss franc liquidity. Nevertheless, the Swiss National Bank was, of course, present in the CHF money market. (Cf. the remarks of Bruno Gehrig.) For the time being, I would sum up the situation as follows: 1. The terror attacks of 11 September 2001 did not succeed in destabilising either the US part of the international financial system or those of the rest of the world. 2. The banks and financial markets have overcome the shock of the terror attacks with impressive flexibility, creativity and with a measure of solidarity that commands respect.  3. The central banks, i.e. the US Fed, the European Central Bank and all the other central banks including the Swiss National Bank fulfilled their task as lenders of last resort in times of crisis. 4. The crisis management was facilitated by the fact that the banks, the markets and financial market infrastructures in general were in a sound condition at the time of the terror attack. Their liquidity and solvency provided them with a good basis for successfully passing the extreme "stress test" to which the international banking and financial systems were subjected.  5. This underlines the significance of banking and financial market supervision on both levels of intervention assigned to them, i.e. both in the micro-prudential as well as in the macro-prudential field. While the former primarily serves to secure the banks' solvency, the latter has the task of upholding the liquidity and functioning capacity of the payment systems and of financial market infrastructures in general.  6. The next step is to work through all the events of 11 September and their consequences rapidly and carefully. Even though we have obtained proof of the stability of the global financial system, we cannot simply carry on as though nothing had happened. Lessons must be learned and defensive measures, both on the financial industry and central bank levels, i.e. in banking and financial market supervision, must be further improved.  7. The events of 11 September have strengthened all the parties' awareness of the extent of international integration in a crisis situation. While the benefits of international cooperation have so far been undisputed, at least theoretically, empirical evidence has now been provided. Cooperation among the authorities in the various countries on the level of the Bank for International Settlements, the relevant committees of central bank governors of the Group of Ten and the International Monetary Fund is to be intensified.  8. A current example of such efforts can be found in the payment systems sector. Any strains on the financial system can spread rapidly as a result of the international integration of participants as well as of payment and settlement systems. Increased attention must be paid to devising and linking systems such as Switzerland's SIC (Swiss Interbank Clearing) and the planned CLS (Continuous Linked Settlement) among others.  9. Further problems which must be dealt with in particular by the private financial industry concern the inadequate geographic diversification of production locations and backup facilities, which have proved less than satisfactory in some cases.  
 BIS Review 100/2001 1 Edward M Gramlich: Asset prices and monetary policy Remarks by Mr Edward M Gramlich, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the New Technologies and Monetary Policy International Symposium, Bank of France, Paris, 30 November 2001. *      *      * During the past several years, changes in asset prices have attracted considerable attention from the public, from economic researchers, and from monetary policymakers. That attention is well deserved: Recent changes in asset valuations have been enormous, and they appear to have had substantial effects on the economy. The observation that asset prices influence macroeconomic performance is hardly new. Undergraduate macroeconomic textbooks generally teach that increases in wealth should boost household spending and that increases in stock prices should stimulate business investment. Moreover, a growing body of empirical evidence at both the aggregate level and the level of individual households and businesses supports these basic presumptions. But while progress has been made, I believe that our understanding of the empirical relationships and of the theoretical underpinnings of those relationships still remains incomplete. My remarks today will cover three topics. First, I will discuss the available empirical evidence from the United States on the effect of changes in asset prices on household consumption and business investment. Second, I will highlight a few aspects of the relationship between asset prices and household spending that I believe merit further research. Third, I will review how monetary policy has responded to asset price fluctuations among other elements of the economic environment in the United States during the past few years. Empirical evidence on asset prices and spending At the aggregate level, a wealth effect on consumption has been a mainstay of large-scale econometric models for at least thirty years. The forecasting model in use at the Federal Reserve Board in the early 1970s incorporated a 5-1/2 cent increase in consumption for each dollar of additional wealth. The econometric model of the U.S. economy in use today at the Federal Reserve Board includes a wealth effect as well, although somewhat smaller in size. Not all researchers agree, but most statistical studies suggest that an additional dollar of household wealth leads, over time, to a permanent rise in household consumption of about three to five cents. An important question for both economists and policymakers is whether households’ net worth summarizes all of the information about their balance sheets that is useful in predicting their spending, or whether a decomposition of net worth into various asset and liability categories can improve forecasts of their spending. Unfortunately, this question has proved difficult to answer. Today I will focus on the possibly different influences of equity wealth and housing wealth, although other components of balance sheets may be important as well. In the current version of the Federal Reserve’s econometric model, the estimated marginal propensities to consume out of stock market and other wealth are virtually indistinguishable. However, I would not want to exaggerate the ability of either the data or our statistical tools to pinpoint these separate influences, and at times in the past, the model’s estimated marginal propensity to consume out of non-stock-market wealth has been nearly twice as large as the marginal propensity to consume out of stock market wealth. Moreover, some recent research conducted outside the Federal Reserve argues that the marginal propensity to consume out of housing wealth likely exceeds the marginal propensity to consume out of equity wealth. The relationship between wealth and consumption as reflected in the Fed’s model has certainly had some real-world analogues in the past few years. For instance, sales of luxury goods such as jewelry and expensive automobiles were very brisk in the late 1990s, with reports indicating that spending was especially robust in locales where individuals were reaping large wealth gains from the technology and financial sectors. More generally, we observed a dramatic decline in the personal saving rate in the late 1990s. Personal saving--which is measured in the U.S. National Income and Product Accounts as the difference between disposable income and outlays--dropped from 6-1/2 percent of disposable 
 2 BIS Review 100/2001 income at the end of 1994 to roughly 1 percent in early 2000, when equity prices peaked. The magnitude of this decline is consistent with the runup in equity prices and the marginal propensity to consume out of equity wealth that appears in the Fed’s model. Nevertheless, until recently economists have been able to marshal little formal evidence that the observed relationship between aggregate spending and aggregate wealth could be traced to changes in spending by those households that actually experienced wealth gains. But that gap in our understanding is now being filled, at least regarding equity wealth. Several recent papers--including some by economists at the Federal Reserve Board--have documented a microeconomic relationship corresponding to the relationship that we have long observed in aggregate data. For example, one study that analyzed the response of individual households to changes in stock market wealth found that, over the 1983-to-1999 period, the spending of U.S. households that own stocks responded to movements in the stock market, whereas the spending of non-holders of stocks has no apparent link to stock prices.1 A second study has estimated that, in the second half of the 1990s, households in the top of the income and education distributions in the United States showed the largest consumption increases, consistent with the fact that these households owned the most stocks and experienced the largest gains in wealth.2 Unfortunately, microeconomic evidence on the link between housing wealth and consumption is much more limited. But the substantial gains in housing wealth that have been experienced in recent years and the disparate movement of house and equity prices make this an issue of both policy and academic interest. I hope that future analyses will add to our understanding of this linkage. Hence there seems little empirical question that changes in household net worth cause changes in household spending. To be sure, not every analysis of the link between stock prices and spending comes to the same conclusions as those of the studies I mentioned. Moreover, we certainly do not have a complete understanding of all aspects of this relationship. For example, we have fairly limited evidence to guide us on the important issue of distinguishing the role of housing wealth from equity wealth. On balance, however, the link between aggregate household wealth and spending has remained one of the sturdier relationships in macroeconomics. When we turn to business spending, the evidence in support of a direct causal link from equity prices to business investment is weaker. Indeed, neither Tobin’s q nor other approaches to formalizing the effect of equity prices on business investment have fared well in most empirical tests. Other influences on business investment aside from asset-price fluctuations--such as the acceleration in business output and the cash flow of firms--often have proven more robust and more important explanators of capital spending than stock prices. However, some careful research--again partly conducted by Federal Reserve economists--suggests that a cost-of-capital effect on investment comes through clearly in empirical models based either on natural experiments with exogenous shocks to the cost of capital or on other econometric techniques that identify the exogenous parts of observed changes in user cost.3 Other recent work suggests that investment is also affected by at least those movements in stock prices that reflect the discounted value of expected profits.4 This important literature is too complex for me to review in detail today. Let me say simply that, despite the empirical puzzles, I believe that the cost-of-capital effect is likely to be at work when stock prices rise or fall significantly.                                                       1 Karen E Dynan and Dean M Maki, “Does Stock Market Wealth Matter for Consumption?” Finance and Economics Discussion Series Paper 2001-23 (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, May 2001). 2 Dean M Maki and Michael G Palumbo, “Disentangling the Wealth Effect: A Cohort Analysis of Household Saving in the 1990s,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series Paper 2001-21 (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, April 2001). 3 Jason G Cummins, Kevin A Hassett, and R Glenn Hubbard, “A Reconsideration of Investment Behavior Using Tax Reforms as Natural Experiments,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, 2:1994, pp 1-59; and Stacey Tevlin and Karl Whelan, “Explaining the Investment Boom of the 1990s,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series Paper 2000-11 (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February 2000) and Journal of Money, Credit and Banking (forthcoming). 4 Jason G Cummins, Kevin A Hassett, and Stephen D Oliner, “Investment Behavior, Observable Expectations, and Internal Funds,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series Paper 1999-27 (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, May 1999). 
 BIS Review 100/2001 3 Two unresolved issues regarding the link between wealth and consumption Let me return to the relationship between household wealth and consumption. Although the current body of empirical literature on this topic sends a rather clear message, it does not answer all the questions. Let me highlight two unresolved issues that I find particularly intriguing and that deserve further study. The first issue pertains to the underlying forces causing the value of the stock market to change. The value of equities can change for two basic reasons: because market participants adopt a new view of future profits, or because market participants apply a different set of discount factors to those expectations of future profits. The discount factors incorporate both risk-free interest rates and equity premia, but I will refer to the discount factors simply as interest rates. Consider the effect of an increase in expected profits, say from a spurt in productivity. To the extent that higher expected profits reflect higher expected future output and income--and not just a redistribution of income from labor to capital--both economic intuition and formal models suggest that desired household spending should increase, all else equal. Consumers foresee their future higher income and want to spend some of it now. That response is a straightforward wealth effect on consumption. Now consider instead the effect of a decrease in interest rates, setting aside for a moment the implications of the interest-rate decline for investment and future output. In this scenario, households are not expecting higher future returns but are simply discounting the same stream of returns at a different rate, so it is less clear that they are truly better off and should increase their consumption. A further complication in evaluating these two scenarios is that the aggregate response of household spending and investment will generally feed back to asset markets and generate further changes in prices and discount rates. The nature and magnitude of these interactions depend on the consumption and investment decisions of households and firms, on the extent of unused labor and capital resources, on the openness of the economy, and on other factors. Untangling these connections is difficult theoretically, and even more so empirically. But the basic point is that wealth changes reflecting future profits (or productivity) and wealth changes reflecting interest rates could have very different effects on consumption. Analyses of the wealth effect often give insufficient weight to these complexities. I believe that further research on both the theoretical and empirical aspects of this issue could contribute significantly to our understanding of the relationship between asset prices and macroeconomic outcomes. A second area in which some further work is warranted is housing. The basic puzzle is this: Roughly speaking, the population currently occupies the stock of residential real estate and will continue to do so no matter what happens to its price. Suppose there is a rise in the relative price of housing. There is no doubt that this rise would increase computed nominal net worth, but why should it support increases in household spending? To articulate the puzzle more carefully, suppose that I intend to live in my current house forever and that the price of the house increases because of a decline in the discount rate for future housing services. In that case, my measured nominal wealth would be greater, but the nominal value of the housing services I am consuming currently and will consume in the future would also be greater. Thus, the increase in the value of my home would not provide me with any additional resources for greater consumption of real housing services or other goods and services. Yet, as I noted earlier, the empirical evidence supports the view that changes in the price of residential real estate do affect household spending. So what is missing from our simple story? One possibility is that the hypothesized increase in the price of my house reflects a change in the housing services that the house is expected to provide, perhaps because individuals have come to think that houses will depreciate more slowly in the future than we had believed. In this situation, a higher house price would be accompanied by an increase in my real consumption of housing services over time but--as long as I stayed in the same house--by no change in my consumption of other goods and services. A second complicating factor is that many homeowners do not intend to live in their current houses forever. Many expect to move to smaller houses, condominiums, or retirement communities as they get older. These individuals, who plan to “downsize” their housing over time, are truly better off when house prices increase, and any standard theory would predict that they will increase their consumption. At the same time, many individuals who do not currently own homes--or who own small homes--likely plan to purchase homes and increase their consumption of housing services in the future. These “upsizers” are worse off when house prices increase, and they will reduce their 
 4 BIS Review 100/2001 consumption of non-housing goods and services. The effect of changes in house prices on desired aggregate consumption depends on the relative number of individuals in these two groups and their marginal propensities to consume out of housing wealth. A third factor, which Chairman Greenspan has recently emphasized, is the effect of realizing capital gains in housing by selling one’s house or by borrowing through a home equity loan. Accumulated home equity is not itself a liquid asset. In addition, its value is somewhat uncertain: Although general trends in real estate prices can be easily observed, nobody receives a statement in the mail saying how much his or her home is worth, and nobody can look up the value of his or her home in the newspaper. Selling a house, or getting one’s house appraised and taking out a home equity loan, converts this illiquid home equity of uncertain value into liquid funds with known value. Recent experience and the response of monetary policy Let me now turn to the recent U.S. experience, including the macroeconomic consequences of movements in asset prices since the mid-1990s and the response of monetary policymakers. As you know, the second half of the 1990s saw a record-breaking run-up in equity values in the United States. In early 1995, the net worth of U.S. households was about 4-1/2 times their after-tax income, quite close to the average ratio during the preceding quarter century. Roughly five years later, in early 2000, the ratio of wealth to disposable income peaked at more than 6--the highest value in the fifty years for which comparable wealth data are available. Now, approaching the end of 2001, the wealth-income ratio has fallen back nearly to 5--still a bit high by historical standards but well below the peak. The primary driver of these recent developments has been the dramatic advance and partial retreat in the value of publicly traded equities. Between early 1995 and the peak in early 2000, the Wilshire 5000 stock-price index (which is a broad measure of equity prices) tripled, adding nearly $12 trillion to the wealth of U.S. households. Since the peak, the Wilshire 5000 has dropped by about one-third, corresponding to a loss in wealth of roughly $6 trillion.5 Not only have the recent movements in U.S. stock prices been extremely large, they have arguably affected more households than did past movements in the stock market because of the broadening ownership of corporate equities in the United States. According to the Survey of Consumer Finances, which is conducted every three years by the Federal Reserve, roughly 32 percent of American families owned equities in 1989 (either directly or indirectly through mutual funds, retirement accounts, and other managed assets). By 1998, 49 percent owned equities in some form.6 Thus, in less than a decade, the United States evolved from a society in which one-third of families owned stocks to one in which one-half of families owned stocks. During the same period, the value of residential real estate rose, but more slowly and more steadily than did the value of equities. Ten years ago, the value of residential real estate was about twice the value of the household sector’s corporate equities. As stock prices soared in the 1990s, the share of equity holdings in household portfolios surpassed the share of owner-occupied housing. However, the recent combination of a strong housing market and faltering stock market has put aggregate housing wealth back on par with aggregate equity wealth. Now let me turn to the influence of these movements in asset prices on the conduct of monetary policy. The fundamental goal of our policy is to achieve maximum sustainable output and employment, which can be reached best in an environment of price stability. Therefore, the Federal Reserve must take an active interest in all the factors that affect economic performance, including business and consumer confidence, economic growth abroad, the foreign exchange value of the dollar, fiscal policy, and, of course, asset prices. We take the level of the stock market into account when we consider the economic outlook and monetary policy. But let me be clear: We do not target a particular level of equity prices. We attempt simply to judge the likely influence of the stock market as well as other important factors on the level of aggregate demand and aggregate supply and, hence, on the economy’s ability to achieve price stability and maximum sustainable employment. In this respect, the stock market plays the same role in our analysis as does any other influence on our outlook. While our goal of price stability can foster a favorable environment for business investment, we make no                                                       5 These calculations include both equities held directly and equities owned indirectly through mutual funds, defined contribution pension plans, defined benefit pension plans, life insurance companies, and personal trusts. 6 Figures from the 2001 Survey of Consumer Finances are not yet available. 
 BIS Review 100/2001 5 pretense to being able to control how that plays out in the stock market. We cannot avoid gauging the effect of the stock market on economic performance, but we do not target stock prices. The dramatic movements in asset prices over the past several years have affected aggregate demand and, to some extent, aggregate supply in the United States. In the late 1990s, the growth rate of U.S. labor productivity increased beyond the expectations of most observers. An important source of the faster pace of productivity was a surge in capital spending fostered by the development of new technology. Faster productivity growth was among the factors that boosted equity valuations; in turn, larger expected productivity advances and a lower cost of equity capital provided a further stimulus to investment. The pickup in investment combined with the wealth effect on consumption to boost aggregate demand. The rapid pace of investment also helped to hold down inflationary pressures by increasing the growth of productive capacity. However, by the summer of 1999, the persistent strength of domestic demand and tightening resource utilization in the United States, especially for labor, heightened concern among policymakers that inflationary pressures could undermine the impressive performance of the economy. Accordingly, the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates. The objective was not to bring down the stock market but rather to bring the growth of aggregate demand and aggregate supply into better alignment. Of course, the U.S. economy has now slowed very sharply. One factor has been the apparent reconsideration of expected profitability in the high-tech sector. This reassessment depressed equity prices for high-tech firms, and it has significantly restrained investment in these types of equipment, which had been substantial contributors to the previously rapid rate of economic growth. Slowing investment and a shift from a positive to a negative wealth effect on consumption have significantly damped the growth in aggregate final demand since late last year. The associated inventory correction has accentuated the decline in production. Since the September 11 terrorist attacks, heightened uncertainty and concerns have also weighed on the U.S. economy. These factors, and many others, have informed our decision to shift the stance of monetary policy aggressively and reduce the target federal funds rate by 4-1/2 percentage points since the beginning of the year. Conclusion Hence there is no question that asset prices influence the macroeconomy. They should theoretically, and they clearly seem to empirically. But one would think that wealth changes coming from investors’ re-evaluation of future profits would have different effects from those coming from interest-rate changes or changes in the relative price of housing. This puzzle should, I feel, loom large on the research agenda for academic economists and, for obvious reasons, on the policy agenda for central banks. 
  Alan Greenspan: The euro as an international currency Remarks by Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, before the Euro 50 Group Roundtable, Washington, 30 November 2001. *      *      * Today I would like to address some of the basic considerations that confront the euro in its emergence as a key international currency. I know I follow a number of contributions on this and related subjects and trust my comments will not overlap too much with what has already been said. An international currency emerges because it is a solution to an economic problem. In a world of multiple currencies and multilateral trade, those engaged in cross-border transactions face a problem of coordinating purchases and sales of currencies. Because a sale of a given currency to a customer is unlikely to be matched by a nearly simultaneous purchase of the same currency from another customer, foreign exchange traders must make their customers wait or must hold costly inventories of currencies. When the volume of transactions in a given currency is large, however, the waiting time between buy and sell orders for the currency will typically be shorter, and smaller stocks of the currency can be held. Thus, there are efficiency gains to channeling international transactions through a single currency, passing demands and supplies for other currencies through trades involving a so-called vehicle. In addition, as more and more transactions work through the vehicle currency, the currency becomes increasingly acceptable in international transactions because bid-ask spreads narrow and liquidity increases. Because the attractiveness of any vehicle currency grows as its liquidity increases, an international currency has a tendency to become a natural monopoly. If the underlying demand for one of two competing vehicle currencies falters for a reason not clearly perceived to be transitory, and its bid-ask spreads, accordingly, increase relative to its competition, demand will shift to that competitor. But that shift, in turn, will widen the bid-ask spread of the faltering competitor still more, inducing a further shift of transactions to the alternative currency. This process ends with the demise of the weaker currency as a competing vehicle and the stronger of the two becoming the sole surviving vehicle. However, even when an emerging international currency is displacing another, the transition can be drawn out, resulting in two vehicle currencies existing side by side for a protracted period. Between the two world wars, for example, sterling and the dollar were both active as international currencies. This period, of course, was clearly transitional, and the dollar subsequently became dominant. But the most important factor inhibiting the emergence and persistence of a single vehicle currency throughout the world is the attraction of portfolio diversification. This can be a powerful counterforce, especially because currencies offer far greater opportunities for diversification than most other assets. The average price of all currencies, by construction, is trendless, tending to increase the negative covariance within a portfolio of currencies. In contrast, equity instruments are often driven in the same direction, as are debt instruments; and often debt and equity prices move together. This point brings us to the question: How does a currency become an international currency? The question is particularly intriguing because, in the reign of fiat currencies, its answer is unlike the explanation of how a currency becomes dominant within a country. When gold, silver, or other commodities were the normal means of exchange, units of currency were defined by commonly understood weights of the commodities that circulated. Soon the equivalent of warehouse receipts for precious metals circulated as currency. Under a commodity standard more generally the value of paper currency or any other financial claim is derived from the value of the standard. Contracts can be written in terms of ounces of gold or, more conveniently, in terms of a unit of exchange. The pound sterling, of course, was originally a pound of silver. The U.S. dollar was originally defined for legal purposes in the Coinage Act of 1792 as either 0.05 ounces of gold or 0.77 ounces of silver. 
  In today’s world of government-issued monies, the unit of currency is not, and need not be, defined. It circulates as legal tender under government fiat. Its value can be inferred only from the values of the present and future goods and services it can command. In the international arena, however, no overarching sovereign exists to decree what is money. Instead, a myriad of private agents must somehow reach agreement on which currency to use as an international currency. In the modern world of fiat currencies, a number of factors can enhance the attractiveness of a currency to private agents, making it easier for them to settle on an international currency. First and foremost, an international currency must be perceived as sound. To be acceptable, market participants must be willing to hold it as a store of value. A necessary condition of that willingness is that a currency’s future value in terms of goods and services be viewed as predictable. Losses in purchasing power will tend to discourage the use of a currency, but so will any excessive price fluctuation that raises the risk of holding it. In addition, if a currency is seen as a viable store of value in times of general uncertainty, it will attract investors even when times are not so uncertain. Clearly, many currencies meet this test; yet few emerge as international currencies. Other factors will govern the selection from among the body of sound currencies. One is a strong, competitive economy open to, and active in, international trade and finance. Such an economy will naturally generate a large quantity of foreign exchange transactions with at least one leg in the home currency to support its wide-ranging business activity. This factor evidently goes a long way toward explaining the dominance of the Dutch guilder in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the British pound in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and the dollar today. Another factor is the presence of an open and well-developed financial system, a factor, of course, that tends to be part, perhaps a necessary part, of a strong competitive open economy. A well-developed financial system increases the attractiveness of doing business in a currency for at least two reasons. First, such a system offers a number of ancillary services to participants in international markets, who may want to borrow or invest in a currency or to hedge foreign currency positions. To the extent that these activities can be accomplished efficiently in a currency, that currency will be more attractive as a currency in which to conduct business. Second, deep and liquid financial markets that offer a full array of instruments and services will attract business from abroad that might otherwise have stayed at home. Because of financial market constraints at home or other barriers to efficiency, for example, borrowing or investing abroad in an international currency and exchanging the proceeds for domestic currency might be cheaper than conducting the transactions directly in the home currency. Thus, a currency supported by a well-developed financial system is likely to encourage greater international use, above and beyond needs associated directly with international business activity. As a consequence, the volume of gross international capital flows denominated in the currency are likely to be high, adding to its desirability, regardless of whether, on net, these capital flows are positive or negative at any point in time. These international currency determinants are clearly interrelated. Strong financial systems tend to develop in strong economies, and well-developed financial systems tend to enhance economic development. The development of both the economic and the financial systems supports the soundness of the domestic currency, which in turn feeds back to economic and financial activity. So, to some extent, there is an element of bootstrapping here. Ultimately, however, a currency’s success in the international arena requires success at home, because the strength and efficiency of the home economy and home financial system will be sources of the strength for the currency. Returning to the specific focus of this conference, clearly the euro readily meets all the key qualifications for a major international currency. Indeed, there can be little doubt that the euro is a sound currency. The mandate of the European Central Bank to maintain a stable purchasing power of the currency is doubtless firmer than that of the Federal Reserve or any other major central bank. The economy of the twelve countries embracing the euro is roughly the size of the U.S. economy, and its financial system is rapidly approaching the magnitude of that in the United States. Continuing advances in European telecommunications and payment systems have resulted in financial systems that now have the potential to be highly integrated across borders. The introduction of the euro and the successful implementation of the TARGET payment system has also contributed to this potential, by linking more firmly the financial markets of the continental European countries. The tremendous growth of bond markets in the euro area over the past three 
  years shows how such potential can be employed successfully. In addition, the greater depth and liquidity of financial markets in the euro area have facilitated the development of financial instruments, such as mutual funds and commercial paper. But in its brief history, the euro area financial system has had its difficulties as well. Expansion across national borders of important financial markets, such as equity trading and securities lending, is apparently being restrained by difficult negotiations over regulatory and legal differences. A resolution of these differences would add to the attractiveness and stature of the euro in the international arena. Many of the concerns about the euro, however, have little to do with the euro itself but pertain to certain European economic conditions that have affected the value of the currency. Following its inception, the euro, contrary to expectations, declined significantly against the dollar. Through the first year of the euro’s existence, the weakening of its dollar exchange rate was widely attributable to a booming American economy. But, again contrary to expectations, the euro has not materially strengthened as the American economy has weakened. Having endeavored to forecast exchange rates for more than half a century, I have understandably developed significant humility about my ability in this area, a sentiment that I suspect many in this room share. With that caveat in mind, I agree with those who have hypothesized that the evident strengthened demand for the dollar, relative to the euro, has reflected a market expectation that productivity growth in the United States is likely to be greater than that in continental Europe in the years ahead. The steady flow of capital from Europe to the United States in recent years is, presumably, the consequence of Europeans finding many investments in the United States persistently more attractive than those at home. As I have argued in other forums, this outcome may well have resulted to an important degree from the particular legal structures and customs that govern labor relations in much of Europe. For example, over the decades, Europe has sought to protect its workers from some of the presumed harsher aspects of free-market competition. To discourage layoffs, discharging employees was made difficult and costly compared with doing so in the United States. By law and by custom, American employers have faced far fewer impediments in recent years to releasing employees. This difference is important in our new high-tech world because much, if not most, of the rate of return from the newer technologies results from cost reduction, which on a consolidated basis largely means the reduction of labor costs. Consequently, legal restraints on the ability of firms to readily implement such cost reductions lower the prospective rates of return on the newer technologies and, thus, the incentives to apply them. As a result, even though these technologies are available to all, the intensity of their application has been more clearly evident in the United States and other countries with fewer impediments to implementation. As a dividend, the level of employment in the United States has turned out to be higher as firms find hiring less risky and, hence, are more willing to add employees to their rosters. The persistent strength of the dollar in the face of the United States’ unsustainable current account deficit underscores this impressive propensity to accumulate dollar investments, relative to those denominated in euros. I assume previous speakers have addressed the as-yet-unfulfilled expectation of a substantial diversification of the large holdings of international portfolios of dollars. Some analysts predicted, before its introduction in January 1999, that the euro would rapidly displace part of the dollar holdings in many portfolios, including in particular official holdings of reserves. These expectations were probably overstated. History has shown us that once currencies achieve the status of an international vehicle currency, as the guilder and the pound did in previous centuries, the established infrastructure of deep and liquid markets favors their continuing to be so used. We have not yet reached the three-year mark since the euro appeared as a currency--a very short time by standards of international monetary history. As I indicated earlier, we have seen substantial development in the markets for euro-denominated bonds and other fixed-income instruments. Advancements in other markets have been slower but should proceed in time. I also note that the introduction of the euro created a motive for diversification into dollars for those investors who had previously obtained some portfolio balance by holding several European 
  currencies. As stability between the exchange rates of those currencies increased through the late 1990s and then became absolute in January 1999, some investors were induced to substitute into dollars to regain the diversification they had lost as the euro-area currencies became more closely correlated. We are left with the question of how the international role of the euro will unfold. The attraction of investing in dollar-denominated assets depends upon relative rates of return. To the extent that the capital flows we have observed from Europe to the United States are a critical piece of the story, the future will be determined, at least in part, by the success in Europe of matching the expected rates of return on U.S. assets. But market pressures toward portfolio diversification are clearly also going to play a major role in the future relative positions of the dollar and the euro. The world can only benefit from the competition. 
 BIS Review 99/2001 1 A H E M Wellink: The impact of new technologies on the implementation of monetary policy Speech by Dr A H E M Wellink, President of the Nederlandsche Bank, at a symposium of the Banque de France on “New Technologies and Monetary Policy”, Paris, 30 November 2001. *      *      * When thinking about new technologies, Information and Communications Technology (ICT) is probably the first thing that comes up in most people’s mind. And, there are those who see an acceleration in the diffusion of ICT as being equivalent to the concept of the ‘New Economy’. For the purposes of this conference, I would prefer to take a wider perspective, in which the new economy is seen as the interaction of several mutually reinforcing factors. These include advances in ICT, financial innovation and liberalisation, the globalisation of trade, improved functioning of markets and enhanced macroeconomic management. The interplay of these factors has the potential to raise the speed limits of the economy. That is, the new economy can operate at higher growth rates than in the past without generating additional inflation. Therefore, both the initial hype surrounding the new economy with some pronouncing the demise of the business cycle, as well as the elimination of the new economy all together in response to current economic circumstances, seem to be misguided. The jury is still out on the question whether we can detect a new economy in Europe. Without wanting to prejudge the outcome, I would argue that there is no intrinsic economic reason to expect the new economy not to materialise. So, assuming that it will take root, indeed what does this new economy imply for the monetary policymaker? I have a couple of general observations to make. First, the new economy influences the transmission of monetary impulses through the economy. It can be argued that in the new economy it will take less time for a monetary policy impulse to have an impact on inflation and output, while the impact of a given impulse will be smaller. Since there is a separate panel discussion devoted to this topic, I will leave it at that and move on to the second observation.  That is, policy makers do not bring about the new economy. It is the result of private sector behaviour, driven by innovative entrepeneurship or, more fashionably, ‘creative destruction’. Policy in general can only be conducive to the new economy. In a market-based economy, private sector decisions are guided by the allocative role played by the price mechanism, which performs best in an environment of price stability. Hence, the monetary policy objective of price stability, which served us well in the old economy, will help foster a new economic environment. It is no coincidence, therefore, that the champion of the new economy, the United States, achieved its greatest advances in an era of low inflation.  A third issue, crucial for monetary policymakers, is the question of how to react to the new economy. Let me simplify matters by conceptualising the new economy as a shock to productivity. The economic consequences of this shock will be felt in the long run as well as in the adjustment towards the new steady state of the economy. Let me start with the long run.The new equilibrium is characterised by structurally higher growth rates of productivity, implying higher profitability of investments. In order to attract the capital needed to finance these investments, and achieve macro-economic equilibrium, a higher interest rate is needed. The central bank must take this upward movement of interest rates into account when formulating monetary policy. Before this new equilibrium is achieved, the economy goes through a complex adjustment process. Analytically, this adjustment not only involves an outward shift of the aggregate supply curve, which by itself implies lower inflation and higher growth. It could also elicit a stimulus to aggregate demand, for example due to wealth effects. The latter would imply higher inflation and higher growth. So, it depends on the circumstances and on the stage of transition from the old steady state to the new one, how monetary policy should react. It is important to note that the monetary strategy of the Eurosystem was devised in order to conduct monetary policy in a particularly uncertain economic environment. The monetary strategy is well-suited, therefore, to cope with uncertainties, including the uncertainty surrounding the effects of the new economy. As such, the definition of price stability does not need to be altered and the two-pillar structure will continue to serve us well. There could, however, be a need to re-assess the information content of individual variables within each pillar. Let me try to illustrate this. 
 2 BIS Review 99/2001 Advances in and the spread of ICT can lead to new forms of money, i.e. electronic means of payment. Anticipating this, electronic money balances held by euro area residents have already been included in the definition of euro area monetary aggregates. However, the new economy could change the information content of the monetary aggregates. For example, electronic money could increase the velocity of money, because people will be able to economise on their money holdings, only accessing money when they need to spend it. Also, structurally higher productivity growth will eventually lead to higher trend growth in the euro area. In due time, both effects could independently elicit an adjustment of the reference value for M3. This issue is covered by the yearly review of the reference value for M3 by the ECB Governing Council. Under the first pillar, valuable information is also distilled from the counterparts of broad money, such as credit variables. The development of new financial instruments could change the information content of these variables. For example, securitisation places bank assets outside bank balance sheets, which could complicate the observation by the central bank of credit flows. In the second pillar, the new economy could widen the range of useful indicators, i.e. because wealth effects gain in importance. The information content of other indicators must be re-evaluated in order to take into account a possible increase in the speed limits of the economy. The new economy could, for example, lead to a downward adjustment of the NAIRU – the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment. At the same time, variables that measure the current economic situation could become more important, as these will be the first to reveal that the new economy has landed in Europe.  Let me conclude with three key points. First, the new economy could have, and in my view will have, important implications for monetary transmission. Second, the implications of the new economy for the conduct of monetary policy are not clear-cut. Especially not in the transitional period to the new economy. What is clear, however, is that price stability will remain at the heart of central banking. Third, the ECB monetary policy strategy is well-suited to take the uncertainties surrounding the new economy into account in policy-making. There is no reason to amend the two-pillar structure on account of the new economy. Within and between both pillars, the assessment of all incoming information is and will continue to be evaluated. This exemplifies the art of monetary policymaking, both in the ‘old’ and in the ‘new’ economy. 
 BIS Review 99/2001 1 Yutaka Yamaguchi: The economic situation and monetary policy in Japan1 Speech by Mr Yutaka Yamaguchi, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan, at the Economic Seminar of the Japan Research Institute, Tokyo, 26 November 2001. *      *      * I am honored to have been given the opportunity to talk before this distinguished audience. My topic today is the economic situation and monetary policy in Japan. There are many issues I would like to talk about related to this topic, but as my time is limited, I would like to focus on the current issue in the economy, the continuous decline in prices. The phenomenon had long been forgotten, as it last emerged just after the war, but it has caught the attention of many and has been actively discussed in recent years. I would therefore like to share my thoughts with you on policy actions that might be taken to stop the decline in prices, which naturally include monetary policy.  I. The Economy: The Present Situation and the Outlook  I would first like to explain the Bank’s assessment of the current economic situation based on the Bank’s semi-annual report, Outlook and Risk Assessment of the Economy and Prices, “the outlook report” for short, published on October 29.  The Bank started publishing outlook reports last year, and the report is released twice a year in April and October. The aim of publication is to promote public understanding by enhancing the transparency of the conduct of monetary policy by comprehensive disclosure of the views of the Bank’s Policy Board members on the outlook for the economy. The October 2001 report covered fiscal years 2001 and 2002, the period from April 2001 through March 2003, and assessed the most likely scenario, or a baseline scenario, for economic and price developments during the period, and the upside and downside risk factors involved.  There is only time today to give a brief summary of the conclusions of the outlook report. It concluded that, as a baseline scenario, Japan’s economy would go through a severe adjustment in fiscal years 2001 and 2002. At the same time, however, the report asserted that the economy would stop deteriorating in fiscal 2002 if overseas economies started to recover in fiscal 2002. Even in that case, more time will be needed before clear signs of recovery can be confirmed and prices are expected to continue declining gradually in fiscal years 2001 and 2002. This outlook clearly involves a high degree of uncertainty and there exist both upside and downside risks to the baseline scenario. Among the risk factors that need to be watched closely are 1) developments in overseas economies, especially those in the U.S., and in IT-related industries; 2) developments in the financial markets at home and abroad, especially stock prices; and 3) the impact of structural reform of the economy, fiscal consolidation, and the NPL disposal.  II. Problems of the Price Decline  If the consumer price index falls, albeit modestly, in fiscal years 2001 and 2002, this will be a post-war record of a continuous decline for three years. To consider the relation between prices and monetary policy, we need to examine the factors behind the price decline.  The projected continuous decline in prices is caused by two factors. The first is the downward pressures on prices brought about by weak demand. Given the baseline scenario that I mentioned earlier, the output gap in the economy will be likely to widen into fiscal 2002. The second is the downward pressures from the supply side, for example, imports of low-priced goods, deregulation, and streamlining of distribution channels.  These two kinds of pressures are both important as factors behind the price decline. But in relation to the short-term economic outlook, it is more of a concern that the downward pressures generated by weak demand will gradually intensify.                                                        1 English translation prepared by the Bank’s staff based on the Japanese original. 
 2 BIS Review 99/2001 This analysis of the price decline does not mean that the Bank is worried only about the pressures due to weak demand and not about those from the supply side. The Bank is well aware of the necessity of stopping the continuous price decline in view of the severe economic situation, and is taking strong monetary easing measures unprecedented in the history of central banking.  Then, what are the problems with the current continuous price decline?  A loss of price stability, regardless of whether this is due to deflation or inflation, could cause the following problems. Firstly, when prices are not stable, the signaling function of prices does not work properly and efficient resource allocation is hampered; and secondly, uncertainty heightens which makes it difficult for economic agents to take decisions for the future. In other words, fluctuations in prices interfere with the most important function of a market mechanism: resource allocation.  We should examine whether the ongoing gradual price decline could cause these problems. However, the Bank’s recent concern is more about the danger that a vicious circle might be generated by the price decline: a deflationary spiral emerges when a price decline leads to a recession and this in turn triggers a further fall in prices. A deflationary spiral can develop for various reasons but the background common to all is that various contracts for economic transactions are mostly agreed at a fixed nominal value which cannot be adjusted flexibly for price declines. I will explain this focusing on three economic variables: interest rates, debts, and wages.  The first point concerns interest rates, the so-called “zero interest rate constraint.” Currently, not all the market interest rates are zero, but short-term rates, which the Bank can control through its policy, are virtually zero and cannot decline further. Once nominal interest rates decline to zero, there will be no room left for monetary policy to affect aggregate demand or the level of prices by lowering nominal interest rates and, consequently, real interest rates.  The second point concerns debts. Debts held by firms and households are usually fixed at a nominal value, and cannot be adjusted for price declines. Hence, repayment of debts becomes more difficult as prices decline and corporate sales and/or household income decrease. To make matters worse, Japan now faces the associated problems of excessive debts in the corporate sector and the large amount of the NPLs in the banking sector. The gravity of these debt problems aggravated by the heavier debt burden due to price declines is hampering the recovery of our economy. In the past, there were some cases where credit contracted substantially when the economy was in a deflationary spiral, and this was due to a vicious circle in which an increase in debt burden interacted with a price decline.  The third point concerns wages. Nominal wages have a downward rigidity. In general, corporate profits decrease in cases where nominal wages remain rigid while sales decrease due to a price decline. In Japan, nominal wages have been adjusted with a certain amount of flexibility and careful analysis is needed to examine whether or not wage rigidity is exerting downward pressures on corporate profits and heightening the risk of falling into a deflationary spiral.  From what I have said it is clear that developments in nominal income, including corporate profits and employee’s income, are important yardsticks to judge whether or not the economy will fall into a deflationary spiral. For example, in 2000, despite some negative inflation rates, the profits of firms marked an increase of 34 percent, and that of employee’s income was one percent. Therefore, the probability of the economy falling into a deflationary spiral was low. After the turn of the year, the situation changed and began to give cause for concern, as corporate profits started to decrease and the year-on-year increase in wages has remained negative since summer 2001. Thus, although the pace of price decline was almost the same in calendar years 2000 and 2001, the implications are different this year.  Is there a high probability of Japan’s economy falling into a deflationary spiral in the future? In the outlook report in October, the Policy Board members’ assessment was that, for fiscal 2002, economic growth will remain negative and prices will continue to decline. However, this assessment did not include the emergence of a deflationary spiral and we assumed that the deterioration of the economy would stop in the second half of fiscal 2002 if overseas economies started to recover. That was our baseline scenario and the associated downside risk factors should not be forgotten. If you recall my earlier explanation of deflationary spirals, I do have a deep concern about developments in corporate profits and financial system problems in a situation where nominal short-term interest rates reach zero. In this sense, we cannot totally rule out the possibility that the economy will fall into a deflationary spiral, and the situation warrants vigilant monitoring.  
 BIS Review 99/2001 3 III. Effects and Limits of Current Monetary Easing Measures  A. Outline of Current Monetary Easing Measures  The Bank of Japan has taken strong monetary easing measures which no other central bank has ever adopted before, against the background of the Bank’s severe economic outlook. The framework of the current monetary easing measures can be summarized in the following four points.  First, the main target of market operations was changed from the overnight call rate to the amount outstanding of the current accounts at the Bank. In addition, the new target was raised from four trillion yen to five trillion yen in March, to six trillion yen in August. Since September, in response to a surge in liquidity demand triggered by the terrorist attacks in the U.S., the Bank has provided the market with ample liquidity “aiming at above six trillion yen” without setting an upper limit. As a result, the amount outstanding of the current accounts at the Bank averaged 9.2 trillion yen for the September and 8.8 trillion yen for the October reserve maintenance period.  Second, the Bank has committed itself to continuing the above mentioned framework of monetary operations until the rate of increase of the CPI rises to and remains stably at or above zero percent. This commitment aims to drive down interest rates of longer maturity by clearly stating that the Bank will continue the current monetary easing measures in the future. This monetary easing effect is often called “the commitment effect” or “the duration effect.”  Third, the Bank decided that it could increase its outright purchase of long-term Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs) when the Bank found it necessary to smoothly provide ample liquidity to the market, on the condition that the amount outstanding of long-term JGB holdings be within the amount outstanding of banknotes issued. In accordance with this framework, in August the Bank increased the amount and frequency of JGB outright purchase from twice a month amounting to 400 billion yen to three times a month amounting to 600 billion yen.  Fourth, the Bank has established the so-called Lombard-type lending facility. By utilizing this scheme, financial institutions, under certain conditions, are now able to borrow funds from the Bank at the official discount rate as long as they have eligible collateral. This measure has strengthened the monetary easing effect in the sense that financial institutions have been ensured access to ample liquidity and that money market interest rates have been stabilized. The official discount rate, which is applied to this Lombard-type lending facility, has been lowered twice in 2001, in February and in September, and is currently at 0.1 percent.  B. The Strong Monetary Easing Effects in Financial Markets  Current monetary policy has achieved extremely easy conditions in the financial markets. In the money markets, short-term interest rates, including longer ones on term instruments, have declined to a lower level than in the zero-interest-rate period of 1999-2000. Since the unit for transactions of the overnight call rate was changed from 0.01 percent to 0.001 percent in early September, the rate has declined to as low as 0.001 percent to 0.004 percent, a microscopic world indeed.  In the bond markets, the interest rates on JGBs continued to move at levels close to the historical low although they did not decline below the level marked in March this year. Furthermore, medium-term interest rates, such as that of JGBs with five years remaining to maturity, are moving at 0.4-0.5 percent, which is lower than the level in March.  In the CP and corporate bond markets, credit spreads have narrowed with the decline in short- to medium-term interest rates and investors have become more willing to take risks. Therefore, the demand for issuance of new securities in firms with relatively high credit ratings has increased and the amount outstanding of issuance of CP and corporate bonds has maintained a high level. In Japan, the share of corporate financing through the capital markets is still relatively small. However, it has become important as a channel by which the monetary easing measures have permeated through the economy because the credit intermediation function of banks is weakened.  By contrast, the effect of the current policy on asset prices such as stock prices and foreign exchange rates has been relatively limited. Although stock prices rose somewhat after the announcement of the monetary easing measures in March this year, they declined steadily from May onward reflecting a deterioration in business conditions and successive downward revisions of the outlook for corporate profits. Stock prices have not shown a positive response to the increase in the outstanding balance of 
 4 BIS Review 99/2001 current accounts at the Bank since August. Foreign exchange rate of the yen also did not depreciate compared to levels in March, as the U.S. economy showed a faster-than-expected slowdown.  C.  Easing Effects on the Corporate and the Household Sectors  The crucial point in assessing current monetary policy is whether the ample provision of liquidity by the Bank and consequent easing in the financial markets are affecting the economic entities outside the financial markets such as the corporate and household sectors. Regrettably, the easing effects have not fully permeated to the economy. The monetary base, the sum of banknotes and current accounts at the Bank, is increasing by 14 percent on a year-on-year basis. However, the growth rate of money supply is only 3.6 percent on the same basis, somewhat higher than at the beginning of this year, mainly due to a shift of funds from maturing postal savings. More serious is the fact that bank lending is contracting at 1.9 percent year-on-year and the pace of this decline has been accelerating somewhat. GDP and price conditions also have not shown any improvement. Business capital spending and housing construction do not seem to be stimulated by the historically low interest rates.  IV. The Monetary Policy and Prices  A.  Is Deflation a Monetary Phenomenon?  I will return to the reasons behind the weak response of the economy to the strong monetary easing policy. Instead, here, I would like to pose a question: Is it fair to say that the insufficient monetary easing is causing continuous price declines and stagnant economic growth? For example, we often hear the argument that “both inflation and deflation are monetary phenomena and price declines can be stopped only by increasing money supply,” a simplified form of the quantitative theory of money. Is this kind of argument correct?  A part of the above argument that “both inflation and deflation are monetary phenomena” does hold as a long-term economic relationship when the amount of money changes significantly. In fact, the policy objective of many central banks including the Bank, that is to attain “price stability,” is based on the understanding of this relationship. However, this relationship holds only over a sufficiently long period of time and can be interpreted as a sort of definitional or identical relationship. Therefore, at a practical level, it cannot be applied to the conduct of monetary policy.  The first problem with the argument is that, as I mentioned above, it does not make a clear distinction between the relationship in the long term and in the short term. For example, if we look at the relation between money and prices, a close relationship emerges when the amount of money increases or decreases on an extremely large scale and has a dominant impact: The hyper-inflation experienced in Germany after World War I is one example. When the amount of money increases or decreases to a certain extent but not on an extremely large scale, a loose relationship is observed only if we look in the sufficiently long term. However, over a period of one year to a couple of years, unless the amount of money increases or decreases on an extremely large scale as I have just explained, the relationship between money and prices is not stable.  The second problem is that at present the underlying mechanism in the argument will not work as theoretically assumed: a central bank’s efforts to expand liquidity, the current account balance at the Bank or the monetary base, will increase money supply in a broader sense, that is liquidity held by the corporate and household sectors, and, consequently, will push up prices and the level of business activity. Needless to say, monetary policy cannot actually resort to dropping banknotes from the sky--this kind of policy is called “helicopter money” in economics textbooks. If such a policy is implemented, people will rush to purchase goods and services after they receive the cash, and prices can be expected to rise immediately. However, in actual monetary policy, money in a broad sense is provided through a series of “transactions”: a central bank purchases financial assets such as government bonds from financial institutions, in turn creating money in a narrow sense, that is the current account balance at the central bank, and then financial institutions make lending and securities investment. However, what is happening currently in Japan’s economy is that, although funds are abundant in the financial markets, they do not permeate outside those markets, that is, to the corporate and household sectors and money supply has not increased sufficiently. This has been both the cause and result of the stagnant growth in expenditures and the decline in prices. Given that the mechanism to increase money is not working properly, I think it is not following logical steps or is ignoring reality to argue that increasing money could solve all the problems.  
 BIS Review 99/2001 5 As I mentioned, while various factors affect the movement of prices, the most fundamental factor determining price developments is the balance between aggregate demand and supply for goods and services. As the supply capacity changes only slowly, it is the movement of demand that mainly determines the short-term supply-demand balance. In fact, in the time-series data on the Japanese economy, prices begin to rise only after the economic growth rate recovers and the output gap narrows. Statistical analysis of the dynamic correlation between the economic growth rate and the rate of increase in prices shows that the correlation coefficient is the highest when the economic growth is one to two years ahead of a consumer price increase. On the other hand, the rate of increase in prices does not seem to lead the economic growth rate.  In the above discussion, it is clear that in order to halt the continuous decline of prices, it is most important to promote a sustainable, not temporary, growth in aggregate demand. The implementation of monetary policy by the Bank so far has been aimed at halting the decline in prices by providing ample liquidity to the markets to lower interest rates thereby stimulating aggregate demand. The current difficulty in the conduct of monetary policy is that it cannot stimulate aggregate demand even with all the measures employed. We need to face up to this fact.  B. Inflation Targeting  Currently in Japan, we often hear the argument calling for the adoption of inflation targeting. However, this argument is peculiar in the sense that it focuses on first raising prices using every measure. I believe we should devise ways to stimulate economic activity first because prices in nature are the result of economic activity. With this understanding of the environments surrounding price developments and monetary policy, the Bank is currently reluctant to accept the recent argument for inflation targeting.  More fundamentally, inflation targeting should be regarded not as a short-term policy tool but as a framework for improving the transparency of the conduct of monetary policy. As a possible tool for improving the transparency, the Bank considers that inflation targeting is worth examining as one of the options in the future. However, currently, as the short-term interest rate has already reached zero percent, the Bank has very few options for further monetary easing. In addition, the effect of the current monetary easing policy is limited because of the NPL problem. In such circumstances, it is unlikely that the adoption of a too ambitious a target will improve confidence in monetary policy.  At this point, I would expect a counter-argument that however limited the room available for additional monetary easing, adoption of an inflation target will of itself directly affect the “expectation” of economic agents and will produce inflation expectations. I would admit that “expectation” is one of the important channels by which the effects of monetary policy can permeate through the economy. However, controlling “expectation” solely by announcing a policy is unlikely to succeed. I think the Bank can affect people’s expectation only if the announcement is accompanied by effective policy measures. The Bank is in fact already strongly affecting people’s expectation by promising to continue the current monetary easing framework until the year-on-year increase in CPI rises and remains stably above zero percent. In fact, as I mentioned, the interest rate on the JGB with five years remaining to maturity is currently at 0.4-0.5 percent. This interest rate level clearly indicates that market participants are expecting the current historically low interest rates will continue for an extended period of time. In spite of this market development, the actual and expected inflation rates do not show any signs of upward movement.  I understand that some argue that the Bank can cause inflation by purchasing any kind of assets. I will touch upon this issue later.  As an example of successful introduction of inflation targeting, some cite the price level targeting adopted in Sweden in the first half of the 1930s. We at the Bank are also interested in the Swedish experience and have studied it. What we found was a great similarity between the Swedish policy and the Bank’s current policy framework.  The most important similarity is that, while both the Swedish authorities and the Bank of Japan declared their firm determination to prevent price declines, neither adopted a numerical target. In the Swedish comprehensive program for price stability, it was stated that “Monetary policy should not be tied systematically to a particular index figure. A formal and simple rule for monetary policy did not appear feasible.” More specifically, the Riksbank, the Swedish central bank, stressed the importance of carefully monitoring various price indices while taking into account other economic variables such as inventory figures and productivity data. It stated that implementation of the policy should not 
 6 BIS Review 99/2001 depend on a specific price index such as the CPI. Therefore, a clear distinction should be made between the Swedish policy and the idea of overcoming deflation by adopting a rigid price targeting scheme using a specific price index.  When comparing Sweden in the 1930s and Japan’s current situation, we should be careful because there are critical differences between the two regarding economic and financial environments. The significant differences are the following: (1) in the Swedish economy at the time, the level of nominal interest rates was relatively high so that there was sufficient room for interest rate cuts, (2) the Swedish financial system did not face a serious problem, (3) as a relatively small open economy, the depreciation of the currency in the foreign exchange market contributed to the prevention of price falls. In sum, there is a difficulty in applying the specific measures used in Sweden in the 1930s to the current situation in Japan.  V.  Why Japan’s Economy is not able to Exit from the Deflation  Now, I would like to raise a question: What kind of economic policies are required to exit from the ongoing deflation, and why is Japan’s economy unable to do so? As I have already mentioned, three factors in particular stand out as important: the constraints imposed by zero nominal interest rates, the NPL problem, and the weakening sentiment.  A.  Constraints of Zero Nominal Interest Rates  First let us consider the constraints imposed by zero nominal interest rates. Short-term interest rates are already virtually zero, five-year interest rates have also declined very close to zero--the term of debt financing by Japanese firms is in many cases five years or less. A standard mechanism of monetary easing is: (1) inducing a decline in short-term interest rates by providing ample liquidity to the money market, (2) thereby influencing financial variables such as the medium- to long-term interest rates, stock prices, and foreign exchange rates, (3) consequently, expecting such changes in financial variables will affect the behavior of financial institutions, firms and households. Now that nominal interest rates have reached the point where no further decline is possible, monetary easing has also reached the point where little additional effect can be expected. Moreover, real interest rates could rise if a price decline continues in this economic setting.  By the way, facing the limits of further monetary easing with the zero interest rate constraints, what kind of meaning does the massive amount of liquidity provision to the financial markets have? It is premature to give a definite answer to this question. The current policy adopted by the Bank is unique and has not been tried in other countries. The effects of such policy, especially in a situation where serious problems exist in the financial sector, should be assessed empirically but we have not accumulated sufficient experience and data to draw concrete conclusions. At the same time, this does not mean that we have no clues. One example is the surge in liquidity demand in the financial markets and the associated increase in the outstanding balance of the current accounts at the Bank after the terrorist attacks in the US. The surge in liquidity demand itself took place not only in the U.S. but also in other countries and major central banks including the Bank provided a huge amount of liquidity in order to secure stability in the financial markets. While the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank returned to normality in terms of liquidity provision within a week, in Japan, by contrast, liquidity demand has continued to be high. It appears that there are two factors at work here.  The first factor is waning incentive to invest or lend funds in the markets with the decline in the uncollateralized overnight call rate to 0.001 percent. Thus, financial institutions that hold excess funds would prefer to deposit them in their current accounts at the Bank even if it does not bear interest. Once such behavior spreads to other market participants, borrowers feel worried that they might not be able to borrow funds in the markets, and subsequently, an increasing number of financial institutions will start to defensively accumulate funds in their current accounts at the Bank.  The second factor is the fact that the cost of yen funding through yen-U.S. dollar swaps has become negative for foreign banks. Foreign banks capable of funding yen at negative interest rates can earn an interest margin without worrying about credit risk by depositing the funds in their current accounts at the Bank. In this case, the negative yen funding rate works as a “sweetener” giving an incentive to foreign banks providing Japanese banks with dollar funds.  These two factors, a disincentive to invest in the money markets and negative yen funding costs, give us an interesting insight into the meaning of current market operations in which ample liquidity is 
 BIS Review 99/2001 7 provided with the current account balance as an operating target. That is to say, the disincentive to lend funds in the market was largely caused by the ample liquidity provision by the Bank. At the same time, the major reason why the Bank can provide ample liquidity without facing under-subscription in open market operations is that there is demand from foreign banks for excess reserves, and this itself is not expected to lead to a revitalization of economic activity. Of course, we still cannot deny the possibility that the demand for excess reserves will lead to a change in the portfolio of economic entities and ultimately stimulate economic activity in the long run. The Bank is now closely examining this possibility while continuing the current massive provision of liquidity.  B.  The NPL Problem  The second reason why Japan’s economy is unable to exit from the ongoing deflation is the NPL problem. It is not the case that once the NPLs are disposed of, the deflation will end, and the economy will recover right away. I think that it is now widely understood that the disposal of the NPLs will rather be associated with short-term pain. It is also true, however, that once the economy recovers, the NPLs will decrease. Sustainable economic growth cannot be expected in a situation where a large amount of the NPLs remain and credit intermediation does not function fully, for the following reasons.  First of all, in such a case, financial institutions are facing the risk of their capital being impaired by external factors such as a decline in stock prices and emergence of new NPLs following a downturn in the economy. Capital is the last line of defense against unexpected risks and losses. It is difficult for the management of the financial institutions to take risks when they are concerned about their capital position. From a macroeconomic point of view, sustainable economic growth may only be achieved with continuously favorable external conditions which will require delicate policy management.  Secondly, until the NPL disposal is completed, it is difficult to adjust lending rates to levels adequately reflecting risk and return. Currently Japanese banks are competing with one another to lend to blue-chip companies and credit spreads have become extremely narrow. On the other hand, the Japanese banks are cautious about extending new loans to firms with low credit ratings and the banks have not increased credit spreads adequately on their lending to existing less creditworthy borrowers. In the current situation, if the banks drastically increase credit spreads, their borrowers are likely to go bankrupt and the banks will have to pay the price in the end. However, from the long-term perspective, unless the lending rates are set in an economically rational manner, the lending attitude of financial institutions cannot be aggressive and consequently it is hard to achieve a sustainable economic growth.  C.  Weakening Sentiment  The third reason for the deflationary trend in Japan is weakening sentiment. Looking at households, their expenditure has been restrained reflecting their anxieties about the future including the viability of social security systems and employment concerns. In the corporate sector, investment appetite has receded partly because the economic stagnation itself has lowered the expected rate of growth. I understand that listing weakening sentiment as part of the background of deflation sounds like talking about the two sides of the same coin. But I think that the current weak demand cannot be fully explained by the zero interest rate constraint and the NPL problem and there remain some kind of residual factors which should be explained as weakening sentiment. Such a decline in demand caused by weakening sentiment can hardly be solved unless people become confident that the economy has returned to a clear recovery path. At the same time, considering the state of typical households and firms, I think it is difficult to deny that, together with the stagnated economy, various institutional barriers are hampering their challenging spirit. For example, in the corporate sector, public corporations are depriving private institutions of their business, and reviewing legal, taxation, and regulation systems to cope with the era of globalization is lagging behind. As for the household sector, consumption seems to be stagnating due to uncertainty about the future caused by the problems related to the social security system such as pension benefits and the health care system.  VI.  Conduct of Monetary Policy  I have talked about various issues, focusing on the decline in prices. Finally, based on above discussion, I would like to talk about what the Bank of Japan can do, and what I expect from the government, which is responsible for economic policy other than monetary policy.  
 8 BIS Review 99/2001 A.  The Role that the Bank of Japan Should Play  First, the role the Bank of Japan should play. I would like to reemphasize that the Bank and the government share the same goal of preventing a further decline in prices and of bringing the economy back to a sustainable growth path as soon as possible. Based on the preceding discussion, I would like to express my thinking on what role the Bank should play.  First of all, although it may sound like something which goes without saying, the current monetary easing policy should be tenaciously continued. The effects of the current strong monetary easy measures have not fully permeated to the real economy. But once there is a positive movement in accordance with the progress of structural reforms such as the NPL disposal and improvement of productivity in the economy, it can be expected that the monetary easing policy will support such movement and have powerful effects. It is extremely important to be tenacious in maintaining the current monetary easing conditions, so that they could support any positive movement in the economy when it appears.  The second role is the provision of liquidity in a swift and timely manner. Should there be uncertainty or concern in the financial markets for one reason or another, liquidity has to be provided in a swift and timely manner, so that such uncertainty or concern will not disrupt the markets. It is one of the central bank’s most important roles to maintain the stability of the financial markets and the financial system through liquidity provision. Maintaining that stability is also important in making the effect of the monetary easing continuously permeate through the economy.  Now, what could monetary policy do, if economic conditions deteriorate further and the risk of a deflationary spiral is heightened as a result? The Bank is aware of the argument that the Bank should not only increase the outright purchase of long-term JGBs but also purchase any assets such as foreign-currency denominated assets, stocks and even the NPLs to prevent deflation. As I have already expressed my thoughts on this issue on a different occasion, I will reiterate the conclusion in the following three points. First, given that just increasing the amount of liquidity gives only limited stimulus to the economy, the major benefit of purchasing such assets is mainly to influence their prices. If, however, one expects to influence these assets through a change in the supply-demand balance and thereby produce the effect of monetary easing, the purchase must be done on a large scale. Second, taxpayers may ultimately have to pay the price of possible loss resulting from this large-scale purchase and this will also affect the microeconomic resource allocation. And third, such a policy implies that a central bank would be conducting an activity which is close to entering the domain of fiscal policy. The basic rule in a democratic society is that fiscal policy using taxpayer’s money needs to be approved as part of a budget by a parliament composed of members elected by the people. I am not worrying about inflation when deflation is a concern, but claiming that such a policy of purchasing various assets should be discussed publicly in the context of governance in a democratic society.  B.  The Role that the Government Should Play  As I mentioned earlier, the government and the Bank share a common goal of preventing further price declines and bringing the economy back to the path of sustainable growth as soon as possible. The role that the government should play in this is also quite large. The first role is to foster business conditions that are competitive and attractive in order to induce business fixed investment. To do this, it is important to deregulate, to review the taxation system drastically, and to ensure that reform of public corporations progresses steadily. Another important challenge is to relieve the anxiety of households about the future by reviewing the social security system, including pension benefits. Furthermore, I would like to reemphasize the importance of ensuring that the NPL disposal proceeds as expeditiously and smoothly as possible.  The following point needs to be borne in mind. Progress in the economic and fiscal structural reform and NPL disposal is likely to lead to a decline in demand and to exert downward pressure on price levels in the short term. On the other hand, if a positive outcome of the structural reform bears fruit which leads to an increase in the productivity of the economy as a whole, it will have a significant meaning to prevent further price declines through a revitalization of economic activity. When we consider economic issues, we should always check from the viewpoint of aggregate demand and productivity. Of course, aggregate demand and the productivity are not independent of each other. Even if the growth rate recovers as a result of inefficient public investment, productivity could fall and consumption expenditure could be reduced due to concern about the future tax burden. On the other 
 BIS Review 99/2001 9 hand, if the growth rate declines substantially, firms reduce business fixed investment and the R&D expenditures necessary for improving productivity in the future.  Whether to put emphasis on aggregate demand or on productivity needs to be judged objectively based on the economic conditions. No matter where the emphasis is put, the economic consequences need to be objectively recognized and shared among the people.  Given that the price decline will inevitably continue to some extent while the structural reform proceeds, policy initiatives will be focused on preventing the decline in prices leading to a deflationary spiral. Monetary policy, it goes without saying, must play an important role in these efforts. On the other hand, there is a limit to what can be achieved by monetary policy alone. Improvement of the social safety net through measures to secure employment is necessary to prevent a sharp decline in consumption. It is essential that the stability of the financial system as a whole be secured when the NPL disposal is pushed forward.  Finally, one of the important issues is the role that fiscal policy should play. John Maynard Keynes asserted that in a liquidity trap, monetary policy loses effectiveness and fiscal policy is necessary. However, the scope for mobilizing fiscal policy is limited in Japan given the high level of public debt. I would like to expect that, given the capacity for additional fiscal outlays is limited, the government will review the components of expenditures drastically. It is widely accepted internationally that the function of built-in stabilizer should be utilized during a recession. Given the current economic situation of our country, I think it is worth examining, leaving some room for this function to work.  In concluding my speech today, I would like to add that, we at the Bank will continue to do our utmost as the nation’s central bank to provide the foundation for a stable and sustainable growth of Japan’s economy.  Thank you for your attention.  
 BIS Review 99/2001 1 M R Pridiyathorn Devakula: How the central bank sees monetary policy in the new world economic environment  Speech by Mr M R Pridiyathorn Devakula, Governor of the Bank of Thailand, made at the Shangri-La Hotel, Bangkok, 29 November 2001. *      *      * Your Excellencies Distinguished Guests Ladies and Gentlemen,  Introduction  I would like to thank the Thailand Board of Investment, the Department of Export Promotion and Tourism, as well as the Nation Group for inviting me to speak at this conference. I believe that it is important in these times of increased global uncertainty for the Bank of Thailand to share with you and the public our assessment of the current economic situation and outlook, as well as our thinking on the future course of monetary policy. The opportunity to do so today is therefore timely and greatly appreciated.  In short, today I would like to discuss what I see as the challenges facing Thailand in the period ahead and what we, at the Bank of Thailand, are prepared to do to meet those challenges. In so doing, I will briefly review the progress of the past few months, and say a few words on the appropriate policy mix which needs to be implemented to help steer the Thai economy through these difficult times.  The new world environment Let me begin by outlining two key aspects of the current world economic environment that I think are important. The first one is more fundamental and concerns the closer degree of financial and economic integration between countries. Globalization of the world economy has been driven by a variety of forces including rising trade in goods, increased international capital flows, greater technological spillovers, and growing labor mobility. While these factors have brought about a more efficient allocation of resources across national borders and facilitated higher growth and development across countries, they have also created a world environment in which shocks have become more global in nature and where crisis in one country can easily affect others. The end product of greater international economic interdependencies, especially in financial markets, is therefore the enhancement of the underlying international business cycle linkages.  Which brings me to the second aspect of the world economic environment that I would like to touch on today. This aspect concerns the immediate state of the world economy. The globalization of information technology (IT) production has meant that the correction of the unsustainable boom in IT spending has had a particularly widespread impact on the world economy. All the major industrialized countries are experiencing a synchronized slowdown in their business cycles, adversely affecting countries in the Asian region who rely heavily on exports of high-tech products. These developments have been accompanied by a steep decline in the growth in world trade. Falling commodity prices and increased competition in world markets have also put pressure on the external sector as exporters grapple with both weaker volume and lower prices. Finally, the re-pricing of assets in world equity and bond markets have created unfavorable conditions for raising capital and have, to some extent, held back consumption through the negative wealth effects. Access to world capital markets has become more limited for developing countries and we have observed a major reduction in capital flows into these countries.  Over the past few months, the external environment seems to have deteriorated quite considerably. The events of September 11th and the developments thereafter have put global financial markets on edge while exacerbating the already weak US economy, primarily through the effect on consumer confidence. Global demand continues to stagnate while difficulties in Latin America have heightened market uncertainty, increased investor’s risk aversion and tightened financing to emerging markets. In such a situation, it is important for the Government to come forward and play a major role in stabilizing and supporting the economy. In this light, I believe that the authorities here in Thailand have done a 
 2 BIS Review 99/2001 commendable job in providing the economy with timely fiscal support while adhering to fiscal discipline.  Fiscal policy has been expansionary and the decision to increase budget spending this year was warranted. The central government deficit of 159 billion baht (equivalent to 3.2 percent of GDP) for the 2001 fiscal year provided the needed support for economic activity and the budget disbursement rate of 88.4 percent relative to the targeted 89 percent was an improvement from the past.  In regards to monetary policy, the global slowdown and heightened market uncertainty has increased Thailand’s external vulnerability prompting the Bank of Thailand to pay increased attention to the issue of external stability; particularly Balance of Payments and International Reserves. Healthy outlook in the country’s external financial position is always useful in maintaining investor’s confidence in times of greater uncertainty. The one time increase in the 14-day repurchase rate in June to 2.5 percent was partly intended to foster increased support to Thailand’s external stability in the face of a more challenging global environment.  Indeed, since then distortions in the interest rate structure have been corrected, the negative differential between domestic and international interest rates has been reversed, capital outflows seem to have decelerated, the baht has become more stable, our real effective exchange rate continues to be competitive, the level of international reserves remains at a comfortable level, with reserves to short-term debt ratio as high as 140%, and inflationary pressures are well contained-headline inflation for the third quarter stood at 1.5 percent year on year, while core inflation remained well below target at 1.6 percent.  With a firmer position on macroeconomic stability, the economy is expected to grow by around 1.3-1.8 percent this year. However, the economic recovery process remains fragile and is now being undermined by the weakening global environment as well as declining consumer confidence.  Looking to the future: More to be done  Going forward, I believe we are faced with significant challenges. Unfortunately the most pressing concern also happens to be one that we have the least control of, that is the external demand. With uncertainty regarding the timing of economic recovery in the United States, Japan still having to undergo real and arduous reforms, and Europe not yet stepping up as the locomotive engine for the resumption of world growth, prospects for an export led rebound remains clouded. With these regions together constituting over 52 percent of the market share for Thai products, exports in 2001 are expected to fall in value by approximately 6 percent compared to last year. Assuming an economic rebound in the US, Japan, and Europe by mid-2002, exports should grow by around 3-5 percent in 2002. Real GDP growth is projected to be between 1-3 percent in 2002.  Against the backdrop of increased uncertainty and weak external demand, safeguarding our economic recovery will require steady resolve, more reliance on domestic demand, and a supportive set of measures and reform. The main challenge for local authorities is to ensure proper coordination of fiscal and monetary policies as well as the acceleration of structural reforms efforts in the banking and corporate sector to facilitate a pickup in domestic demand, enhance confidence, and bolster foreign investment. Mr. Bosworth did mention yesterday that to resolve the crisis, bad loans must be placed in asset management companies and then AMCs must get rid of them. This is one of the top priority policies of this government. Almost all NPLs of government banks have been transferred to AMCs, and all multi-creditor NPLs of private commercial banks have been transferred to the TAMC. And we will speed up our effort to clear them out. However, please be informed that when similar financial crises occurred in the US in 1982, the US economy was not in as bad a shape as Thailand has experienced in the past four years. At that time, Japan, Europe and the Middle-Eastern economies were strong and contributed certain capital flows into the US economy. But now, under current world economic conditions, where every country has its own problems to solve, we know well that we cannot expect foreign investors to help us clear this NPL mess, so we have to help ourselves. I do not see why we cannot do it. And we will do it.  Back to the economic forecast for next year. One important source of growth in 2002 will be fiscal spending, and the projected central government deficit of 224 billion baht or 4.4 percent of GDP strikes a good balance between improving the economic infrastructure, raising external competitiveness, and fostering economic recovery. It is very important, however, that the fiscal stimulus program meets its spending target.  
 BIS Review 99/2001 3 Safeguarding the recovery would require timely as well as effective disbursements of the 58 billion baht emergency spending plan. The proposed reduction in the corporate tax rate for companies seeking listing in the stock market as well as those already listed, and the postponement of the restoration of the VAT rate until September 2002 will further set the stage for more support in the revival of domestic demand. Additional stimulus will come from the 71.3 billion baht village fund designed to boost investment and facilitate job creation in rural areas. It is important to emphasize that the planed increase in fiscal spending does not compromise the Government’s commitment to fiscal discipline. Total public debt will remain below 60 percent of GDP while debt service (principle and interest) will account for less than 16 percent of the budget.  In regards to monetary policy, the inflation targeting framework gives the Bank of Thailand sufficient flexibility to respond quickly to fast changing domestic and external developments. With inflation remaining subdued and likely to remain contained in the range of 1.5-2.5 percent for 2002, the emphasis in the near future will be to strike a proper balance between domestic growth and external stability.  While the current stance of monetary policy under the inflation targeting framework with emphasis on external stability is accommodative and appropriate given current conditions, the Bank of Thailand is constantly monitoring developments and will move decisively should circumstances change. In light of the information currently available, and against the background of the Bank of Thailand’s long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth, I believe that the risks at present are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future. Such weaknesses could come from further retrenchment of business and consumer confidence, undershooting of fiscal expenditure targets, and slower than expected recovery in the industrialized countries. Whatever risk ultimately materializes, we would make timely and decisive adjustment of our monetary policy. With strong international reserves, at 140% of short-term debt, we can afford to adjust our monetary policy to support growth, if needed.  At this juncture, I would like to stress that the Bank of Thailand remains committed to the open and transparent monetary policy framework that has served us well since May 2000. Let me emphasize that inflation targeting is a framework, not a rule. Just as the case of a real-life anchor, inflation targets keep the economy on the desired growth path in the long run, while permitting it to respond in the short run to unpredictable tides and currents. As long as the inflation rate is within the targeted range, I believe monetary policy is allowed sufficient flexibility to address other challenges currently facing our economy.  Given the supportive policy mix, the recovery process in Thailand should remain on track for next year. However, with monetary policy geared at safeguarding the recovery while keeping sight of external stability, and fiscal discipline imposing limits to further government spending, there is not much room to maneuver on the domestic front. To substantially improve long term profitability, increase investor confidence, and enhance the success of economic recovery, the nation also needs to be unified in the pursuit of real corporate restructuring, improved financial sector discipline and reform, as well as stronger legal framework for the resolution of debt negotiation and restructuring.  Need for closer regional cooperation In addition, the growth outlook remains dependent, importantly, on a revival in world demand and improved global financial environment. In this respect substantial risks and uncertainties persist, as the world remains vulnerable to further unexpected developments. This is a possibility that we must consider and be prepared for.  We must therefore consider other possibilities in meeting the challenges that may arise in the face of deteriorating external environment. Such alternatives would ideally incorporate increased and closer cooperation among governments at the regional level. This makes good sense since the countries in the Asian region are very open by nature and would all feel the impact of further slackening in world demand. There certainly seems to be some scope for closer coordinated efforts to improve the resilience of our economies to external shocks.  As previously mentioned, one of the major vulnerabilities lies in the area of capital flow, especially for developing countries. In this regard, the regional swap arrangements already signed by a number of countries are a step in the right direction. By strengthening the credibility of central banks, such arrangements have the scope to impart positive impacts in terms of reduced volatility in regional 
 4 BIS Review 99/2001 financial markets. In light of the large pool of savings and international reserves the region currently has, there may be room for further initiatives on this front.  In addition, there seems to be scope to better mobilize regional savings and improve intra-regional capital flows. In the past, the savings rates of countries in the Asia-Pacific regions have been very high. But most of these savings were channeled first to the United States and Europe before eventually returning to Asia. I believe that we should look into ways to better channel these regional savings so that they help to cushion our countries from excess volatility of capital flows. I am glad that yesterday Mr. Kuroda proposed the establishment of a co-operation on capital flows and the streamlining of foreign exchange policy among the ASEAN plus three group. Thailand welcomes this move which would not only help reduce excess volatility of capital flows for countries in the region, but also provide exchange rate stability to support intra regional trade, which constitutes about 50% of our exports. We are willing to move forward with ASEAN plus three in this direction. You may take this as an official response, as I have already discussed this issue with our Minister of Finance.  Conclusion  Ladies and gentlemen,  Before ending, I would like to emphasize again that Thailand has gained significant ground since the aftermath of the 1997 crisis. Macroeconomic stability has been restored, progress has been achieved in financial restructuring and strengthening bank supervision, and external vulnerability has been substantially reduced. At this juncture, however, there is no room for complacency. The key challenge facing the authorities is to maintain macroeconomic stability while accelerating the pace of reforms amidst the global slowdown and heightened market uncertainty. Through careful management of domestic policies, greater regional cooperation, as well as consolidation of restructuring efforts, Thailand and the surrounding region should weather the global slowdown and return to a sustainable growth path.  I would like to thank you once again for the opportunity to address this distinguished forum and wish you all the best. Thank you.  
 BIS Review 98/2001 1 Ernst Welteke: Germany as a financial centre – European perspectives for Japanese markets  Lecture by Mr Ernst Welteke, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the Finanzplatz-Dinner, Tokyo, 29 November 2001. *      *      * I Ladies and Gentlemen, First of all, I would like to thank you most sincerely for this opportunity to speak to such a distinguished audience. It is always a pleasure for me to be here in Tokyo. I especially appreciate the opportunity to discuss with the financial elite of Japan the chances and prospects for Germany as a financial centre. Looking at the financial centre Germany (which we call “Finanzplatz Deutschland”), we have to take a European perspective. Germany and eleven other European states have formed the European Monetary Union with the European Central Bank located in Frankfurt. This union is only one month from completion. On January 1st, the notes and coins of the single European currency will be circulated. Europeans will be able to pay bills using their single domestic currency in all twelve member states of the Eurosystem. For the man in the street, this is a sea-change. In economic terms, however, the cash changeover is virtually a minor-event. Europe has de facto had a common currency and a single monetary policy for nearly three years now.  The EU has been developing a common market for more than half a century. However, the member states of this closely-knit economic network have (almost) all used a currency of their own. In 1999, economic and financial integration made a huge leap forward, as eleven – now that Greece has joined, twelve – countries decided to embark on a common currency.  II Clearly, the enlarged currency area and the integration process are of utmost importance for growth and stability of the German economy and for the expansion of the financial market in Germany. Therefore, let me start with a few figures about the euro area. Its size of population, with roughly 300 million people, is quite similar to the United States. The twelve countries have twelve national governments. People in the euro area speak eleven native languages. The euro area is the most open of the three large currency areas – the United States, Japan and Europe. Japan and the United States are our most important non-European trading partners. 17 per cent of our GDP of six-and-a-half billion euro is generated by exports, and the current account is roughly in balance. The euro area generates almost one-fifth of world exports. Average per capita GDP stands at somewhat more than € 20,000 (roughly Y 2.2 million), a third less than in Japan. Differences between individual countries are considerable.  The public sector share in the euro-area economy accounts for nearly fifty per cent of GDP, and the aggregate budget shows a small deficit. Aggregate gross public sector debt stands at 70 per cent of GDP. Individual country figures, however, differ. For instance, gross public sector debt ranges from four per cent of GDP (Luxembourg) to 100 per cent of GDP (Belgium, Italy). Heterogeneity is a fact of life in the euro area. But homogeneity far outweighs heterogeneity in one crucial respect: we are united by our intention to form an integrated Europe with a common market as a strong and reliable partner for the world economy. Germany has 82 million inhabitants or about 28 per cent of the euro area’s combined population. Germany’s share in domestic product is about a third of the euro area. In terms of foreign direct investment and trade, the German economy is even more intertwined with the world economy than the euro area. About a third of our national income is generated by exports.  This share may even rise after the integration of the central and eastern European states. Within the foreseeable future, some of our neighbouring countries will join the European Union and maybe also 
 2 BIS Review 98/2001 the Monetary Union. Germany, at the moment still a border territory of the euro area, will become the geographical centre of the union. Since these countries are in the midst of a catching-up process, we will clearly benefit from their dynamic economies. III I am well aware that the most important effect that the currency union will have on markets is by its performance – mainly through the degree of price stability achieved.  At its start, the Eurosystem saw a period of hitherto unprecedented price stability. In 1998 and 1999, consumer prices rose by only 1.1 per cent; in the year 2000, the inflation rate, at 2.3 per cent, ran a little above the two-per cent ceiling in the wake of the sharp increase in oil prices. This year, after peaking in May at 3.4 per cent, the inflation rate has been decreasing. In October, prices were 2.4 per cent higher than a year before. In the current environment of a weak world economy, the ECB Governing Council is expecting a further moderation of price increases. At its meeting on November 8, the Governing Council therefore decided to cut rates by half a percentage point. It has lowered its key interest rates during this year by 150 basis points, to 3.25 per cent.  A generally stable currency, and markets that trust the stability-orientation of the central bank, make for lower price increases at times of crisis.  In its brief history, the Eurosystem has already dealt successfully with three external shocks and crises. We have witnessed the Asian crisis in 1997-99, an oil-price shock in 1999-2000 and, most recently, the terrorist attacks in the USA. Europe did not escape unscathed from all these events. However, the low level of turbulence within the euro area contrasts with sharper reactions to similar events in the period before EMU existed. This means that we have withstood what has been regarded as the worst-case scenario for the new currency. The European currency area exhibits greater macroeconomic stability, to the benefit of all its citizens, and also to the benefit of the world economy at large.  IV Three years into its life, the euro is the second most important currency in the world. It took over that role from the Deutschmark.  The euro has a share of roughly 13 per cent in international currency reserves – about as much as the Deutschmark had before. In this field, the dollar is the unchallenged leader, with two-thirds of international reserves. The size, depth and liquidity of the dollar markets, as well as the widespread habit of using the dollar for interventions and for pricing commodities, explain its predominance. The need to diversify and the growing importance of European financial markets make a rising share of euro reserves in central banks‘ portfolios possible.  As regards its use as a store of value, we find some evidence of the growing importance of the euro. 30 per cent of all international securities outstanding are denominated in euro. This share is slightly above the aggregate share of the predecessor currencies shortly before EMU was launched. That leaves the euro as the second-most-important currency in the international securities markets. Again, the dollar is the dominant currency, accounting for one-half of all international securities outstanding.  The currency composition of international bank assets presents a similar picture. Again, the dollar is the leading currency, with a share of 40 per cent, while the euro is in the process of catching up. From slightly less than one-quarter at the end of 1998, its share rose to 27 per cent. What can we see from these figures? Although habits in the international use of currencies change only gradually, the euro has already won a respectable market share. Its market share roughly equals the economic weight of the euro area.  Further progress in the development of broad, deep and liquid financial markets is a precondition for the expansion of the euro’s international role. Increased international use of the euro, as a currency for international reserve holdings, for investment and financing purposes, might have some bearing on monetary policy, but this potential impact seems manageable. Hence, in the Eurosystem, we have adopted a neutral stance towards the internationalisation of the euro. We regard it as a market-driven process, and we neither hinder it nor foster it.  
 BIS Review 98/2001 3 V The functioning of the European Monetary Union depends heavily on a high degree of financial market integration. Its smooth functioning enables monetary transmission to work. Progress in this field is tremendous, but more is yet to come.  Correspondingly, it is in the financial markets that the benefits of a common European currency are to be felt most clearly. The implications of the euro are obvious: rising liquidity, deepening and widening of the money, bond and stock markets, reduction of transaction costs and abolition of currency risks. The euro is speeding up financial market integration. Those parts of the European financial markets that are crucial to the transmission of the Eurosystem’s monetary policy are already integrated to our satisfaction. The wholesale market for interbank liquidity in the euro area is now actually a single European money market.  In addition, European banks are interconnected in a common payment-system infrastructure. And improvements to the euro-area-wide payment system are being undertaken. A few days ago, the Bundesbank launched its new payment system RTGSplus (Real Time Gross Settlement), which improves security, reduces liquidity needs and expedites settlements of large-value gross payments. Through this system, about 8,500 banks and credit institutions, including their branches all over the world, are accessible. VI The most impressive progress, in terms of integration, has been witnessed in the euro-area bond markets. Yield differences among the government bonds of the different participants have narrowed from more than five percentage points before EMU to some 30 basis points now. The remaining spread is mainly due to the varying liquidity of the paper issued. Currency risks or divergent monetary policies no longer disturb the euro-area-wide diversification. In terms of outstanding amounts, the euro-denominated bond market is still significantly smaller than that denominated in US dollars. But in terms of new issuance, both markets are on a par. One reason for that is the sharp rise in the new issuance of corporate bonds. Here again, diversification within the euro area has increased. The issuers' nationality, as a determinant of the yield and performance of bonds, has been superseded by other factors, especially by a sectoral view. Country diversification is being substituted by industry diversification. The volume of German government bonds is second in Europe only to the Italian bonds. Nevertheless, the ten-year German government bond, known as the “Bund”, enjoys benchmark status in EMU with the lowest yield and a remarkably liquid market. The “Bund” is the main underlying product for the contracts of Eurex, the derivatives exchange in Frankfurt. Since three-quarters of all bond futures traded in Europe are euro-Bund futures, Eurex has become by far the leading derivatives exchange in the world. With almost 500 million contracts, Eurex has clearly outperformed all other derivatives exchanges. Eurex is a good example of the international attractiveness of the German capital markets. More than 60 per cent of the participants in Eurex are non-Germans. Looking at corporate bonds, we can recognise the emergence of a "high-yield" bond segment in Europe and especially in Germany. Corporates are becoming increasing popular among both issuers and investors. In this way, firms become independent of bank financing and investors esteem the higher yield and the opportunity to diversify. Much new issuance is generating a high growth rate in this segment. The volume of non-public bonds in Germany is only about a sixth of the corresponding figure in the USA, but it is more than twice as much as in any other European country. A speciality of the German capital markets are the mortgage-backed bonds and municipal bonds known as “Pfandbriefe”. Both are a kind of asset-backed-security. The German “Pfandbrief” became so popular that other European countries copied the idea. Investors can gain some additional yield over public bonds, but without much risk. About 38 per cent of the issuers are triple-A-rated. “Pfandbriefe” are now issued in larger volumes and are placed internationally.  There are three developments which increase the German bond markets’ attractiveness for both issuers and investors:  (cid:1)(cid:2)a higher turnover and therefore increased liquidity,  
 4 BIS Review 98/2001 (cid:1)(cid:2)many new issuances and therefore more opportunities to diversify, and  (cid:1)(cid:2)a wider range of products, and therefore more chances to satisfy the needs of investors.  VII As in the bond markets, investors in the equity markets have shifted their perspective from country benchmarks to pan-European sector benchmarks. European equity markets are still small compared with those in the USA. The market capitalisation of domestic shares, as a ratio of GDP, reaches about 90 per cent. The matching figures for the USA and Japan are 152 per cent and 68 per cent, respectively. However, equity markets in the euro area are growing fast. The ratio of new issuance to market capitalisation averages over 4 per cent. This is twice as much as has been achieved in the USA or Japan. Germany has outperformed within the euro area in terms of the number of listed companies, of new stock issues, and of market capitalisation. The most impressive feature, however, is the ongoing growth of the capital markets and the potential to continue growing. Market capitalisation as a ratio to GDP in Germany is about 60 per cent. This reflects our bank-dominated financial system. However, market capitalisation of domestic stocks grew over the last decade by 17 per cent per year.  The turnover growth of the German equity markets is also reflected in a rising importance of investment funds and their assets. In Germany some 6,800 funds manage assets of more than 800 billion euro. Over the last decade the number of funds almost tripled, while their assets rose by 18 per cent per year. The German capital market has been able to provide the bulk of start-up financing in Europe. More than 200 venture capital companies operate in our country. They serve as a catalyst for new companies and – in the event of success – as a pacemaker for initial public offerings (IPOs), especially on the “Neuer Markt”, which is the high-tech and innovative segment of the German stock exchange. Germany benefits from a high degree of international attractiveness of its capital markets. About 235 foreign companies have their stocks listed in Germany, a number which is topped only by the USA and the UK. Germany is, of course, among the leading centres for central and east European business. In comparison to equity markets of other leading industrial countries, the German equity market has a remarkable potential for growth. Of the 3 million companies in Germany, only one-fifth are organised as corporations. Some one per cent of these are stock corporations. A little more than a tenth of these are listed on the exchange. Clearly, the stock corporations are more important in economic terms than their number suggests. But it is equally clear that even a small additional number of IPOs would cause a real surge in issuance on our capital markets. There are many initial public offerings in the pipeline. Quite a lot of medium-sized firms are thinking about using the financial opportunities offered by our liquid and well regulated equity markets. Two years ago, we witnessed the first municipal company to go public (Mannheim utilities) and there are hundreds of possible followers. As a result, a shareholder culture is emerging very fast. Compared to the USA and the United Kingdom, the percentage of shareholders in the total population is low in Germany – just like in Japan. The percentage in the USA and UK is about a quarter of the population, while our countries show little less than ten per cent. However, to judge this number for Germany you need to look at the historical development. The number of people holding shares and mutual fund units has doubled since 1997 and is still increasing, even this year. This clearly proves that we have an emerging equity culture. What is equally important is the changing structure of shareholdings in Germany. Investment funds, private households and foreign investors have a rising share, while the former dominance of companies as shareholders has vanished. The old picture of “Germany Incorporated” is disappearing and a market-based culture is emerging. This process will accelerate even more because capital gains from the sale of corporate shareholdings will be tax-free as of 2002. 
 BIS Review 98/2001 5 The overall picture of the German equity market is that of a high quality market, less important than those in the anglo-saxon world but with a high growth potential. The realized growth rate in the recent years is indeed impressive. For investors this provides a good opportunity to join the markets. A potentially high growth rate means better chances for gaining market share than a saturated market. One important medium and long-term effect is coming from the changes in the statutory pension schemes. Japan, Italy, and Germany are the countries with the most rapidly ageing population. In 2040 – according to demographic estimates – every working person in Germany will have to support one pensioner. And up to now our pension systems have mainly been financed on a pay-as-you-go basis. Probably less than 20 per cent of pensions are paid out of funded pension schemes. This share will rise because of the recent reform of the pension system and because of the rising number of pension funds. That also justifies the expectation of an ongoing growth rate for turnover and stocks on the German capital markets. One major asset for our capital markets are the highly efficient exchange structures, including the high-technology systems. But that applies only to the national markets. Looking at Europe or the euro area as a whole, we must admit that there is a segmentation of both stock exchanges and clearing and settlement systems. Even in Germany, besides the dominant Frankfurt Stock Exchange, there are seven regional stock exchanges which focus on special services and the specialisation or particular strength of their regional economy. This segmentation is hampering financial market integration to a considerable extent. A consolidation process has started and should be boosted further by legal harmonisation in the field of financial services. This weakness will be overcome step by step: The European Commission’s Financial Services Action Plan provides 42 proposals to frame legislation aimed at establishing a uniform European capital market by 2004. VIII Let me share some insights with you into the European and German banking sector. The degree of European integration in the banking sector is mixed. On the one hand, wholesale markets and investment banking are largely integrated. On the other hand, commercial credits and retail banking still operate in national, segmented markets. However, a few European banks created by cross-border mergers are slowly starting to offer retail services at a standardised level for customers in more than one country.  The financial system in the euro area is still highly bank-dominated. At the end of last year, credit financing totalled about 108 per cent of GDP. This is about as much as in Japan, and twice as much as in the USA. The picture is similar with deposits. In the euro area, they account for 80 per cent of GDP, and for 110 per cent in Japan, while the US figure is only about 40 per cent. However, capital markets are increasing in importance in the euro area. Disintermediation is gaining ground. Financial markets have boomed in recent years and investment banks (as well as non-bank financial firms like institutional investors, pension and investment funds) have enlarged their market share. Disintermediation will be enhanced by the need for pension systems to rely more on funded retirement schemes. Another trend is the centralisation and consolidation within the banking sector. The financial centres, and among them especially Frankfurt, will benefit from that trend. IX One could argue that financial services will be provided at the location of demand and that a centralisation does not necessarily improve efficiency. However, economies of scale, economies of scope, and the motivating and innovation-stimulating effect of personal (face-to-face) contact add up to large benefits for financial centres. Globalisation in world financial markets therefore means concentration. There is only room for a few large financial centres in the world, probably one or two for each time zone and some niches for minor players and actors. There are a couple of hard facts which prove the qualifications of Germany (Frankfurt) as the leading financial centre in the euro area: 
 6 BIS Review 98/2001 (cid:1)(cid:2)a stable currency, (cid:1)(cid:2)a full range and multiplicity of financial institutions, instruments and products, (cid:1)(cid:2)a high volume of funds available for investment, (cid:1)(cid:2)an innovative financial culture, (cid:1)(cid:2)an efficient legal framework,  (cid:1)(cid:2)a sound and competitive banking system, and (cid:1)(cid:2)a strong national economy in the background. The German financial centre is not restricted to Frankfurt. Important locations for financial services are for example Düsseldorf, Stuttgart, Berlin and Munich. Munich is the third largest location of insurance companies worldwide and leads the world in terms of insurance premia. There are 280 insurance companies located in that city, of which 80 maintain their head office in Munich. Among them is the largest reinsurer in the world. In addition, the internationality of Frankfurt and Munich is an important aspect. Frankfurt hosts the head offices of as many as 136 foreign banks, among them 13 Japanese banks. Frankfurt has a lively (English speaking) international financial community.  This has grown considerably since the ECB was located in downtown Frankfurt and all of those ECB watchers joined the former Buba watchers in our city. Frankfurt is the “City of the Euro”. A couple of international trade fairs, international schools and universities and, last but not least, the large airport and traffic hub “Rhine-Main” provides the necessary international flair. What we are working on now is the improvement of our intellectual infrastructure. This comprises the need for internationally comparable education degrees, the concentration on finance and banking as well as professional schools for further education. Much has been achieved in this field, but we have to improve to serve the recruitment needs of a financial centre. X Ladies and gentlemen, The new currency is a symbol of European integration. That has attracted a lot of interest in currency unions and in Europe all over the world. We are both pleased and proud to see this heightened attention for this unique historic event and the ongoing integration process in Europe.  Today I wanted to draw your attention to the integration and development of financial markets in Europe, with a focus on Germany. I hope that I managed to give you a reliable and true picture of the financial markets in Germany. But that is only part of the story. Listening, talking and hearing about it is not nearly as interesting and informative as going there and gaining insights yourself. You will always be welcome.  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attention. 
BIS Review 98/2001 1 Willem F Duisenberg: The ECB and the accession process Speech by Dr Willem F Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, at the Frankfurt European Banking Congress, Frankfurt, 23 November 2001. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, Let me first thank the organisers of this Frankfurt European Banking Congress for giving me the opportunity to address such a distinguished audience. Today I would like to share with you a few thoughts about the process of EU accession from a central banker's perspective, and review some of the issues that are of particular relevance to the ECB. Little more than ten years after the beginning of the transition to market economies in Central and Eastern European countries, the successful model of European integration is in the process of being extended. This testifies to the attractiveness of the European Union as a sound framework providing both political stability and economic progress. In a few weeks' time, on 1 January 2002, a new milestone will be reached when the euro, our money, becomes truly tangible. The introduction of the euro banknotes and coins indeed constitutes a historic event in the process of European integration, and represents a key accomplishment in the already long European experience. The changeover comes as we approach a situation in which inflation should fall below 2% and price stability should be restored. In line with our forward-looking strategy we have cut interest rates on the basis of reduced risks to price stability. Recent data are in line with expectations and confirm our decision of 8 November which took account of all relevant information. As President of the ECB, I would like to confirm that the euro will indeed eventually "go east". As many as 12 countries from central, eastern and southern Europe and the Mediterranean are currently negotiating accession to the EU. They have made remarkable progress, both in negotiations and in strengthening their economies and policy-relevant institutions. However, the road towards EU membership and, later, the adoption of the euro still poses a number of significant challenges.  What are these challenges? Let me focus briefly on three economic areas in which notable differences still prevail between accession countries and EU Member States: first, real convergence, second, nominal convergence and, finally, the structure and functioning of the financial sector. By "real convergence", I mean the broad adjustment through structural reforms and economic development of the economies towards structures prevailing in the EU. This requires, inter alia, the completion of the market economy transition agenda, further privatisation in some sectors, and the strengthening of the institutional and legal framework. Real convergence is seen as facilitating economic cohesion among Member States once they have joined EMU, thereby helping to minimise the risk and effects of asymmetric shocks. Hence, in order to enhance the process of real convergence as much as possible, accession countries should ensure that they make progress in the restructuring of their economies and gradually align them with those of the euro area. Real convergence is often interpreted as a catching-up in real income with the EU. Such a narrow measure is, however, only a rough proxy for the concept of real convergence I was referring to. Indeed, different income levels can be compatible with Monetary Union, as we know from our own experience in the euro area.  As for nominal convergence, accession countries have achieved a remarkable process of disinflation during the last decade. Inflation is expected to reach around 6% on average by the end of this year. Nevertheless, further progress on disinflation might turn out to be more complicated in the coming years. First, several macroeconomic and microeconomic factors as well as transition-related factors will continue to push up inflation in many accession countries. Second, what is known as the "Balassa-Samuelson effect", that is, the potential inflationary pressures arising from higher productivity growth in catching-up economies, has also been held responsible for higher inflation in accession countries. However, research has shown that this effect should not be overestimated. These factors should be borne in mind when designing monetary policy strategies. In this context, disinflation in accession countries should be promoted, at a pace determined by the overall economic situation and in particular by the need for these countries to foster real convergence. In addition, the Maastricht inflation criterion should not be regarded as an immediate requirement, but rather as a medium-term objective for the central banks of the accession countries. This should not mean, however, that 
2 BIS Review 98/2001 accession countries do not have to pay attention to progress in nominal convergence. On the contrary, a balanced monetary and fiscal policy stance and wage increases supported by productivity gains should favour the disinflation process of accession countries, and allow them to make progress on nominal and real convergence in parallel. As a specific topic that is of great relevance to the ECB in the accession process, I would like to mention the structure and functioning of the accession countries' financial sector. Significant progress has been made in restructuring and consolidating the banking sector over the past few years. This progress has been achieved through the large-scale privatisation of state-owned banks and the extensive opening-up of the banking sector to foreign ownership. This process has contributed to greater financial integration with the EU and significant gains in terms of efficiency and stability. However, the level of financial intermediation remains relatively low and the provision of bank financing represents a much smaller share of GDP in the accession countries than in the euro area countries. Furthermore, the financial sector of accession countries remains dominated by the banking industry, as capital markets are not yet fully developed. From an ECB perspective, further deepening of the accession countries' financial markets is needed to ensure the proper transmission of monetary policy impulses once they join the euro area, and it may also help these countries make full use of their growth potential.  Coping with any of the three challenges which I have just mentioned will have a significant impact on the design of monetary and exchange rate policies. Taking into account the different starting points and progress made so far in addressing these challenges, accession countries may well pursue different approaches in the pre-accession phase. Once in the EU, however, there is a clear path defined in the Treaty that should be followed by all EU Member States towards the adoption of the euro. First, immediately upon EU accession, the new Member States have to treat their exchange rate policy as a matter of common interest. Furthermore, in view of the final objective of adopting the euro, accession countries are expected to join ERM II at some point following accession to the EU.  Most accession countries have already expressed their intention to join the mechanism as soon as possible after their entry into the EU. However, it should be clear that ERM II membership does not need to happen immediately after EU accession in all cases, nor does ERM II membership need to be limited to only two years, which is the minimum for adoption of the euro. A longer membership of ERM II may, in some cases, be helpful since it would allow countries to retain the exchange rate as an instrumental policy variable during the catching-up process. Participation in ERM II should thus be seen as a meaningful and flexible framework for increasing convergence with the euro area, and for tackling the challenges faced by accession countries on the road towards the adoption of the euro. Finally, after having outlined the path along which the euro will go east, I would also like to say a few words about a path which I am confident will not be followed – and that is unilateral euroisation. Such an adoption of the euro outside the Treaty process would not be welcome as it would run counter to the important process of convergence prior to the adoption of the euro outlined in the Treaty. Unilateral euroisation would also imply circumventing the process of multilateral assessment of new members by current EU Member States and as such would be difficult to reconcile with the co-operative spirit of a community of fellow members. From the other perspective, I believe it would also not be in the interest of accession countries, as it would imply relinquishing monetary and exchange rate policy instruments at a very early stage of convergence for these economies. It would further deprive the countries concerned of a lender of last resort function and non-negligible seignorage revenues. Finally, it would make the integration of the central banks concerned into the Eurosystem operational framework much more difficult, if not impossible. Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to end my remarks here by saying that the Eurosystem is fully aware of the future implications of the ongoing accession process for the fulfilment of its own statutory objectives. As the historic process of reunifying Europe unfolds before our eyes, let me assure you that the ECB is ready and looking forward to playing its part. Thank you very much for your attention. 
 BIS Review 96/2001 1 Guy Quaden: Central banking in an evolving environment Speech by Mr Guy Quaden, Governor of the National Bank of Belgium, at the 23rd SUERF Colloquium, Brussels, 27 October 2001. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, I am particularly pleased to speak before this eminent forum and to have the opportunity of addressing the topic "Technology and Finance" from a central banker's point of view.  Technology and the challenges it raises for financial markets is a most appropriate theme for this Colloquium. On the one hand, technology is closely intertwined with the evolution of many other factors affecting financial markets and, so, allows coverage of a wide range of issues. On the other hand, it has farreaching consequences for all market participants, and this certainly includes central banks. In a first part I propose to briefly recall how technology has impacted on our macroeconomic and regulatory environment. In the next two parts I would like to sketch the main consequences of these developments on what my colleagues at the Bank of England have described as the two wings of central banking, i.e. monetary and financial stability. * *     * Technology is a powerful factor of change in our macroeconomic environment. So, a few years ago, our colleagues of the Federal Reserve had to recognize that something new was happening in the US economy: a persistent higher growth and lower unemployment without the emergence of inflationary strains. This was related, at least partly, to the revolution in the Information and Communication Technologies, which increased productivity growth and fostered efficiency in the labour market too. A third feature of the so-called New Economy, the reduction in the variability of output growth, obviously proved to be short-lived! But a wave of over-pessimism should not submerge the previous wave of over-optimism. The question whether the American economy is still on a higher trend productivity growth path remains open, as well as what the prospects for the European economy are in this respect. Europe will benefit from a specific driving force, the completion of the single market with the new single currency, which should trigger further structural reforms and hence foster innovative energies. Technology also radically transformed the financial sector, which by the way greatly contributed to the new technological wave by financing it. INew techniques in the treatment, the storage and the transfer of information exerted profound effects on a sector which is largely an information based industry.  In a first stage, Information Technologies made it possible to develop more sophisticated products, to build up a better market infrastructure, to implement more accurate and reliable techniques for the control of risks, to reach more distant and diversified markets, and to multiply the value and the volume of operations. In short, new technology has radically transformed all three major functions performed by banks, i.e. access to liquidity, transformation of assets and monitoring of risks. A new phase is presently at work with the emergence of e-money, e-banking and e-finance. It is clearly this new development which will represent the great challenge of the coming years. The speed of adoption of these new products remains difficult to forecast. Contrary to the preceding phase, this new wave is not limited to professional operators but involves all customers, including the retail market. Many of the scenarios suggested by IT firms or consulting groups have proved to be overly optimistic. At the same time, it would be wrong to become complacent. Most new technology is spreading following an S-shaped curve. The base section of the S can be quite long and practically horizontal; however, it will sooner or later be succeeded by a steep section. The example of Nordic countries, and more specifically Finland, shows how quickly e-finance can develop, once circumstances are ripe.  It is important to emphasize that the integration of new technology into the financial sector did not take place in isolation. Rather, it is the interaction of technology with another major development, deregulation, that contributed to reshaping the financial landscape. True, the pressure of the market to fully exploit the new technologies was strong, probably even irresistible. However a receptive 
 2 BIS Review 96/2001 environment had also been created by a lifting of the rather strict financial and banking regulations which were still prevalent at the end of the seventies.  The increased awareness of the wide-ranging possibilities offered by new technologies illustrated that a lot could be gained through the removal of distortions in competition, directly linked to excessive regulation or intrusion from the Government. In combination, these two evolutions contributed to the emergence of a more open, competitive and globalised financial market, which obviously improves efficiency in the world economy. The transition, however, has not been a smooth one. It was not easy for the authorities who had to cope with the more frequent arbitrages operated by market participants between the various currencies and financial instruments or even between different legal, regulatory or tax regimes. Neither was it easy for financial intermediaries that had to work in a much more competitive environment where traditional protection and barriers to entry were progressively lifted. In short, the shift toward a more liberalised system together with the quick expansion of new products and markets has greatly increased uncertainties and risks for financial sectors. This was not immediately recognised by many market participants who had previously been sheltered by the existing regulation. As a result, individual bank failures and banking crises, quasi non-existent between the end of the forties and the early seventies, became all too frequent during the past two decades. In this context, the absence of significant problems within the Belgian banking sector during the recent period must be considered more an exception than a rule. Despite deregulation there is still a major role to be played by public authorities, among others in the field of competition rules, consumer protection, fight against money laundering... and, of course, central banking. Central banks indeed have to provide stability, which certainly does not mean "no change" but, on the contrary, building the best foundations for a sustainable dynamism. In doing so, central banks will cope with the evolving environment shaped by technical progress, by deregulation and globalisation and, last but not least in Europe, by the single currency. * *     * As regards the first wing of central banking, monetary stability, central banks have to provide a durable anchor in order for the price system to appropriately guide economic decisions. A stable value of money is all the more necessary for preserving the information value of relative prices in a changing world, where decisions have to be taken rapidly. Maintaining price stability is the primary objective of monetary policy, not only for the Eurosystem - according to the Treaty of Maastricht- but also for every central bank. Nowadays the only regulations central banks rely on in designing the operational framework of monetary policy are the monopoly of banknote issuance and reserve requirements. The Eurosystem fully respects the principle of an open market economy with free competition, as enshrined in the Treaty. Its main instrument is the weekly allotment of credit by euro area-wide tenders. Minimum reserves, which are remunerated, have a stabilisation function, thanks to an averaging provision, and are enlarging the structural liquidity shortage of the money market. As the development of e-money is liable to weaken the leverage of the Eurosystem and in order to provide for a level playing field, e-money issuers should not escape reserve requirements. A European directive of last year rightly broadens the definition of credit institutions in order to include e-money institutions. Technological change and financial market developments do not only affect monetary policy instruments but also the whole transmission process and consequently the strategy of monetary policy. In this complex and changing world the Eurosystem was right in rejecting any simple rule and adopting an all-encompassing two-pillar strategy. Central bankers have to continuously reassess the information content of many economic indicators. Let me pick out some of them - output, money, stock prices and bond market indicators - not because other variables, like wage developments and the fiscal policy stance, are less important, but because the former are most affected by technological and financial market changes. Central bankers, even in the Governing Council of the ECB, are not insensitive to growth and employment prospects, as some critics argue. But they are well aware of two limitations: firstly, growth should not be stimulated to the detriment of price stability, because such a stimulus would be short-lived and would imply longer-term costs; secondly, as "à la plus belle fille du monde on ne peut 
 BIS Review 96/2001 3 demander que ce qu'elle a", monetary policy may exert some influence on the demand side of the economy but cannot solve structural problems, like persistent unemployment. Central banks may nevertheless contribute to output stabilisation, as far as the risks to price stability are linked to the business cycle. A central concept in this respect is the output gap, but its measurement, especially in real time, is surrounded with a large degree of uncertainty. Potential output growth, which is an ingredient of both pillars of the Eurosystem's strategy, is not known with precision. Should the New Economy materialise, higher rates of growth could become sustainable. In the absence of any firm evidence of a New Economy in the euro area - although some driving forces are to some extent in place - and since the emergence of a New Economy is not driven by monetary policy, the Eurosystem did not take the risk of pre-emptively accommodating it. Nevertheless it monitors a wide range of indicators in order to periodically reassess the "speed limit" of the euro area economy.  Needless to say, in the present circumstances growth is unfortunately even below the Old Economy speed limit, and the associated decrease in inflationary pressures has already prompted a 100 basis points interest rate cut in three steps since the spring.  The first pillar of the strategy of the ECB gives a prominent role to money. It is based on the conviction that inflation is a monetary phenomenon in the long run and underlines the medium-term orientation of monetary policy and the inheritance in this respect from the Deutsche Bundesbank. Recognising that the demand for money can be subject to short-term fluctuations which are harmless for price stability, the ECB has not announced an "intermediate objective" but rather a "reference value" for the growth of a broad monetary aggregate. The recent rise in M3 growth is up to now interpreted as being such a short-term fluctuation, caused by the relatively flat yield curve and the weakness in stock markets. Technology and financial market changes obviously affect the first pillar. They might increase the volatility of the income velocity of monetary aggregates and, as they are blurring the frontiers of "moneyness", they complicate the definition of key aggregates. To paraphrase a former Governor of the Bank of Canada speaking about M1 twenty years ago, I would say that while the ECB is not planning to abandon M3, I cannot rule out that, some day, M3 could abandon us, but you already noticed that the first pillar is much more than the reference value. It encompasses a broad monetary analysis which will duly take into account such developments. The first pillar also rests on the fact that credit institutions remain major players in the transmission process of monetary policy. The development of euro area capital markets could however increase the weight of financial market indicators in the second pillar. The stock market is still a much less important channel of transmission in the euro area than in the US, but the holding of shares is spreading, for example through mutual funds. I would not attempt to summarise the vast debate about the appropriate monetary policy reaction to asset price movements. I am inclined to say that central banks have not to put on these variables more emphasis than warranted by their effects on demand and should avoid asymmetric reactions - benign neglect in the case of irrational exuberance, intervention in the case of sharp downward correction - which could pose a moral hazard problem. The bond market provides indicators which are probably more important within the second pillar of the Eurosystem's monetary policy. Technical progress and European integration lead to more sophisticated and liquid markets which supply useful information about market expectations. Incidentally I notice that, while many central banks looked disapprovingly on indexed bonds prior to monetary union, the Eurosystem now welcomes the opportunity to extract information on inflation expectations from the comparison of yields on indexed and nominal bonds. Despite the upsurge in inflation in the euro area resulting from oil price and food price shocks, inflation expectations appear to remain very moderate, showing that the Eurosystem benefits from a high degree of credibility. Such a capital of credibility has to be preserved. * *     * About the second wing of central banking, the safeguarding of financial stability, I would like to adopt a chronological approach. First, how are central banks currently adapting to the new environment by reconsidering the role they are playing in the financial market? Second, how could new technology affect the relations in the coming years between market participants, central banks and other supervisory and regulatory authorities? 
 4 BIS Review 96/2001 Financial market developments and the heightened risks associated with these rapid changes led central banks to reconsider the role they had to play to preserve financial stability. For those central banks that were in charge of the surveillance of individual credit institutions, the implications were straightforward. They had to adapt the modalities of their micro-prudential activities. However, the need to proceed to macro-prudential monitoring was also strongly felt by central banks, like the NBB, which were not vested with the micro supervision. First, at an analytical level, central banks were induced to enlarge the scope of their research. The use of new technologies has caused a spectacular expansion in the volume of financial operations, certainly in comparison to the growth of real activities. This has required reconsidering the direction of the links between these two fields. Central banks had traditionally focused on the consequences that changes in financial conditions could have on the real economy. If such analyses remain essential, central banks are also increasingly concerned by the vulnerability of the financial system to fluctuations in real activities. So, the causalities also have to be reversed and due attention must be given to the impact that evolution of the real economy could have on the stability of the financial system. It is no coincidence that an increasing number of central banks now complement their traditional annual reports centred on monetary policy and macro-economic developments by another report focused on the theme of financial stability. This is a development that the NBB will also actively embrace through the publication, possibly starting in 2002, of a new yearly Financial Stability Report. At a more operational level, central banks contribute directly to strengthening the stability of the financial system by the development of secure and efficient payment and settlement systems. Here also new technology is playing a crucial role. Real time gross settlement systems, delivery versus payment mechanisms, cross-border connections between various clearing or settlement institutions, instant world transmission of information would be in practice unmanageable without the possibilities offered by IT technologies. These multiple layers of networks are too often considered as mere plumbing. However, this so-called plumbing is in many respects as spectacular and sophisticated as the more glamorous Internet or mobile phone networks. The oversight of these modern payment and settlement systems has become a key function in modern central banking and this certainly applies to the NBB, as Belgium is hosting two major international institutions, SWIFT and Euroclear. The second step in our chronological approach is also the most uncertain as it implies speculating about the impact of new technology on the future organisation of financial markets. It must be recalled from the outset that the introduction of new technology in the banking sector is not a one shot phenomenon. On the contrary, it is proceeding by waves. As already said, the development of e-money, e-banking and e-finance will represent a great challenge.  Whatever its speed, this new wave will strongly modify the nature of relations between market participants. Distant access to financial products is substituting for close individual contacts. Brand loyalty, while still a key asset in a business built on trust, is increasingly associated with cherry picking. Banks themselves tend to shift from an approach based on long term and stable relations to a strategy where each deal is individually appreciated on its own merits. The various financial institutions are also redefining what should be their core business. The technological wave of the eighties and early nineties allowed the unbundling of most financial products into their various components. To the unbundling of products is now associated, thanks to the second wave of innovation, an outsourcing of the production but also of the distribution process. Back office functions, distribution networks and IT infrastructures can now easily be subcontracted, creating a new web of connections between various categories of market participants.  There are also important changes in the relations between monetary and prudential authorities, on the one hand, and financial institutions on the other. First the authorities will have to rely, much more than in the past, on the markets themselves for the surveillance of financial stability. One may legitimately feel concerned by such an evolution, which sounds like asking the fox to watch over the hens. However we must realise that financial markets are not only a major factor of change, they are also potentially a powerful factor of discipline. They are forcing credit institutions to be more transparent and to communicate more reliable information. The development of new, more sophisticated, risk management techniques, under the form of internal models, has been, at its roots, a private initiative from market participants. In order to integrate this modeling approach in the monitoring of banks solvency, the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision is not designing a new system from scratch. 
 BIS Review 96/2001 5 On the contrary, it is referring to the best practices of the market itself as a benchmark against which to calibrate its own proposals. Now, the authorities should not delude themselves. Best practices are what they are, easier to respect by strong institutions and in favourable circumstances, but much harder to maintain when the situation deteriorates. Far from being lightened, the burden of prudential authorities is becoming heavier. The necessarily limited human and financial resources of these authorities will be called upon all the more by the new Basle proposals which will require a more individualised and detailed surveillance of these new internal risk management systems. The resource constraint will finally also strongly determine the relations that the various monetary and supervisory authorities will have to maintain among themselves. A more globalised financial market calls for a more globalised approach to supervision. At the international level, several co-operative bodies and mechanisms have been established, either in the form of multilateral forums bringing together the competent authorities in the fields of prudential control and financial stability, or by means of bilateral protocols concluded between the supervisory bodies of different countries or sectors. At each national level, the authorities also have to carry out an in-depth examination of their supervisory structure and procedures. I will not dwell here on the subject of the devolution of prudential tasks. Different models exist across the world bearing witness to the trade-offs which have to be made to adapt to market trends while also taking account of the specific national context.  Finally, this existing national and international framework needs to be periodically reviewed and adjusted. Whatever its form, the prevailing structure will have to fulfil two major conditions. On one hand, it must be efficient in preventing either loopholes or redundancy in supervision. On the other hand, it must be all encompassing by combining the microprudential control of individual institutions with macroprudential monitoring of the systemic risks faced by the global financial market.  * *     * To conclude, let me stress that central banks are fully aware of the close connection and the large convergence existing between the two goals of financial stability and monetary stability. Keeping inflation under control, which is the ultimate goal of every central bank, has proved to be the best way to reduce uncertainties on the market, to alleviate distortions and, so, to eliminate one of the fundamental sources of financial instability. Conversely, central banks need sound and efficient banking systems for ensuring rapid transmission, to the whole economy, of the impulses of their monetary policy. This is all the more important given that the assets at the disposal of central banks - the monetary base in our jargon- is becoming increasingly tiny compared to the total assets managed by credit institutions and, beyond that, by financial market operators. In this context, the monitoring of financial stability may certainly not be considered as a by-product or a mere extension of the traditional monetary stability objective of central banks. The two functions are closely related but distinct. In other words, the monetary stability and financial stability wings belong to the same bird. 
 BIS Review 95/2001 1 Donald T Brash: Monetary policy in “Interesting Times” Address by Mr Donald T Brash, Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, to the managers of small and medium-sized businesses, Whangarei, 21 November 2001. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen About seven or eight years ago, I was visited by a share-broker who told me what a great job the Reserve Bank had done in explaining its actions to the banks and the big corporates. I felt good, until he said “But frankly, you have done a lousy job communicating with the small and middle-sized businesses in New Zealand.” True, I protested, but I can’t even get a good mailing list to cover the tens of thousands of smaller businesses. “Fair enough”, he replied, “but every small business has a bank account. Put it on the banks to invite their small business clients to meetings which you host, and to which you speak.”  And from that conversation grew the idea of this meeting. We had meetings of this kind for the first time in 1995. We repeated the idea again in 1998. And now we are doing it for the third time this year. In part, we want to use this meeting to tell you how we see the world. And in part, we want to learn, from your questions and comments when I have finished, how you see the world. We are acutely aware that the health and vitality of the New Zealand economy depends to a huge degree on the health and vitality of the small and middle-sized businesses represented in this room. We live in “interesting times” You will recall the ancient Chinese curse “May you live in interesting times”. Sadly, these are “interesting times” and we all know why. Just one week after the terrible events of 11 September, the Reserve Bank made an unscheduled and largely unexpected interest rate cut, from 5.75 per cent to 5.25 per cent. Within the Reserve Bank, we briefly debated whether I should hold a press conference to explain what we had done. We decided not to, in large part because there would have been very little I could usefully have said. Essentially, what I could have said at that time was “We don’t know yet what the economic consequences of these events will be, and we certainly don’t know what they mean for inflation in New Zealand. All we can say is that confidence has taken a huge knock; this is more likely to reduce prices than to increase them; and under these circumstances there is scope for lower interest rates.” That would not have made for a very productive press conference. Time has moved on, and there is more we can say now. Last week, we issued our latest assessment of the outlook for the economy and for inflation, and reduced the Official Cash Rate by a further 50 basis points to 4.75 per cent. Why did we do that? Interestingly, when we looked over our shoulder at the historical data available to us, it was hard to see a justification for any cut in interest rates. The latest comprehensive information we had on economic growth showed that, in the first half of this year, the economy grew by 2.3 per cent, equivalent to an annual growth rate of more than 4 per cent. The latest information we had also showed that unemployment was at its lowest level in 13 years. Job advertisements, as surveyed by the ANZ Bank, were running at a high level. Many businesses were reporting that they had little unused capacity to meet increased demand. In some parts of the country, there were reports of great difficulty finding skilled and even unskilled staff. The world prices for many of our commodity exports, while lower than a few months earlier, were holding up surprisingly well. And to top it all off the exchange rate was not far above its all-time record low, which meant that, in New Zealand dollar terms, our exporters and tourist operators were being substantially insulated from the slow-down in the world economy.  To some extent, this was the same picture that we had painted in our August Monetary Policy Statement. There we had suggested that there might have been a case for an early increase in the Official Cash Rate were it not for the threatening clouds in the international economy. And that was weeks before we knew just how strongly the economy had grown during the first half of the year. But three months on, and notwithstanding the relatively robust historical data, we have cut the Official Cash Rate by a total of 1 per cent. We have done that because, despite the relatively strong position 
 2 BIS Review 95/2001 that the New Zealand economy is now in, we see the real prospect of the economy slowing down quite significantly over the next year or so. And if that slow-down occurs, interest rates can be lower than previously without jeopardising the price stability objective which the Reserve Bank is required to achieve. The basic cause of this rather abrupt change in the outlook for our own economy relates to a fairly substantial change in the outlook for the world economy. Back in early August, as our previous Statement went to press, the Consensus forecasts for the 14 countries which dominate our export trading suggested relatively slow growth this year but quite a marked pick-up in growth next year (figure 1). As we went to press with last week’s assessment, the general expectation was for growth to be significantly slower this year than previously expected, and growth next year to be even more markedly lower than previously expected (figure 2). And this deterioration in the world outlook seems to get somewhat worse with every passing week.

Figure 2 Export partner GDP growth -  November 2001 Monetary Policy Statement (annual average percentage change)  Source: RBNZ, Consensus. 
 BIS Review 95/2001 3 Moreover, the deterioration is not confined to a single country. Most economists are now expecting a recession in the United States. Almost all economists are expecting a recession in Japan. Several of our biggest trading partners in Asia are clearly in recession already. Europe continues to slow down. Only Australia, among our main trading partners, seems to be enjoying reasonably robust growth for the moment. (Figure 3) Figure 3 Sum of 2001 and 2002 export partner GDP growth  (annual average percentage change)  Source: RBNZ, Consensus.  And this slowdown in the world economy is bound to have an impact on the New Zealand economy, in particular by reducing the demand for our exports and reducing the prices of those exports. We are beginning to see that already, and as it occurs we expect to see both some reduction in growth in New Zealand and some downwards pressure on prices - including some reversal of the very strong increase in the price of things like meat and dairy products, which in recent months has done so much to push up the price of the average food-basket. So it seems reasonable to believe that inflation will be much less of a problem as we look forward 12 months than it has been over the last 12 months. Having explained our decision to reduce the Official Cash Rate last week, let me use this situation to make four points. Price stability means neither inflation nor deflation The first point I want to make is that the Reserve Bank is just as serious about keeping inflation above zero as it is about keeping it below 3 per cent. Dropping interest rates now is about preventing inflation falling too low. And if inflation threatened to go negative, you can be sure we would be very active indeed in stimulating the economy.  It’s been said that any fool can keep inflation down, and that’s true, but our task is much more demanding than that. I know our rhetoric is mostly about the economic and social costs of inflation, rather than about the economic and social costs of deflation. That’s because, at least in New Zealand, inflation has been much the more common problem, certainly for the last 60 years. Also, because New Zealand went through a period of quite high inflation in the seventies and eighties, we have had to work hard to persuade people that we are serious about keeping inflation down, in order to bring down inflationary expectations. But make no mistake. Inflation going below zero would be just as much a breach of the Reserve Bank’s inflation target as having it go above 3 per cent. Deflation causes its own set of economic problems and distortions, doing social and economic damage. And our policy deliberations are always, without exception, mindful of both risks. We are always trying to find the policy setting - the interest rate - which will deliver an inflation outcome which is neither too hot nor too cold. 
 4 BIS Review 95/2001 Preventing deflation is also part of the law under which I operate. The Reserve Bank Act 1989 makes it clear that monetary policy must deliver “stability in the general level of prices”. And the Policy Targets Agreement which I have with the Minister of Finance, a requirement of the Reserve Bank Act, defines “stability in the general level of prices” as inflation measured by the Consumers Price Index of between zero and 3 per cent. Deflation is not “stability in the general level of prices”, any more than inflation is. This means that, once price stability has been achieved, and as a very rough rule of thumb, the Reserve Bank’s monetary policy will be seeking to restrain inflationary pressures by raising interest rates roughly half the time, and will be seeking to restrain disinflationary pressures by lowering interest rates roughly half the time - as we did in the second half of 1998 and as we have been doing through most of this year. New Zealand goes into this world slowdown in a strong position Secondly, although New Zealand will be affected by the world slowdown, we are not completely hostage to external events. It is important that we don’t talk ourselves into a gloomy frame of mind just because the slowdown in the world economy could be substantial, and could last well into next year. When the world slowdown began, many sectors of the New Zealand economy were in rude good health economically, as I have mentioned - and I haven’t even mentioned such other advantages as a strongly capitalised banking system and a government running fiscal surpluses. In other words, we start into the slowdown from a good position.  Figure 4 Prices of New Zealand’s export commodities  (denominated in US dollars)  Source: ANZ. Yes, export prices look likely to fall, and indeed have already done so in a number of cases, but in US dollar terms they have, on average, been at relatively high levels for much of the last year or so (figure 4), and in New Zealand dollar terms they have been pushed up even further by the low level of the kiwi dollar (figures 5 and 6). This low exchange rate provides very useful insulation from the downturn in the world economy, by propping up returns to New Zealand exporters (and indeed returns to those competing with imports) despite weaker prices abroad. There has been a sharp decline in net confidence in the business sector in recent months, as measured by both the National Bank Business Outlook survey and by the quarterly survey undertaken by the Institute of Economic Research (figure 7). And businesses have become less confident not only about the economy in general, but also about the outlook for their own businesses.

 6 BIS Review 95/2001 But at least as of late last month, more businesses continued to expect an improvement in their own business over the year ahead than expected a deterioration. As you can see from the graph (figure 8), the National Bank survey for September, taken prior to the tragic events of 11 September, showed that only 6 per cent of businesses expected that their own business would deteriorate over the year ahead. By the October survey, that had increased to 16 per cent expecting a deterioration. In both surveys, roughly half of all respondents expected no change in their business over the period ahead. And despite the increased gloom, roughly twice as many businesses were expecting their business to improve as were expecting a deterioration, even in October. Figure 8 Expected business activity (September and October 2001 surveys)  Source: National Bank Business Outlook. Interestingly, surveys conducted in September by both the Employers and Manufacturers Association in Auckland, and the Canterbury Manufacturers Association in Christchurch, showed a remarkably upbeat mood in both cities. And both surveys were conducted after the events of 11 September. A survey conducted by Bancorp in late October found respondents (134 in all) more optimistic about general business conditions, and more confident about increasing investment expenditure, than a similar survey four months earlier. A more limited survey of the top 20 listed companies undertaken by the New Zealand Business Times, also in late October, found that, with only a single exception, corporates had not changed budget allocations or staff hiring intentions since 11 September - and the exception was “a company that is subject to a particular restructuring in its business.”1 Moreover, if the slowdown in the global economy affects us more adversely than we currently expect, there is scope to stimulate additional demand without causing inflation to accelerate. Typically, monetary policy is these days the policy instrument of choice for providing temporary stimulus to the economy. We have now eased monetary policy by reducing the Official Cash Rate from 6.5 per cent early this year to 4.75 per cent currently. There is little doubt that that reduction will help to cushion the effects of the international slowdown. But if we need to reduce the Official Cash Rate further, there is clearly plenty of room to do so, and in that respect we are in a very much easier position than the one in which the Japanese central bank finds itself, with official interest rates already at zero, and with no further reductions possible. So there is good reason for businesses in New Zealand to be more optimistic about the future than is the case in many of our trading partners: New Zealand starts from a situation of relatively strong growth, and there is ample scope for monetary policy to stimulate the economy if that should be needed, without jeopardising price stability.                                                        1  New Zealand Business Times, 2 November 2001. 
 BIS Review 95/2001 7 But unfortunately policy is unable to provide complete protection But thirdly, having said that, it is unfortunately quite impossible for policy-makers, whether in the government or in the Reserve Bank, to protect your business from all the effects of the global slowdown. In part that is because policy - whether government fiscal policy or Reserve Bank monetary policy - works with what in the trade we call a long lag, or delay. In other words, the time between when the Reserve Bank changes the Official Cash Rate and when that change impacts your business will almost certainly be many weeks and probably many months. I have heard that some businesses believe that a change in the Official Cash Rate can have an almost instantaneous impact in the market, because of the effect which such a change can have on confidence. But that is surely the exception rather than the rule. In most situations, the lag or delay between a change in monetary policy and the impact of that change on the economy is typically more than a year. To make life even more complicated, the lags are not only quite long but are also variable - they vary somewhat from situation to situation. This means that, if we had to offset the effect of, say, a world economic slowdown on the New Zealand economy by easing monetary policy, we would need perfect ability to see the future for more than a year ahead, perfect understanding of precisely where the economy is now, and perfect understanding of how the economy works. Well, we do our best, and I am fortunate to have some of the brightest economists in New Zealand on my staff, trying to discern the future. We study 6,000 data series. We look for relationships which look realistic in recent history. We talk to businesses up and down the country - about 50 or 60 before each quarterly Monetary Policy Statement. We use some sophisticated economic models, but stir in very large amounts of judgement. We are constantly looking to update our assessment of the real economy outside the Reserve Bank’s doors. We get a steady flow of data relevant to New Zealand from overseas economies. We believe we are as well-informed about the economy as any other organisation in New Zealand, and better informed than most.  But we can still get it wrong. Let me illustrate. One of the most reliable relationships in recent economic history is that the world prices of the commodities New Zealand exports tend to rise when the economies of our trading partners are buoyant, and tend to fall when the economies of our trading partners are subdued. That sounds pretty much what one might expect on the basis of common sense, and that is consistent with the data (figure 9).  Figure 9 NZ’s export partner growth and world commodity prices  Sources: RBNZ, Consensus, ANZ.  
 8 BIS Review 95/2001 Figure 10 World export price index projections (previous Monetary Policy Statements)  Source: RBNZ. November 2001 is central projection. So since at least the December 2000 Monetary Policy Statement, we have been expecting the prices of our commodity exports to decline (figure 10). And we projected the same thing to happen in March this year, even though in the intervening period prices had risen some more, despite a steady weakening in the world economy. And we projected prices to fall in our May Statement, even though they had risen some more, despite still more weakening in the world economy. And in our August Statement, we again projected world prices to fall, even though by August they had risen still further and the world economy was looking quite seedy! And in the Statement we issued last week, we still projected that the slowdown in the world economy would produce a fall in our export prices! Indeed, had we not expected our export prices to fall, the case for reducing the Official Cash Rate last week would have been non-existent. Should we have changed our expectation about export prices because over most of the last year the traditional relationship between export prices and the growth of our trading partners has broken down? Obviously we don’t think so, but the example is a good illustration of the difficulty of forecasting the economy even in “normal” times.  And of course these are anything but normal times. No economic model, and no economic forecaster, could have foreseen the events of 11 September. By definition therefore, given the long and variable lags between a change in monetary policy and the impact of that change on the real economy, and the inability of even the most experienced central bankers to foresee the future, we will sometimes fail to adjust policy sufficiently quickly to protect your business from a sharp downswing - or for that matter, from a sharp upswing (though that may well cause fewer complaints!). There is another reason why monetary policy can not protect your business from all the adverse effects of world events. Even if we had super-human ability to see into the future, the reality is that world events have quite different effects on different industries and different regions. Monetary policy, with its single interest rate instrument, can only react to the balance of inflationary pressures in the economy as a whole, not to the pressures in individual industries. In other words, we can’t have a high interest rate to restrain the very buoyant conditions in the dairy industry but a low interest rate to support the software export sector, which has been adversely affected by the sharp deceleration of spending on information technology in the United States. We can only have an interest rate which seems appropriate to the economy as a whole - and must accept that that interest rate will seem far too high for some parts of the economy and will be arguably too low for other parts. We saw that situation rather clearly in the mid-nineties, when the building sector was experiencing quite strong inflationary pressures, but many export industries were experiencing quite strong disinflationary pressures. It would have been great to have been able to have a high interest rate applicable to the building sector but a low one applicable to export industries. But as long as we have a common currency throughout New Zealand, that is not an option. So the Reserve Bank can help your business by trying hard to anticipate developments in the New Zealand economy, and can adjust monetary policy quickly if it looks likely that inflationary or 
 BIS Review 95/2001 9 deflationary pressures will emerge. But we can’t provide complete protection, either for the economy as a whole or, even more clearly, for each industry and region. Monetary policy doesn’t determine the economy’s long-run growth rate Finally, it is important to be aware of what monetary policy can and can not do for the economy’s long-run growth rate. There is now virtually unanimous opinion among economists and policy-makers around the world that central banks can’t engender faster economic growth by being more tolerant of inflation. On the contrary, there is a virtually unanimous view that the best thing that monetary policy can do for economic growth is to keep inflation low and stable.  It is a myth, though one clearly believed by some New Zealanders, that the United States economy has grown faster than the New Zealand economy over the last decade because the US central bank has a mandate to encourage growth and maintain price stability, whereas the New Zealand central bank has only a mandate to maintain price stability. The reality is that in both countries it is now fully recognised that the best thing which monetary policy can do to encourage growth is to keep inflation under control. In that respect, the Federal Reserve and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand think and operate in the same way. This is not the place for a comprehensive discussion on the determinants of trend growth in output. Essentially, economic growth depends on growth in inputs of labour and capital, and advances in the productivity with which that labour and capital are employed. And most of the things which impact on those factors are quite unrelated to monetary policy. Some studies have suggested that high levels of taxation discourage growth through their effect on incentives to work, save and innovate. Others have pointed to the importance of protecting private property rights if growth is to be dynamic. Still others note the importance of human capital, and highlight the role of education as a determinant of economic growth. And of course there are many other relevant factors, such as the rules and regulations which may make undertaking new investments a slow and cumbersome process. Getting policies in all of these areas right is crucial if trend growth is to be increased, and none of them are policies susceptible to central bank influence. Conclusion So in conclusion, in these “interesting times” -  • First, the Reserve Bank is as committed to avoiding deflation as to avoiding inflation, and that means that we will always be leaning against the wind to the best of our ability, tending to tighten policy if inflation looks likely to rise in the future, and tending to ease policy if inflation looks likely to fall below the bottom of our target.  • Second, the New Zealand economy is well-placed to weather the international slowdown, with moderate growth, low unemployment, an exchange rate which is providing useful support for export and import-competing industries, and ample scope for further easing of monetary policy if that should prove necessary.  • Third, even with the best will in the world, the best economists in the world, the most regular contact with companies up and down the land, monetary policy can never provide you with complete protection against the vagaries of life, whether these vagaries come in the form of international crises or in the form of some dramatic domestic development. • And fourth, monetary policy doesn’t determine the economy’s long-term growth rate - that is determined by a whole range of factors which have nothing directly to do with the Reserve Bank. Sometimes the Reserve Bank will need to leave monetary policy unchanged for months on end. Sometimes we will need to adjust interest rates in small incremental steps, as earlier in the year. And sometimes we will need to adjust rates more aggressively, as over the last couple of months. Different circumstances will require different responses. But what I can say is that, in “interesting times” as in normal times, the role of monetary policy is to help and not to hinder, and that is what we are committed to doing. 
 BIS Review 95/2001 1 Birgir Ísleifur Gunnarsson: Monetary issues in the European Union and Iceland Speech by Mr Birgir Ísleifur Gunnarsson, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Central Bank of Iceland, at a seminar organised by the Iceland Trade Council, Euro Info office in Iceland and the EU Commission on the theme: Does the Euro affect Iceland?, Reykjavik, 31 October 2001. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen: The evolution of European integration during the second half of the last century is remarkable in many ways. This process began soon after the end of World War II and represented an effort to forge stronger bonds between European nations and thereby, among other things, reduce the likelihood of further conflict on the continent. Although I shall not go into its history here, many notable milestones can be cited along the course that has been taken. One of the most notable was the formal establishment of the Economic and Monetary Union in the beginning of 1999. Now the abolition of the individual member nations’ separate currencies is in sight. As of next year they will be replaced by Euro notes and coin. Not only will prices of goods and services be calculated and stated in a single currency in the twelve EMU countries, but the same notes and coin will be used for business in them all. One consequence of pricing in a single currency in all member countries will be to facilitate buyers of goods and services greatly in making price comparisons, and competition within the EU will certainly become more active than it has been until now.  Economic and Monetary Union The EMU has a population of more than 300 million and accounts for 16% of global GDP. By way of comparison, the USA has a population of 280 million and accounts for 22% of global GDP. Exports of goods and services are equivalent to 19% of EMU GDP, while the corresponding figure for the USA is under 11%. Some 19% of total world merchandise exports come from the EMU, and 15% from the USA. Twelve of the fifteen EU nations belong to the EMU. The UK, Denmark and Sweden remain outside it, but their positions differ somewhat. Denmark and the UK have stated reservations about membership, on which they have reached agreement with other EU states. Sweden, on the other hand, has opted to remain outside the EMU, although no special reservations have been agreed upon for them. Denmark is involved in currency cooperation with the EMU, one aspect of which is that the exchange rate of the Danish krone may not deviate from the Euro by more than 2.25% from a defined central rate. Denmark therefore enjoys limited monetary independence. This is reflected in the fact that the Danish Central Bank invariably alters its interest rates in the wake of announcements of changes in the European Central Bank (ECB) policy rate. Sweden and the UK have opted for inflation targeting as their monetary policy framework, which therefore does not have the objective of keeping these countries’ currencies stable against the Euro. European Central Bank The Maastricht Treaty stipulates monetary arrangements in the EMU. The EU countries created a framework for the ECB’s activities which was to some extent modelled on the Central Bank of Germany but differed in many ways from the arrangements in others. Various conditions were set which EU members had to fulfil in order to be granted EMU membership. On the one hand these related to major components of economic developments, such as inflation, fiscal deficit, government debt and interest rates. On the other hand they addressed the framework that the Maastricht Treaty lays down for monetary policy implementation in the EMU.  This policy was consistent with growing support for the view that it was natural to set a simple target for central banks – i.e. promoting price stability – and to increase their independence from the political leadership in pursuing their main objectives, and to strengthen their financial independence. Another emphasis was that, at the same time as the central banks’ independence was strengthened, stricter demands would need to be made of them regarding transparency in their activities and actions, and regarding accountability towards the government and general public.  
 2 BIS Review 95/2001 All this was reflected in the Maastricht Treaty. The European Central Bank, which formally began operation in the middle of 1998, enjoys extensive independence and is subject to requirements for transparency and accountability. Even though Sweden is not yet a member of the EMU, it amended legislation on its own Central Bank which now largely fulfils the Maastricht terms. The Bank of England’s legislation does not entirely fulfil the terms of the treaty, but it was granted greatly increased independence a few years ago. Denmark has still not amended its central bank legislation, although this will need to be done in the event of Denmark joining the EMU, not least to give legal sanction to its independence.  Price stability is the main objective The Maastricht Treaty set a single objective for the European Central Bank, namely ensuring price stability. Price stability was not defined in the treaty, however; this was done by the ECB itself, which specified it as an annual rise of under 2% in the Harmonised Consumer Price Index. A separate treaty on stability and economic growth stipulates that EMU members should aim for long-term fiscal balance or a surplus, and a public sector deficit of less than 3% of GDP. The decisive viewpoints behind the formulation of the European monetary framework were also dominant in many other parts of the world. Examples are industrialised nations such as Australia and New Zealand, while numerous others, such as the transformation economies of Eastern Europe and newly industrialised countries in Latin America and Asia amended their legislation to reflect the main principles of simple target-setting, independence and transparency.  Even though Iceland was not a party to European monetary cooperation and there was no outlook for a change in this situation for the foreseeable future, the Central Bank of Iceland felt that it ought to monitor developments as closely as possible. The forerunner of the ECB, the European Monetary Institute, was founded in the beginning of 1994 and the Central Bank of Iceland soon established formal relations with it. This continued after the ECB began operation. Central Bank experts have also had ready access to ECB experts on various issues concerning the formulation and, not least, the implementation of monetary policy. One fruit of the Central Bank’s work in this area was a comprehensive report published in mid-1997 on the Economic and Monetary Union.  The Central Bank of Iceland changed its monetary instruments In March 1998 the Central Bank of Iceland made an extensive reform of its monetary instruments. The guiding principle was to bring these instruments into line with those already decided for the ECB, even though it had not yet become functional. Consequently, since this time the Central Bank of Iceland has employed working procedures which in principle are analogous to those used by the ECB. The main difference is in the repurchase agreement auction format. Hitherto, the Central Bank of Iceland has auctioned unlimited amounts at a fixed rate of interest. Initially the ECB decided both the interest rate and total amount of its repo auctions at any time. The result was that the ECB only accepted a fraction of the bids made for its repos. This arrangement was abandoned and more recently the ECB has invited bids for a specific amount, but not at any predetermined rate of interest. Amounts are decided on the basis of the ECB’s assessment of the credit institutions’ liquidity requirement and the money market interest rates which it aims to achieve. One reason for the ECB’s choice of this format is that the various EMU central banks operated different arrangements for liquidity facilities before the ECB was established, and different viewpoints needed to be reconciled.  Regarding other aspects of central bank activities and their effect in Iceland, it should perhaps first be pointed out that the Central Bank of Iceland began increasing the transparency of its activities and actions long ago. Among other things, this is reflected in the Bank’s efforts to explain more clearly its policy and assessment of the economic and monetary situation and outlook. One step in this direction was taken towards the end of 1999 with a thorough review of the Bank’s publishing activities. It ceased publication of Monthly Statistics, which had appeared since 1974, and launched the quarterly Monetary Bulletin which provides a much better forum than earlier publications for presenting in-depth explanations of the Bank’s assessment of the economic and monetary situation and outlook, its measures in domestic markets and its policies. Furthermore, the new bulletin created an opportunity to present other material which directly or indirectly concerns the Bank’s policy. It was also decided that the bank’s quarterly inflation forecast would be published in Monetary Bulletin. Thus Monetary Bulletin can be described as the main platform today for the Central Bank’s accountability towards the Government and general public.  
 BIS Review 95/2001 3 New Central Bank Act The most important milestone in the changes affecting the Central Bank, however, was reached this year with new legislation passed by parliament. A committee appointed by the Prime Minister at the end of last year submitted its proposals for a draft Central Bank Act in March. The bill was presented to parliament in the beginning of April and such a broad consensus was reached that it was passed with the unanimous votes of all 56 members of parliament who attended the final vote. The new Central Bank Act is closely modelled on the legislative framework that had been created for central banks in other countries in recent years, including the EMU. A simple target was set for the Central Bank of Iceland, i.e. to promote price stability, it was granted full independence to use its instruments, its financial independence was ensured and legal requirements were made for transparency and accountability, along with other points. I think it is fair to say that the new Central Bank Act generated interest internationally, not least for the speed at which the legal review was made and the broad consensus achieved on the reforms.  The Central Bank Act authorises the declaration of a numerical target for inflation, subject to the Prime Minister’s approval. This provision incorporates into law the policy introduced on March 27 this year when the monetary framework was changed and the flexible fixed exchange rate was replaced with an inflation target and floating exchange rate. Despite very detailed discussion of the framework changes and the fundamental principles of the new policy, the Bank has often noticed widespread misunderstandings. I shall therefore outline the broad principles of monetary policy.  Inflation is a monetary phenomenon The Central Bank was assigned a specific inflation target in the joint declaration which it issued, with the Government, on March 27. This stipulated that the Bank should aim for a rate of inflation as close as possible to 2½%. Tolerance limits were also set, 1½% higher than the inflation target and 1½% lower. The inflation target was defined as the twelve-month rise in the CPI. If inflation exceeded the tolerance limits, the Bank would be obliged to bring it back within them as quickly as possible. At the same time the Bank would be obliged to submit a report to the Government, which would be made public, stating the reason for the deviation, its planned response and the length of time that it expected to take to bring inflation back within target. When the target was set, inflation was running relatively high in Iceland. Bearing that in mind, the upper tolerance limit was set for 6% this year, 4½% in 2002 and then 4% from the year 2003 onwards.  Upheavals in the foreign exchange market in the spring and a sharp depreciation of the króna caused a substantial rise in inflation, which exceeded the upper tolerance limit in June. The Central Bank submitted a detailed report to the Government on June 20. Other aspects of the joint declaration included a provision that, notwithstanding the abolition of the exchange rate target band, the Central Bank would intervene in the interbank market in foreign exchange by buying and selling currency if it deemed this necessary in order to contribute towards attaining the inflation target, or if it viewed exchange rate swings as a threat to financial stability. At the same time, the Central Bank undertook to produce a quarterly inflation forecast projecting two years into the future.  It should be remembered that one of the main reasons for the simplification of central bank targets in recent years, and for assigning them the main objective of price stability, is that inflation is primarily a monetary phenomenon and the long-term impact of monetary policy is above all on prices. Its impact on economic growth and employment is therefore generally only temporary. Since central banks broadly speaking have only one instrument, i.e. interest rates, and can therefore only achieve a single long-term macroeconomic goal, it is natural to set price stability as the ultimate monetary goal. This is not to say that price stability is a more important goal than, say, full employment, but simply that monetary policy instruments are inherently better suited to impacting prices. It is pointless to set objectives for monetary policy which it cannot achieve. Through price stability, a forward-orientated monetary policy can contribute towards creating a stable economic environment on which the long-term growth potential of the economy is based.  From the above it is clear that the Central Bank’s main task is to achieve the inflation target, and this is what it aims to do. There have been vocal calls recently for the Central Bank to ease its monetary stance in order to soften or even prevent a looming economic contraction. The growth outlook has an impact on the output gap, i.e. the deviation in demand from a level which is consistent with balanced supply and demand for domestic goods and factors of production. The output gap is subsequently one of the factors that play a key role in the inflation cycle. All things being equal, the growth outlook thus 
 4 BIS Review 95/2001 exerts an influence on monetary policy, namely the worse the outlook, the lower the interest rate, and the contrary. For as long as inflation remains at its present high level, however, it is unavoidable to allow the output gap to shrink sufficiently and the Central Bank cannot apply its instruments at this stage to prevent that happening.  High interest rates are counter-inflationary The Central Bank has held the view that, until clear signs emerge that its August inflation forecast will hold good, it is still not safe to lower interest rates. Impulsive action could entail a risk that inflation will magnify even further, with very dire consequences for households, businesses and economic growth conditions. Claims have also been heard that Iceland’s high interest rates are inflationary rather than counter-inflationary. The Central Bank does not agree with this view, which cannot be supported with economic theories, studies or research. On the contrary, there is every indication that interest rates have a similar effect in Iceland to that elsewhere. The Icelandic economy was showing signs of strong overheating which apparently peaked last year. It is beyond doubt that the tight monetary stance made a major contribution towards cooling the economy. And such a winding down was necessary, too, since great macroeconomic imbalances had emerged, reflected most clearly in an unacceptable current account deficit and inflationary pressures. It is therefore inevitable that the output gap will narrow in order to bring down inflation, and that national income will drop even further in order to achieve a significant reduction in the current account deficit, which is far beyond a sustainable long-term level.  High interest rates can be painful, not least for the households and businesses that have been imprudent in their consumption and investments recently and have relied too heavily on the facilities of credit institutions. It is out of the question for the Central Bank to base its interest rate policy on the actions of the least prudent members of the community. This can only be based on provisions made in laws and the joint declaration by the Government and the Central Bank this March, i.e. to promote price stability. This is the guiding aim of central bank activities in industrial countries around the world, because it creates a climate for economic growth and greater well-being for citizens. In a world of free capital movements and greatly enhanced access to credit compared with earlier times, businesses and households, and credit institutions too, must find their bearings for themselves.  Understandably, many people complain about high interest rates, but the lively debates in recent weeks have often revealed excessive faith in the effect that an interest rate cut would have on economic developments. A slowdown in economic activity is not solely caused by interest rates. Other factors that deserve to be mentioned are the contractionary impact of fishing quota cuts, the downturn in the IT sector which is closely linked to global trends, and fluctuations in power-intensive development projects which are unaffected by domestic interest rates. Cutting interest rates now would have a limited immediate effect on the supply side of the economy, while high interest rates act with full force on the demand side where they serve to reduce inflation and domestic demand, which will contribute to improved macroeconomic balance and low inflation.  Iceland’s currency options I have outlined various aspects of the Central Bank’s monetary policy. As I mentioned, Iceland has not taken part in European currency cooperation. Various currency framework options that Iceland ought to consider are often named in public discussions. A detailed account of most of them was given in the Central Bank’s 1997 report on the EMU. It is frequently said that Iceland ought to adopt the Euro as its currency, either unilaterally or through associate membership of the EMU. I strongly warn against simplifying the options available to us in this respect. Even if associate membership were being offered, which does not seem likely, it seems fair to assume that any country which was interested in it would need to fulfil the Maastricht Treaty requirements for EMU membership. These include a rate of inflation no higher than 1½% above that in the three EU countries where it is lowest, a one-year record of average nominal interest rates on long-term bonds no more than 2% higher than in the three EU countries where inflation is lowest, and membership of the ERM for at least two years without devaluing the currency and without exceeding the deviation band. Iceland will obviously not be fulfilling these conditions in the immediate future. Some form of EMU membership in the future would therefore not release Iceland from the obligation to bring inflation down to a similar level to that among its trading partner countries. It may be added that even if Iceland fulfilled all these conditions, it is extremely unlikely that it would be able to negotiate, in the foreseeable future, associate membership 
 BIS Review 95/2001 5 of the EMU or some kind of other bilateral currency cooperation with it. All the signs point in the opposite direction, whatever the phrasing of individual articles in the Treaty of Rome and Maastricht Treaty might suggest. Furthermore, it should be pointed out that twelve Eastern European countries are waiting to be admitted to the European Union and, later, the EMU. The ECB and Community leadership have firmly underlined that these nations should fulfil all the conditions for participation in EMU. Thus the EU is highly unlikely to agree to set any precedent which these nations could take advantage of as a short-cut into the EMU.  Iceland has chosen to remain outside the EU and has not declared an interest in membership. If Iceland were to show an interest in adopting the Euro as its currency, the most obvious course would be to join the EU with all the advantages and obligations that this entails, including membership of the EMU. Such a decision, however, depends on more factors than just the national currency, and this process would take a good many years. Of course, this is a highly political question and therefore outside the scope of this address. We need to continue to find our bearings in the global community as a nation with its own currency, which in an environment of free capital movements calls for very disciplined economic policy implementation. Ladies and Gentlemen: Representatives of all EU countries were involved in formulating and developing the Economic and Monetary Union. They created a monetary framework within the EMU which they regarded as serving the Community’s citizens best. Although Iceland stands outside the EMU, we have incorporated into our monetary policy implementation much of what the EU countries agreed that best served their interests. I am convinced that we will benefit from this. 
 BIS Review 94/2001 1 David Klein: The damage which rapid increase of government expenditure causes to economic growth Speech by Mr David Klein, Governor of the Bank of Israel, at the conference on “Israel’s Economy as 2002 Approaches”, Tel Aviv, 31 October 2001. *      *      * The background Every year the question “what is the desired budget deficit?” is raised, even though all governments in the last ten years adopted a policy which was supposed to reduce the deficit. Those favoring a rise in the deficit argue that the tax burden should not be raised, certainly not across the board, but that government expenditure should be increased to meet certain “needs”. Such needs are natural and understandable, whether one is dealing with security, or helping families in need, or increasing the water supply in hot, dry Israel, or providing aid for factories encountering difficulties in a competitive market, or improving education, particularly in development areas, or updating the items covered by the national health scheme, or relieving traffic congestion in the major metropolitan areas, etc., etc.; the list is endless. If the needs criterion were the only one, the budget deficit, and with it the government’s debt, would rocket. The reason that this does not occur is the worldwide consensus that a policy which increases government expenditure and the budget deficit by more than the rate of growth of the economy will-beyond a certain limit-cause more harm than good. But where is that limit? The US provides an interesting example of this. As a result of the terrorist attacks on 11 September the need arose to increase federal government expenditure, and voices can already be heard referring to a return to “big government” in the US. To put matters into proportion, however, anyone looking at figures published recently by the OECD will see that public-sector expenditure in the US in 2001 prior to the attacks was estimated at 30 percent of GDP, the lowest in the world. The increase in expenditure under discussion resulting from the state of emergency is less than one percent of GDP, with the main support being provided by tax cuts-some of that temporary due to concern about a rise in long-term interest and the depressing effect this would have on growth. Israel, on the other hand, using the same yardstick, has the highest figure, 54 percent of GDP, more than the other members of the OECD. Have we crossed the limit? All Israel’s governments and the parliaments which approved the budgets in the last decade answered in the affirmative: the share of public-sector expenditure in GDP in Israel is too high, and reducing it is the best way to cut the deficit and the huge government debt. Leading the process, as the entity responsible for seeing the broad picture, was the Ministry of Finance, with the backing of the Prime Ministers, and insofar as it matters, also of the Bank of Israel. However, there were always government ministers, Members of Knesset, various experts, commentators, and others who thought that a further response must be given to meet some specific needs. Thus it was, and thus it always will be. The question “where is the limit?” is clearly of concern to other countries too. Following several decades of rapid increases in government budgets throughout the world since the middle of the twentieth century, increases which exceeded their countries’ rates of economic growth, and accompanied by increases in the tax and debt burden, the process halted, and with good reason. We will detail below the damage caused by rapid increases of government expenditure, and relate it to the current situation in Israel’s economy. Financing a rise in government expenditure by raising the tax burden  When the increase in government expenditure is financed by higher taxes, two types of damage are caused:  • People are less willing to invest and work, an “underground” economy is created, and there is a build-up of strong pressures to distort the tax system by granting exemptions for all sorts of reasons (the latest example is that of the Negev laws; the next in line is the recognition of 
 2 BIS Review 94/2001 mortgage interest as tax deductible. It is estimated that total tax benefits in 2001 will come to NIS 29 billion, 60 percent of which is via the capital market). The tax burden is being borne by a smaller and smaller part of the population.  • The second effect, to which we were exposed only in the last few years, offers an even more serious threat: international competition on taxes. This encompasses all types of tax: on individuals’ labor income; on companies; and on income from capital. Failure to meet this competition provides an incentive to Israelis and Israeli companies to build their economic future abroad, and is an important factor for nonresidents considering whether to operate in Israel. It is clear that in open economy such as Israel’s the tax burden cannot in the long run be higher than that abroad.  The tax burden in Israel relative to GDP is higher than the average in the OECD, although there are countries (France, Denmark, Italy, and Sweden) where it is higher than ours. Distortions in the taxation of financial income Despite what was said above, the main problem in Israel is not so much the total tax burden as the composition of tax revenues. Among the numerous subjects requiring attention in this regard (such as the sharp rise in tax rates on labor income as the latter increases, with the top tax bracket applying at a relatively low level of income; the heavy burden of indirect taxes; low taxation on capital), we will concentrate here on just one, taxation of interest income of individuals and mutual funds. The current situation suffers from the following distortions: • Local-currency deposits are tax exempt; foreign-currency deposits in Israel are taxed. • Savings schemes are exempt; tradable government and private indexed bonds are taxed.  • Unindexed government bonds are tax free, while similar private bonds are taxed. The tax, where applicable, is 35 percent, and in some cases higher. There is thus a very grave distortion here. This situation causes serious damage to the functioning of the financial markets in the following ways:  • It obliges the business sector to depend on banks as almost the sole source of finance in Israel, and does not enable it to develop alternatives via the capital market. Similarly it creates a preference among households for savings via banks. The tax system thus strengthens the banks’ monopolistic hold over financial intermediation in Israel. • Changes in the composition of the assets portfolio, i.e., switching between local-currency and foreign-currency assets, is affected by considerations of taxes which were introduced in a period when no NIS/foreign-currency market existed in Israel, and which needlessly affect the exchange-rate appropriate for Israel at any time. In this way one of the pillars supporting Israel’s economic growth-foreign trade-is undermined.  • The tradability of the government bond market is adversely affected as tax rules effectively exclude households from this market-another blow to the infrastructure of any advanced capital market.  • The tax distortions deter foreign financial institutions from developing services for Israelis, thus also impairing the financial markets in Israel. These all undermine financial stability and the economy’s ability to withstand financial shocks, whether caused domestically or from abroad, placing an open economy such as Israel’s at a great disadvantage. The opportunity to iron out these distortions was sacrificed together with the program for sweeping tax reforms, although it is quite simple to do what is necessary without reference to any other reform. What needs to be done is to introduce one low rate of tax, say 5 percent on average, on all interest income above a certain threshold; that threshold should be determined in such a way that on the one hand it is not worth the trouble of deducting the tax at source, and on the other it is justified on social grounds. The change should be planned in such a way that it is neutral with regard to the total revenue obtained, i.e., the drop in tax revenues on one side should be matched by increases on the other. It is important to ensure that the collection system is simple as far as the definition of the tax 
 BIS Review 94/2001 3 base is concerned, and to set a lower rate, say 4 percent, on nominal interest, and a slightly higher rate, say 6 percent, on real or foreign-currency interest. This change could be implemented without much preparation, and would be of great benefit to the economy. Clearly it should not made effective retroactively. Financing an increase in government expenditure by borrowing from the public Financing an increase in government expenditure by borrowing from the public (by the sale of government bonds) causes damage in the following ways: • The first derives from the fact that the government already has a large debt of NIS 430 billion, more than 90 percent of GDP, due to budget deficits in past years. This debt obliges the government to allocate part of its tax revenues each year to service the debt. In 2001 this interest payment will total some NIS 30 billion, more than the total education budget, and several times larger than the government’s investments. The increase in the debt caused by budget deficits reduces the government’s ability to use its sources for current purposes, and creates pressure to further increase the debt to enable expenditure to rise nonetheless. • The second adverse outcome results from the effect of the government debt on the rate of interest. In Israel, as in every economy, the rate of interest on government bonds is used as a benchmark for fixing interest in the private sector. Mortgage interest rate is determined in this way, and interest on long-term loans, both those advanced directly by banks and those issued in the form of private bonds on the stock exchange is based on the interest the market requires from the government on bonds it issues. In other words, the greater the government debt, the greater the pressure on the cost of capital for the whole economy. A rise in the price of long-term capital eventually affects the price of short-term money, and this clearly harms investment and growth.  This effect is clearly evident this year: the yield on 10-year government bonds declined in the first half of the year (from 5.6 percent in January to 4.3 percent in June), but went back up (to 4.6 percent in September) when the government had to increase its borrowing because the deficit significantly exceeded the level originally planned. • The third way in which damage is caused by an increase in the government debt is by drawing Israel further away from the international norm according to which its economy is rated. This increasing deviation from the norm that requires the government debt/GDP ratio to be around 60 percent-and this year for the first time in many years we have recorded a rise in the ratio-will make it difficult to improve Israel’s rating and may even combine with other factors to exert an influence in the opposite direction. This would mean a rise in the price of raising capital internationally, both for the government and the private sector. • The fourth derives from the connection between a rise in the budget deficit and a rise in the balance-of-payments deficit. This was very clearly illustrated in the mid-1990s when due to expansionary fiscal and monetary policies the balance-of-payments deficit grew to a potentially critical level. As a result we had to adopt contractionary policies. A repeat of the first act in that performance is unfolding before our eyes now in 2001, with a rising budget deficit contributing to a rise in the balance-of-payments deficit. We say “the first act” because there is a not insignificant chance that next year’s budget deficit will be higher than this year’s, meaning possible added pressure to further increase the balance-of-payments deficit. In contrast to the US, which can print dollars, we have to borrow them to finance the balance-of-payments deficit, and this would occur just at a time when foreign investment in Israel is falling. A declining foreign debt was one of the indications of the stability of Israel’s economy; that can change. The relation between the two deficits can be explained quite simply: a rise in the budget deficit normally derives from an increase in current government expenditure. This expenditure does not generate exports, and sometimes prevents it, but it always increases imports. This has a bearing on the proposed budget for 2002: the greatest part by far of the increase in expenditure over the level in 2001 is in current expenditure, with only a small part directed towards increasing investment, and the proposed rise in total government expenditure will almost certainly exceed the rate of economic growth. In other words, the budget for 2002 proposes to increase the government debt by at least 
 4 BIS Review 94/2001 NIS 12 billion, and to burden it, and the following budgets, with additional interest payments close to NIS 1 billion a year, and all this just to increase the government’s current expenditure. It is thus possible to contribute to growth by increasing the budget deficit thereby raising the standard of living, both public and private, for a time, but this cannot be maintained, because the rise in the budget deficit creates inflationary pressure, pressure on financial markets, and a rise in the foreign-currency deficit. This is a short-term policy, with part of the bill presented for immediate payment and part carried forward. Eventually the outstanding balance of the bill has to paid, and it always comes out very expensive. The composition of the government debt Additional damage is caused to the economy, not deriving directly from the existence of the deficit but from the fact that almost half of the government’s domestic debt is not tradable. As the government moves to raising unindexed loans, the share of its tradable indexed debt in its total debt falls. In 1995 it made up 30 percent of the total debt; in the middle of 2001, it is down to 23 percent. The market for tradable indexed government bonds is drying up, and that is the market which determines the long-term rate of interest in Israel. A two-pronged course of action is required: 1. The process of extending the term of unindexed government bonds from 10 years to 30 years already started by the Ministry of Finance must continue, to provide an additional benchmark for long-term interest rates, in addition to the disintegrating benchmark provided by indexed bonds, to encourage the development of long-term unindexed uses in the mortgage market and other long-term projects. 2. At the same time, the chapter of earmarked bonds in pension savings should be brought to a close, as has been done in all other savings channels, to deepen and stabilize the tradable bonds market. This should not be applied to existing funds, including those launched in 1995, but only to new ones introduced from the date the change is implemented. Such a change would enable the realization of an important idea, which cannot be adopted as long as there are earmarked bonds: mandatory pension schemes up to a certain level of income, covering all employees and the self-employed. A superficial examination of the country’s support structure for the weak, elderly sections of the population also shows the need for the situation to change. Mandatory pensions schemes (without earmarked bonds!) could provide another important layer to the meager support which old-age social security grants currently offer this low-income population. Summary: the importance of an order of priorities Those responsible for deciding on the extent of government expenditure and the rate of the budget deficit, from the government to the Knesset (parliament), must balance gains and losses, the pluses and the minuses. They must have a long-term view-based on the fact that Israel’s economy is an open one-of the trends of the budget aggregates: the tax burden, the government expenditure/GDP ratio, the budget deficit, and the government debt burden. The basic attitude should be that government expenditure can grow only if there is economic growth. No less important, however, is that there is a clear order of priorities within each of the above four components: How can the composition of tax revenues be improved over time to meet international competition, to broaden the tax base, and to reduce the inequality in the distribution of income in the economy? Should the order of priorities for government expenditure be changed, both between its different elements (e.g., current expenditure as against investment) and within them (e.g., focusing expenditure on education on specific geographical areas, or ages, or types), and how can more responsibility and authority be devolved to government ministries in this field? The answers to these two questions contain great potential regarding the government’s contribution to economic growth. Two further questions: How should the budget deficit be financed (long-term as against short-term debt; indexed as against unindexed debt)? How can the share of the government’s tradable debt vis-à-vis nontradable debt be increased? 
 BIS Review 94/2001 5 The answers to these two questions contain the key to the government’s contribution to financial stability in the economy. The attitude towards the trends of the aggregates and the order of priorities within them should be guided by: • the general aim of placing the economy on the path of sustained growth, and  • the socially just approach of supporting the weaker sections of the population not of working age, and encouraging others to join the labor force. This is not an exact science. It is clear, however, that much more can be done in this direction. Finally, when the budget is presented to the Knesset for approval, the basis of growth for 2002 should be reconsidered, as this provides the basis for estimates of tax revenue. Instead of discussing the probability of a sharp turnaround in the economy’s growth rate next year, the budget could be based on a more modest estimate of say 2 percent, instead of 4 percent, and a certain amount of the government’s approved expenditure could be frozen to ascertain that the target deficit is being met, even if the rate of growth is below the forecast. It can be made clear how the government will act if tax revenues exceed the forecast because of a higher rate of growth. We would prefer the extra revenue to be used to broaden the tax brackets on individuals, but part could also be used to increase expenditure more favorable to economic growth, provided that a certain decline in the share of government expenditure in GDP is maintained. 
 BIS Review 93/2001 1 Ernst Welteke: The introduction of the euro as a historic event Speech by Mr Ernst Welteke, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the European American Business Council, Washington, 19 November 2001. *      *      * I Ladies and gentlemen, It is an honor for me to be here in Washington today. I would like to thank you for your kind invitation, which gives me an opportunity to discuss European Monetary Union with so distinguished an audience. Before I come to my main point, I would like to assure you that I feel close bonds with the people of the United States in these troubled times. If you type “historic event” into your favorite internet search engine, you will get about 40,000 responses. Well, of course, I did not check all the sites suggested, but be assured that there is quite a wide variety of “historic events”. The introduction of the euro was not among the top twenty hits of that search, though. In discussing the historic dimension of the introduction of the euro today, we are not exactly walking a well-trodden path. However, as I will make plain today, that introduction is a historic event.  II The three large currency areas in the world — the United States, Japan and the euro area — together account for almost one-half of world output. Those three entities share a lot of similarities, but they are strikingly different in some respects.  In terms of population size, the United States and the euro area are quite similar, around 300 million people, while Japan is a little less than half that size.  In terms of the share in world GDP, Japan is less than 10 percent, the euro area comes out in the middle, at 16 percent, while the USA accounts for rather more than one-fifth of world GDP. Per capita GDP, however, in the USA and Japan is about 50 percent higher than the euro area’s Ε 20,000 per head.  Ranked by openness — external trade in relation to GDP — the euro area is the most open of the three large currency areas, with its current account roughly in balance. The USA comes second with a current account in deficit, and Japan has its current account in surplus.  Comparing the three areas with respect to the public sector’s share in the economy, the USA has the lowest government expenditure, it has the lowest public debt and for the time being a budget in surplus. While the euro area has made some progress in reducing the government deficit and debt, the continuing slump in Japan has led to a rise in both measures of the scale of the public sector's activity.  In the field of finance, the three large currency areas show different structures due to the traditions followed. Bank deposits as a medium of investment, and bank credit as a source of finance, predominate in Japan.  Investors and financiers in the USA clearly prefer the capital markets. The euro area is claiming the middle ground, with a certain tendency towards a more market-centered system.  Economic and financial integration is deepening fast. International trade has grown considerably during the last couple of years. Foreign direct investment flows have increased even faster. Portfolio investment has internationalized. Stock exchanges are moving more or less in sync.  Growth rates are dwindling simultaneously in all three large currency areas at this point in time. That has very much to do with the higher degree of global integration yet underestimated by many policy makers. Growth of global trade will probably diminish this year to two percent after 12 percent last year. Among the major regions in the world only China, the Middle East and Russia, including some neighboring countries, will show substantially positive growth rates. There is something like a global business cycle. However, there is no perfect synchronicity among different areas. Causes, 
 2 BIS Review 93/2001 consequences and repercussions are different in every currency area. Therefore, policy reactions have to vary.  The US business cycle is close to a technical recession. Remember, less than a year ago, forecasters wondered whether the USA would see a hard or a soft landing. The downward trend of the high tech industry, and the corresponding overinvestment in IT where prominent among the causes of the downward movement in growth rates. The savings rate rose abruptly and the labor market performed increasingly worse. After September 11, additional negative psychological impact has to be overcome.  The USA responded quickly. The Fed lowered interest rates, the federal government lowered taxes substantially. Firms and markets do adjust quickly. I have no doubt that the US economy will again show rising growth rates within a few months. Japan — already in a prolonged recession — could not withstand this downward trend. Japan has to cope with an economy that is still recovering from the effects of the severe banking crisis that followed the bubble economy of the late eighties.  Finally, the Euro area business cycle followed the world trend more closely than was observable in recent years. This can be seen as an outcome of closer links due to increased foreign direct and portfolio investment. Growth rates diminished, employment gains came to a halt, and prospects for the next year have worsened over the last months. However, capacity utilization and sentiment are still higher than, for example, in the recession of 1993. Adjustments take place, although slower than in the USA. As usual, expectations adjust faster than production. For Europe, psychological factors are no less important than in any other currency area. Different causes require different policy reactions. This is the first reason for varying responses of the three central banks. Another – equal important reason – is that they pursue different concepts. The Bank of Japan is in an exceptional situation, anyway.  The US Federal Reserve System was set up in 1913. In accordance with the Employment Act (of 1946) and the Humphrey-Hawkins Act (of 1978), it must pursue several objectives at the same time: economic growth in line with potential output growth, stable prices, a high level of employment and moderate long-term interest rates.  The European System of Central Banks is "the new kid on the block" among the large central banks. Since 1999, it has pursued its sole primary objective of price stability. Differences in objectives and in strategy are the main explanations of the perceived differences in response to the current situation.  For Europe, monetary integration is an event of historic dimensions. Joining forces to set up a common currency area promises prosperity and stability to 300 million people. The institutional features of the ESCB provide for a framework enabling it to keep this promise. The success of the euro is one of the driving forces for Central and Eastern European states to apply for membership in the EU. It is not only in Europe that efforts towards regional integration are being made, including notions of, and moves towards, monetary harmonization. Such discussions are likewise topical in all five continents:  • A currency union between Russia and Belarus is the one that is most concrete at present. The two countries have decided to set up a currency union from 2005 onwards; at first, the Russian rouble will be their currency.  • The member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council have been contemplating an Arab Gulf currency for some time. To further that initiative, they have recently set up a committee to take charge of studying the necessary requirements. However, political, economic and financial convergence does not suggest the early introduction of a common currency.  • In South America, monetary integration is envisaged for the Mercosur countries from time to time; however, with economic developments in Brazil and Argentina diverging more and more, a currency union looks rather far away.  • The idea of developing an American currency union from NAFTA emerges now and then. Obviously, it has not been pursued with any real zeal up to now.  • Talks about a possible yen zone have come up regularly in Asia. However, although trade and financial integration is well advanced there, switching from dollar orientation to yen orientation does not look very likely at this point in time.  
 BIS Review 93/2001 3 • Deliberations on forming currency unions between Australia and New Zealand, or in Africa, are in a very preliminary state, as the political will to cooperate is lacking. In Africa, however, with the CFA Franc zone and the South African Rand zone, two currency unions already exist.  III European Monetary Union (EMU), which started on January 1st, 1999, has its origins in the 1970s, when the first plan of a single European currency was drafted. Not until the Treaty of Maastricht — signed in 1992 — was the notion of a European currency put into concrete form. EMU is to be completed six weeks from now, when euro notes and coins are circulated. Monetary unions in Europe, however, are not unprecedented. Three of them were set up during the second half of the 19th century. Today’s world resembles the 19th century world in certain respects.  In that age of industrialization, rapid international integration was witnessed. Transportation costs sank, and led to closer trade relations. Profound structural change was the result. As the European countries became more similar, their economies converged. In that environment, naturally, monetary integration was deemed helpful.  Today, we are in the age of so-called “globalization”. Transportation costs, information costs and communication costs have come down tremendously. Structural change is taking place in the “information society”.  Trade and investment relations are becoming ever closer. This is especially true of the European Common Market, where freedom of movement is guaranteed for people, goods, services and capital. The case in favor of monetary integration in Europe is compelling. Let’s have a look now at the 19th century currency unions in Europe, and find out what we have learnt. Just as drawing an analogy of the international setting is far from perfect, so is any comparison of the monetary unions themselves. We can, however, gain some useful insights from earlier experiences.  In 1865, the four sovereign states of Belgium, France, Italy and Switzerland - Greece joined a little later - set up the Latin Monetary Union. The union covered only coinage, and had no common central bank. It was originally constructed as a forerunner of a political union — which was never established, though.  The founding treaty was open to interpretation in several respects, and that leeway was extensively exploited. Overall, commitment to the treaty was weak. One country was able to finance its public deficit by printing - or rather minting - money. What made those altogether rather heterogeneous countries stick together for more than 60 years was basically the need to tap the French capital market.  The issue of the Scandinavian Monetary Union was rather different. Sweden, Denmark and Norway - all three countries now abstaining from EMU - pegged their currencies to one another in 1872. They aimed at economic, political and cultural cooperation. In some respects, the Scandinavian union was more weatherproof than the Latin union. The three countries pursued similar development strategies, they were export-oriented, and they showed great adaptability to exogenous shocks. Today, we would speak of convergent economies. Furthermore, the union treaty only spelled out what had been practised before.  What made the Scandinavian Monetary Union fall apart (in 1931)? Against the backdrop of international banking crises, it seems as if the lack of a single monetary policy framework was one of the reasons. Monetary policy in the three countries gained an increasingly national flavor, as, first, a pre-World-War-One export boom hit the union asymmetrically. And so, a little later, did the war itself. Monetary policy diverged increasingly, until the union was formally terminated in 1931.  As a third example, let’s have a brief look at the German Monetary Union of 1871. The ground for that currency union was well prepared. First, the German Customs Union had already created a common market, although that had been hampered by the existence of disparate coinage systems. Labor mobility in the common market was relatively high. Second, Germany had been united politically under the lead of Prussia. The Reichsbank Act of 1875 then established a unified central bank to complete the German Monetary Union. It introduced the German "Mark" currency one year later.  
 4 BIS Review 93/2001 What are the insights to be gained from these stylized facts about three earlier experiences of European monetary unions? We can identify certain features of such unions that seem to be conducive to the stability, and the success, of a monetary union. The European Union took these experiences into account when designing EMU.  IV A monetary union is intended to provide the participating countries with a stable monetary regime that ensures price stability and enables them to thrive. The Maastricht Treaty set up the European System of Central Banks, with the European Central Bank - the ECB - on top. Both the ECB and the national central banks are independent. Monetary policy decisions are taken by the ECB Governing Council, which consists of the ECB Executive Board and the Governors of the participating national central banks.  Unlike the centralized decision-making, the implementation of the single monetary policy is decentralized. National central banks provide the markets with liquidity, in accordance with the decisions of the ECB Governing Council.  The primary objective of the European System of Central Banks is to maintain price stability. The ECB Council defines price stability as an increase in consumer prices in the medium term of less than two percent a year.  Unlike earlier monetary unions in Europe, EMU was set up with a watertight monetary regime. We have one single currency, the euro. The ECB has the sole right to authorize the issue of banknotes. Troubles similar to those which both the Latin and the Scandinavian Monetary Union ran into, when the countries’ central banks pursued divergent policies, cannot occur under the European monetary framework, where decision-making is centralized.  A common stability orientation of all policy areas, to which all member states are committed, is essential.  The second stability-ensuring institutional feature of EMU is the Stability and Growth Pact. It spells out how member states are supposed to ensure sound public finances, as the Treaty obliges them to avoid excessive deficits.  As long as national budgets are in order, there is no incentive for member states to pursue an overly lax monetary policy, with an eye to reducing the interest burden on their budgets. Wage policy is another national responsibility. Wage agreements have in general been settled in line with productivity advances. Low, and stable, inflation expectations reflect confidence in the Eurosystem’s policy, and help in negotiating stability-oriented wage settlements.  Research in the field of optimum currency areas has come to the conclusion that the member states of a successful currency union need to be what is called convergent economies. Convergent economies allow for a unified policy; divergent economies require differentiating policies. Its relative homogeneity may explain why the Scandinavian Monetary Union, over a long period, was more successful than the less convergent Latin version.  The European Union has been developing a Single Market for more than half a century. The four fundamental freedoms - mobility of goods, services, people and capital - ensure that what had previously been a customs union became an integrated economic area. Convergence is progressing.  Entry into EMU was and is conditional on the fulfillment of “convergence criteria”. Countries willing to join the monetary regime must display a “high degree of sustainable convergence”. That is measured in terms of price stability, exchange rates, capital-market rates and sound public finances. In a currency area, we have a “one-size-fits-all” monetary policy, and no exchange rates to cope with asymmetric economic shocks. Such shocks may occur despite the advanced state of convergence in the euro area. The countries of a monetary union are therefore in need of flexible goods, capital and labor markets. The EU member states are working to improve the flexibility of those markets. Insofar as price rigidities exist mobility, as ensured by the four basic freedoms, is called for.  Political union has, in the past, proved helpful in preserving the stability of a monetary union. The European Union is moving slowly but steadily towards that long-term goal. Its willingness to assume greater responsibility in the global context is encouraging in that respect.  
 BIS Review 93/2001 5 Overall, European policy makers have created a monetary union that is designed to last. Features which, in former currency unions, proved destabilizing have been avoided in the design of EMU.  But institutional features alone do not guarantee EMU’s success. Commitment to the Union, and a true European spirit, are called for. In the ECB Council, we show this European spirit. National interests are not relevant to the process of shaping monetary policy for the euro area — the euro area as a whole.  V Ladies and Gentlemen, At its start, the Eurosystem has seen a period of unprecedented price stability. In 1998 and 1999, consumer prices rose by only 1.1 percent; in the year 2000, the inflation rate, at 2.3 percent, ran a little above the two-percent ceiling, after the sharp increase in oil prices during 1999 and 2000.  This year, after peaking in May, at 3.4 percent, the inflation rate has been decreasing. In October, prices were 2.4 percent higher than one year before.  In the current environment of a weak world economy, the ECB Governing Council is expecting a further moderation of price movements. At its most recent meeting on November 8, the Governing Council decided therefore to cut rates by half a percentage point. It has lowered its key interest rates during this year by 150 basis points to 3.25 percent.  The ESCB has been assigned one main policy goal: keeping inflation in check. If possible without compromising price stability, it shall support general economic policiesThe reasoning behind this policy mandate is threefold.  First, there is a purely economic reason. Keeping overall inflation low is the best contribution a central bank can make to sound economic growth. Furthermore, inflation tends to modify distribution in an unfavorable way.  Second, there is the well-known principle of reaching a bundle of policy goals best if each institution is assigned only one of the goals. And, third, there is the argument based on democracy theory: once an institution is granted independence, it should be given a clear mandate in return.  A generally stable currency, and markets that trust the stability orientation of central banks, make for lower price increases at times of crisis. They also anchor inflation expectations at low levels. The larger currency area is able to cushion external shocks.  In its brief history, the Eurosystem has already dealt successfully with three external shocks and crises. We have seen the Asian crisis in 1997-99, an oil-price shock in 1999-2000 and, most recently, the terrorist attacks. Europe did not escape unscathed from all these events. However, the low level of turbulence within the euro area contrasts with sharper reactions to similar events in the period before EMU existed. This means that we have withstood what has been regarded as the worst-case scenario for the new currency. The European currency area exhibits greater macroeconomic stability, to the benefit of all its citizens, and also to the benefit of the world economy at large. For this greater macroeconomic stability to become reality, convergence is of paramount importance. Economic convergence is a precondition for the “one-size-fits-all” monetary policy really fitting all the regions in the euro area. A currency union, both stable and beneficial, needs convergence in all three respects: nominal, real and structural convergence.  VI The European single currency fostered stronger economic integration by means of foreign direct investment. In 1999, world FDI flows, at Ε 888 billion, were more than three times as high as in 1995. Intra-EU FDI flows grew significantly faster over that period. In 1999, they were five times the size of 1995. In addition, intra-EU direct investment has risen significantly since the start of EMU. In the year 2000, it actually rose by 50 percent. Today, intra-EU FDI accounts for one-quarter of world foreign direct investment.  
 6 BIS Review 93/2001 FDI stocks show a similar picture. Intra-EU FDI stocks make up 22 percent of world FDI stocks. Almost one-half of the FDI stock originating in the European union is invested in another EU member state.  The FDI statistics clearly show, first, that economic integration in the EU is intense, and, second, that economic integration deepened fast after the introduction of the common currency. These observations are borne out by the trade statistics. About one-half of the external trade of the euro-area member states is intra-euro-area trade.  VII It is in the financial markets that the benefits of a common European currency are to be felt most clearly. The implications of the euro are obvious: rising liquidity, deepening and widening of the money, bond and stock markets, reduction of transaction costs and abolition of currency risks. The euro speeds up financial market integration. Correspondingly, the functioning of the European Monetary Union depends heavily on a high degree of financial market integration. Its smooth functioning enables monetary transmission to work. Progress in this field is tremendous, but more is yet to come.  Those parts of the European financial markets that are crucial to the transmission of the Eurosystem’s monetary policy are already integrated to our satisfaction. The wholesale market for interbank liquidity in the euro area is now actually a single European money market.  In addition, European banks are interconnected in a common payment-system infrastructure. And improvements to the euro-area-wide payment system are being undertaken. A few days ago, the Bundesbank launched its new payment system RTGSplus, which improves security, reduces liquidity needs and expedites settlements of gross payments. Through this system, about 8,500 banks and credit institutions, including their branches all over the world, are accessible. The most impressive progress, in terms of integration, has been witnessed in the euro-area bond markets. Yield differences among the government bonds of the different participants have narrowed from more than five percentage points before EMU to some 30 basis points nowadays. The remaining spread is mainly due to the varying liquidity of the papers issued. Currency risks or divergent monetary policies no longer disturb the euro-area-wide diversification. In terms of outstanding amounts, the euro-denominated bond market is still significantly smaller than that denominated in US dollars. But in terms of new issuance, both markets are on a par. One reason for that is the sharp rise in the new issuance of corporate bonds. Here again, diversification within the euro area has increased. The issuers' nationality, as a determinant of the yield and performance of bonds, has been superseded by other factors, especially by a sectoral view. Accordingly, investors in the equity markets have shifted their perspective from country benchmarks to pan-European sector benchmarks. European equity markets are still small compared with those in the USA. The market capitalization of domestic shares, as a ratio of GDP, reaches about 90 percent [2000]. The matching figures for the USA and Japan are 152 percent and 68 percent, respectively. Equity markets in the Euro area are growing fast. The ratio of new issuance to market capitalisation averages over 4 percent. This is twice as much as has been achieved in the USA or Japan. Further integration of equity markets in Europe is being hampered by the segmentation of both stock exchanges and clearing and settlement systems. A consolidation process has started, and should be fostered by legal harmonization in the field of financial services. The degree of integration in the banking sector is mixed. On the one hand, wholesale markets and investment banking are largely integrated. On the other hand, commercial credits and retail banking still operate in national, segmented markets. Only a few European banks created by cross-border mergers start to offer retail services at a standardized level for customers in more than one country.  The financial system in the euro area is still highly bank-dominated. At the end of last year, credit financing totaled about 108 percent of GDP. This is twice as much as in the USA. The same ratio holds for deposits. In the euro area, they account for 80 percent of GDP, while the US figure is about 40 percent. 
 BIS Review 93/2001 7 However, capital markets are increasing in importance in the euro area. Disintermediation is gaining ground. Financial markets have boomed in recent years and investment banks (as well as non-bank financial firms like institutional investors, pension and investment funds) have enlarged their market share. Disintermediation will be enhanced by the need for pension systems to rely more on funded retirement schemes. Disintermediation will change the transmission process. Basically, it is speeded up. And disintermediation will change the income structure of banks. A rising share of fees and dividends, at the expense of interest income, will increase the volatility of banks' income. Since capital markets are more integrated than the banking sector, disintermediation will foster the integration of the entire financial system in Europe.  Changes for the banking sector are in prospect once the new Basle Accord is applied. In general, we welcome the new accord if it helps to improve the allocation of capital. However, two special features of the German economy should be considered:  1. The German economy is largely dominated by small and medium-sized enterprises, known as the „Mittelstand“. 2. Our financial systems rely to a large extent on long-term financing. This long-termism of financing has contributed successfully to the stability and prosperity of our economy, as well as the financial system. That is why the Bundesbank argues that banking regulation should not discriminate against long term financial relations.  Small and medium-sized enterprises with a revenue of up to φ 5 million make up more than 95 percent of all enterprises in Germany. This „Mittelstand“ forms the backbone of the German economy. However, their share of outside capital is significantly higher than with larger firms. A lower rating is therefore to be expected, unless other collateral or risk-lowering factors are taken into account. Here again, we favor a differentiated approach that does not put banks with a large disposure to small and medium-sized enterprises at a disadvantage. Since we do not want the new Basle Accord to endanger the prosperity or stability of our economy, and our financial system, we have to convince our partners to agree to a more differentiated accord. VIII Let us share a few thoughts on the international role of the euro.  Three years into its life, the euro is the second most important currency in the world. It took over that role from the Deutschmark.  The euro has a share of roughly 13 percent in international currency reserves — about as much as the Deutschmark had before. In this field, the dollar is the unchallenged leader, at two-thirds of international reserves. The size, depth and liquidity of the dollar markets, as well as the widespread habit of using the dollar for interventions and for pricing commodities, explain its predominance.  As regards its use as a store of value, we find some evidence of the growing importance of the euro. 30 percent [at end-2000] of all international securities outstanding are denominated in euro. This share is slightly above the aggregate share of the predecessor currencies shortly before EMU was launched. That leaves the euro as the second-most-important currency in the international securities markets. Again, the dollar is the dominant currency, accounting for one-half of all international securities outstanding.  A look at the flow data underlines the growing importance of the euro as a means of international finance and investment. In its first year (1999) the euro was the most important currency for debt-securities issues that were aimed at the international market; in the year 2000, it fell back somewhat, to 40 percent.  The currency composition of international bank assets presents a similar picture. Again, the dollar is the leading currency, with a share of 40 percent, while the euro is in the process of catching up. From slightly less than one-quarter at the end of 1998, its share rose to 27 percent, twelve percentage points of which were intra-EU bank assets.  
 8 BIS Review 93/2001 What can we see from these figures? Although habits in the international use of currencies change only gradually, the euro has already won a respectable market share. Its market share roughly equals the economic weight of the euro area.  Further progress in the development of broad, deep and liquid financial markets is a precondition for the expansion of the euro’s international role. Increased international use of the euro, as a currency for international reserve holdings, for investment and financing purposes, might have some bearing on monetary policy, but this potential impact seems manageable. Hence, in the Eurosystem, we have adopted a neutral stance towards the internationalization of the euro. We regard it as a market-driven process, and we neither hinder it nor foster it.  IX Ladies and Gentlemen, For Europe, the introduction of the single currency is an event of historic scope. The launch of the European System of Central Banks came with a promise of stability and prosperity.  Stability must be earned, again and again, day by day. The German “Stabilitätskultur” - one may translate this as "stability culture" - is one of our most cherished exports to our European partner countries. European people now share a firm stability orientation. Prosperity must likewise be earned, again and again, day by day. The Eurosystem can and does contribute by providing an environment of stability, where prices are fairly accurate indicators of relative scarcity. The ensuing efficient allocation of resources is a precondition for prosperity. However, other policy areas can - and must - do more in this respect than monetary policy.  People in the European Monetary Union hold on to the single market and the single currency, because they know it is good for them - individually - and also for their countries. This, ladies and gentlemen, is why I expect a long life for the European version of a currency union, as shaped in the late 20th century.  
 BIS Review 93/2001 1 Jürgen Stark: The euro - the new European money Speech by Dr Jürgen Stark, Deputy Governor of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at a conference hosted by the Deutsche Bundesbank in association with the Generalkonsulat and the German Information Center, New York, 19 November 2001. *      *      * I am greatly honored to speak today before such a distinguished audience. It is good to be here in New York tonight – for I see this event also as a sign of solidarity and sympathy with a wonderful people and a great city. To us Germans, with the United States having stood by us for many decades following the Second World War, from the Berlin Airlift 1948/49 to reunification in 1990, solidarity should not and will not be – as Chancellor Gerhard Schröder put it a few days ago – a “one-way street”. With our unconditional solidarity, we can now give back to you some of the support you have been giving us for so many years. I wish to express my heartfelt sympathy to all of those who lost relatives and loved ones in the horrible terror attacks of September 11. My sympathy also goes out to the families and friends of the victims of last week’s plane crash in Queens. Even after these terrible few weeks, to me New York always has been and always will be a symbol of the peaceful coexistence of people from all backgrounds, one which is a shining example for the entire world. I am therefore especially pleased to be here with you today. I am, of course, also glad that you have shown such great interest in this event and that it was possible to organize this event despite all the difficulties involved. My thanks go out to all those who made this happen. I hope that this event helps bring us a little closer to a state of normality.  I would like to talk to you this evening about “The euro – the new European money”. When I spoke before the Council of Foreign Relations here 4½ years ago on the subject of European monetary union (EMU), I still needed to provide a lot of background. At that time, even a fairly sophisticated American dictionary offered only two definitions of EMU. The first said: “EMU = electromagnetic unit.” The second said: “EMU: large Australian bird that runs well but cannot fly.” Today there is hardly likely to be anyone who, upon hearing EMU, does not immediately think of European monetary union.  If you’re thinking about coming to Europe next year, you will meet the euro wherever you go – because in just a few weeks it will exist in physical form. Paris, Rome, Brussels or Berlin: in most of Europe, you will be able to pay with a single currency – euro bills and coins – starting on January 1, 2002. For you here in the United States, it is natural that the dollar is legal tender in all fifty states of the Union. For us in Europe, though, monetary union is a quantum leap, both politically and economically. In my speech I would like to address the following issues:  1. The historical background of the euro. 2. The essential features of the new system and its ramifications. 3. The future outlook for the euro – the political agenda.  The historical background of the euro The euro is not quite as new as the title of my speech would lead you to believe. In fact, the euro is already a reality. The new European currency was born nearly three years ago when Europe entered Stage Three of economic and monetary union. However, compared with the dollar and its long tradition, the euro is a “rookie” in the monetary policy league. However, this “rookie” took the field after going through a tough “training camp” on the field of stability.  Nearly five decades ago, far-sighted European politicians kicked off the drive toward European unification. Sure, this drive has repeatedly been hampered by setbacks. However, the thrust towards greater integration has ultimately been unmistakable. European economic integration has been firmly established according to the principle of an “open market economy with free competition.” This was not as obvious back then, as it seems today. Here in the United States, in particular, people might say “what else?” In Europe, though, it would behoove us to keep reminding ourselves of what it takes for a market economy such as ours to function properly. Only by paying attention to fundamental principles - personal responsibility, individual initiative, entrepreneurial spirit, and competition – can social equity 
 2 BIS Review 93/2001 be achieved; and this is what is needed to overcome the severe structural problems that still beset Europe. We Europeans can learn much in this sphere from the United States.  The latest and greatest step towards integration in Europe has been entry into Stage Three of economic and monetary union. The euro-area countries have entered into a community of solidarity without any “exit.” There is no precedent for this unique project. In fact, it can rightly be called the most significant innovation in monetary history since the creation of the Bretton Woods system in 1944. This project is also unparalleled because clear preconditions needed to be met before EMU could be launched. The countries participating in monetary union needed to pass a stability test beforehand. Only then could their currencies merge to form the euro. By contrast, in the past currencies only ceased to exist after having failed to function as a store of value.  The historical, political and economic dimensions of this project are extraordinary. I sometimes get the impression that this is not being given its due on either side of the Atlantic – Europe or the United States. There still seem to be US investors who think that “EMU is crazy – in particular for Germany.” A single currency for Europe means waiving political sovereignty at the national level. This was a particularly difficult step to take for many people in Germany. That should come as no surprise: the D-Mark transcended its economic importance to symbolize the postwar reconstruction of Germany. The D-Mark stood for growing prosperity and Germany’s reintegration into the international community. This success story also played a substantial role in the negotiations on EMU. Yet it was ultimately the courageous political will and the success in convergence achieved in the run-up which made it possible to turn the vision of “one market – one currency” into a reality. Through this well-prepared yet courageous step, Europe has received positive stimuli. The elimination of exchange-rate risk among the countries involved and the greater integration of financial markets are advantages that are immediately obvious. However, the medium-term orientation of monetary and fiscal policy represents an even greater success. A European stability culture has emerged! This signifies a paradigm shift in European economic policy.  The essential features of the new system and its ramifications The new European reality, with a new economic policy regime, is a rather ambitious one. The path chosen was not the usual “one political entity - one currency” route but instead one in which a single monetary policy has to contend with budgetary and economic policies which are still largely in the hands of individual nations. This is a difficult concept to explain outside of Europe, even to those who have been keeping up with developments in Europe. In the United States, there are some people who sometimes wonder how Europe really functions. By the way, we in Europe also wonder sometimes what makes the United States tick. We must learn to understand and accept existing institutional structures on both sides of the Atlantic. A chosen economic policy regime must be judged against the background of historical developments, traditions and its specific regional environment. Naturally, the asymmetry between centralized monetary policymaking and decentralized economic and fiscal policy generates a certain tension. The way to overcome this state of tension is to closely coordinate decentralized economic and fiscal policy at the European level. Fiscal policy in the member states is additionally required by the Stability and Growth Pact to achieve the medium-term goal of a budget that is close to balance or even in surplus. One rationale for the Stability Pact was that it would be asking too much of a single monetary policy to be the sole defender of stability. The other was to keep government budgets sustainable. Public debt and the interest burden should not be allowed to go up after every economic slump as happened in the seventies and the early eighties. An additional factor is the unfavorable demographic trend in Europe. The aim is to regain fiscal policy room for maneuver and to avoid placing an undue burden on posterity. This fiscal policy self-commitment in Europe is “revolutionary”. Fiscal rules of this type are probably unprecedented worldwide. Yet these rules are not a straitjacket. In monetary union, the government sector has an important role in stabilizing demand. Through automatic stabilizers, the government budget has a steadying effect on economic development. In Europe, these automatic stabilizers are twice as effective as in the United States. One reason lies in the higher European general government ratio; another is the difference in the levels of social transfer payments. Given a 2 % decline in growth, these stabilizers restore ½ percentage point of GDP in the United States, whereas in Europe it would provide a fiscal stimulus of 1 % of GDP. 
 BIS Review 93/2001 3 As you can see, it is expressly not the objective of the Stability and Growth Pact to stifle the ability of the budget to breathe in sync with the economic cycle. The Stability and Growth Pact is seen as a burden only by those member states which passed up the opportunity to consolidate their budgets over the past few years and which have so far failed to achieve a sustainable medium-term position. However, this sustainable medium-term budgetary position is a basic precondition for fiscal policy stimuli to be able to generate additional demand in the first place. Given unsound financing, in the private sector only the saving ratio would increase – to make up for impending tax increases or cutbacks in transfer payments. This is an aspect which I am afraid is all too often overlooked in the debate on European economic programs. In addition, there are indeed serious reasons for objecting to an anti-cyclical fiscal policy. The time lags in the political decision-making process and in implementation are generally too great to preclude pro-cyclical effects. The fact that it will tend to have an adverse impact on interest rates should not be underestimated, either.  The situation from which fiscal policy starts out is a completely different argument. Here, the United States is in an entirely different position than Europe. In the euro area, the general government ratio is just under 49 % of GDP, and thus 1½ times that of the United States.  I intentionally placed fiscal rules in Europe at the top of my agenda for this talk. One reason is that this necessary implication of monetary union is often overlooked or not properly understood. The other is that fiscal rules are occasionally perceived as a barrier to greater economic growth in Europe. It is easier to get across the message that monetary union requires institutional changes in monetary policy.  Monetary union led to the creation of a new institution in Europe, the European Central Bank. It is an independent institution with the priority task of maintaining medium-term price stability. This approach is based on a broad consensus among central banks – not just in Europe but worldwide – that the best macroeconomic contribution monetary policy can make towards improving the economic outlook and raising standards of living is to credibly maintain price stability over the medium and long term. Within this consensus there are various concepts and different strategies that can also have a variety of ramifications. At any rate, monetary policy cannot work wonders. Chairman Greenspan a week ago put it that way: Interest rate cuts are not an instant fix to every problem. However, it can contribute to low and stable inflation expectations. And stable money is a core element of the functional viability of a market economy. Transparency in price formation is improved by giving an undistorted view of supply and demand in the real economy. Keeping inflation as low as possible holds down long-term interest rates and minimizes the distorting effects of the tax and social welfare systems. Decades of practical experience and a wealth of empirical studies have led in Europe to the mandating of price stability as a priority objective and have led to the transfer of this task to an Eurosystem, which is free of political influences. This mandate has been used to develop a stability-oriented monetary policy strategy tailored to the specific needs of the Eurosystem.  The changeover to a single monetary policy involved a pronounced regime shift. The structural and institutional changes and the resulting insecurity regarding the future transmission process needed to be taken into account when formulating the monetary policy strategy. For it to be able to perform its task, monetary policy needs to earn market participants’ confidence. The monetary policy strategy must therefore be credible – while at the same time taking due account of the particular environment in which monetary union operates. Such a strategy must be clear, comprehensible, transparent, reviewable and compatible with the institutional independence of the Eurosystem.  The ECB’s two-pillar strategy meets these criteria. The first pillar, which assigns an outstanding role to the monetary aggregate, is designed to be the “nominal anchor” and recognizes that inflation is essentially a monetary phenomenon. The second pillar undertakes a well-founded assessment of the outlook for price developments, incorporating the entire range of relevant cyclical indicators. Many critics claim that this strategy is inconsistent. For that reason, some recommend strict monetary targeting, while others say inflation targeting is the way to go. I think the strategy chosen is sufficiently clear and reflects the specific situation the European monetary union now finds itself in. In an insecure world, it is not possible to assign each of the two pillars a fixed and unchanging weight. Therefore, the information relevant to the price outlook is recompiled every time using the framework provided by the two pillars and subjected to a fundamental analysis. Yes, this concept is new and, for 
 4 BIS Review 93/2001 that reason, takes some time getting used to. However, the euro was launched in a completely new environment, too. And this is why an independent approach was chosen. The assertion that the ECB’s Governing Council bases its decisions arbitrarily on whichever pillar is most convenient at the time is completely unfounded. Today I would like to call on all of you to see this strategy as an independent approach alongside others and to accept it as such. Critics cannot use their own – wishful – thinking as a benchmark. And it should not be assumed that there is a global “one-size-fits-all” monetary policy. Of course, this strategy being pursued by the Eurosystem requires a communication policy that meets high standards. Monetary policy cannot be successful in the long run if the public does not accept it. This is particularly the case with a young and independent central bank. It must constantly seek a dialogue with the public. What is often overlooked is that the ECB is one of the most transparent central banks in the world, with a communication policy that goes above and beyond its statutory obligations. Among the most important central banks, only the ECB holds monthly press conferences immediately after it has taken monetary policy decisions.  However, a “track record” says more than words can. Credibility is gained by actions, not words. For the Eurosystem, this means adhering to the primary objective of maintaining price stability “in a time-consistent” manner. The decisions of the past two months have clearly demonstrated the ability of the ECB to respond quickly to exceptional events without giving up its medium-term orientation. The ECB has taken due account of global developments and has assumed its share of responsibility for the stability of the international financial system. In my view, the ECB Governing Council’s monetary policy decisions do not need to shy away from the critical attention of the public.  However, we should not make the mistake of attempting to transfer the macroeconomic framework as it exists in the United States to Europe or vice versa. On the one hand, long-term interest rates in Europe play a more important role in investment decisions. On the other hand, Europe is more heavily regulated and has less flexible labor markets. The European automatic stabilizers are more powerful. In the United States, wealth effects from the valuation of stock prices have a stronger influence on consumer behavior than in Europe. In the seventies our attempts to implement short-term anti-cyclical economic policies taught us a tough lesson. The necessary adjustments came with a painfully high macroeconomic price tag. Even today many countries are suffering from the major debts run up in that period, which, in some cases, are over 100 % of GDP. The medium-term orientation of macroeconomic policies was hard-won. It is precisely in troubled times that this orientation should be adhered to. The future outlook for the euro – the political agenda Well now, what specific changes have taken place in Europe and what still has to be changed? Today’s Europe does not resemble the sclerotic Europe of the eighties. Prior to monetary union, considerable adjustments were undertaken in the real economy, which are going to start having an impact over the medium term. 1. The economies of Europe have converged to form a single internal market. There are no more barriers to free trade in goods, services and capital. In the nineties, many countries’ state-owned enterprises were privatized, and markets were liberalized and deregulated – particularly in the telecommunications, media and energy sectors. Monetary union is the final stage in achieving the single market. The money market is fully integrated, and the European capital market is also making great strides toward integration. 2. Monetary union means that exchange-rate adjustments are no longer possible in the euro area. The exchange-rate distortions that have occurred time and again due to external shocks, and the attendant expansion of interest-rate spreads, are now things of the past. These advantages were already evident in 1998 following the Russian and LTCM crises. These advantages have been equally evident in the past couple of months. 3. The euro-area fundamentals are quite strong. The results of the more medium-term policies, which have been implemented so far, have to be rated as positive. Since its inception, the ECB has largely guaranteed price stability. Interest rates are low and conditions for borrowing are favorable. Wage developments are moderate, and government budgetary consolidation is making progress. However, there is no cause for complacency. 
 BIS Review 93/2001 5 Economic growth in the euro area will be around 1½ % this year; for Germany this figure will be ¾ % at the most. At the same time unemployment, already high to begin with, will continue to rise - especially in the large economies. Europe’s problem is that its potential growth rate is only a sluggish 2 to 2½ %. In the event of a global downturn, Europe will therefore quickly be pushed to the brink of economic stagnation. The priority must therefore be to increase potential growth. This cannot be done over the long term by deficit spending, nor is an even easier monetary policy the answer. Economic reforms are the only road that will lead to success. Despite the creditable steps toward reform that were taken in the nineties, European economies are still struggling under a raft of burdens from the past: high structural unemployment, a welfare state that is overstretching the capacity of many countries, and future strains caused by demographic developments. The euro and the current economic slump have made structural problems even more apparent. At the same time, the euro will prove to be the most ambitious reform program of the European Union. Any economy refusing to become more flexible will be left behind. Just a few days ago the IMF once again called on European governments to tackle structural problems on the labor market through, in its words, “a consistent and coherent set of labor market reforms.” These problems “head the list of remaining structural priorities.” Especially in Germany, the issues involved are - among others - • the degree of job security • the type, amount and duration of unemployment benefits • the wage formation process and wage differentiation • the amount of non-wage labor costs and, by extension, social security reform. These are all tasks that each country has to tackle and accomplish by itself. Monetary union requires flexibility at the national level – since exchange rates are no longer available as an adjustment parameter. Prior to EMU’s inception, many critics pointed out that only an optimum currency area could afford to forgo flexible exchange rates as an adjustment tool in the event of asymmetrical shocks. The mobility of labor as a factor of production in Europe, so the argument, is too restricted by cultural, linguistic and legal barriers to effect the necessary adjustment in a single currency area. However, one of the most striking effects of the history of European integration has been that real shocks are becoming increasingly symmetrical. In addition, European economies are less regionally specialized in certain sectors of industry than, say, the United States. Therefore, the need for geographical mobility is likely to be a less important factor. Divergences exist in all currency areas, even in one as long established as the United States. In the euro area, inflation rates range at present from 1.6 % in France to 5.4 % in the Netherlands. By comparison, in the United States the inflation rate was 2.4 % in Chicago and 5.0 % in San Francisco. Divergences in real growth rates in the United States are no less pronounced than they are in the euro area, either. Forecasts for 2001 range from 6.3 % in Ireland to 0.7 % in Germany. In the United States, the average growth gap between the individual states in the nineties was as high as 7 % of gross state product (GSP). Of course, much remains to be done. There is a clear correlation between the politically urgent structural reforms and the international standing of a currency. The development of the euro's exchange rate since 1999 has not been satisfactory, yet it is not a measure of the success or failure of EMU. The euro and globalization are exerting pressure on policies and markets in Europe to become more flexible. At the same time, however, the reforms will - in the medium to long term - accelerate the pace of economic growth and enhance the attractiveness of the euro area as well as the single currency. What will be a crucial factor, therefore, is that policymakers commit themselves in a credible manner to tackling the necessary changes and, at the same time, to safeguarding the stability of the euro. As monetary history has repeatedly shown, a stable internal value is the precondition for gaining that sustained confidence of international investors, which also gives a currency its external stability.  One of the main tasks of the national central banks of the Eurosystem at present is preparing for the cash changeover on January 1, 2002. This is a tremendous logistical task. It is a great challenge to all of us. But I am confident. We will have a smooth transition from national currencies to the euro. I am also convinced that the issuing of the euro in physical form will help to improve acceptance of the new currency in Europe and in particular in Germany. The results of the latest Eurobarometer opinion 
 6 BIS Review 93/2001 survey show already a growth in support for the euro. In the euro area, 66 % of the people support the single currency. Germany is still lagging behind, with 53 % in favor of the euro; however, this is a significant improvement compared with the previous opinion survey.  From an economic point of view the changeover is a non-event; but it is not a merely technical process. It is the final and historical step towards further political integration in Europe. At least, I hope that the euro will also function as a catalyst in that direction. After all, history tells us that normally the territory of a political entity and the monetary area is identical. This is not - or nor yet - the case in Europe. As a consequence, monetary union cannot stand alone. In the medium term, EMU will need to be underpinned by political union. In particular, the stage of intergovernmental cooperation must be overcome in foreign and defense policies, and in domestic and legal policies. That means national interests have to become manageable and ultimately to be overcome in order to move on to truly common European policies. The deepening of European integration and the enlargement of EU offer a unique opportunity to integrate Europe peacefully and to create a region of stability and prosperity. Slowly but surely Europe is beginning to liberate itself from political standstill. Political processes take time since they need to be supported by a public majority. The deepening of integration and the enlargement of the EU both need the support of suitable political and macroeconomic framework conditions. This includes in particular, favorable growth and employment trends, which, in turn, can only be brought about in an environment of price stability. For the first time in history, Europeans from Lapland to Portugal and from Ireland to Greece will use the same currency. And what is also of importance: for the first time since the empire of Charlemagne 1,200 years ago, French and Germans will be united by a single currency. I am convinced that the euro will become a symbol of identification with Europe and of the idea of deeper European integration – if the euro stays a stable currency. This symbol reflects a strong political will and a long-lasting process of economic and political integration:  • towards an open market economy, • towards free competition, • towards tolerance and democracy, • towards freedom and peace. 
 BIS Review 92/2001 1 Christian Noyer: Challenges ahead - the accession process Speech by Mr Christian Noyer, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London, 12 November 2001. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, It is a great pleasure for me to be able to be here today at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to share with you some thoughts on the process of EU accession and the challenges that this process poses for the accession countries. While recognising that this process raises challenges for the EU itself, I will not elaborate on those in my speech today. Undoubtedly, the enlargement of the European Union to embrace a number of countries from central, eastern and southern Europe and the Mediterranean constitutes, after the changeover to the euro banknotes and coins, one of the main challenges currently faced by European policy-makers. However, I would be giving a somewhat misleading impression if I devoted my speech today solely to the “challenges ahead” without first mentioning the very foundations of the European structure. The latter form the basis for our capacity to actually meet those challenges. EU enlargement rests on the proven success of European integration. The European Union constitutes an unprecedented framework for the successful development of regional co-operation. Not only have the original objectives of European integration been achieved, namely to ensure peace and prosperity in a historically conflict-ridden part of the world, the European Union has also shown its ability to overcome the various economic and political challenges with which it has been confronted throughout its almost 45-year history. Such is the attractiveness of the European integration project that, since the Treaty of Rome was signed in 1957, nine countries have joined the original six, and a host of others are keen to do so. A key accomplishment of this progress towards “ever closer union” will become truly tangible in a few weeks' time, on 1 January 2002, when most of the citizens of the European Union will finally have the euro, our money, in their pockets. In many ways, the prospect of EU accession has also been instrumental in triggering reform in the 12 countries currently negotiating entry into the EU, namely five Central and Eastern European countries, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia; three Baltic States, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania; two southern European countries, Bulgaria and Romania; and Cyprus and Malta in the Mediterranean. Following some troublesome years at the beginning of the transition process, the accession countries have made substantial progress in building institutions and designing appropriate policy. The accession countries have now generally achieved macroeconomic stability. The significance of these achievements can be demonstrated by the resilience shown by the accession countries to the Asian and Russian crises in 1997-1998 and, more recently, to the adverse developments in Argentina and other emerging market economies. However, a number of important challenges remain. The years to come will be crucial to ensure that the current significant momentum of the accession process is maintained, and that the remaining difficulties are dealt with effectively in order to permit the smooth integration of accession countries into the EU and, later on, into the euro area. The forthcoming enlargement of the EU will, no doubt, increase the diversity and complexity within the Union in an unprecedented way. In economic terms, the discrepancies in real per capita income and price levels between the accession countries and the euro area are of a magnitude that has never been observed in previous enlargement rounds. In this regard, however, it should be borne in mind that the combined GDP of all the accession countries accounts for only around 5% of that of the EU. The enlargement also confronts European policy-makers with enormous challenges in political and institutional terms. The sheer increase in the number of Member States that the current enlargement represents renders the functioning of decision-making bodies more difficult. As we all know, substantial institutional reforms are needed to ensure that the EU can continue to function effectively after enlargement. From the Eurosystem's perspective, there are five economic issues that appear to be of greater relevance at the current juncture: real convergence, inflation developments in the accession countries, monetary policy and exchange rate strategies, capital account liberalisation, and the structure and functioning of the financial sector. Let me elaborate briefly on each of these. 
 2 BIS Review 92/2001 1. Real convergence Sustainable rates of GDP growth will be a key challenge for accession countries in the years, and even decades, to come. 2000 was the first year since the beginning of the transition process in which all accession countries experienced positive growth. The degree of real convergence with the euro area, that is, the catching-up of the per capita income and price levels of accession countries with those of the euro area, has remained limited. Looking ahead, it appears unlikely that the overall growth differential between the accession countries and the euro area will be significantly higher than a few percentage points. Overall, the gap between the average GDP per capita of the accession countries and that of the euro area remains large. On average, GDP per capita in the accession countries is, in terms of purchasing power parity, around 44% of that of the euro area, and this figure is even lower when current exchange rates are taken into account. The size of the gap, combined with the limited growth differentials, suggests that the process of real convergence will be a very slow one, likely to continue far beyond the tentative dates for EU accession and for the adoption of the euro. Hence, although differences in income levels are compatible with membership of EMU, it is important for accession countries to progress in the process of real convergence with the euro area. In particular, real convergence can help to create economic cohesion within EMU and promote integration between Members States. Further real convergence will also help to minimise the risks and the effects of asymmetric shocks. Against this background, it seems crucial that accession countries pursue structural policies that enhance the potential output growth of their economies. 2. Inflation developments With regard to inflation developments, I should like to stress that, on the whole, the accession countries have made remarkable progress in bringing inflation down to single-digit rates. Inflation in the accession countries is expected to average around 6%-7% by the end of this year. However, reducing inflation from relatively low levels to even lower ones is clearly a difficult task. Evidence points to a number of micro and macroeconomic factors which affect current inflation rates in the accession countries. These include ongoing price liberalisation, privatisation processes, relatively expansionary fiscal policies and stubborn inflation expectations. Inflationary pressures stemming from high productivity growth in the tradable sector of fast-growing economies – known as the Balassa-Samuelson effect – have also been cited as one of the main reasons for higher inflation in catching-up economies, such as those of the accession countries. A closer examination of inflation developments in the accession countries shows, however, that the Balassa-Samuelson effect alone cannot explain the persistence of inflation differentials vis-à-vis the euro area. Moreover, notwithstanding its importance, the Balassa-Samuelson effect should not be overstated when explaining current inflation rates in the accession countries. Indeed, most empirical studies estimate the Balassa-Samuelson effect within a range of 1 to 2 percentage points. This does not mean, however, that the pursuit of real convergence conflicts with further progress on disinflation. On the contrary, the process of disinflation should be advanced in the accession countries, at a pace determined by the overall economic situation and in particular by the need for these countries to increase real convergence. The Maastricht inflation criterion, which will not be revised to take into account any possible Balassa-Samuelson effect, should not be seen as an immediate requirement for these countries, but rather as a medium-term objective for central banks. As the experience of some euro area participants shows, progress in nominal and real convergence can be, and should be, pursued in parallel. Indeed, the experience of countries such as Greece, Spain and Portugal confirms that a key element of their successful entry into the euro area was their success in controlling sources of inflation other than the Balassa-Samuelson effect. In particular, a balanced monetary and fiscal policy mix and the control of real wage increases have supported the disinflation process in these countries, and allowed them to advance in the process of nominal convergence without compromising the gradual catching-up in real incomes. 3. Monetary policy and exchange rate strategies With regard to monetary policy and exchange rate strategies, most accession countries have already indicated their intention to join ERM II as early as possible after entry into the EU. The accession countries have also signalled their intention to adopt the euro as soon as possible, that is, after two years of ERM II membership. 
 BIS Review 92/2001 3 The whole issue of the timing of ERM II membership, both as to when to join and how long to remain in the system, is dependent on a somewhat more complex question, namely whether the discipline which ERM II imposes on its members is advantageous for the accession countries. The answer, in our view, is “yes”. Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to reflect on this question for a moment and explain why we hold this view. Being small open economies, most accession countries cannot disregard exchange rate developments when making their monetary policy decisions. The exchange rate is generally a more potent transmission channel of monetary policy decisions than domestic interest rates, and it also plays a crucial role in explaining the pass-through to price developments in most accession countries. Thus, in order to achieve further disinflation and sustainable growth, excessive exchange rate fluctuations need to be avoided. In our view, and this view is supported by our previous experiences with the EMS/ERM framework, ERM II provides a useful mechanism to anchor exchange rate expectations. At the same time, ERM II, with its adjustable central rate and its current fluctuation band of ±15%, provides accession countries with the same degree of flexibility as the EMS/ERM following the decision to widen the fluctuation band in 1993. This may be suitable for accession countries. Given that accession countries still need to complete the process of restructuring their economies and catching up in terms of real income, the flexibility inherent in ERM II and its wider fluctuation bands provides accession countries with sufficient scope to accommodate these reforms. Bearing in mind that ERM II constitutes a multilateral arrangement, and that it is consistent with the regional integration process in which all accession countries are deeply involved, ERM II is likely to have fewer potential weaknesses than other alternative exchange rate arrangements have shown over recent years. Of course, as for any exchange rate arrangement, coherence between macroeconomic policies must be ensured for successful participation in ERM II. With regard to the length of the period of ERM II membership, in view of the varying degrees of convergence of the accession countries, limiting the duration of ERM II membership to the minimum permissible time to qualify for the adoption of the euro – that is, two years – may not be an optimal choice for all accession countries. Longer membership of ERM II may, in some cases, be helpful since it would allow accession countries to retain the exchange rate as an instrumental policy variable during the catching-up process. Indeed, this option has proven useful for most of the current euro area participants. Again, it is worthwhile to recall the examples of Greece, Portugal and Spain. In the case of Greece, the final revaluation of the drachma on 17 January 2000 took place at the request of Greece, with the agreement of the EU authorities, to support the country's efforts to preserve sustainable price stability and progress in real convergence without jeopardising the competitiveness of the economy. Portugal and Spain, which participated in the EMS/ERM for a longer period of time, also used the option of realigning the respective exchange rates of the escudo and the peseta at several points along the road towards entry into the euro area. Participation in ERM II should, therefore, not be seen as a mere “waiting room” prior to the adoption of the euro. Instead, it should be regarded as a meaningful and flexible framework for increasing nominal and real convergence with the euro area, and for tackling the challenges faced by the accession countries as they progress towards the adoption of the euro. Indeed, the experience of current euro area member countries in the fields of inflation and exchange rate developments strongly suggests that the existing institutional framework for accession to the euro area, including the convergence criteria as defined in the Maastricht Treaty, is sound. Furthermore, this framework should be sufficiently flexible to accommodate most of the challenges that accession countries will face on their path to the eventual adoption of the euro. 4. Capital account liberalisation Ladies and gentlemen, the fourth economic issue I would like to refer to is capital account liberalisation. In several accession countries, capital movements are still subject to a number of restrictions. The most relevant restrictions, from a monetary policy perspective, apply to short-term portfolio investments. Although transitional periods may be allowed under the Treaty in the early years of EU membership, as well as prior to accession under the Europe Agreements, thus far, only a few countries have requested them. In those few cases, transitional periods mainly relate to areas that are not particularly relevant from a monetary policy point of view (e.g. real estate purchases). 
 4 BIS Review 92/2001 Despite the generally positive impact of capital liberalisation on the growth prospects of the accession countries, one should bear in mind that the speed of capital account liberalisation may carry risks for countries with underdeveloped financial sectors, especially in a context of fixed or tightly managed exchange rate regimes. If not carefully sequenced and supported by consistent macroeconomic and structural policies, capital account liberalisation could pose some risks to macroeconomic or financial stability in the accession countries. It is therefore crucial that the right policies are put into place before EU accession. 5. Financial sector structure and functioning The last issue I would like to elaborate on concerns the structure and functioning of the financial sector in the accession countries. Partly for historical reasons, the financial sector in the accession countries is largely dominated by the banking sector, whereas other financial sector intermediaries still need to be further developed. Over the past few years, significant progress has been made in restructuring and consolidating the banking sector. This progress has been accomplished through the large-scale privatisation of state-owned banks and through the extensive opening-up of the banking sector to foreign ownership. Undoubtedly, this process has contributed to greater integration with the EU and significant efficiency gains. It has also supported the strengthening of financial stability and provided the banking sector with know-how and capital. However, the degree of financial intermediation remains rather low and the challenges ahead are considerable. Given the major implications that the structure and functioning of the financial sector may have for macroeconomic developments, a strengthening of the accession countries' financial markets, including the enhancement of legal frameworks and prudential supervision, is needed. The principal reasons for this are twofold. First, the weakness of the financial sector has been partly responsible for the relatively modest growth rates observed in some accession countries during the last decade. In spite of substantial structural reforms in the real sector of the economy, the as yet insufficient development of the financial sectors may have made the transition to a fully functioning market economy more costly in many accession countries. Financial sector development is, therefore, crucial if potential economic growth is to be increased and real incomes are to catch up with those of the euro area. Second, financial stability in the accession countries is of great relevance to the ECB, since it is a central aspect of ensuring the smooth conduct of monetary policy in an enlarged euro area. Financial sector vulnerabilities have to be avoided as they may complicate the efficient working of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. They may also pose great challenges for the conduct of monetary policy, for central banks' credibility and for the maintenance of price stability. Finally, accession countries have embarked on the process of developing a modern financial market infrastructure. This is essential in order to facilitate the transition from a planned to a market economy and, at the same time, to support the conduct of a single monetary policy in an enlarged euro area. Setting up such a financial infrastructure is, however, a difficult task. First, preparatory work in this field is subject to very long lead times and, therefore, needs to be implemented years before the adoption of the euro. Second, the target of this preparatory work is a moving one: certain components of the euro area financial infrastructure may need to be adapted before new Member States can be integrated into the euro area. Furthermore, there is an ongoing debate in international fora about the optimal structure of modern financial markets in an increasingly integrated global financial system. More and more, market pressures, economies of scale and efficiency gains point to the need for further consolidation of the financial infrastructure. In the context of EU entry, and taking into account the relatively small size of the financial sectors in the accession countries, plans to develop the financial market infrastructure may need to bear in mind the specific conditions applying to accession countries. Indeed, there is a risk that accession countries may now be investing considerable efforts and resources to develop infrastructures similar to those that some euro area countries are trying to rationalise. Concluding remarks Ladies and gentlemen, I shall conclude with a few brief remarks of a more general nature. The ultimate goal of entry into the euro area is an ambitious one and, for this reason, it is necessary to start preparing for this prospect well in advance. Broadly speaking, the prospect of EU membership should encourage accession countries to make all the macro and microeconomic adjustments necessary to join the euro area. In this way, EU accession may set in motion a virtuous cycle of long-term 
 BIS Review 92/2001 5 sustainable economic growth. As the experience of current euro area participants shows, accession countries may encounter difficulties, and even sometimes feel frustration, during the different stages of this process. However, these difficulties should not discourage accession countries from going ahead with the project of entry into EU and, later on, the euro area. Undoubtedly, EU enlargement poses great challenges to both the accession countries and to the European Union itself. Creating the right economic and political conditions and adjusting the European institutions for the eventual integration into the EU of all accession countries is certainly an enormous task. However – and here I come back to what I mentioned at the beginning of my speech – the project of European integration should not be regarded just as a stimulating exercise of facing up to never-ending “challenges ahead”, but rather as a historic opportunity to deepen and extend the idea of Europe. I am confident that we, as Europeans, and more specifically in our central banking function at the ECB, will be able to master the “challenges ahead” and, in this way, to contribute to the completion of the European project through the successful integration of the future Member States into the euro area. Thank you for your attention. 
 BIS Review 92/2001 1 Stephen Grenville: Policy dialogue in East Asia What are the criteria for determining the number of groups for policy dialogue in East Asia? And the criteria for participation?  Talk by Mr Stephen Grenville, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to the Australian National University Conference on Regional Financial Arrangements in East Asia, Canberra, 12-13 November 2001. The references for the speech can be found on the Reserve Bank of Australia’s website.  *      *      * I want to begin by clarifying the issues, as I see them. If we can define what we are trying to achieve with regional co-operation, then we will be in a better position to determine the nature of the regional groupings needed to achieve this. My brief today is to discuss the relevant criteria for groups which carry out a policy dialogue in East Asia. In defining the area of interest, I may widen this brief somewhat, because the sort of regionalism which I hope will develop over time goes well beyond policy dialogue, and indeed policy dialogue in its narrow sense does not seem to me to be the most pressing need. Policy dialogue, as it evolved in the post-War period, was largely about macro-economic policy co-ordination, and this was really only relevant for the largest countries – essentially the G3. For the rest of us, this was not a case of policy dialogue, but rather monologue – the G3 did what they could in terms of international co-ordination, and we wore the results, principally in the form of substantial fluctuation in the G3 exchange rates, which was often inconvenient to many. So there certainly remains a major issue of international macro policy co-ordination, and perhaps we might hope to have some input to it from the periphery, but this will not be central to our regional arrangements. There are, however, important areas where regional arrangements have the potential to be very important for the development of policy: these are trade and (less certain) exchange rate arrangements. The first of these seems beyond the scope and brief of this paper, so I will leave it untouched: the second is the focus of discussions tomorrow, so that, too, I leave to others. This still leaves important regional policy issues, including the possibility of policy co-ordination in the face of a repeat - or variation - of the 1997/98 Asian crisis - I will certainly talk about this. But the much more general, wider and perhaps more important issue relates to globalisation – how to maintain the momentum which has brought so much benefit (particularly to this region); how to make it work better with better rules; and how to get proper representation for our interests in the forums which determine the parameters – the “rules of the game” – for globalisation. This, in my view, should be a central focus of regional policy dialogue. With this general introduction, let me turn to the specifics of what different functions regional co-operation might serve, grouped under the two omnibus headings of “policy co-ordination” and “globalisation”. Policy co-ordination Having downplayed the centrality of macro policy co-ordination in my introduction, let me now try to be more specific about where a degree of policy co–ordination will still be important. I have left aside trade and exchange rates, acknowledging the importance of each of these. But beyond these, I do not see a compelling reason why, say, the countries of Asia should be running similar monetary or fiscal policies, or even why they should co-ordinate their different macro policies. The heavy-lifting of macro policy-making is, broadly speaking, a domestic matter.1                                                       1  I have argued that there is only a minor role for international macro policy co-ordination (and this largely confined to the G3). But as international interdependence increases, the need to know and understand what is happening in the world economy increases. The current international conjuncture is perhaps more coincident in its cyclical shape than would be imposed on it by globalisation as such – the coincidence of downturns in the G3 is, to a large extent, idiosyncratic. But there can be little doubt that the international linkages are much stronger than ten years ago, and in all probability will be much stronger still in ten years' time. For all of us, an ability to forecast how the rest of the world is moving will be critical to our own policy-making. 
 2 BIS Review 92/2001 There is, however, one aspect of policy-making where regional co-operation might make a real and substantial contribution – i.e. surveillance. Surveillance is, perhaps, an unfortunate way of describing the process, because it has connotations of checking up and looking over the shoulder of policy-making in individual countries, i.e. something more intrusive than is generally acceptable in this region. When does “peer pressure” become interference? The principal objective of surveillance should not be to “catch out” and expose any policymakers who are doing the wrong thing, but rather to act as an advocate of good policies and as a catalyst for reform: the context has to be positive and supportive, not negative, proselytising, and adversarial.2 Reluctance to be too assertive is, to some degree, the current characteristic, but the process needs to be given more content if surveillance is to have a beneficial effect. Perhaps I can explain the point more clearly by referring to the surveillance process as it occurs in the OECD, and in particular as it occurred in relation to Australia during the 1980s. Each year we faced the interrogation of our peers (the OECD Secretariat and two “examining” countries), who quizzed us on both macro and micro policies, invariably from the viewpoint of hard-edged economic analysis. This is not to say that they were always right, but they were always putting forward the viewpoint and input of best-practice economics. Why was this so valuable to the policy-making process? It made it easier for the national bureaucrats (who, by-and-large, agreed with these policies) to get these policies implemented, within a diverse decision-making framework in which other less-economically-rational views might well have prevailed. The fact that these surveillance examinations received quite wide publicity and added spice and fire to the policy debate was often inconvenient at the time (because we bureaucrats had to defend the then-current – imperfect – policies), but was almost always salutary and useful in moving us towards better policies. The additional area where policy co-ordination may well be relevant is in crisis response. Other sessions at this conference will be looking at this issue in more detail. Specifically, the main area of co-operation here will be in the pooling of foreign exchange reserves. Building up large foreign exchange reserves has been the clearly demonstrated response to the crisis: faute de mieux, international capital flow volatility will be handled by substantial reserve-holding. This rather inefficient response can be made less inefficient by pooling. It is also true that regional groups share enough self-interest to encourage them to go beyond simple altruism: we are all going to be readier to help our neighbours than to participate in some kind of collective action for a more distant region (which argues for regional arrangements to supplement the IMF, rather than the more universal approach of the New Arrangements to Borrow). Rather than anticipate the later debate on this issue here, let me quote, with approval, Yung Chul Park (2000): “One development that has encouraged the regional cooperation in East Asia has been the slow progress of the reform of the international financial system. The urgency of reform in the G-7 countries has receded considerably with the rapid recovery of East Asia. … As long as the structural problems on the supply side of capital are not addressed, the East Asian countries will remain as vulnerable to future crises as they were before. Instead of waiting until the G-7 creates a new architecture, whose effectiveness is at best questionable, it would be in the interest of East Asia to work together to create their own system of defence.”. Globalisation As I foreshadowed, my feeling is that the issues of globalisation are even more important to regional co-operation than is policy co-ordination. Let me record briefly some of the characteristics of globalisation, to try to establish why policy must be attuned to the needs of this new globalised world, in order to foster globalisation and – at the same time – ensure that we all get maximum benefit from it. First, a point which is close to tautology, but full of policy implication nevertheless: globalisation means that an increasing part of our economic relations are with external parties (for many of the East Asian economies, foreign trade (exports and imports taken together) far exceeds GDP.                                                       2 As Dobson (2001, p. 26) observes: “Peers must be willing to supply constructive criticism and those in potential or actual difficulty must be willing to accept objective analysis. Unless governments are willing to enter into this kind of give and take, the regional mechanism will simply become another overlay of officialdom.” 
 BIS Review 92/2001 3  Foreign Trade (per cent to GDP) Australia 36 China 42 Hong Kong 255 Indonesia 79 Japan 18 Korea 84 Malaysia 202 New Zealand 54 Philippines 99 Singapore 296 Thailand 108 United States 20  Domestic trade and investment is subject to myriad controls and regulations, even in the most “free market” economies. In contrast, international relations are lightly regulated. “The dilemma we face as we enter the 21st Century is that markets are striving to become global while the institutions needed to support them remain by and large national.” (Rodrik - quoted in The Economist, 29 September 2001, page 19 of 'A survey of globalisation'). Is this disparity in regulatory density reflecting some innate characteristic – that these relationships are, say, simpler – or does it reflect the greater difficulty of regulating across sovereign borders? It seems to me to be the latter, and we should address this deficiency. The need for “rules of the game” seems, if anything, to be greater in a globalised world than in a less integrated world. One of the defining characteristics of globalisation is the importance of scale, as technology drives the optimal business units larger and larger in a number of important areas. The other defining characteristic is “winner takes all”, and its related concept of “first mover advantage”. These characteristics combine together to produce areas where monopoly or quasi-monopoly will be important. The old response to monopoly – to break it up and force competition – will be precluded or restricted because of the inefficiencies that would result from this action. So the alternative channel will be to achieve a network of rules which addresses the issues raised by these imperfectly competitive firms. Given the increasingly international nature of enterprise, what is needed to complement this development are international rules, not specific to any one country, but developed in a uniform way and acceptable to all. These would address issues such as monopoly, intellectual property rights, and legal issues. Prudential supervision, capital flows, taxes and “industry policy” may also be suitable cases for treatment. In short, as closer relations impose greater need for uniformity (e.g. in tax or investment regimes), the need is to develop these in a collective international environment. Tom Friedman (1999) has called such rules the “Golden Straitjacket”, which captures two important characteristics of the process – the degree of uniformity which globalisation will impose; and the generally beneficial nature of these rules.3 Rules to govern global relationships will generally need to be on a uniform multinational basis, but this does not preclude the need for important regional input, in order to ensure the applicability of the universal rules to all countries. A good set of rules requires recognition of the great diversity of circumstances and institutions between countries. One specific example here is the rules on prudential supervision. It seems quite likely that the rules relevant to banks in this region would be somewhat                                                       3  It would be easy to exaggerate just how universal and all-encompassing the Golden Straitjacket may be. It does not seem true, for example, that tax rates will have to become uniform across countries. 
 4 BIS Review 92/2001 different (reflecting the different degree of complexity and make-up of banks). We certainly would not want a set of international rules which unfairly penalised banks in this region, simply on the grounds that they were not the same as banks in London or New York. At the general level, the collective wisdom of worldwide experience needs to be incorporated into the Golden Straitjacket more effectively than it has been to date. It is now part of the conventional wisdom that there were various deficiencies of perception and analysis in the international response to the Asian financial crisis. The “one size fits all” approach came out of earlier Latin American experience, and was a poor fit for East Asia in 1997. To some extent these deficiencies were driven either by inadequate representation, or by inability to have our voice heard above the confident assertions of those whose policy prescription was driven either by doctrinal interests, vested interests, or sometimes simple ignorance. Regional groupings are the principal way of addressing this “democratic deficit”. There seems little room for debate that this region is inadequately represented in many of the forums which determine the important issues of globalisation. There seems little doubt, also, that the region pays a price for this. East Asia, with an IMF quota of less than 15 per cent, accounts for more than 20 per cent of world GDP, almost a quarter of world trade, and almost half of world foreign exchange reserves. Prominent American economist David Hale (2001, p. 8) has observed: “In the past, the U.S. government has only supported major (IMF) interventions for countries in which the U.S. had a military base. During the Asia crisis, for example, the U.S. acted aggressively to support Korea, but played a much less significant role in Thailand and Indonesia.”. The case I want to make here is that much of our efforts in regional groups should be directed towards correcting this. There have been very important improvements in international financial architecture since the crisis. The IMF has added new lending facilities that should be better able to handle the demands of capital account crises. The Fund has also started to pay greater attention in its work to financial markets and financial systems and has been critically examining both its policy prescriptions and its general approach to conditionality. Representation has greatly improved, with an additional eight Asian countries gaining membership of the BIS. The creation of G20 (with six Asian members) is, potentially, a good breakthrough. At a more detailed level, the negotiation of Basel II involved a degree of consultation entirely missing from Basel I (which had been tailored specifically for G10). There has been a push from the FSF, the IMF and the G20 to improve countries' resilience to crises by promoting adherence to standards and codes and there has been much discussion of ways to secure a greater role for the private sector in crisis prevention and resolution. Within central banking circles, there had been some support for the formation of an Asian BIS given the Eurocentric focus of the existing organisation. In the event, this has been satisfied by the setting-up of a BIS office in Hong Kong and the creation of the Asian Consultative Council (ACC) of the BIS, which will give Asian central banks a greater say in the operation of the organisation. Some Asian countries have also been invited to attend some of the Basel/G10 committees associated with the BIS, although sadly not on a permanent full-member basis. But the issue of ensuring that our voice is heard remains unresolved, with the IMF still giving inadequate place to this region, and other more representative groups (such as the G20) still to find a role for themselves in a world which is crowded with competing and overlapping institutions, none ready to diminish their own status and power, and many governed by inadequately representative views. Who should be represented in the councils of the world? This should not simply depend on GDP – this is important, but an equally important issue is what contribution each participant can make to the debate, and to the production of a universally acceptable set of rules. To be more specific, the G10 representation is deficient not just because of its limited numbers, but because of the uniformity of view of its European-dominated membership – too many people with the same viewpoint.4  The development of the Globalisation Rules should be a two-way process – the regional groups give input into the rule-making, and then act to put these rules in place in their individual countries (or at least adapt their own rules to fit the straitjacket). The regional groups “spread the word” in order to improve policy. This is closely related to the idea that policy improvement can come out of the surveillance process, but it adds the extra point that better policy can also come out of a process of swapping ideas and simply observing the way other countries go about doing things. The process of globalisation is forcing a degree of uniformity or similarity on policies, and to the extent that this is “best practice”, the quicker we all adapt to it the better.                                                       4 For more discussion of the role and rationale for regional arrangements, see Grenville (1998).   
 BIS Review 92/2001 5 What does this mean for the shape of regional arrangements? As a preliminary to these issues, we need to note that international dialogue takes place at the multilateral, regional and bilateral levels. We should not be surprised or concerned at this “layering”. Nor should we be overly concerned if there is a fair degree of overlap between groups and meetings. If an issue is important, then it probably needs to be discussed in a variety of forums, each of which will bring different insights to bear. Checks and balances are important. Groups are not simply about getting together to make decisions: they are often about getting together in order to learn about decisions or discussions which have taken place elsewhere. So we should not be surprised to see, for example, Finance Ministers meeting together separately from Central Bankers, and then, separately, the two will meet collectively.  We certainly should not allow some ill-defined principle of “territorial exclusivity” to constrain dialogue which would otherwise be useful. When the Asian Monetary Fund was proposed after the onset of the Asian crisis, some people argued that it would overlap with the IMF (and this no doubt coloured the views not only of the Fund itself, but those who had a more prominent position within the Fund than they would have had within an Asian Monetary Fund). We should recall that, in many countries, there are three levels of government, each with its own contribution to make, and each interacting with the others in ways that should be fruitful – passing up regional issues which have been digested (in the sense of having achieved a degree of consensus), and passing down more nation-wide macro views to the regional levels. Petty territorial jealousies have no place in working out the proper number of organisations and their relationships: the issues should relate to bringing together groups with commonality of interest, and ensuring that they are linked (both upwards and downwards) in fruitful ways. This commonality of interest is the most important criterion for useful interaction. This does not mean that all the participants have to be at the same stage of development, but it probably does mean that they should be travelling along much the same path, albeit at different distances and speeds along that path. This commonality of interest allows the possibility of an effective consensus, which can be passed to the next level, representing the group as a whole. What are the right numbers for a group? If the issues revolved around trade or currency unions, then economic analysis can offer useful guidance on which countries should be included. Who are (or potentially could be) good trade partners? What countries meet the criteria for an optimal currency area? The original APEC membership, for example, makes economic sense as a trading group because of established trading ties.5 But we have suggested here that some fruitful dialogue is more general and nebulous. At one level, one might ask whether it matters: the membership of European single currency was indeterminate until the last minute - it turned out to be much more numerous than most people had expected, and looking ahead it will probably become far more numerous than the original proponents envisaged. That said, there seems to be a lot to be said for keeping numbers down to manageable levels, which for practical purposes might be defined in terms of how many people can comfortably sit around the same table (I am tempted to add “and communicate with each other without the use of microphones”). What we know is that when we get to the size of universal “one country one vote” representation (as seen in the UN), effective decision-making becomes extraordinarily difficult and “lowest common denominator” outcomes often prevail. To give a concrete example of a response to the vexed issue of numbers: the G20 was, at one stage in its evolution, rather larger, but it was recognised that it had to be contracted. For surveillance, the relevant point will be that smaller groups can have much more candid (and therefore useful) discussion than can larger groups. “Small may well be beautiful”. If, over time, the various participants develop knowledge, empathy and understanding of the practical policy constraints, then so much the better. When it comes to the task of developing rules (see the discussion above on globalisation), the important thing is for the rules to be developed by experts or technicians – those who know the nuts and bolts of a particular issue rather than the arm-waving generalists. If the degree of detail in domestic rules and regulations is any indication of what it takes to ensure good and efficient commerce within countries, why should international dealings require less complexity? These rules may well be the same ones which apply in domestic jurisdictions, but it is only the technicians who can give an accurate reading on whether this is appropriate or not. When compromise is needed, the compromise will be on the basis of technical and expert issues, and not on the basis of voting power at the table.                                                       5 See Garnaut (1993, p. 308). 
 6 BIS Review 92/2001 Two historical analogies The obvious model for policy co-ordination in the broad sense is Europe, which over a period of four decades has progressed to economic union despite a history of hostile relations between members. Europe's success can be attributed to two main factors. Firstly, the economic dynamic: exploiting the obvious economic advantages which follow from geographic proximity. A second important factor in Europe's success was the underlying political imperative – a firmly held view on the part of a number of politicians of the need to pursue greater integration so as to reduce the prospects of future conflict. This was actively supported by the United States. The G10 had a much more specific genesis, formed from the countries that agreed to provide a loan facility to back up the IMF's resources in 1962. These resources were to be made available in the event of potential impairment of the international financial system, and therefore only to the G10 countries themselves. Over the intervening years, the G10 has come to be central to issues governing the world financial system, both in the context of the IMF and the BIS. The enormously influential Basel Rules for Prudential Supervision were developed by (and, initially, for) the restricted club of the G10. The point to emphasise here is that groups which form for one purpose can metamorphose into new functions – in this case, far more important than the initial function. (We note that the G10 is also an illustration of why it is important to gain a seat at the table from the outset, since the incumbent members – particularly the smaller ones – will try to avoid having their power diluted.) The group's effectiveness over an extended period probably reflects a relatively small and focused membership. However, as the world has developed, the G10 has looked increasingly unrepresentative of the global economy, giving a disproportionate say to small European economies and no say to the rapidly developing countries of Asia and Latin America. A couple of lessons might be drawn from the historic experience: • groups need specific tasks to weld them together – “frank and fruitful exchanges of views” are good but not enough. The Europeans started with the Coal and Steel Community: i.e. something of real substance; • patience is not just a virtue: it is a necessity in a world where it takes time to build institutions. Progress is not steady: it may stall for a time, and the group has to hold together waiting for the tide to turn; • there is a sense of community and common interest stemming from geographic contiguity, which goes beyond simple economic linkages.  If progress towards closer international relations is important, then institution building will be an important element. “Virtual” secretariats may have their place, but real bricks-and-mortar institutions, with effective and active secretariats, will be needed. Charles Wyplosz (2001) makes a compelling case that the progress of European integration was hugely assisted by the presence of Europe-wide institutions, which could provide some on-going momentum and in particular could “pull a plan out of the drawer” when the country representatives were ready to discuss the next step. It is only if there are bureaucrats with an on-going vested interest in pushing forward that such plans will be ready – waiting in the “bottom drawer” – to put on the table when circumstances are propitious. How well do current groups “fit”? In the detailed discussion here, I have put to one side the issues of trade and exchange rate co-ordination. But now, when we turn to see how the existing regional institutions meet these needs, we should put the full range of regional arrangements on the table. • APEC is the broadest regional grouping, bridging, most importantly, East Asia and North America, but also incorporating the likes of Chile, Mexico and Russia. Its predominantly trade focus has seen its fortunes wax and wane with developments in global trade, although the addition of Finance Ministers' and Leaders' meetings have broadened its coverage. Its principal achievement to date has been the Bogor Declaration under which developed countries agreed to strive for free trade and investment by 2010 and developing countries by 2020. However, even this has shown the tensions inherent with a relatively disparate group, with initial calls by some countries for a binding and measurable process significantly watered down. The Finance Ministers' process has focused on encouraging regional 
 BIS Review 92/2001 7 dialogue and promoting capacity building and may not be suited to a more substantive agenda, particularly given political tensions between China and Taiwan.  • The Manila Framework Group has a broadly similar East Asian-North American structure. It had its genesis in the push for an Asian Monetary Fund in the midst of the Asian crisis. It is seen as proving one of the better surveillance mechanisms among the regional groups and also takes an interest in global architecture issues. It could be (but is not yet) the forum for developing regional positions which are then taken to world forums such as IMFC and G20. One of its main initial functions was to provide a co-operative financing arrangement to supplement IMF resources. This was initially reflected in the second line of defence facilities offered to Indonesia and Korea. More recently the idea has been revived, with discussions underway on the possibility of a more formal on-going arrangement.  • EMEAP is a narrower group in two senses. It is a purely central bank forum, drawn from the East Asian core of the above two groups. EMEAP's stated goal has been to strengthen the co-operative relationship among the central banks of the region, although various members have held ambitions of the group becoming a more substantial organisation, along the lines of the BIS. The furthest EMEAP has moved down this track is a system of bilateral repurchase agreements over US Treasuries, to provide short-term foreign currency liquidity support. EMEAP's strength is its specialist working groups, which promote good practices and better understanding at a technical level. This is, potentially, the forum for developing regional consensus on such issues as capital flows (Chilean-style inflow taxes: dealing with in extremis crisis resolution). The value of the forum at the highest level is now being tested by the formation of the BIS Asian Consultative Council, which has drawn Asian countries more into the mainstream of BIS activities. This is already the forum for developing regional positions on financial issues, so the close link with the BIS is natural and logical.6  • Compared with other regional groups, there is perhaps a greater uniformity of interests and views within ASEAN, and it has been going longest. ASEAN has some runs on the board already with the ASEAN Free Trade Area (which has been strengthened since the crisis) and a multilateral foreign currency swap arrangement. More recently, ASEAN has set up a surveillance mechanism, with the assistance of the ADB, in an effort to foresee and forestall crises.  • The broad agenda of ASEAN+3 covers economic, social and political fields. However, its most important achievement has been the Chiang Mai initiative, which incorporates, among other things, a regional financing arrangement (building on the ASEAN arrangements) to supplement existing international facilities.  The significant momentum in ASEAN+3 may reflect East Asia's equivalent to Europe's “integrate to avoid further conflict” imperative. There is also a strong belief that the international institutions are not set up to work in Asia's favour and that Asia must therefore look after itself – particularly given the large proportion of world reserves held in Asia. This has been felt very strongly since the Asian crisis and it is no co-incidence that the Chiang Mai initiative grew around those countries that felt most aggrieved. Similarly, countries in this group have more in common than the groups that bridge the Pacific. It could also be argued that the size of the arrangement made it a more workable decision-making entity, although it is difficult to determine whether this reflects physical numbers or simply the greater uniformity of country interests embodied in the group. Reserve pooling arrangements could have occurred within the Manila Framework Group or EMEAP, but ASEAN+3 seems to be where the action is at present. Just as G10 gravitated from its original narrow specific purpose to become the centre of prudential supervision, ASEAN+3 might be where the more general foreign exchange rate discussions occur. For our part in Australia, we are supportive of these moves, regardless of the forum in which they evolve. Obviously, we would like to have a seat at the table, since we believe Australia has much to offer from its own experience and resources. We also feel our own policy-making has been enriched through our engagement with Asia and we have certainly appreciated the input of like-minded countries from the region in the difficult international debates of recent years.                                                       6 SEACEN is a longstanding grouping of central bankers, focused on South-East Asia, but with membership spread as wide as Sri Lanka, Korea and Mongolia. One of the initial aims of SEACEN was to establish an ASEAN voting group for the IMF and the IBRD. The voting group still exists and SEACEN Governors continue to meet annually, although SEACEN's significant outward contribution appears to be its training and research efforts through the SEACEN Centre. 
 8 BIS Review 92/2001 Should the Chiang Mai initiative continue to develop towards an ultimate goal of becoming a regional monetary fund, my view is that we should support it. If there were major developments in this regard, participants presumably would want to assess whether the Manila Framework Group, the APEC Finance Ministers, EMEAP and SEACEN are still playing a unique role. The bottom line is that it is probably too early to assess which groups will continue to play a useful role, given uncertainty over a future world trade round, G20's unformed mandate, and the future directions of ASEAN+3. We should, nonetheless, be critically watching developments among the regional groupings over the next two to three years with a view to making tough decisions when the time is right. Conclusion I have tried to make the case, here, that the rationale for regional groupings will not be to achieve macro policy co-ordination. The powerful case is a wider one – we have a commonality of interest because geography and contiguity still matter, even in a world of globalisation (or even more than before). It is part of a more general view that “we are not alone”. We can learn much from the experience of those around us, and the gaining of this experience is the often nebulous and formless process of talking issues through with people of common interests. We meet to discuss a specific topic, and we end up with wider knowledge, and better general understanding, of each other. If this view is correct, then regional dialogue is not inimical to globalisation: it is, in fact, its hand-maiden and ally. 
 BIS Review 91/2001 1 David Dodge: Brief outlook for economic growth and inflation in Canada Opening statement by Mr David Dodge, Governor of the Bank of Canada, before the House of Commons Standing Committee on Finance, Ottawa, 7 November 2001. *      *      * We are pleased to appear before this Committee, on the occasion of the release today of our autumn Monetary Policy Report, which provides our latest assessment of the outlook for economic growth and inflation in Canada. Mr. Knight and I hope to be able to return for future issues of the Report, every six months.  Right now, all national economies face difficulties—difficulties stemming from the further weakening of the world economy and from the terrorist acts in the United States. As businesses, governments, and individuals in Canada—and around the world—strive to come to terms with the implications of those acts, the main preoccupation is, naturally, with the near term. But, as I said in a speech in Moncton two weeks ago, at times like this, it is also very important that we step back and look past current developments, to the longer-term trends and potential of our economy. Viewed from this angle, the outlook is brighter. The progress that we have made over the past decade in strengthening our economic foundations is remarkable. And it should stand us in good stead, no matter what short-term turbulence and uncertainties we face.  True, at the moment, we are beset by tremendous uncertainties. And I would like to turn to those now, as I discuss the economic outlook and the steps that the Bank is taking to support growth in Canada.  When I appeared before you in May 2001, the incoming information was broadly in line with the Bank's expectations of a modest pickup in growth in the second half of 2001 and further strengthening in 2002. Among the factors that would bring this about, we counted the completion of the inventory adjustment, tax cuts, the easing in domestic monetary conditions, and a recovery in U.S. business investment.  But, by midsummer, evidence began to accumulate that the expected rebound in U.S. investment would be delayed and that the economic slowdown there would be deeper and more protracted than previously expected. Economic activity outside North America had also begun to show more clearly the effects of weaker U.S. growth and of the ongoing global retrenchment in the information and telecommunications sectors. In Canada too, there were signs that domestic demand, which had held up through the first part of 2001, was softening and that the inventory adjustment, particularly in the electrical and electronic sectors, was less advanced than expected.  Accordingly, we revised down our projections for the second half of 2001 and the first half of 2002. And, at the end of August, we lowered interest rates to support domestic demand growth and to keep inflation near the target of 2 per cent over the medium term.  The terrorist acts in the United States, and their worldwide fallout, greatly heightened the degree of uncertainty, further dampening near-term growth prospects. To underpin confidence in the face of this uncertainty, we took the exceptional step of lowering interest rates by ½ of a percentage point on 17 September, outside our regular schedule of fixed announcement dates.  The ongoing economic consequences of the terrorist acts are very difficult to assess. These developments are unlike anything we have ever experienced in North America, and it will take some more time to understand their full implications.  If we consider the direct effects of the attacks, their immediate impact on consumer and business confidence, and adjustments to address increased security risks, the Bank expects that output growth in Canada will be close to zero or slightly negative in the second half of 2001. For all of 2001, this implies growth of about 1½ per cent.  As we look to 2002, the timing and strength of a recovery will depend crucially on geopolitics and on how soon confidence returns to normal in North America. But once the uncertainty stemming from terrorist acts dissipates, I expect that healthy growth in output, investment, and employment will resume, given Canada's sound economic fundamentals.  At present, one can envisage two scenarios with respect to confidence. In the first, confidence could be restored quickly, and robust growth could resume, supported by the substantial monetary and fiscal 
 2 BIS Review 91/2001 stimulus already in place. In the second, confidence could stay weak for some time and, consequently, growth would remain sluggish through most of 2002.  Under either scenario, by the end of 2002, our economy would still be operating at levels that are below capacity. Core inflation is thus expected to fall to about 1½ per cent by the second half of 2002. Total CPI inflation is also expected to decline to about 2 per cent by the end of 2001 and to move below that during 2002, if energy prices remain at or below their early-September levels.  Based on these considerations, on 23 October, we again lowered our key policy interest rate by ¾ of a percentage point. The cumulative reduction of 3 full percentage points since January aims to support growth and to keep inflation close to the 2 per cent target over the medium term.  Given the many unknowns in the current environment, we will continue to monitor the situation very closely and adjust our outlook in the light of new information.  
 BIS Review 91/2001 1 Klaus Liebscher: The Euro area - an anchor of stability in Europe and the world Luncheon speech by Mr Klaus Liebscher, Governor of the Oesterreichische Nationalbank, at the East-West-Conference, Wien, 6 November 2001. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, I am glad to have this opportunity to personally thank you all for your participation and all speakers for their active involvement in this year’s East-West Conference, which centers on topics that are of long-term relevance for Eastern, Central and Western European countries, of relevance to the growing integration and historic reunification of our continent, but certainly also of relevance outside Europe. It is a pleasure for the Oesterreichische Nationalbank to continue the long tradition of offering our annual East-West Conferences as a platform and a meeting place for debates on issues relevant to those countries – but not only to them – in order to help developing answers to the challenges ahead. Since the very inception of transition, the Oesterreichische Nationalbank has had the opportunity to be an active partner for central banks in transition countries. At the same time, the Oesterreichische Nationalbank has been actively participating in another historic project, the realization of the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) and the introduction of the euro. The establishment of the euro as the single currency in 12 sovereign countries of the European Union was certainly not a purely economic move, but rather another major step in the process of European integration that began more than half a century ago.  Ladies and gentlemen,  The strong rise of commodity prices, in particular of the oil price, in 1999 and 2000, recent economic turbulences in some emerging markets and the tragic events of September 11 have not compromised stability in the euro area. On the contrary, and I would like to stress this especially, EMU, among other factors, contributed to avoiding possible exchange rate or financial tensions in Europe. However, the terrorist attacks on the U.S. have further dampened global economic activity in 2001 and will postpone an economic rebound at least for one or two quarters in 2002.  Apart from the irreplaceable human loss, the direct effect of the terrorist attacks on the overall U.S. economy is likely to be limited. However, the indirect effects on private consumption, investment and savings could be more significant as confidence of consumers and business has already stated to fade. Due to increased uncertainty, investors have become more risk-averse. But policy makers reacted quickly. Central banks around the world, including the Eurosystem, acted swiftly by providing ample liquidity to financial institutions and lowering key interest rates decisively. This adjustment of interest rates came on top of earlier significant rate cuts. The Governing Council of the ECB has also lowered its key interest rate by 100 basispoints from 4 ¾ to 3 ¾ % since May 2001. Moreover, the United States and the euro area have grown increasingly resilient to shocks over the past decade. Structural reforms aiming at efficient and flexible product and labor markets, deregulated financial markets and improved public finances have enhanced the ability of our economies to cope with adverse shocks.  Thus I am confident that the world economy, after a temporary slowdown, will return to healthier growth rates in the course of 2002. In this assessment, the single currency plays a pivotal role, since the euro has established itself as a stable anchor not only for the European, but also for the global economy.  Among the benefits already being reaped from EMU are the following:  • a stable currency based on price stability throughout the euro area and • a stable factor in the international financial system,  • a huge domestic market with 300 million inhabitants (with high purchasing power),  • deeper and further integrated European financial markets,  • lower transaction costs for intra-European trade, tourism and investment and, last, but not least,  
 2 BIS Review 91/2001 • cross-border price transparency and increased competition.  Ladies and gentlemen,  These benefits are assured by a number of stability safeguards: The Eurosystem follows a monetary strategy whose  primary objective is to maintain price stability over the medium term. Price stability is defined as a year-on-year increase in the Harmonized Consumer Price Index (HCPI) for the euro area of below 2 %. Currently, the euro area’s inflation rate is somewhat above our definition of price stability (2.4 % October). This is mainly due to temporary supply shocks, among them the increase of oil prices until the end of 2000 and livestock diseases. But the latest forecasts confirm that inflation will most likely fall below 2 % in the first half of 2002. Still, at the present moment it is too early to conclude that the risks of inflation have been banished. But there is no doubt that these risks have been diminished due to the economic slowdown and weaker pressures from the demand side. Another stability safeguard are fiscal policies in the euro area that have become better coordinated in recent years. The Stability and Growth Pact obliges participating EU Member States to achieve budgetary positions close to balance or in surplus in a sustainable manner, in order to minimize the risk of breaching the budget deficit criterion of 3 % of GDP, according to the Treaty of Maastricht, in the course of a business cycle. Sound budgetary positions not only create enough leeway for automatic stabilizers to take full effect in economic slumps, they also contribute to reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio and consequently the interest burden for governments, increase investors‘ confidence in the euro area, keep interest rates lower than they would otherwise be and, as a consequence, lead to a crowding-in of private investment. Thus, the current economic slowdown should not distract governments from the successful consolidation process we have witnessed so far. Ladies and gentlemen, Perseverance in structural reforms of product, capital and labor markets constitute an important foundation for vibrant and strong euro area economies, underpinning the euro as an anchor of stability. Product markets in the European Union have already undergone sizable improvements, though we should not underestimate how important it is to fully implement internal market legislation and, for example, further reduce state aid. In concert with independent and powerful competition authorities, these types of measures would not only help make economies more efficient and competitive, but would also play their part in ensuring price stability. In addition, it is of utmost importance that the EU continues to be committed to trade liberalization and that we support the opening of a new trade round within the WTO.  Moreover, the introduction of the euro has accelerated structural reforms in the European financial markets. Apart from making financial markets less fragmented and more competitive, it is important that these developments lead to an efficient and stable financial system. The recent tragic events in the United States have shown how quickly financial markets can come under severe stress – and that sound and well supervised markets, with the backing of liquidity provided by central banks, can cope even with such dreadful events. As regards labor markets in the euro area, continuing high structural unemployment and low participation rates in many member countries are a cause for concern. Obviously the functioning of labor markets needs to be improved to allow higher employment. Wage settlements in line with productivity developments appear crucial for the attainment of a sound macroeconomic policy mix. The social partners are called upon to continue to act in a responsible manner, thereby enhancing prospects for healthy growth and employment. If the just mentioned macroeconomic and structural safeguards are adequately kept in place and reinforced, the euro area will remain an area of sustained stability.  Ladies and gentlemen, Where do Central and Eastern European countries enter this picture? I am convinced that enlargement of the European Union and - in a later stage - of EMU will strengthen Central and Eastern European countries‘ positions and further enhance the importance of the euro as an anchor of stability. This brings me to the topic of our current East-West Conference “Convergence and Divergence in Europe” – a pivotal issue with regard to the afore-mentioned historic integration process in Europe. As we all know, nominal convergence of inflation rates, interest rates, budget deficit and debt levels among initially 11, later 12 Member States of the European Union have ensured the launch of 
 BIS Review 91/2001 3 Monetary Union and the introduction of the euro. This process has been accompanied by long-term movements toward real convergence also of income levels, i.e. poorer EU Member States have partly caught up in living standards with wealthier Member States. Yesterday, the first two Sessions of this conference dealt with various aspects related to the history of European convergence in detail. The transition process in Central and Eastern Europe and preparations for EU accession are to a large degree about convergence in a very broad sense. The economic systems in the region are now approaching market economy standards; macroeconomic policy-making is pursued along the same principles as in Western Europe; and institution building and human capital formation are proceeding.  As we all realize, structural changes and modernization may often be very painful. On the other hand, privatization is largely completed in most countries of the region and strong flows of foreign direct investment have contributed to impressive advances in productivity and competitiveness. Real convergence and the balance of real and nominal convergence have been the topics of the afternoon Sessions. Challenges for monetary and exchange rate policy were dealt with. As you know, the Eurosystem proposes a three-step approach for monetary integration of accession countries: Firstly, accession to the European Union, secondly, entrance into ERM II, and thirdly, joining the euro area and the Eurosystem.  Inflation continues to be on average somewhat higher and income-per-capita levels remain much lower in most “transition economies” than in the present-day European Union. In my view, the pace of further disinflation in accession countries should be determined in line with the overall economic situation, in particular with the need of countries to increase real convergence. The Maastricht inflation criterion should not be seen as an immediate requirement for the EU-entry, but rather as an objective of central banks during the period of ERM II participation. But to stick to it and it's definition as formulated in the Maastricht Treaty is a MUST. The Eurosystem’s policy position that nominal and real convergence should be pursued in parallel and that accession countries should strive to achieve price stability in the medium term is very sensible.  Over the past few years, there has been significant diversity in the monetary policy and exchange rate strategies of accession countries. Over this period, the euro has become the main reference currency for most of these countries, including those operating managed floating regimes. In the pre-accession phase, the consistency of the exchange rate strategy with other macroeconomic policies and objectives will take precedence over the choice whether to reduce existing exchange rate flexibility. However, a certain degree of exchange rate orientation toward the euro would be in line with further economic and financial integration and would also be consistent with the prospect of ERM II entry. ERM II arrangements should not necessarily be seen as a „waiting room“ prior to the adoption of the euro, but as a flexible framework for the achievement of further convergence.  In particular, real convergence can help promote both economic cohesion within EMU and integration between member states, thereby supporting efforts to minimize the risk and the effects of asymmetric shocks.  Ladies and gentlemen, This morning the discussions focused on the role of the financial sector. This sector is predestined to provide a key contribution to speeding up real convergence in accession countries. Significant progress has been made over the past years in rehabilitating banking sectors and encouraging foreign ownership. The latter has also contributed to greater microeconomic integration with the EU. But financial sectors are still relatively small and some segments are underdeveloped. Creating conditions for the sound expansion of the intermediating role of the banking sector remains fundamental to promote the efficient use of capital and sustained growth. Progress in corporate governance and the enhancement of the legal frameworks that support the banking sector would also be conducive to achieving the macroeconomic objectives of the accession countries. Looking ahead to an enlarged European Union, it will be even more important in the future than today to keep up the momentum of existing convergence processes and to promote them further. Nominal as well as real convergence are key ingredients of regional and social cohesion and thus, stability, in our Union and the euro area. I am looking forward to the final session this afternoon, which will deal with some of these issues. Ladies and Gentlemen,  
 4 BIS Review 91/2001 We will not be immune to adverse shocks in the future. However, based on the stable architecture of EMU, I am confident that sound policies will continue to keep the euro area a robust shock absorber and the euro a stable anchor. Prudent accession and enlargement policies will enhance the position of the European Union and add to the importance of the euro worldwide, reinforcing it as a major and stable cornerstone of the international monetary system.  This will, however, require perseverance of structural reform efforts in various fields within the European Union, as well as sound convergence strategies and policies on the part of accession candidates. Together we provide our strategic response to rising global competition and our common contribution to global stability.   Thank you very much for your attention. 
 BIS Review 91/2001 1 Christian Noyer: Banking in the euro area Speech by Mr Christian Noyer, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, at the 30th Anniversary of the Association of Foreign Banks' Representatives, Frankfurt, 8 November 2001. *      *      * I am very grateful for the invitation to speak to you on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the Association of "Foreign Banks' Representatives in Germany". Your Association has 117 members from a large number of countries. Several of the member institutions are counted among the 30 major European banks, or among banks from elsewhere with important operations in Europe.  For many banks represented by your Association, the topic of my speech "banking in the euro area" is part of day-to-day business. It is also day-to-day business for the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Eurosystem as a whole, as we conduct our monetary policy operations and run the TARGET large-value payment system.  The further integration of the European banking system and financial markets is in the interests of both banks and the central bank. For banks, it means the liquidity benefits of deeper and wider markets and lower costs when operating in several countries. From the central bank perspective, it enhances the efficient and consistent implementation of the single monetary policy.  We already enjoy the benefits of a common euro area banking system in important respects. An integrated money market exists for liquidity transfers in euro; banks are inter-connected in a common payment system infrastructure; and wholesale securities market activities and corporate finance services do not recognise geographical borders. However, at the retail level, international banks must still treat each country as an individual market. This is because of localised demand and country-specific banking products, and differences in conduct-of-business and consumer protection rules. The remaining differences in regulatory and supervisory practices can also play a role. I believe that few institutions understand this as well as you do, as you still have to cope with the task of navigating business through various national environments.  I should like to explore this double feature of euro area banking today. On one hand, there is the challenge for central banks and supervisory authorities to respond to the emergence of a common wholesale banking system in order to maintain financial stability. On the other hand, greater integration, also in the retail field, remains an important policy objective. I should like to address the two aspects in turn, starting with wholesale banking and then moving on to the retail side. A common wholesale banking system I share the view that a common currency and a common central bank actually determine a unified banking system. In a nutshell, access to a common source of central bank liquidity and a common money market – as well as confidence in the common currency – create strong interconnections between all banks operating in the single currency area. This is the case irrespective of whether we have pan-European banks, or whether discrepancies remain in local retail markets. The case of the United States is illustrative. Even when strong inter-state banking limitations were in place – restricting retail banking activities to small local markets – the US banking system was, nevertheless, commonly viewed as a single system.  Illustrative facts The progress made with integration in wholesale activities has been rapid and remarkable. First, a common euro money market has been in place since the early days of the euro. A large number of financial products can be traded easily with minimal price distortions, small enough to prevent arbitrage across countries. Likewise, data on cross-border trade flows provide a strong indication of market unification. In the case of the predominantly used unsecured interbank contracts, the share of counterparties from other euro area countries has more than doubled after the introduction of the euro. In addition, a large proportion of the activity in euro is conducted with counterparties outside the euro area, especially in London. The share of cross-border transactions is somewhat lower in the case of repo transactions, because of remaining legal and tax barriers and settlement difficulties. All in all, less 
 2 BIS Review 91/2001 than 40% of all interbank market activity is now conducted with domestic counterparties. In 1998, the share was still over 60%. Second, the wholesale payment infrastructure for the euro area – including TARGET, Euro I and Euro Access Frankfurt – is already very unified. Payment flows in these systems again indicate a significant increase in cross-border interbank trading after the introduction of the euro. In terms of value, cross-border transactions currently account for 40% of all kinds of TARGET payments, for instance. The degree of integration is certainly lower for securities settlement, even though a process of consolidation has been taking place. Third, the degree of integration of securities market activities is usually misjudged, since attention is focused on the costs and difficulties of individual investors when investing abroad. The picture is completely different for wholesale activities. The corporate finance markets for major customers are actually already quite highly integrated. To give an example, the share of domestic book-runners for bonds issued by euro area companies dropped from over 80% in 1995 to 36% in 2000. As in many other securities and derivative market activities, the market structure relies on large European or global financial groups. The same trend towards a high level of integration also holds true of wholesale asset management, with investments being increasingly diversified across borders. In terms of volume, growth has been very impressive in the euro-denominated securities markets, until the very recent slowdown and increased market uncertainty after the tragic events in the United States. The deepening of the markets has been particularly strong for bonds – euro-denominated bonds issued by private entities doubled during 1999, and market activity remained quite strong until the summer of this year.  Challenges stemming from integration Two major challenges for authorities in charge of financial stability emerge from the common wholesale banking system: vulnerability to common shocks and potential contagion of major problems across many countries, should such problems arise.  Let me take the issue of common shocks first. Clearly, integration opens up a wide range of opportunities for growth and contributes to increasing the resilience of the system. It brings along a wider range of funding sources and – on the asset side – the degree of diversification of exposures increases. But integration also renders financial institutions more exposed to common shocks. For the largest banks, area-wide risks affecting specific lines of business increasingly matter more than the home country-related risks.  One way of illustrating this point is to take a look at banks' share price development. Since the beginning of the year, the share prices of almost all major European banks have declined. The 30 largest banks have lost, on average, around 25% of their value. The overall deterioration in global macroeconomic conditions and financial market volumes has affected all institutions, as banks' profit outlook has deteriorated following the likely increase in provisioning needs and reductions in income from market-related activities.  However, the stock market changes for these 30 banks range widely from a small plus to very significant minuses of over 50%. In line with the notion that the home-country risks have lost in importance, banks' nationality is no longer a very relevant determinant of the size of the stock market reaction. To give you just one example, large retail-oriented banks have suffered only a mild deterioration, while the share prices of wholesale and market-oriented banks from even the same countries have declined quite substantially. In general, the greatest stock market reductions have occurred for banks with substantial dependence on declining investment banking activity, or with significant credit exposure concentrations on certain industries – such as the technology sectors or airlines – or troubled emerging markets. These represent common risk elements for euro area banks.  Let me turn to the second issue of the spreading of problems. The common wholesale market is clearly a driving force behind efficiency and further integration. Market participants have generally expressed that they are satisfied with the way the market works. Banks are able to borrow liquidity from one another across borders, instead of having to resort to central bank funding. The common money market can also absorb larger disturbances than before. However, banks operating in the common wholesale system form a network, which could facilitate a rapid propagation of shocks across the euro area. A major problem at a key financial institution is likely immediately to be transmitted to other countries, through large and well-capitalised counterparties, or via the effects on liquidity and prices in securities markets.  
 BIS Review 91/2001 3 Responses by central banks and banking supervisors While responsibility for financial stability remains vested in the national authorities – even in the countries participating in Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) – the need for co-operation among national authorities has increased because of the concerns I have just mentioned. In fact, EU authorities have shown awareness that close co-operation is essential both for a strategy of risk reduction and for the prompt and effective management of any problematic events. Let me refer to some of the main issues pertaining to the activities of central banks and banking supervisors. First, as to the Eurosystem responsibilities, the operational tools established for the common monetary policy allow market-wide liquidity shocks to be dealt with. The quick and successful reaction to the consequences of the terror attacks in the United States was a sign that the institutional framework is able to address the consequences of common shocks.  Already in the evening of 11 September, the ECB announced that it was ready to provide additional liquidity. Indeed, the euro money markets showed some signs of tension on 12 September, because of banks' caution about lending funds due to uncertainty regarding their own liquidity needs. The ECB ensured the availability of adequate liquidity through a quick tender operation, restoring a normal functioning of the market, in the same way as, for instance, the Federal Reserve accomplished this for the dollar money market. In addition, the ECB and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York negotiated a US dollar/euro swap agreement on 12 September. The purpose of the agreement was to channel US dollar funds to European banks, which are not counterparties of the Federal Reserve for its discount window operations. European banks faced difficulties in raising short-term US dollar funds due to the disruption in the US financial system.  Second, as to the co-operation between central banks and banking supervisors, the ECB, the national central banks and the banking supervisory authorities of all EU countries have recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding. It establishes arrangements for co-operation and sharing information with respect to risks in large-value payment systems.  Third, as regards banking supervisors, the EU Economic and Financial Committee has recently reached the conclusion – also endorsed by the finance ministers – that, while the existing institutional arrangements for supervision and crisis management are adequate, cross-border co-operation needs to be fostered. The co-operative bodies of banking supervisors in the European Union – the Banking Supervision Committee of the ESCB and the Groupe de Contact – are currently addressing this recommendation. The opinion of the ECB is also that the existing arrangements can provide an adequate and flexible basis for safeguarding financial stability at the European level. We have also stressed that co-operation needs to be enhanced in order to ensure the effective execution of prudential supervision and corrective action in crises. For the single monetary policy, it is important that financial stability is effectively maintained. Let me make some remarks also about the supervisory arrangements at the national-level. After the reform carried out in the United Kingdom to establish a single all-encompassing financial supervisory authority outside the central bank, proposals to set up a single supervisory authority have been put forward in several euro area countries. Tendencies to separate supervision from central banking have also emerged. In almost all euro area countries, central banks have traditionally been in charge of supervisory functions. In some euro area countries, adjustments have already been made. In Austria, an all-encompassing financial supervisory authority will be established, but the central bank will still be in charge of certain banking supervisory tasks. In Luxembourg, a supervisory authority has been created outside the central bank. Changes are also underway or being discussed in Germany, Belgium, Ireland, and Finland.  The Eurosystem has recently expressed the view that continuing to have national central banks in charge of supervisory responsibilities would offer clear benefits. This would be an appropriate response to the challenges triggered by the euro, as it would enhance the capability to monitor risks to financial stability from an area-wide perspective. In any alternative arrangement, the involvement of central banks in prudential supervision and ample information sharing would be necessary in order to achieve the necessary interaction between the two bodies.  A central bank supervisor is in a position quickly to assess systemic risks. These could be generated, for example, by a failure of a large and complex financial institution through payment and settlement 
 4 BIS Review 91/2001 systems and securities markets. We have also considered that the traditionally expressed arguments in favour of separating prudential supervision and central banking would not be very convincing in the specific euro area conditions. For instance, the concern of conflicts of interest with monetary policy and a lack of domestic accountability should not be overstated in our setting where monetary policy is centralised and supervision remains national.  Still dispersed retail markets Despite the progress I have mentioned, the markets for retail financial services are still defined quite strongly along national, or even local, lines. In these markets, for instance, interest rates are based on local competitive conditions, as you know very well. However, this does not mean that there is no international competition. The fact that this Association has now existed for thirty years is a clear sign that financial institutions have already been international for a long time.  Internationalisation of retail operations Until now, branches and subsidiaries abroad have been preferred to large-scale mergers as a strategy for entering foreign banking markets. The establishment of foreign branches and subsidiaries has increased steadily in the euro area. For example, the number of foreign branches of German banks in the European Union is now 59, almost double that of 1995. The average market share of foreign branches and subsidiaries established by banks from EU countries was 10% at the end of 2000, which is definitely not negligible.  Also, the ownership structure of the banking sector is changing significantly. It is no longer true that only Luxembourg's banks have a significant proportion of capital owned by foreigners. In Ireland, Belgium and Portugal, and in the Nordic countries, the percentage of banks' capital in foreign hands ranges from around 40% to some 20%. France, Italy, Spain and Austria also show ratios of between 15% and 10%. For many large European banks, the holdings of stakes in other large players is sometimes associated with joint ventures in specific business lines or geographic areas – for example, in accession countries. Looking at the strategies of individual banks, some banks have already developed strong multi-country operations in the retail field. For instance, two major banking groups have retail activities in more than five EU countries. In any case, if the integration of the retail markets proceeds, more such operations could be expected to emerge. Integration could also be advanced via electronic banking, or cross-border lending, both of which are still relatively limited. In fact, e-banking could represent a forceful boost to integration, since it could allow customers to access banking services offered by banks in other countries, or it could be a powerful way to enter a new market without the need to establish a costly branch network. Responses by European authorities As noted, banks with international operations have to develop local products, also to comply with different legal systems, which implies significant costs. Important steps are being taken by EU authorities to overcome the obstacles of segmentation. However, legal aspects are only one element hindering the integration of the retail markets, since proximity to the customer is still an important factor. Even though it is likely that the retail markets will maintain local features at least for some time to come, any unnecessary burden on the cross-border expansion of activities should be lifted to the maximum extent possible. At the regulatory level, the European Commission is generally striving to finalise the Single Market programme via the so-called Financial Services Action Plan. The higher cost of cross-border retail payments, as compared with domestic ones, has been a very topical issue, and it has been taken as a sign of a lack of integration. In July 2001, the European Commission proposed a draft Regulation to close the gap between domestic and cross-border payments. In the draft now being examined by the Council and the Parliament, banks would be obliged to equalise prices for cross-border and domestic payments. The ECB has stated that the Eurosystem shares the general objective of the Regulation. However, the Eurosystem has expressed reservations about the chosen method, because it gives too little time to the banking industry to adjust in a rational way. In this context, I find the recent initiative of the European Banking Federation for a self-imposed calendar for reducing the level of such fees extremely promising.  
 BIS Review 91/2001 5 Steps are also being taken in the field of consumer protection legislation. The aim of the recently launched revision of the Consumer Credit Directive is to promote transparency and to ensure that cross-border credit can flow in harmonised conditions for both consumers and lenders. Also, a report on the regulation of e-commerce in financial services has just been launched by the Commission. It draws attention to the problems that arise from the interplay between different legal systems and makes proposals to overcome them.  At the supervisory level, the Economic and Financial Committee has stressed the need to work on the convergence of diverging national supervisory practices. The main motivation is to enhance the efficiency of the national supervisory authorities involved in monitoring cross-border financial institutions and thereby to improve financial stability. This is also linked to the new framework for capital adequacy rules being developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision that will significantly increase the scope for supervisory discretion, leaving broad room for diverging implementation across Member States. Thus, demand for supervisory convergence is going to increase. To the extent that this is accomplished, the costs of banks with multi-country operations will also become lower. Conclusion In conclusion, I should like to stress that when talking about the requirements of the euro area banking system, we are not concerned with ordinary co-operation across Member States, as is necessary on account of the internationalisation of financial firms' activities. We talk about a single banking sector. This means that only substantially reinforced co-operation, combined with convergence in supervisory policies and practices, can deliver the conditions for a continued integration of banking activities. This will mitigate the potential risks to financial stability that stem from the new channels of contagion and will, in turn, benefit euro area economic activity. 
 BIS Review 101/2001 1 Jean-Pierre Roth: Review of the Swiss economy: end-of-year media news conference Introductory remarks by Dr Jean-Pierre Roth, Vice-President of the Swiss National Bank, at the End-of-year Media News Conference, Zurich, 7 December 2001 *      *      * The Swiss National Bank has decided to lower the target range for the three-month Libor rate by 0.5 percentage points to 1.25%-2.25%. For the time being, the three-month Libor is to be kept in the middle of the target range. Recently, the National Bank has adjusted its monetary policy twice already. On 17 and 24 September 2001, we lowered the target range for the three-month Libor rate by 0.5 percentage points each. At the time, we acted in response to the decrease in inflationary pressures and the undesirable development of the Swiss franc exchange rate. The economic outlook has since continued to deteriorate around the globe. In Switzerland, there are no signs that price stability might be jeopardised in the medium term. Due to this development, we are now in a position to reduce rates again. Accordingly, since the beginning of 2001, we have lowered the target band for the three-month Libor by a total of 1.75 percentage points, thus easing monetary policy considerably. Assuming that the three-month Libor rate will remain stable at 1.75%, inflation is expected to hover between 0.9% and 1.5% in the next three years. The National Bank projects real gross domestic product to increase by 1.5% in 2001. For 2002 we anticipate a growth rate of around 1%. In the following, I would like to describe the development of inflation over the past few months and explain our latest inflation forecast in more detail. The dotted curve in the graph shows our inflation forecast of June 2001. At the time, we expected inflation to climb slightly to 1.6% by mid-2002 and, subsequently, to recede gradually towards 1.2% by the beginning of 2004. This forecast was based on the assumption of a robust development of the world economy and a stable three-month Libor rate of 3.25%. We assumed at the time that the economic slowdown experienced in the United States and Europe would be overcome as early as in the second half of 2001 and that the Swiss economy would be able to perform according to its potential. The price of oil was expected to stand at approximately USD 25 per barrel. Our forecast of June overestimated the inflationary development of the last few months. Year-on-year inflation, as measured by the national consumer price index, dropped to 1.0% in the third quarter 2001 from 1.5% in the second quarter. In October inflation amounted to 0.6%, and to 0.3% in November. This sharp decrease can be mainly attributed to the marked fall in oil prices and prices of other foreign goods. Moreover, upward price pressure on domestic goods also eased markedly in November after still having been substantial until October. The dashed curve in the graph shows our latest inflation forecast. The table contains the average annual inflation rate according to the new forecast. Since our forecast of June 2001, the world economy has moved towards recession. Short-term inflationary pressures have subsided considerably. On the assumption that the three-month Libor rate will remain stable at 1.75% during the next three years, inflation should amount to 0.9% in 2002, move up to 1.3% in 2003 and reach 1.5% in 2004. The fluctuations in the anticipated 2002 inflation rate are due to basis effects that do not reflect the inflationary trend. Inflation is expected to remain within the range of price stability throughout the forecasting period. From mid-2002 on, however, it will follow a slight upward trend through the rest of the forecasting horizon. This slight rise in anticipated inflation is attributable to two factors. First, the world economy will recover in due course. Second, Swiss monetary policy at a constantly low interest rate - which is currently 1.5 percentage points lower than in the June 2001 forecast - will tend to have an increasingly expansive effect as time passes. These two factors combined will cause inflation to rise somewhat over time. Our forecast is based on the assumption that the US economy will remain in recession until mid-2002 and will subsequently gradually return to its potential growth path. In Europe, the economy will presumably stagnate until mid-2002 and pick up momentum afterwards. We expect the US dollar to remain roughly at its current level vis-à-vis the euro. The forecast assumes that today's relatively low oil prices will eventually climb back slightly. At this point, I would like to briefly comment on the interpretation of our forecast. It is based on the above-mentioned assumptions regarding the development of the world economy, and on the three-month Libor remaining stable throughout the forecasting horizon. In other words, the forecast 
 2 BIS Review 101/2001 shows the development of inflation on the condition that monetary policy is left unchanged. However, monetary policy will certainly need to be adjusted during the forecasting period. The economic environment changes continuously as new disruptions occur, and the National Bank responds to these changes in order to meet its objective of maintaining price stability. Therefore, it is important to bear in mind that the forecast is made for a three-year period but is valid for only six months at most, i.e. until the publication of the next forecast. The relatively long forecasting period reflects the time lag with which monetary policy measures impact on the price level. We publish our forecast in order to inform the public of our assessment of the inflation outlook, at the time of the forecast, on the basis of an unchanged monetary policy. The publication is a means of making our monetary policy decisions more transparent and easier to understand. I will now make a few remarks about the development of the Swiss economy in the year now ending and the coming year. The recessionary trends witnessed across the globe will not leave Switzerland unscathed. Both this year and next, growth will be considerably slower than we predicted only a short time ago. We expect the economy to go into virtual stagnation in the second half of 2001. Overall, the economy will presumably grow by about 1.5% in 2001. In line with the development in the major economic blocs, notably exports and capital spending have shrunk drastically, putting a major break on economic growth. Although consumer confidence has been dented, consumption has so far turned out to be a cornerstone of growth. The decline in construction investment is also clearly more moderate than the fall in capital spending. We expect the economy to follow a path of muted growth and to perform below its potential until the middle of next year. Only the second half of 2002 should see the economy expanding in line with the development abroad. We project average growth of approximately 1.0% for 2002. Unemployment is likely to climb in the months ahead. We consider the current interest rate level and the existing monetary conditions to be adequate to enable the economy to return to sustainable, non-inflationary growth. Our forecasts, however, are fraught with uncertainties. In the aftermath of the terror attacks in the United States, these uncertainties are now particularly substantial. Investment and consumption depend on whether market participants have confidence in the quality and stability of the basic conditions. Depending on the development of the political situation, the global economy may thus recover at a faster or slower pace than we anticipated, and the exchange rates might be subject to major fluctuations. In this case, the National Bank would have to review its monetary policy. In the short run, the price of oil will also have a considerable influence on inflation. If it continues to erode, measured inflation might fall below zero for a few months. Should this situation arise, it is important to bear in mind that it cannot be equated with sustained - and thus economically dangerous - deflation. On the contrary, a low oil price level would create a positive supply shock and, under the current circumstances, would impact favourably on production. Inflation would be dampened temporarily. We also keep a close watch on the development of the money supply M3 in order to assess the medium-term inflationary risks. Following a phase of low, or even negative, growth rates, M3 is now expanding at a somewhat faster pace. So far, however, there has been no excess supply of liquidity in the economy, and the money stock M3, therefore, does not point towards inflationary risks at present. Finally, I would like to make some closing remarks about the imminent introduction of euro notes and coins. For about three years now, the euro has existed as deposit money. It has led to fixed exchange rates and a uniform interest rate level in the euro area countries. The introduction of euro notes and coins will have additional positive effects on the economic development in Europe, as it will be easier to compare prices and confidence in the new currency will be strengthened. Moreover, the euro is to be regarded positively not only with regard to the Swiss economy but also Swiss monetary policy. The Swiss export sector will profit from lower transaction costs, and currency devaluations - as previously implemented by some European countries in order to improve their competitiveness - will be a thing of the past. Swiss monetary policy will benefit from the fact that a large economic bloc now exists in Europe which pursues similar goals in terms of monetary policy. All in all, exchange rate fluctuations between Switzerland and the EMU countries should thus remain below the levels seen before the launch of the euro. Furthermore, the markets will realise in due course that there is no reason why the Swiss franc, with regard to the role as a safe haven currency, should be assessed differently than the euro. This realisation should reduce the risk of sharp appreciations. As a result of the introduction of euro notes and coins, the euro will increasingly be used as a means of payment in the tourism sector and the hotel and restaurant industry as well as in foreign trade, to some degree simply as a substitute for the D-mark. Apart from very few viable exceptions, however, employment and loan contracts will continue to be concluded in Swiss currency, and the large majority of domestic payments, too, will be effected in Swiss francs in future. The euro will thus not emerge as 
 BIS Review 101/2001 3 a parallel currency in Switzerland. The purview of Swiss monetary policy will remain unaffected by the arrival of the euro. By retaining the Swiss franc, we are able to pursue an independent monetary policy that is oriented to the needs of the Swiss economy, and to keep interest rates at a low level. In this respect, the exchange rate is a key element for producing our inflation forecast and, therefore, for determining our policy.

 BIS Review 101/2001 1 Hermann Remsperger: Enlargement of the European Union and European and Monetary Union: Maastricht meets Copenhagen Speech by Prof Hermann Remsperger, Member of the Directorate of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the annual meeting of ELEC, Frankfurt, 7 December 2001. *      *      * I. Introduction1 The accession of ten central and east European countries as well as Malta and Cyprus presents the European Union with one of the greatest challenges in its history.2 In June 2001 the Gothenburg European Council clearly stated that the process of European enlargement is irreversible. It has already been foreseen that the first of the accession countries will participate in the European Parliament elections in 2004. What currently looks possible is that there will be a “Big Bang”, an initial major enlargement involving ten candidate countries. The new EU member states also commit themselves to adopt the euro at a later date. Contrary to the United Kingdom and Denmark there will be no “opt out” clause. This means that two to three years after enlargement of the European Union there could already be a far greater number of countries participating in European Monetary Union. In my opinion, however, it is actual progress in convergence rather than pressure to keep to a political date which should be the prime focus of the ongoing process of integration.  I would like to start today by describing some fundamental economic facts concerning EU enlargement. I then propose to outline the challenges for the candidate countries and the current EU member states in the enlargement process.  II. Economic background to EU enlargement The accession of twelve candidate countries to the EU first of all means that the population of the EU is set to rise by more than 100 million, in other words by more than one-quarter. However, gross domestic product would not increase by anywhere near as much. The aggregate nominal GDP of the accession countries is currently less than 5% of GDP in the EU as a whole. In terms of purchasing power parities, the weight of the accession countries would be roughly twice as much. Even if this measurement method is used, however, there are considerable differences between them and the current member states. The candidate countries also demonstrate major structural differences with the EU. The share of agriculture in the gross value added is on average more than twice as high as in the EU, where it is around 2%. Sectoral employment also points to the existence of structural discrepancies. In Poland, for example, agriculture contributes over 3% to the gross value added, whereas almost 19% of the workforce is employed in this sector. Increasing rapprochement with the EU is likely to result in a major reallocation of resources even if full structural harmonisation is not likely.  At this point I should add that the accession countries generally have large current account deficits. Although such deficits are thoroughly defensible for countries that are in the process of catching up, persistent current account deficits make the economy more vulnerable to internal and external disturbances, especially if these are relatively severe and are financed short term and in foreign currency.  When painting the external picture of the economy, it needs to be said that the average degree of openness in the candidate countries is significantly higher than in the EU. This is partly due to the fact that most of the candidate countries are fairly small. Nonetheless, the figures range from 29% in Poland to 109% in Malta.3 Trade liberalisation and the prospect of EU accession, together with the geographical proximity of some of these countries to the present EU member states, have led to a                                                       1  I would like to thank Dr Sabine Herrmann for her assistance. 2 Turkey is not included in these deliberations. Although it has applied for accession to the EU, negotiations have not yet begun.  3  The degree of openness is defined as the average export and import of goods and services as a percentage of GDP.  
 2 BIS Review 101/2001 considerable intensification of trade integration with the EU. Imports from and exports to the EU on average account for around two-thirds of the candidate countries’ total imports and exports.  In addition to the differences with current EU member states, account also needs to be taken of the heterogeneity amongst the accession candidates. With a population of more than 38 million and around 40% of the total output, Poland is by far the largest accession economy. GDP in both the Czech Republic and Hungary, the second and third largest economies, is less than one-third that of Poland. Most of the other candidate countries are relatively small economies. As well as size and economic strength, the standard of living varies considerably. If purchasing power parity is taken as a basis, the figures range from 24% of the EU average in Bulgaria to 82% in Cyprus. Nine of the twelve candidate countries show less than 60% of the average EU income. It can therefore be assumed that real convergence will take some time. The heterogeneity amongst the accession countries can also be seen from the fact that there are a number of different exchange rate regimes in operation. Most of the countries have seen their exchange rate regime change at least once, if not more often, during the transition process. This can be partly attributed to the fact that exchange rate policy has to fulfil different tasks in the various stages of development.4 The current exchange rate regimes can be roughly divided into three groups. At one end of the spectrum are Estonia, Lithuania, Bulgaria and, to some extent, also Latvia and Malta. These countries have reduced their monetary policy flexibility significantly by adopting a currency board arrangement or a relatively narrow currency peg. At the other end of the spectrum are the countries which allow their national currency to float on the foreign exchange markets and primarily pursue an inflation or monetary target. Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic fall into this category. The third group comprising Hungary, Cyprus, Slovenia and Romania5 peg their exchange rates to the euro while at the same time allowing the external value of the currency to fluctuate somewhat.  III. Three-stage accession process The increase in heterogeneity brought about by EU enlargement is frequently perceived as a risk for the single market and the single currency. It must be noted, however, that the candidates have to meet a whole range of requirements before they can accede to the EU or EMU. These go far beyond the nominal convergence criteria so often cited. For this reason, I think we need to take a closer look at the complex three-stage integration process. At the moment we are in the first phase, which will last until EU accession. Then comes the second stage, a period of transition characterised by two issues: entry into the exchange rate mechanism ERM II on the one hand and the convergence test for membership of EMU on the other. The third stage begins when the accession countries adopt the euro. The complicated issues involved with the third stage are not covered in this paper.  First Stage: Preparations and conditions for EU accession  In 1993, when the Copenhagen European Council decided that the European Union would be enlarged to include the twelve candidate countries, it also established the terms of their accession. The Copenhagen criteria require new member states to demonstrate a sufficient degree of political, institutional and economic stability, to comply with the obligations arising from membership and to identify fully with the goals of European integration. Of particular relevance to the Eurosystem are the economic criterion and the criterion on the adoption of the acquis communautaire, as the body of EU law is known. The economic criterion established in Copenhagen requires new EU member states to have a functioning market economy that is able to cope with competitive pressure within the Union. This requires, among other things, functioning property rights, competition, free price formation and a well-developed financial sector. The European Commission’s progress reports clearly show that so far only Malta and Cyprus fully meet the economic criterion. Although Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia are functioning market economies, further efforts                                                       4  See Wagner, H. (2001), “Pitfalls in the European Enlargement Process – Challenges for Monetary Policy”, presented at the Bundesbank Conference on 26-27 October 2001. 5  Officially, Slovenia and Romania operate a strategy of monetary targeting, although the exchange rate is implicitly pegged relatively closely to the euro (managed floating). 
 BIS Review 101/2001 3 are needed to differing degrees before these economies are able to cope with market forces. In Bulgaria and Romania the reform effort must be intensified considerably. While great progress has already been made in terms of liberalising trade and the foreign exchange market and in the privatisation of business enterprises, prime consideration must be given to economic competitiveness.  If a country is to be able to cope with international competition and if capital is to be channelled smoothly within a country, it is of paramount importance for the domestic banking and financial sector to be efficient. This requires a high degree of financial intermediation, liquid capital markets, the banks having a sufficient capital base, a functioning system of banking and securities supervision and sound payment systems. The financial sector in the accession countries is in need of further development. All in all, the banks have a fairly low level of financial intermediation. This primarily reflects the relatively limited development position of former transition countries that are still undergoing a restructuring process. For instance, banking expertise is not yet developed enough in some areas and some banks remain insufficiently geared towards making a profit. All this is also reflected in loans to the private sector. Here, the candidate countries display, on average, only around 30% of GDP or less than one-third of the figure for the EU. The occasionally very large spreads between loan and deposit rates – which are on average roughly twice as high as in the EU – point to a risk premium. Some observers interpret this spread as an indication that the banking system is not yet efficient enough. On the whole, securities markets do not yet play a major role in the accession countries. Although the equity markets have grown steadily in importance since 1994, market capitalisation remains small by comparison with the EU. The bond markets are dominated by government bonds. Corporate bond markets scarcely exist. None of this is unusual for countries that are in the process of catching up. However, it does indicate problems with regard to the competitiveness of business enterprises. If the major significance of the financial sector is taken into account when allocating resources, it becomes apparent that the accession countries need further structural reforms. The framework provided by the Copenhagen criteria is intended to ensure this structural convergence. It is a necessary precondition to accelerating the process of real convergence in the accession countries. The criterion on adopting the acquis communautaire obliges the accession candidates to implement and enforce all the European legal acts and regulations. In terms of the later adoption of the single currency, this relates particularly to the central bank acts, movement of capital, the banking system and the stability of the financial system.  By virtue of their accession, the central banks of the new EU member states become part of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB). Central bank legislation must therefore be in line with the relevant provisions of the EC Treaty. The accession countries must accept the primary objective of maintaining price stability, ensure the institutional, personal and financial independence of their central banks and prohibit direct public sector financing by the central bank. In addition, EU accession is conditional upon the liberalisation of capital movements. Nine of the twelve candidate countries have already been able to conclude provisionally the relevant chapters in the accession negotiations. However, there are still pronounced differences. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have removed all foreign exchange controls and are therefore fully liberalised in this respect, although there are still some restrictions to the purchase of property or land by foreigners. The Czech Republic and Bulgaria have also been able to fulfil the relevant capital account provisions of the acquis to a large extent. In Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia there are restrictions on short-term movements of capital, in particular. There are still a considerable number of restrictions in Cyprus, Malta and Romania.  While the liberalisation of capital movements is essentially non-negotiable, the timing and the scheduling of the liberalisation steps should be dependent on the macroeconomic facts and the stability of the financial sector. Free movement of capital actually represents an additional challenge for the economies concerned. Particularly as their financial sector is not yet fully developed and reforms in banking supervision have still some way to go, it is best to adopt a step by step approach – especially if the accession countries are tying their exchange rate to the euro. It is not possible for 
 4 BIS Review 101/2001 monetary policy to be autonomous if the movement of capital is completely liberalised and if the exchange rate is targeted (impossible trinity6).  Second Stage: The transition period The period of transition following EU accession is geared to enhancing the convergence needed for adoption of the single currency. The countries which accede to the EU commit themselves to adopting the euro at a later date. There is no “opting out”. The preparations for EU accession as laid down in the Copenhagen criteria establish basic rules for later adoption of the euro. Central bank independence constitutes the institutional basis for increasing harmonisation of exchange rate policy. Free movement of capital is essential to a meaningful monitoring of the exchange rate criterion. The reforms relating to the structure and stability of the financial markets speed up the process of real convergence. At the same time, the process of catching-up by the new EU member states will, of course, continue after accession. When acceding to the EU the candidate countries commit themselves to regard economic policy as a matter of common concern and to submit to the EU mechanism for coordinating and monitoring economic policy. The objective is for all EU member states to have a stability-oriented economic policy that is geared to increasing convergence. The Stability and Growth Pact is especially geared to fiscal policy and establishes the medium-term objective of a balanced public-sector budget.  (a) Participation in the exchange rate mechanism ERM II In the period of transition exchange rate policy is also a matter of common concern. In accordance with the Treaty, it is not possible to accede simultaneously to the EU and EMU. Rather, the convergence criteria require a country to have participated in ERM II for at least two years without severe tensions. Only then can it join EMU. Whether an even longer transition period would appear necessary or whether participation in ERM II can take place immediately after EU accession is dependent on the particular situation of the country in question or on its progress in the convergence process and in achieving macroeconomic stability.7  With regard to the question of what exchange rate regime would be appropriate, in my view particular attention must be paid to the following three aspects: 1. EU accession and liberalisation of capital movements could lead to capital flows becoming more volatile. It is therefore likely to be more difficult to maintain “rigid” exchange rate regimes. 2. As a result of the catching-up process, the accession countries will probably find their equilibrium real exchange rates increasing in the years ahead. 3. As inflation rates in some accession countries are still considerably different from those in the current EU countries, the exchange rate regime must also take account of the risk of higher current account deficits and of competitiveness.  In the transition period from EU accession to joining EMU, efforts must therefore focus on the consistency of exchange rate strategy and macroeconomic policy. Participation in the exchange rate mechanism is only appropriate if pegging the exchange rate more closely to the euro is in line with the general macroeconomic situation.  In my opinion, the European exchange rate mechanism is an adequate way of preparing for adoption of the single currency.8 This mechanism can help to limit exchange rate fluctuations in a credible multilateral system, without preventing a certain degree of exchange rate flexibility.  However, it should be noted that there may be cases, in which even the broad bands of ERM II may not be wide enough to accomodate the necessary exchange rate adjustments during the integration process. This may be due, for example, to liberalisation measures or persistent changes in the relative                                                       6  See Frankel, J. (1999), “No Single Currency Regime is Right for All Countries or At All Times”, NBER Working Paper No. 7338, Cambridge. 7 See Von Hagen et al.

 BIS Review 101/2001 5 prices. It is therefore best to wait until the initial impact of EU accession is over before taking part in ERM II. This is the best way to avoid speculative attacks. This is particularly true of the present free floating currencies, whose proponents consciously stress exchange rate flexibility or the advantage of an autonomous monetary policy. Premature participation in the exchange rate mechanism could prompt the foreign exchange markets to “test” this mechanism. In countries which have already maintained a fixed exchange rate peg to the euro for some time, it is argued that the current high degree of integration is “relaxed” by accession to ERM II, in other words by adopting an exchange rate band. This could lead to the risk of distortions. But in this context it should be taken into account that in certain circumstances exchange rate bands narrower than +/- 15 percentage points or even currency boards can also be sustained within the framework of ERM II. In the case of a currency board, however, this would merely involve a unilateral decision by the country concerned. The Eurosystem would not be under any obligation to intervene in order to support the currency board.  Other exchange rate systems, such as free floating, crawling pegs or currency boards using reference currencies other than the euro, are essentially incompatible with ERM II. Neither would the unilateral introduction of the euro as legal tender (euroisation) be in line with the way to participation in monetary union foreseen in the EC Treaty. The Treaty requires all candidate countries to adopt the acquis communautaire in its present form. This means that all candidates must comply with the stages leading to adoption of the euro provided for in the Treaty.  In any case, euroisation would probably be worth considering, if at all, for those accession countries that have already had a well functioning currency board or a fixed currency peg for some time. After euroisation, however, the countries in question could not count on the support of the Eurosystem. Consequently, they would renounce monetary sovereignty completely without benefiting from the confidence-building effect of participation in the Eurosystem.  In addition, it should be remembered that a decision to allow a country to participate in monetary union only makes sense if the economy concerned has proved able to cope with the pressures of the single market without contravening the convergence criteria of the EC Treaty. The credibility of the whole Eurosystem is ultimately dependent on the sustained convergence of all participants. The multi-stage integration process is intended to ensure that this convergence is indeed sustainable. Early adoption of the euro would simply undermine the integration process.  (b)  High degree of lasting convergence before adoption of the euro The long and carefully planned process of integration culminates in the adoption of the single currency. Accession to EMU is only possible if the accession countries can show a high degree of lasting convergence. Pursuant to Article 121 of the EC Treaty, a high degree of convergence has been attained if the Maastricht convergence criteria have been fulfilled. A clear benchmark is thus set for attainment of this target. Sustainability of convergence, however, is very difficult to assess. The criteria do not merely have to be met once at the time of the examination; they also have to be maintained after that time. Both aspects are important if monetary union is to function smoothly.  A high degree of convergence  The convergence criteria make considerable demands on the accession countries in terms of macroeconomic stability. The inflation criterion requires a high degree of price stability backed by market economic conditions. This is necessary to avoid longer and more persistent delays to the competitiveness within EMU and to allow the development to be as tension-free as possible within the framework of a single monetary policy. Stable prices create an atmosphere of accountability, increase transparency and allow resources to be allocated efficiently. They are thus a vital precondition for growth and employment.  Most candidates have made distinct progress in recent years in terms of macroeconomic stability. However, counter-developments, especially in prices, have been observed recently; in addition to internal influences, such as wage developments, these have been the result of external factors – such as oil prices and the exchange rate of the euro.9 Great efforts are still needed to take the double-digit                                                       9 See IMF(2000), “Exchange Rate Regimes in Transition Countries”, Washington. 
 6 BIS Review 101/2001 rates of inflation in Romania, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Poland back to an acceptable level. In 2000 only Lithuania and Malta had a rate of inflation which would have been in line with the inflation criterion. If inflation expectations are to be kept as low as possible and the appropriate underlying conditions for a stability-oriented monetary policy secured, deficit and debt ratios need to be low. Sound public finances also ensure that national fiscal policy remains flexible even in times of cyclical downturns. This room for manoeuvre becomes even more important for the participants in a monetary union since they no longer have recourse to the instrument of exchange rate adjustments.  With regard to the criteria on the sustainability of public finances, the countries made improvements by and large up to last year. On average, in 2000 the accession candidates virtually attained the benchmark of 3% established by the Maastricht convergence criterion. Malta and the Czech Republic, in particular, still have very high public deficits. Especially against the background of an economic slowdown, however, some candidate countries are likely to experience a marked deterioration of their budgetary position in 2001. Moreover, it must be borne in mind that the deficits are based on definitions that are not always fully consistent with those of the EU. Government debt in all the countries – with the exception of Bulgaria – is around 60% or less.  The interest rate criterion requires an adjustment of the long-term nominal interest rates. In liberalised capital markets differences in the nominal interest rates primarily reflect expectations with regard to the development of the rate of inflation, public finances and exchange rate stability. Viewed in this way, the interest rate criterion provides an assessment, in line with market conditions, of whether the convergence progress can be sustained over the long term. However, in the run-up to monetary union it became apparent that interest rate differentials were declining sharply as confidence in accession grew (“convergence trade”).  Sustainable convergence In terms of EMU accession, the Maastricht criteria are intended to ensure not only a high degree of convergence, but also its sustainability. Structural discrepancies and differences in the standard of living could, however, lead to the economies drifting apart again after accession. It is consequently important to ensure that convergence is sustainable. This is of particular importance for price performance, to which I shall return in a moment. First, though, it must be said that sustainability is also vital to fiscal policy. The Treaty states that persistent excessive deficits are to be avoided (Article 104). The Stability and Growth Pact gives concrete expression to the obligation to ensure a government budget that is in balance over the medium term. The stability programmes stipulate how and when the objective is to be achieved. The aim is to ensure that the stability orientation of European monetary policy is not undermined by a lack of fiscal discipline.  The Balassa-Samuelson effect,10 as it is called, means that above-average growth rates in catching-up countries are accompanied by higher rates of inflation. This is the result of major increases in productivity in traded goods. In the case of the small open economies of the accession countries, the resultant improvement in return does not always lead to price reductions and may, instead, lead to calls for higher wages. The corresponding wage claims in the non-tradable goods sector, which does not generally show the same progress in terms of productivity, are accompanied by higher unit labour costs in this sector. The outcome is higher prices in the catching-up countries.  In this connection there have been frequent calls for the definition of price stability in the euro area to be increased.11 This is intended to prevent inflationary tendencies in the faster growing economies having to be counterbalanced by deflationary developments in other countries. Several aspects are problematic.  First, relaxing the objective of stability would undermine the credibility of the ECB in the early stages of its development. Second, the impact of the Balassa-Samuelson effect needs to be qualified. Estimates put it somewhere in the range of 1%-3% p.a.12 Given the relatively small economic weight of the                                                       10 See Balassa, B., (1964), „The Purchasing Power Doctrine: A Reappraisal“, Journal of Political Economy, Nr. 72, S. 585-596 and Samuelson, P., (1964), „Theoretical Notes on Trade Problems“, Review of Economics and Statistics, Nr. 46, S. 145-154. 11 As proposed, for example, by Sinn and Reutter (2001), “The Minimum Inflation Rate for Euroland”, NBER Working Paper, No. 8085, Cambridge.  12 See Broek/Slok (2001), “Interpreting Real Exchange Rate Movements”, IMF Working Paper, 01/56, Washington D.C.; Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report, October 2001.  
 BIS Review 101/2001 7 candidates, the effects on the European aggregate would therefore be fairly minor. For fundamental considerations major shortfalls in convergence should not be compensated by relaxing the stability objective. Fairly minor inflation differences, however, are completely normal in a monetary union and can be accommodated by the ECB’s stability objective of up to almost 2%. They have so far not jeopardised monetary policy in Europe. With regard to the enlargement of EMU, I would like to point out that efforts to increase the flexibility of the labour markets could take account of the sectoral and regional productivity differentials in the accession economies. Moreover, intensifying competition in the non-tradable sector and a restrained fiscal policy may be ways of avoiding higher rates of inflation. In any case, such efforts would seem to make a lot more sense than relaxing the European Central Bank’s stability objective.  To ensure the sustainability of convergence, it is vital that not only nominal convergence but also an appropriate level of real convergence be achieved before accession to EMU. In this connection, attention should be drawn to the importance of the Copenhagen criteria and the concomitant structural reforms which lay the foundation for swifter real convergence prior to EU accession. Nominal and real convergence are two sides of one coin and should therefore be pursued simultaneously. To put it in a nutshell, Maastricht meets Copenhagen. Nonetheless, the desire to achieve monetary stability is often seen to be at odds with the real process of catching up. It is argued that a monetary policy geared to the objective of stability puts an unnecessary brake on growth. This is, however, to overlook the fact that, if at all, this could happen in the short term; over the longer term a stable monetary environment is absolutely essential to price stability, a healthy investment climate and sustainable growth. This has also been borne out by numerous empirical studies. The IMF, for instance, shows that most progress is made by precisely those transition countries that are determined to push forward with monetary stabilisation.13  The criteria laid down in the EC Treaty represent a comprehensive set of rules for enlargement of the EU and European Monetary Union. If the rules are respected, it will be possible to sustain the degree of nominal and real convergence that is essential to ensure that European Monetary Union functions well. With regard to measuring convergence the EC Treaty therefore also refers to the need to take account of the results of the integration of markets, the situation and development of the balances on current account and the development of unit labour costs and other price indices (see Article 121 (1)). The EC Treaty subjects all members to the same criteria, thus avoiding the formation of a two-class monetary union. To sum up, neither the introduction of new hurdles nor the relaxing of existing criteria appear economically necessary or politically judicious.  IV.  Conclusion I would like to close by summarising my deliberations with five comments.  1. Accession of central and east European countries as well as Malta and Cyprus to the European Union represents an unprecedented integration process. Owing to the large number of candidates and their heterogeneity, not to mention the differences between new and existing member states, all those involved are faced with major challenges.  2. There is general consensus that the integration of the candidate countries represents both a political necessity and an economic opportunity. It is perfectly understandable that the candidates wish to benefit from the prosperity of this large economic area as quickly as possible. Particularly after the introduction of the single currency, an integration-related reduction in transaction costs, greater price transparency and a consolidation and expansion of the capital markets can be expected. In addition, the accession countries stand to benefit from the ECB’s track record. A further decline in inflation rates, capital market rates that are tending to fall and improved investment terms can be expected.  3. If one considers the major significance of the financial sector for the allocation of resources, it becomes clear that further structural reforms are needed in the accession countries before they are ready to join the EU. The framework provided by the Copenhagen criteria is intended to ensure this structural convergence. It is a necessary precondition to advance the process of real convergence in the accession countries.                                                         13 See Havrylyshyn et al. (1999), “Growth Experience in Transition Countries 1990-1998”, IMF Occasional Paper No. 184, Washington D.C.; IMF, (2001), “A Decade of Transition: Achievements and Challenges”, Washington D.C. 
 8 BIS Review 101/2001 4. Accession to EMU before sustainable convergence has been achieved could prove to be disadvantageous both for the candidate countries concerned and for the Union as a whole. For example, forgoing the possibility of using the exchange rate as an adjustment instrument would be problematic if an insufficient degree of convergence has been attained. The competitiveness of the candidate countries could even be jeopardised. It is therefore vital that the Copenhagen and Maastricht criteria for enlargement are actually fulfilled. Before central and eastern European countries, Malta and Cyprus can participate in EMU, it really needs to be a case of Maastricht meeting Copenhagen. 5. The unilateral introduction of the euro as legal tender (euroisation) is out of keeping with the route to membership in monetary union foreseen in the EC Treaty. The Treaty requires all candidate countries to adopt the acquis communautaire in its present form. This means that all candidates must comply with the stages leading to adoption of the euro provided for in the Treaty. 
 BIS Review 100/2001 1 Laurence H Meyer: The future of money and of monetary policy Remarks by Mr Laurence H Meyer, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Distinguished Lecture Program, Swarthmore College, Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, 5 December 2001. The references for the speech can be found on the website of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System. *      *      * Money and the payment system have evolved over time. The earliest forms of money were commodities, such as cattle and grain, that came to be used as means of payment and stores of value, two properties that effectively define money. Over time, precious metals, specifically silver and gold, became dominant forms of payment. From the 1870s to World War I and, in some cases, into the Great Depression, many nations backed their currencies with gold. Later, fiat money--currency and coin issued by the government but not backed by any commodity--became the dominant form of money, along with deposits issued by banks. What has driven this evolution of money, and what is the future of money? This is the first set of questions that motivate this lecture. Money also provides a metric for the measurement of prices. That is, once you have defined the unit of exchange, you can measure the price of any other item in terms of that unit. Money is also obviously related to monetary policy. Another theme of the lecture is the relationship between the nature of money, the scope for changes in the overall level of prices, and constraints on or opportunities for discretionary monetary policy. The next step in the evolution of the nature and transfer of money appears to be the spread of electronic forms of money and payment. In the United States, deposit money issued by private banks grew rapidly in the late nineteenth and the twentieth centuries. From a historical perspective, a now well-established form of electronic money is the bank deposit stored on the computers of the banking industry. Ironically, the most widely used method by the general public for transferring this electronic type of money is still the paper check, although large-value transactions between banks and between some businesses are electronic. In the early-to-mid-1990s, a new generation of technology created the possibility of storing monetary value on a silicon chip embedded in a plastic card or in a personal computer. With these developments, the focus of payments development shifted to electronic money--e-money--using card-based and computer-based products (often referred to as stored-value cards and network money, respectively) that consumers might use as a general means of payment in both the physical and the virtual worlds. What is driving the evolution toward electronic payments and perhaps toward new forms of electronic money? How rapidly is the innovation catching on, and what will the payment system look like in the future? How would the spread of e-money affect financial stability and the conduct and effectiveness of monetary policy? This is a third set of questions that motivate my lecture. In the past, money was often privately produced, though today note and coin production has generally become a government monopoly. The development of e-money has generated a fascinating debate about the possibility of reintroducing privately issued currency in the United States. What would be the implications for the payment system and for the central bank of the reintroduction of what is in effect private currency? Could the development of private money and private clearing balances make the Fed obsolete? If so, what becomes of monetary policy, and how would the price level be determined? These are the final themes that motivate my lecture. The evolution of money The range of commodities used over time as money is very wide; it includes cattle, grain, knives, spades, shells, beads, bronze, silver, and gold. The oldest recorded use of money dates back 4,500 years to ancient Mesopotamia, now part of Iraq. About 3,500 years ago, cowrie shells from the Indian Ocean were used as a means of payment in China. Passages in the Bible indicate that silver 
 2 BIS Review 100/2001 was used as a means of payment in the time of Genesis.1 The first coins--lumps of “electrum,” a natural mixture of gold and silver--were introduced in Asia Minor in the seventh century B.C. in Lydia, now part of Turkey. Driving the evolution of money, from the earliest emergence of commodity money, has been the desire to increase the efficiency of carrying out exchanges. In the absence of money, trade is accomplished by barter, the direct exchange of commodities or services to the mutual advantage of both parties. Such exchanges require a double coincidence of wants or multiple trades. If I have apples and want grain, I have to find someone who has grain and wants apples. Alternatively, I can engage in a series of intermediate trades that ultimately result in the exchange of apples for grain. In primitive societies with a small range of goods, barter can work well enough, but as the range of goods expands, barter becomes increasingly inconvenient and costly. Several considerations have affected the evolution of commodity money itself--from cattle and grain toward shells and then bronze and ultimately to silver and gold. Commodities are useful as a means of payment and store of value if they were are less bulky in relation to their value, more durable, more homogeneous, and more easily verified as to their worth than other commodities. These considerations favored the use of the precious metals, for example, over cattle and grain, encouraged the use of gold and silver rather than bronze and copper, and further affected the way that silver and gold were used as money over time. Early commodity money, for example, was weighed, not counted, including the early uses of silver and gold. The introduction of coins that were stamped with their weight and purity allowed money to be counted and again reduced the costs associated with making transactions. Silver became the dominant money throughout medieval times into the modern era. Relative to silver, copper was too heavy and gold was too light when cast into coins of a size and weight convenient for transactions. The next important evolution was the introduction of “representative” paper money. Warehouses accepted deposits of silver and gold and issued paper receipts. These paper receipts in turn began to circulate as money, used as a means of payment and held as a store of value. The paper was fully backed by the precious metals in the warehouse. Once again, efficiency was enhanced by the convenience of carrying paper money as opposed to the bulkier silver or gold coins. Owners of the warehouses soon learned that the holders of the paper receipts would not simultaneously redeem the gold deposited with them. The warehouses could therefore lend the gold--in turn, often converted into paper notes--holding a reserve of gold that allowed them to meet the normal demands for redemption. This is the beginning of fractional reserve banking. Seventeenth-century English goldsmiths are usually credited with this transition to modern banking, though the first paper money was introduced in China in the seventh century, a thousand years before the practice became widespread in Europe. Paper notes and early banking were introduced in Europe in medieval times and further advanced by the great banking families of the Renaissance. The spread of paper notes and fractional reserve banking opened up the potential for credit expansion to support economic development but also introduced the possibility of runs and liquidity crises as well as the risk of insolvency through the credit risk associated with the lending. In the nineteenth century, many countries were on a bimetallic standard, allowing the minting of both gold and silver coins. But by late in that century, many countries had moved to the gold standard, and currency and bank reserves were backed exclusively by gold. Barry Eichengreen (1996) describes the gold standard as “one of the great monetary accidents of modern times,” owing to England’s “accidental adoption” of a de facto gold standard in 1717. Sir Isaac Newton was master of the mint at the time and, according to Eichengreen, set too low a price for silver in terms of gold, inadvertently causing silver coins to mostly disappear from circulation. As Britain emerged as the world’s leading financial and commercial power, the gold standard became the logical choice for many other countries that sought to trade with and borrow from, or emulate, England, replacing silver or bimetallic standards.                                                       1 Williams (1997) begins chapter 1 of Money: A History with the following quote from Genesis: “Then there passed the Midianites, merchant-men, and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver, and they brought Joseph into Egypt.” Williams notes that the transaction in this passage is quite plausible for the historical period in which it is supposed to have occurred (early second millennium, B.C.), but with “one vital qualification.” He argues that the seventeenth-century English translators of the text mistakenly thought the reference was to coins (“pieces of silver”). But, at the time, silver was used as medium of exchange as bullion, weighed for each transaction, not counted as with coins. 
 BIS Review 100/2001 3 England officially adopted the gold standard in 1816. The United States moved to a de facto gold standard in 1873 and officially adopted the gold standard in 1900. The international gold standard refers to the period from the 1870s to World War I, during which time the major trading countries were simultaneously on the gold standard. Though many countries went off the gold standard during World War I, some returned to a form of gold standard in the 1920s. The final blow to the gold standard was the Great Depression, by the end of which the gold standard was history. Eichengreen argues that the emergence of the gold standard reflected the specific historical conditions of the time. First, governments attached a high priority to currency and exchange rate stability. Second, they sought a monetary regime that limited the ability of government to manipulate the money supply or otherwise make policy on the basis of other considerations. But by World War I, economic and political modernization was undermining the support for the gold standard. Fractional reserve banking, according to Eichengreen, “exposed the gold standard’s Achilles’ heel.” The threat and, indeed, reality of bank runs created a vulnerability for the financial system and encouraged governments to seek a lender of last resort to provide liquidity at times of distress. Such intervention was, however, inconsistent with the gold standard. The international gold standard involved adherence to certain “rules of the game.” First, the national unit of currency had to be defined in terms of a certain quantity of gold. Second, central banks had to commit to buy and sell gold at that price. Third, gold could be freely coined, such coins represented a significant part of the money in circulation, and other forms of money were convertible into gold at a fixed price on demand. Fourth, gold could be freely imported and exported.2 With the collapse of the gold standard, countries moved to fiat money systems. Fiat money is inconvertible, meaning that it is not convertible into nor backed by any commodity. It serves as legal tender by decree, or fiat, of the government. Its value is based on trust--specifically that others will accept it in payment for goods and services and that its value will remain relatively stable. This trust is based, in part, on laws that make the fiat money “legal tender” in the payment of taxes and, in the United States, also in the payment of private debts.3 Fiat money consists of both paper currency and metal coins the face value of which exceeds the value of the metal content of the coins. The need to finance wars encouraged early efforts by governments to issue fiat money. Early examples include the continentals issued by the American government during the Revolutionary War, assignats issued during the French Revolution, and the greenbacks issued during the Civil War. Most such issues of fiat money were followed by severe increases in prices, as governments tapped to an ever greater degree the easiest--in some cases perhaps the only--source of revenue. These experiences highlight the importance of control of the money supply for achieving price stability. Today, money consists of currency, coin, and transactions deposits (that is, checking accounts) at depository institutions, including, in the United States, commercial banks, thrift institutions, and credit unions.4 It is not clear when the first check was written. The earliest evidence of deposits that might be subject to checks is from medieval Italy and Catalonia. But at that time, the depositor had to appear in person to withdraw funds or to transfer them to the account of another customer. Checks did not come into widespread use until the early sixteenth century in Holland and until the late eighteenth century in England. The payment system has evolved further in recent decades with the spread of credit cards and then debit cards. Credit cards allow consumers to purchase all kinds of goods “on credit,” making payment to the credit-card company for a collection of purchases later by check. In effect, the use of credit cards separates the purchase of goods from the ultimate settlement but increases the efficiency of                                                       2 Bloomfield (1981) refers to the strict version of the gold standard described here as the “gold-coin standard.” He notes that some countries operated under a variant he calls the “gold-exchange standard.” In this case, the monetary authorities held their reserves in gold or in claims on currencies (foreign exchange) that were redeemable in gold. Instead of moving gold around to settle payment imbalances, they stood ready to buy or sell these currencies at fixed exchange rates, which enabled them to economize on gold and earn interest on the reserves. Gold coins either did not circulate at all or circulated to only a limited extent in countries operating under a gold exchange standard. 3 Section 102 of the Coinage Act of 1965 provides in part: “All coins and currencies of the United States, regardless of when coined or issued, shall be legal tender for all debts, public and private, public charges, taxes, duties, and dues.” Thus when you tender U.S. currency to your creditor, you have made a legal offer to pay your debts. However, private businesses are not required to accept currency as a form of payment and may develop their own policies in this respect, unless state law says otherwise. However, the government is required to accept currency in payment of taxes and for other public charges. 4 I am defining money “narrowly,” to include only the means of payment, not broadly to include other highly liquid deposits. 
 4 BIS Review 100/2001 exchange. Debit cards allow the consumer to make a purchase from a checking account through an electronic instruction to debit the account instead of by writing a check, another advance in efficiency. Even more recently, electronic money has been introduced, still perhaps more in concept than in practice, at least in the United States. I will return to the role of electronic money today and the potential for the spread of electronic money in the future. Money, monetary standards, and monetary policy The nature of money determines some important properties of the economy, including the scope for changes in the overall price level and the opportunity for discretionary monetary policy -- that is, for control of the money supply in an effort to improve economic performance. The basic relationship between money and prices is often described in terms of the “quantity theory of money.” In the long run, according to this proposition, the price level moves proportionately to the money supply. As a result, the rate of inflation depends on the rate of money growth. Though this proposition holds precisely only under restrictive conditions, it identifies in a more general sense an essential link between money and prices. It is therefore useful in understanding the way changes in the nature of money might affect the determination of the price level.5 Under commodity money systems, money is often privately produced, and the price level of non-money goods in terms of the commodity money depends on the supply of commodity money relative to the supplies of the non-money commodities. In a sense, there is no absolute price level of goods in such an economy, only a set of relative prices. However, the relative prices of non-money goods in terms of the commodity money become, in effect, a measure of money prices, as we would think of that term today. The supply of commodity money, in turn, depends on technology and--particularly in the case of precious metals--on the pace of discovery. Prices of non-money goods in terms of the commodity money need not be constant, but there is no opportunity for discretionary monetary policy. As states came at times to monopolize the issue of commodity money, such as gold or silver coins, they often were tempted to debase the currency by reducing the proportion of silver or gold in the coins in an attempt to realize “seignorage” or revenue from issuing money. Debasement of the currency typically resulted in inflation--a rise in the price of non-money goods in proportion to the debased currency, which, in effect, maintained the underlying relationship between the commodity, gold or silver, and the price of other goods. These are the first experiences with significant inflation induced by government’s manipulation of money. The next evolutionary step was representative paper money. As long as the relationship between the commodity money and the amount of paper money backed by the commodity money is stable, inflation will be determined by the available supply of commodity money. But the beginning of modern banking, by breaking the strict link between the commodity money and the money supply, added an element of flexibility to the money supply and further opened up the possibility for inflation. During the international gold standard period, currency issue and coin production were linked to and convertible into gold, so that a country’s total domestic money supply was tied to the domestic supply of gold. This situation did not guarantee a stable price level, but it did remove the risk of government-induced inflation. The result--and an indeed an important motivation--was to constrain and, in principle, eliminate the government’s discretion regarding the supply of money. The gold standard, in effect, put in place a rule that governed monetary policy.6 If a country ran a trade deficit that exceeded private capital inflows, it would, in principle, finance the difference by shipping gold to other countries. Doing so reduced the money supply--and hence income and prices--in the country with the balance of payments deficit and increased the money supplies, incomes, and prices in the countries with balance of payments surpluses. As a result, the system had                                                       5 The quantity theory of money can be understood in terms of Irving Fisher’s (1913) equation of exchange: MV=PQ, where M = the money supply, V = velocity (which is defined as the ratio of nominal income (PQ) to money), P = the price level, and Q = the level of real output. V summarizes the features of the payment system that determine how much money is needed to carry out a given volume of transactions. Fisher assumed V was constant and that in the long run Q would be determined by the economy’s productive capacity and be independent of the money supply. In the face of ongoing financial innovations, V is not constant, and the link between money and prices, even in the long run, is not as precise. 6 In a strict gold standard, there is not opportunity for discretionary monetary policy. However, many countries did not strictly follow the gold standard “rules,” and, as a result, squeezed a degree of flexibility for discretionary policy out of the gold standard in practice. 
 BIS Review 100/2001 5 a built-in tendency to move the deficit and surplus countries toward balance. In fact, drains on a country’s gold or foreign exchange reserves were typically countered by an increase in central bank’s discount rate. The effect on income and prices was, in this case, not due directly to changes in the gold supply, but to the changes in interest rates that were implemented to limit the drain on gold. However, principle and practice differed under the gold standard. Richard Cooper (1992) summarizes the contrast in the following terms: “The idealized gold standard . . . conveys a sense of automaticity and stability--a self-correcting mechanism with minimum human intervention, which ensures rough stability of prices and balance in international payments. . . .The actual gold standard could hardly have been further from this representation.” Cooper notes that economic growth during the late nineteenth century was respectable, but variability in income growth was substantially greater under the gold standard than during the period after World War II.7 But the gold standard was predominantly about price stability, so here we might give special weight to evidence pertaining to that characteristic. Cooper notes that short-run variations in wholesale prices were greater during the pre-war gold standard than during the period from 1949 to 1979. In assessing economic performance under the gold standard, one must also look at possible trends in prices. Here the story is more complicated. If one compares 1877 and 1913, for example, the price level is essentially unchanged. But the period covers a sharp and extended decline in the price level followed by an equally sharp and persistent increase. Prices from 1873 to 1896, for example, decreased 53 percent; this decrease was followed by an increase of 56 percent from 1896 to 1913. These swings can be explained, in large measure, by fluctuations in gold production driven by discoveries of new deposits. In the early post-World War II period, nations sought an alternative to the international gold standard to govern exchange rates and international economic relations. At a conference at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, in 1944, participating governments agreed to maintain a fixed exchange rate system--more precisely, an adjustable peg. Exchange rates were mostly stable but could be altered in discrete amounts, under prescribed circumstances--allowing deviation from a fully rules-based system to one with more discretion. In practice, the system was implemented by the commitment of the United States to maintain a fixed relation between its currency and gold and other countries’ agreement to fix their exchange rates relative to the dollar, at rates agreed to at the conference. Fixed exchange rate systems provide a degree of constraint on domestic monetary policies. Under such a system, imbalances in payments were settled by flows of acceptable assets, typically gold or dollars. Most countries, given limits on their international reserves, had to follow policies consistent with supporting their fixed exchange rates--though, as noted above, they had the option of changing the exchange rate. The United States, however, was in a unique position because it could print more of the assets--dollars--acceptable for settling payment imbalances. As long as the United States was prepared to convert dollars into gold, at a fixed exchange rate for official purposes, other countries seemed willing to hold dollars. As dollars grew relative to the U.S. gold supply, the sustainability of this system came into question. When the United States broke the link to gold in 1971, other major countries no longer were willing to accept dollars at the fixed exchange rate. The adjustable peg system broke down, and the world ended up, de facto, in a regime of floating exchange rates, with exchange rates determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. Most countries were operating under fiat money systems by this time. The combination of fiat money systems and floating exchange rates removed the earlier constraints on domestic monetary policies for other countries and made price stability and other dimensions of domestic economic performance dependent on the conduct of their domestic monetary policies. Central banks had to learn how to exercise that discretion in support of the objectives usually dictated by their legislatures, almost always including price stability and, in the case of the United States, price stability and full employment.8 There have been disappointments as well as successes with monetary policy around the world. Over time, the number of independent central banks has increased significantly, and independence no                                                       7 The concern that the gold standard increased the volatility of output is reinforced by Barry Eichengreen’s (1992) conclusion that the gold standard contributed to the severity of the Great Depression. He finds, for example, that countries that were still operating under the gold standard throughout the Great Depression suffered the most, while those that were not on the gold standard in 1929 or that had quickly abandoned it by and large escaped. 8 The precise language of the Federal Reserve Act, as amended in 1977, is that the Federal Reserve should promote price stability and “maximum employment.” To ensure the consistency between the two objectives, the latter objective has been interpreted as maximum “sustainable” employment or “full employment,” meaning the maximum employment level sustainable without rising inflation. 
 6 BIS Review 100/2001 doubt enhances the ability of central banks to achieve price stability. There has also been an advance in our understanding of how to conduct monetary policy to achieve stable rates of inflation, at least on average over a period of years, and perhaps also to contribute, at the same time, to smoothing output and employment growth. Over the last ten to fifteen years, coinciding with both an increased emphasis on the price stability objective and the advances in our understanding about the conduct of policy, inflation performance has been very good. However, some countries today continue to impose constraints on discretionary monetary policy through fixed exchange rate regimes, tying their inflation rates to inflation in the country to which their exchange rate is pegged. This system does not eliminate the influence of discretion, but it makes inflation in one country dependent on the discretionary monetary policy in some other country. A currency board and dollarization are tighter versions of a fixed exchange rate regime--that is, fixed exchange rate systems from which it is progressively more costly to exit. The payments system today The payment systems in use today rely on concepts developed in the eighteenth century and before as well as on those developed in the twentieth century. Paper instruments are vital to commerce and so are electronic systems. To understand the long-term incentive for the spread of electronic payments and potentially new forms of money, one must appreciate the complexities and costs associated with our current payment system. As checks came into more widespread use, banks that accepted checks for deposit had to find ways to exchange checks drawn on a variety of other banks and to receive appropriate value for those checks--processes called “collection” and “settlement.” First, banks sent messengers directly to other banks to collect the money due to them and their customers, the direct presentment method of check collection. Second, out-of-town banks would send checks to a correspondent bank, which in turn would collect the check, the correspondent banking method. Both of these methods required significant travel and could require the movement of large amounts of banknotes or gold. According to banking lore, a third solution to the interbank check collection problem evolved at a British pub. A London bank messenger stopped by for a pint (or two) and allegedly met another bank messenger. They quickly discovered that they each had checks drawn on the other’s bank and decided to save time by exchanging them on the spot. More messengers joined the group. These messengers found that they could not only centralize the exchange of checks, they could also net the amounts of money that had to be exchanged among them to settle (pay) the checks they exchanged. This arrangement, the clearinghouse method, was first adopted in the United States by the New York Clearing House in the mid-nineteenth century, and it is still used by banks all over the world today--although, generally speaking, the exchanges are not held at a drinking establishment. In fact, all three methods of interbank check collection still are in use in the United States. In the early twentieth century the creation of the Federal Reserve System helped to improve the efficiency of the payment system in at least two important ways. First, the Fed set up a national system of check-clearing, in which the Fed acts like a correspondent bank with an ability to collect checks throughout the United States. This system improved the existing localized check clearing system by facilitating the collection and settlement of interbank checks among banks scattered throughout the country. Second, the Fed was able to act as a central repository for the reserves of the banking system. Reserve balances held at the Fed are widely used as the settlement vehicle for interbank check-clearing. According to a new Fed survey, households, businesses, and government entities write approximately 50 billion checks each year. The costs of using these checks include processing by depositing and receiving banks and by intermediaries, transportation, accounting, and resolving problems. The estimated cost to the banking industry of operating the entire check clearing system range from approximately ¼ to 1 percent of GDP. In addition, fraud losses in connection with checks are significant, perhaps in the tens of billions of dollars annually, and are growing rapidly. The level of these costs provides an incentive to improve the efficiency of the check clearing process.9 These costs have also encouraged innovation in substitutes for checks, that is, electronic payments, and may foster the development of new payment instruments, such as electronic money. Of course, developing and implementing electronic payment alternatives is expensive; however, electronic payment methods                                                       9 See appendix 1 for a discussion of important recent advances in improving the efficiency of the retail payment system. 
 BIS Review 100/2001 7 tend to be characterized by high fixed investment costs but low marginal costs, so the average cost per transaction should fall as use rises. The process of innovation, driven by attempts to increase the efficiency of the payment system, is continuing. Banks and technology providers are attempting to develop new payment methods, in many cases building upon the underlying the automated clearing house (ACH), debit card, and credit card networks to find more convenient and secure ways to make purchases, pay bills, settle debts, and post credits, especially over the Internet.10 “On-line” banking involves electronic access to information over the Internet about accounts and loans--including current balances and transactions history--as well as providing the ability to carry out payment related transactions--including transfers among accounts, receiving and paying bills, applying for bank credit cards, and reordering checks. Some so-called virtual banks have been set up to service customers exclusively through electronic channels, but an increasing number of traditional “bricks and mortar” banks see the Internet as another delivery channel that improves convenience for some of their customers. Similarly, the emergence of e-money reflects the attempt to develop new payment methods as a more efficient alternative to existing electronic payment means. The future of money: the spread of e-money Many innovations to existing payment systems have been successful, but the question remains as to how e-money, a fundamentally new payment system, has fared. As mentioned earlier, most types of e-money take one of two forms: stored value cards and network e-money. Initially, many believed that these innovations would allow more retail and smaller-value transactions to be made electronically, paralleling the move to electronic funds transfer for large-value payments. Of course, substantial investments were needed to provide the infrastructure for using these types of payment devices and to ensure that enough consumers and merchants would use them to make the investments worthwhile. In the end, despite optimistic predictions, this first generation of e-money products was not widely adopted in the United States. In general, stored-value cards have been successful in closed payment systems, where e-money was the primary payment instrument accepted, and have failed in open payment systems, where competing instruments were readily available. Examples of closed system successes include mass transit systems, college campuses, and military bases. Two well-publicized open system e-money experiments that fizzled (one at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and the other on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in 1997 and 1998) accepted e-money at only limited locations and suffered operational difficulties. Limited locations discouraged consumer use, while operational difficulties discouraged merchant use. Both consumers and retailers were able to substitute other payment instruments, which resulted ultimately in lack of either customer or retailer support for the product. Possibly as a result of these experiences, new e-money plans target captive markets, including corporate expense accounts, teenagers with allowances, and payroll for employees without bank accounts, and use the existing, well-functioning credit card and debit card networks. The fundamental e-money characteristic--that a liability is issued by an entity primarily for the purpose of making payments--is retained. However, these new products are similar to a standard debit card issued by the major networks in terms of technical implementation, institutional arrangements, value transfer, recording of transactions, and currency denomination. I should note, however, that it took years for ATMs and debit card networks to be widely used and accepted within the United States. Ultimately these innovations in the payment system have proved efficient and cost-effective for users. E-money may have a similar experience, with natural setbacks at first, further evolutionary development, and eventually a growing acceptance from the general public. E-money and financial stability The spread of e-money could have significant implications for the size of central bank balance sheets, for depository institutions (depending on which are allowed to provide network money), for financial stability, and possibly for the implementation of monetary policy.                                                       10 See appendix 2 for a fuller discussion of existing electronic elements in the payment system, including the automated clearing house (ACH) and credit and debit cards for retail payments, and Fedwire for large dollar or wholesale payments. 
 8 BIS Review 100/2001 Let me begin with the implications of the spread of e-money for financial stability. One possible problem is that those issuing the stored-value cards or network money, or clearing the transactions in them, could fail to make good on the promise of convertibility. The situation would be like that of banks issuing private notes under a gold standard. In the period before the founding of the Federal Reserve, bank failures were a common feature of the financial landscape, especially in times of economic and financial stress. Such failures presumably resulted from the effects of poor, dishonest, or excessively aggressive bank management, as well as the impact of adverse economic shocks on poorly diversified banks. While modern-day private money issuers should be able to hold diversified asset portfolios, they could still face strains as a result of larger-than-expected shocks or of management difficulties. Thus, one could imagine “runs” on a particular brand of stored-value card, for example, if the issuer were thought to be in financial trouble. If the issuers were banks and the stored-value cards were, in a legal sense, deposits, then such runs could be managed in the usual way, via the discount window and, if need be, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. If the issuers were not banks, however, then the introduction of new types of private money could increase financial instability and pose difficulties if--and this is a big if--the scale of operations were large relative to the financial system. E-money and monetary policy To appreciate the implications of the spread of e-money for monetary policy, it will be helpful to understand the concept of the monetary base (B). The monetary base consists of currency held outside the banking system (C) and bank reserves (R). In the United States, depository institutions hold reserves either in the form of currency--so-called vault cash--or balances at Federal Reserve Banks. Banks are required to hold reserves against their transactions deposits (required reserves), and they voluntarily hold a small amount of excess reserves. Monetary policy is implemented through the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) setting a target for the federal funds rate. This is the rate at which banks borrow reserves from one another. The FOMC then gives instructions to the manager of the Fed’s portfolio (called the System Open Market Account, or SOMA) to carry out open market operations to hit the target funds rate. The Fed injects the monetary base into the economy through open market operations, purchases or sales of securities from its portfolio. When the Fed purchases securities for its portfolio, it pays for the purchase by creating a balance at one of its regional Reserve Banks--in other words, by creating reserves. The federal funds rate is determined by the supply and demand for such reserves. Through open market operations, the Fed can adjust that supply of reserves so that the market clears at the desired funds rate. The implications of the spread of e-money for monetary policy would arise from the substitution of e-money for both currency and deposits, shrinking the size of the monetary base. Taken by itself, the decline in the demand for currency would have no direct implications for the conduct of monetary policy because what matters for monetary policy is the supply of and demand for reserves.11 A decline in the demand for currency would, however, lower the monetary base and hence reduce the size of the Fed’s portfolio of securities. The size of the Fed’s portfolio, in effect, determines the seignorage the government obtains through the issue of the monetary base. To the extent that the demand for currency declines, the monetary base and hence the Fed’s portfolio would shrink, and the interest earnings on that portfolio would diminish. The Fed uses the interest earnings, along with revenue from fees for check clearing, Fedwire, and other priced services, to cover the cost of its operations. The costs today are a small fraction of the interest earnings; the remainder is returned to the Treasury. The Treasury and hence the American taxpayer are the ultimate beneficiary of the seignorage. The interest earnings also allow the Fed to cover its costs outside the federal government budget and appropriations process, contributing to the independence of the Fed from the executive and legislative branches.                                                       11 Today, open market operations are carried out partly to neutralize the effect of swings in currency demand on the level of reserves. In the absence of such offsetting operations, a decrease in currency demand would raise the amount of reserves and hence lower the federal funds rate. For example, if the demand for currency declined as a result of the spread of stored value cards, and there were no offsetting open market operations, reserves would increase as banks converted currency into deposits. 
 BIS Review 100/2001 9 Given that the Fed’s cost of operations today are less than 10 percent of its interest earnings, the substitution of stored-value cards for currency would have to be very substantial before the budgetary independence of the Federal Reserve would be threatened--though, of course, the Treasury would lose seignorage even from the first dollar of substitution of e-money for currency. If the Fed were to lose so much seignorage that it could not cover its costs under current arrangements, it would have to look for other arrangements to cover its costs in a way that supported its independence. One reason for doubting that currency would dramatically decline is that much of it--at least half and maybe as much as two-thirds--is held abroad mostly as a store of value, not as a means of payment. A further significant portion of outstanding currency is held in connection with criminal activities, because of the anonymity it offers its holders. More interesting is the possibility that the spread of network e-money might dramatically reduce the demand for deposits and hence correspondingly reduce the amount of bank reserves. The effect of the spread of e-money on reserves would depend on who provides it and on the regulatory and statutory responses. For example, will providers be restricted to depository institutions? In this case, the e-money balances could be subject to required reserves, in which case its spread would not reduce reserves. Depository institutions could have a competitive advantage in offering e-money, if it were treated as another form of bank deposit and insured by the FDIC. In that case, the spread of e-money would not significantly reduce the effectiveness of monetary policy. But what if other financial or even nonfinancial firms were allowed to issue e-money? Again, reserves would not be affected if the other providers were subject to reserve requirements, though making them so would require a statutory change. However, the prospect that the spread of e-money could reduce reserves has generated many articles and an interesting debate.12 To address the issues in debate, let’s assume that network e-money is not subject to reserve requirements. In this case, reserves would decline, so we would need to analyze the implications of such a decline for the conduct of monetary policy. Fortunately, we already have some experience with earlier innovations that have reduced the demand for reserves. Over the past decade, for example, banks have implemented retail sweep programs. These programs sweep excess funds not immediately needed for transactions from reservable transactions accounts into nonreservable saving accounts, allowing banks to reduce their required reserves. Banks have an incentive to use sweeps to reduce required reserve balances because they pay no interest. As a result of the spread of sweep accounts, the level of required reserve balances has declined from about $28 billion in late 1993 to only about $6 billion today. The Fed has worried that this decline in the level of required reserve balances could result in increased volatility of the funds rate and require the Fed to alter the way it conducts monetary policy. The concern here is the same that would present itself if the spread of network money substituted for transactions deposits and further reduced the level of reserves. If binding, a reserve requirement raises the level of reserves relative to what banks would otherwise hold. In the absence of a reserve requirement, banks would still hold reserves for settlement or clearing purposes. But without the cushion provided by required reserves, the intraday and interday fluctuations in the demand for reserves could increase the volatility of the federal funds rate. I should note, however, that to date, despite the sharp decline in required reserve balances, there has not been an increase in the volatility of the funds rate. The Fed has asked the Congress for statutory authority to pay interest on required reserve balances as well as on excess reserves. Paying interest on required reserve balances would greatly reduce the incentive for banks to conduct sweep programs and would therefore raise the level of transactions deposits and hence reserves. This would diminish the risk that further declines in required reserve balances would increase the volatility of the funds rate. In the absence of such new statutory authority, the Fed has indicated it might need to alter the way it implements monetary policy, in the event that required reserve balances fell further and the volatility of the funds rate increased. To date, because the volatility of the funds rate has not increased, moving in this direction has not been necessary. However, if the volatility of the funds rate did increase, one possibility would be to introduce a regime of floors and ceilings that would limit the fluctuation in the federal funds rate to an acceptable range. The ceiling could be set through a so-called Lombard facility at which banks would be able to borrow at a penalty rate, perhaps 50 basis points above the                                                       12 The debate was touched off by a provocative paper by Friedman (1999) which in turn provoked a series of papers on the same topic, including King (1999), Freedman (2000a and b), Goodhardt (2000), and Woodford (2001). 
 10 BIS Review 100/2001 target funds rate. Banks would never pay more than 50 basis points above the target funds rate to borrow reserves if they had access to such a facility and if borrowing from the facility had no nonpecuniary cost. The floor would be set through a re-deposit facility at which banks could deposit any unwanted reserves with the Fed at a rate perhaps 50 basis points below the target funds rate. Banks would never lend in the market at a rate lower than 50 basis points below the target funds rate if they had access to such a re-deposit facility. The funds rate would thus be limited to a 100-basis range, and open market operations would aim to keep the funds rate on average near the midpoint. In principle, the system could work with somewhat narrower or wider ranges. The same system could be implemented if the spread of e-money reduced the demand for transactions balances and hence the level of required reserves. Such a system is common, indeed almost the norm for other central banks, in the conduct of monetary policy. So there has been a lot of experience with it and the United States could presumably implement it, although a statutory change might be needed to set up a re-deposit facility.13 But what if the spread of network money fully replaces transactions deposits and if reserves are not required against such money? Several countries have eliminated required reserves, and we appreciate today that reserve requirements are not essential for the conduct of monetary policy.14 In any case, under these assumptions, there would be no demand for required reserve balances at the central bank. Nevertheless, if trust in e-money instruments were not complete, holders would presumably demand that e-money be exchangeable for notes and coin at par. In this case, there may be no problem for monetary policy. To make good on the promise of convertibility, the issuers and their clearing and settlement banks would probably hold some notes and coin and some balances at the central bank. The resulting demand for the monetary base would allow the Fed to set the federal funds rate (by setting the supply of reserves, or by setting the terms on deposit and borrowing facilities). If trust in the private provider or providers were complete, and nobody ever doubted their ability to convert stored-value or network money into dollars, then demand for the monetary base could fall to zero. But providers of stored-value cards and network money would still need funds to meet demands as holders of the e-money use it to buy goods and services. Today such so-called settlement balances are held as reserve balances at the central bank. Even if there were no required reserves, banks would still hold settlement balances to meet liquidity needs and might continue to hold these reserves at the central bank. In this case, once again, there does not appear to be a problem for monetary policy. But, just to be sure we have covered all the possibilities, let’s assume that banks or other providers of e-money choose to hold settlement balances to meet liquidity needs in the form of interbank deposits--deposits with other banks--instead of balances at the central bank. In this case, perhaps the large money center and regional banks would collectively take on the role of providing settlement balances to the providers of e-money. Let’s call them the settlement banks. Let us also assume that such settlement balances were convertible into balances held at the central bank, a link that would enhance the acceptability of and confidence in e-money. This hypothetical situation--perhaps one more interesting as an intellectual challenge than as a plausible outcome--forces us to try to understand what the minimum requirements are for an effective monetary policy, defined as one that can maintain control of some short-term interest rate. Michael Woodford (2001) considers this problem (or at least a closely related problem) in a paper presented at the most recent Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Jackson Hole conference. He convincingly argues that monetary policy could still maintain control over interest rates--provided that the central bank can pay interest on the deposit balances it offers.                                                       13 For some reasons, however, such a system might not work quite as well in the United States as in other countries. The stigma against borrowing from the Fed is entrenched in the United States. It is not clear whether or to what extent that stigma would be overcome with the introduction of a Lombard facility. 14 In recent testimony, the Federal Reserve opened the possibility that the required reserve ratio could be reduced over time and that reserve requirements could even be ultimately eliminated. See Meyer (2001). Specifically, if the Fed were allowed to offer interest on reserve balances, the demand for voluntary reserve balances to facilitate settlements across banks could rise. Today some banks voluntarily hold operating balances, above the level of their required reserves, to facilitate settlements. These balances pay implicit interest, in the form of credits against priced services provided by Reserve Banks. But the amount of priced services purchased by a bank limits the amount of balances on which it can make use of implicit interest. Payment of explicit interest might permit the Fed to ensure a high enough level of voluntary reserves to avoid undesirable volatility of the federal funds rate with a lower required reserve ratio or, in principle, without any reserve requirement. 
 BIS Review 100/2001 11 The central bank can conduct monetary policy in this case by setting an interest rate on balances held at the central bank. Banks cannot pay a rate on interbank deposits lower than the rate offered on the balances banks could hold at the central bank. Otherwise, banks would convert their interbank deposits into central bank balances. Banks have no incentive to offer a rate on interbank deposits higher than the rate offered by the central bank because they would experience a loss as other banks give them low-yielding central bank liabilities in exchange for their high-rate interbank deposits. The minimum requirement for an effective monetary policy is, therefore, the ability of the central bank to set an interest rate on balances held by banks with the central bank. Woodford does not address the possibility that banks might not have a positive demand for central bank balances. Even in this case, the availability of central bank balances and credit at an interest rate set by the central bank would, in my view, effectively control the interest rate on interbank deposits and therefore continue to allow the central bank to conduct monetary policy. The availability of balances at and borrowing from the central banks would limit and effectively control the rates that settlement banks paid on their interbank deposits. Charles Freedman (2000b) makes a strong case that the possibility that banks would prefer to use interbank deposits for clearing purposes rather than central bank money is far-fetched. Central bank money has some unique properties that likely ensure it a comparative advantage relative to interbank deposits. First, central bank balances carry no default risk. No private bank or other financial firm can match this. Second, central banks typically provide access to liquidity through a discount window or other standing facility, especially important in the event of a serious liquidity problem. Banks may want to maintain a clearing account at the central bank to obtain funds quickly and conveniently from the discount window. Third, banks have a long tradition of holding reserve (settlement) balances at central banks. Therefore, the spread of e-money is unlikely to reduce the demand for reserve balances at the central bank to such an extent that the central bank could not conduct monetary policy by controlling an overnight interest rate. First, e-money that substitutes for bank deposits could be subject to a reserve requirement. Second, even if these deposits were not reservable or if reserve requirements were eliminated, banks would most likely continue to hold clearing balances with the central bank. In this case, a system of floors and ceilings, as described above, complemented by open market operations, should ensure the continued effectiveness of monetary policy. E-money and the reintroduction of private money: Is the Fed obsolete? This leaves one last interesting set of issues to explore. Could e-money issuers successfully introduce new monetary standards-independent of the dollar-and either compete with the Federal Reserve as central banks, or operate without a central bank? Alternatively, what if the Federal Reserve were privatized, its role taken by a successful issuer of e-money? After all, the United States has not always had a central bank. Before 1914, private firms managed many of the activities now handled by the Federal Reserve. Thus, one can at least imagine a world in which central banking, to the extent there is such a thing, is in private hands. The result, in any of these very speculative cases, would clearly be that the factors shaping monetary policy and the determination of the price level would be greatly changed. Consider first the possibility that privately produced e-money replaced the Federal Reserve’s monetary base, and allowed the establishment of several competing private central banks, each with its own money (say, red dollars, blue dollars, and yellow dollars). Of course, legal tender laws linked to government-issued currency make such a development very unlikely. Still, if a private bank were somehow able to establish its currency as a fiat currency (that is, without making it convertible into Fed dollars or some other asset), then its monetary policy over time would determine the value of its currency, interest rates on its currency and its inflation rate. If competing banks provided their own currencies, there would be multiple price levels, depending on the currency, and a number of cross exchange rates. But such an outcome would be extremely inefficient and is therefore hard to imagine as the ultimate outcome. Indeed, the euro area is going the other way to avoid the costs of dealing with multiple currencies. Though technology may reduce the costs of handling multiple currencies and prices, we are not at the point where the costs of doing so are negligible. Alternatively, the private money issuers might adopt a commodity standard, so that one could transact business with money backed by gold or other commodities, for example. In that case, the price level in each currency would reflect the relative price of the commodity chosen by the respective issuer. 
 12 BIS Review 100/2001 Some, like Lawrence White (1992), argue that free entry into the business of providing media of exchange tied to a commodity standard can lead to good outcomes even without a central bank, as he argues was the case in Scotland in the eighteenth century and first half of the nineteenth century. But that outcome may have depended on some special factors (including the unlimited liability of banks’ shareholders). In the current environment, some issuers of private money would, from time to time, likely fail to be able to redeem the money in the underlying commodity. Moreover, it is not clear that the private issuers would have the appropriate incentives to hold capital and act as lender of last resort in a crisis. Indeed, as I noted earlier, central banks, at least in developed economies, issue currency and provide clearing services, at least in part, because their services offer features, such as freedom from default risk and finality of settlement, that private providers cannot match. What about a private institution taking over the (monopoly) role of the Fed (with the Fed disappearing)? Or, equivalently, the privatization of the Fed? In that case, the overall price level would be the result of the monetary policy chosen by the firm running the private central bank. It is not clear that a private monopoly central bank has the incentives to produce good monetary policy. Indeed, given the externalities involved, it seems plausible that a monopoly central bank that issued fiat money would not respond optimally to crises (it would charge too much for liquidity) or to cyclical variations (it would be maximizing the present discounted value of its seigniorage income rather than minimizing some weighted sum of discounted inflation and output losses). If the private central bank were to adopt a commodity standard, then its actions would be constrained and might lead to stable prices over the longer term, subject to all the limitations of the gold standard discussed earlier. But the central bank’s incentives in terms of serving as a lender of last resort and holding capital and reserves would presumably still be wrong because of macro externalities that it would not take into account. Ultimately, it is essential, in my view, to require the central bank to act in the national interest and not as a profit-maximizing firm and that the government back it in a crisis to ensure that it has the ability to take any required actions without being constrained by its own financial resources. Conclusion The evolution of money is clearly a dynamic and on-going process, driven by the incentive to improve the efficiency of exchange. Even today, after a long historical process of evolution, we are left with a payment system that is very costly to operate, requiring tons of paper checks to be flown around the country and reunited with the person or firm that wrote the check in the first place. It seems inevitable that further evolution lies ahead. The spread of computers, advances in telecommunications, and the dramatic growth in the use of the Internet point to innovations in e-money. These will ultimately reshape the payment system and, along the way, present challenges to the Federal Reserve and monetary policy. Given the slow pace of progress and the strong likelihood that stored-value cards will substitute only for a portion of currency, there is little danger that the Fed’s portfolio will shrink to the point at which the Fed will be unable to cover its costs of operation. The spread of network money, on the other hand, might not reduce the demand for reserves, if network money is subject to reserve requirements. In the absence of reserve requirements against network money, it is still likely that central bank balances would dominate settlement balances at private banks, given the former’s lack of default risk. In this case, a system featuring floors and ceilings appears well designed to allow the Fed to continue to implement monetary policy by controlling the federal funds rate. Appendix 1: Innovations in retail payment systems Important advances have been made in improving the efficiency of retail payment systems. For example, check collection costs may be lowered by the use of check truncation. In this case, a paper check is stopped - “truncated” - at some point in the processing cycle, but information continues to flow. Typically today, the truncation of the check occurs at the paying bank and the check is not returned to the check writer. Credit unions have been handling checks in this manner since the late 1970s. 
 BIS Review 100/2001 13 The earlier the paper flow is stopped, the greater the proportion of costs saved. For instance, cost savings can be greater when one bank in the check collection chain transmits information electronically to the paying bank. The payee’s bank or an intermediary such as the Fed reads the information on a check and presents that information electronically to the paying bank. This form of truncation can be supported by the use of imaging technology that allows the digital check images to be captured and archived and used for information purposes or, perhaps, used in lieu of the original check. These images may then be returned to the check writer. Currently, this arrangement must be agreed upon by the parties to the check, which may include all banks in the stream of collection, and the check writer. The Federal Reserve Board is developing a draft law that would facilitate check truncation by removing several existing legal impediments to the use of electronics in check processing. Another form of truncation occurs at the point of sale, where the check is written. In this approach, a customer’s check is scanned, converted into an electronic payment, and handed back to the customer. In this case, the payer’s check is used as a source document from which to create an electronic payment. Truncation and imaging can potentially improve the efficiency of clearing paper checks. In addition, existing electronic funds transfer systems--ACH, debit cards, Fedwire, and CHIPS--have already substituted electronic transfers for paper checks for many transactions. The recent Federal Reserve study of retail payments found that Americans’ use of credit cards, debit cards, and other electronic payments have been gaining relative to their use of checks. For example, from 1979 to 2000, while the number of checks written per year increased by 53 percent (or a 2½ percent compound annual growth rate), electronic payments increased by 500 percent (or an 8 percent compound annual growth rate). As a result, electronic payments accounted for roughly 40 percent of all retail payments other than cash in the United States in 2000 up from 15 percent in 1979. Credit card transactions today account for about half the electronic retail payments, and debit cards account for a little more than a quarter, and the remainder is primarily ACH payments. These trends are expected to continue. As part of this movement to electronic payments, the federal government encourages recipients to receive benefit payments electronically, and an increasing number of taxpayers are filing electronically. The Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 required that most Federal payments, except for tax refunds, were to be made electronically by 1999. While the “requirement” has been eliminated, in Fiscal Year 2001, 32.6 percent of federal tax payments were made electronically, and approximately 76 percent of all other Treasury disbursements were made electronically, representing more than 900 million payments. Today, the Federal Reserve operates an extensive check clearing system and an electronic automated clearinghouse (ACH) system, alongside and in competition with private check and electronic clearinghouses. Daily the Reserve Banks receive more than 50 million checks, which they sort on high-speed machines and route to paying banks in the local area and throughout the country. The Fed’s check-processing operations also electronically capture payment data on all the checks and create digital images of many of the checks. ACH payment instructions flow from one bank computer to another via Federal Reserve computers. The value of these check and ACH payments are settled between banks on the Fed’s books. Questions have been raised over the years about the rationale for a direct role for the Federal Reserve in the retail payment system. In 1996 and 1997, a Federal Reserve study group, under the direction of Alice Rivlin, who was then Vice Chair, considered the future role of the Fed in retail payments. After extensive discussions with banking industry representatives, the group concluded that the Federal Reserve should continue to provide check-clearing and ACH services and, at the same time, work with the private sector to encourage payment system innovations. Appendix 2: Electronic payment systems E-money is not the only potential type of electronic money. There are already important electronic elements of the payments system that have been operating since the 1970s. One is the automated clearinghouse (ACH) through which retail payments can be made electronically. This system is used primarily for pre-authorized recurring payments, such as payroll, corporate payments to vendors, social security benefits, insurance premiums, and utility payments. More recently, its use has expanded to include processing one-time payments, such as the checks that merchants truncate at 
 14 BIS Review 100/2001 the point-of-sale or, occasionally, as “e-checks” for Internet transactions. In 2000, the ACH system processed 6.9 billion transactions with a total value of $20.3 trillion. Two other electronic elements of the retail payments system are the debit card and automated teller machine (ATM) networks. The use of debit cards with personal identification numbers (PINs) for making consumer purchases is growing, and the use of signature-based cards sponsored by the major credit card companies has grown even more rapidly during the past decade. In 2000, there were approximately 3 billion PIN-based debit transactions with a total value of $138.2 billion and 5.3 billion signature-based debit transactions with a total value of approximately $210 billion. Credit cards, the largest share of electronic payments, have both a payment function and a credit function. Credit card payments represent approximately 50 percent of electronic payments. In 2000, there were approximately 15 billion credit card transactions with a total value of approximately $1.23 trillion. Large dollar, or wholesale, payments are processed electronically through either the Fed’s Fedwire system or the private sector’s Clearing House Interbank Payment System (CHIPS). Fedwire is available to depository institutions that have accounts with Federal Reserve Banks. It is used by about 9,000 depository institutions to make electronic funds transfers, on their own behalf or on behalf of their customers. Fedwire is especially useful for large-value and time-sensitive payments, such as payments for interbank settlement of purchases or sales of federal funds (borrowing and lending of reserves among banks), purchases and sales of securities, distribution or repayment of loans, and settlement of real estate transactions. The Federal Reserve began operating Fedwire through the nation’s telegraph system in 1918 as an underpinning of the national money markets. In 2000, Fedwire, which has long-since become fully electronic, processed 108 million funds transfers, with a total value of $380 trillion and an average of $3.5 million per transaction. Also in 2000, CHIPS processed 45 million funds transfers with a value of $237 trillion and an average transaction value of $5.3 trillion. 
 BIS Review 99/2001 1 Guy Quaden: The monetary policy of the European Central Bank and the economic outlook in the euro area Speech by Mr Guy Quaden, Governor of the National Bank of Belgium and Member of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank, at a conference in Ottawa, 30 November 2001. *      *      * For economists and financial markets, the euro has been reality since January 1st, 1999. The decisive steps were taken at that moment by irrevocably fixing parities between the different national currencies that continued to exist momentarily and the start of the single monetary policy conducted by the new European Central Bank. For the general public, however, in Europe and elsewhere, the euro will only be real when it will at last be tangible in the form of notes and coins. In little over one month, on January 1st 2002, the euro banknotes and coins will become part of the every day life of more than 300 million European citizens in 12 countries. And, after an unprecedented logistical operation, at the end of February at the latest, 12 national currencies will have disappeared for good. At that moment, monetary union will have been achieved completely. *      *      * To my mind, the implementation of monetary union in Europe can be explained by a series of long term structural factors.  First of all European integration is to a large extent a political process, having its roots in the two world wars that have devastated our continent in the first half of the 20th century. The Schuman Declaration of May 1950, which provided the basis for the European Coal and Steel Community, stated clearly that “solidarity in production will make it plain that any war between France and Germany becomes not merely unthinkable, but materially impossible”. Then came the deepening of economic and financial integration with the common market which has logically culminated into monetary union. Finally, during the 1990s, a large consensus was reached regarding the objectives of a stability oriented macroeconomic policy which has contributed to a remarkable convergence towards low inflation and limited public deficits, without which monetary union would not have been possible. *      *      * In the new monetary constitution of Europe, what we call the Eurosystem plays an essential role. It consists of the European Central Bank as such, that is situated in Frankfurt, and of the twelve national central banks of the countries that have introduced the euro. The Eurosystem is not to be confounded with the structure of any other central bank in the world, be they even of a federal nature. In the euro area, monetary policy decisions are centralised from now on, but their implementation remains to a large extent decentralised. The Governing Council of the European Central Bank is the supreme decision-making body. It meets every fortnight and consists of the six permanent members of the Board of the ECB and of the governors of every national central bank. It is the Governing council which more in particular determines the level of official interest rates.  In practice, decisions are taken on a consensus basis, but according to the legal provisions they require a simple majority of votes. Each member has one vote: the vote of the governor of the National Bank of Belgium carries the same weight as the one of the president of the Bundesbank, the governor of the Central Bank of Luxembourg or the Governor of the National Bank of Belgium. The principle ‘one person, one vote’ thus reflects the fact that even though they are originally from different countries of the euro area, the members of the Governing Council act completely independently and not as representatives of their country. The Treaty specifically stipulates that they can neither ask for or receive instructions from their government or from anybody else and that they must take their decisions solely on the basis of the interests of the euro area as a whole. 
 2 BIS Review 99/2001 *      *      * In granting the decision makers of the European Central Bank a high degree of independence, the Treaty of Maastricht- and I think these two things go together- has also assigned them a specific task: i.e. to guarantee price stability. Indeed, the Treaty clearly states that this is the primary objective of European monetary policy and that, without prejudice to this stability, monetary policy contributes to the other objectives of economic policy. In every country in the world the population is, I think, of the opinion that the first duty of the central bank consists in maintaining the purchasing power of the currency it issues. But this mandate is particularly stringent for the euro area, as was the case previously for the Bundesbank in Germany. The people in Europe, and moreover not only in Germany, seem to be particularly attached to price stability. Moreover, no central banker, and in any case not the members of the Governing Council of the ECB, is insensitive to growth and employment. But we think that growth should not be stimulated to the detriment of price stability, as such an action is short-lived and costly in the long term and monetary policy cannot resolve structural problems, in particular structural unemployment, which is important in Europe. Furthermore, price stability contributes to economic growth by sustaining consumer confidence, an essential element of growth, and by favouring low long term interest rates, these rates being even more important for the financing of growth than short term rates in many European countries. (It must be observed that while for the moment short term rates are higher in the euro area than in the United States, long term rates are slightly lower). The European Central Bank has given a precise definition of what she understands by price stability : price stability is defined as “an annual rise in the harmonised index of consumer prices for the euro area of less than 2 p.c. It must be maintained in the medium-term.” Such a definition offers a stable anchoring point for the expectations of economic agents in an uncertain environment. It also offers the public a means to evaluate monetary policy, thus enhancing the transparency of the European Central Bank and enabling it to be called to account for its performance. The expression “of less than 2 p.c.” specifies the maximum limit for the pace of inflation that is considered compatible with price stability. At the same time, the word “rise” clearly indicates that deflation must be avoided in the same way as inflation. By defining price stability at the level of the euro area, one clearly specifies that monetary policy is based on an assessment of developments at this level. Finally, when one speaks about maintaining price stability “in the medium term”, this means that one acknowledges the existence of short term price volatility, due to non-monetary influences and that monetary policy must be oriented towards the future (“forward looking”). *      *      * To reach its target and to assess the risks weighing on price stability in a founded manner, the ECB carries out its analyses according to two separate, but complementary, analytical approaches. These are called the two pillars of the strategy.   In the first pillar, the emphasis is on the monetary origins of inflation, as inflation indeed remains ultimately a monetary phenomenon and the important role of money supply in the strategy also emphasises the responsibility of the Eurosystem for inflationary monetary pressures, which a central bank can more easily keep under control than inflation itself. For the assessment within the framework of the second pillar, use is made of a wide range of other economic indicators, especially variables which have qualities as leading indicators of future price developments. These consist of, among other things, wages, exchange rates, bond prices, the term structure of interest rates, indicators for budgetary policy, various standards for measuring real economic activity, and the results of surveys among producers and consumers. *      *      * 
 BIS Review 99/2001 3 If I make a short comparison between the monetary policy in the United States, Canada and the euro area, I observe a great similarity between the Bank of Canada and the ECB : price stability is clearly the primary objective of their policy, whereas the mandate of the Federal reserve is both wider and less specific. In your country quantifying the objective(“inflation target”) is subject to an agreement between the Minister of Finance and the central bank, whereas in the euro area, the central bank determines this autonomously. It is true that in the euro area we have twelve Finance Ministers! However the discretionary power of the Fed is greater still. But apart from these few differences, our three central banks share the characteristics of the major modern central banks : price stability is considered as a necessary condition for sustainable growth; they enjoy a high degree of independence in the conduct of monetary policy and simultaneously have a strong concern for transparency and accountability. *      *      * During the first three years of the euro’s existence, the European Central Bank has already been confronted with important and different challenges. At the start of the single monetary policy, in the beginning of 1999, its principal leading interest rate stood at a low level of 3 p.c. During the spring of that same year the ECB then has had to address a deflationary threat and lowered its rate to 2.5 p.c. Later on, primarily due to the steep rise in oil prices, but also of meat prices in Europe inflationary risks appeared which the ECB has sought to contain by gradually raising its interest rate from 2.5% to 4.75% between November 1999 and October 2000. No central bank can avoid that a shock beyond its control, such as an oil shock, momentarily increases inflation. But the central bank has to prevent the increase of certain prices from transforming into an upward spiral of all prices and costs. The European Central Bank has succeeded in doing so. Euro area inflation reached a maximum of 3.4 p.c. at the beginning of the summer of this year; since then it has been declining and should according to all expectations drop below 2 p.c. in the coming months. The reduction of inflationary pressures has allowed the European Central Bank to reduce its interest rates since the spring by 150 basis points in four moves (coming from 4.75 p.c., a level lower than in North America). These moves had moreover become desirable given the weakening economic activity in the euro area. *      *      * The economy of the euro area has been affected, more than originally thought, by the slowdown in the United States, (which itself has been more important and long lasting than initially foreseen). Admittedly, since trade between European countries has become internal trade, from a monetary point of view, paid for in euro, our countries have become less dependent of their foreign trade as such. But other transmission channels have developed: European financial markets have grown, but Wall Street still sets the tone; as European companies have invested on a large scale in the United States during the last years, the height of their profits and investments is more influenced by their results on the other side of the Atlantic than was previously the case. Finally, different shocks, such as the increase in oil prices or the crisis of the new technologies have hit all industrialised countries and more recently the tragic events of September 11th have significantly increased uncertainty all over the world. It is true that the economy of the euro area is running for the moment at a very slow pace. However economic activity should return to a much more satisfactory path in the course of next year. Normally the high level of uncertainty currently affecting the world economy should diminish. And, with the exception of the confidence of consumers and entrepreneurs, the conditions for a recovery are already present in Europe. I think of the gradual effects of the measures favourable to growth that have already been taken (interest rate cuts and in many countries also tax cuts); of the fact that inflation is low and is still declining and that financing conditions (both short term and long term interest rates) have become very favourable. Moreover consumers in the euro area are hardly indebted and there has been less excess in investments, which should make it easier for consumption and investment to take off again if non-economic uncertainty progressively recedes. *      *      * 
 4 BIS Review 99/2001 Europe is not an island as we have seen in 2001. However, the full introduction of the euro should, without immunising us against external influences, allow the euro area in the coming years to register supplementary growth owing to supplementary stability, efficiency and visibility.  More stability: since the birth of the euro in 1999, much has already been achieved in this field. Within the euro area exchange rate fluctuations have disappeared. A framework has been set up for a macroeconomic policy aiming at stability, where monetary policy is oriented towards price stability and fiscal policy, within the framework of the so called Pact for Stability and Growth, towards sound public finances. These objectives are crucial for the confidence of economic agents and sustainable economic growth. The single currency is also a major step forward in terms of more efficiency, by lowering transaction costs and increasing price transparency and competition, which will be even more evident once the notes and coins will have been introduced. Monetary union also intensifies the integration of European financial markets, which improves financing possibilities for companies. The single currency should also help speed up other necessary structural reforms in Europe. Finally, the introduction of euro banknotes and coins will provide not only the new currency but Europe itself with more visibility all over the world. And within Europe, the use of the same notes and coins from Helsinki to Lisbon and Athens via Brussels will give the European citizens, much more than is now the case, the feeling of belonging to a community sharing the same destiny.  
 BIS Review 99/2001 1 David Dodge: Monetary policy and inflation targets in Canada Opening statement by Mr David Dodge, Governor of the Bank of Canada, before the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce, Ottawa, 29 November 2001. *      *      * Malcolm and I are pleased to appear before this Committee. We hope that we will be able to do so, on a regular basis, in the future.  Today, I would like to start our discussion by spending a few minutes explaining how we at the Bank of Canada go about setting monetary policy.  The Bank has a commitment to contribute to the economic well-being of Canadians. This means that we must conduct monetary policy so that it fosters sustained solid economic growth.  As I said to you last March, the unique contribution that monetary policy can make to good economic performance is to preserve confidence in the future value of money. When people can count on their central bank to keep inflation low, stable, and predictable, they can make sounder economic decisions. The Bank pursues low inflation within a framework based on an explicit inflation target, supported by a flexible exchange rate. The current target is to aim at the 2 per cent midpoint of a range of 1 to 3 per cent over the medium term. I say “over the medium term” because monetary policy actions take time to have their effects on the economy and on inflation. Some effects are felt fairly quickly. But the full impact on inflation can take up to 18 to 24 months. So, in setting monetary policy, we have to look ahead and make judgment calls about future economic developments and about the timing and final outcome of any actions we take today.  Since their adoption in 1991, inflation targets have proven very effective in keeping inflation low and in anchoring people’s inflation expectations. They have also provided the Bank with a useful mechanism for assessing and dealing with demand pressures on future inflation in a way that helps to keep the economy on a more even keel.  Let me explain how the inflation targets work to guide monetary policy and to allow the Bank to help stabilize the economy.  At any point in time, there is a certain level of output that an economy can produce without putting either upward or downward pressure on inflation. Economists refer to that level of output as “potential output” or “production capacity.” The level of potential rises over time as more workers join the labour force; businesses increase their investments in new technology, machinery and equipment; policy measures are taken to make product and labour markets more flexible; and all of us become more efficient and productive in what we do. Because potential output depends on many factors and their interaction, it is not something we can measure precisely—either in level or growth terms. But we can roughly estimate it, by analyzing the trends in those factors. At the Bank, we estimate that potential output in Canada is likely to rise by about 3 per cent per year over the medium term (as shown in Chart 1).  In estimating potential output, we find the emphasis on inflation control to be particularly helpful. It helps us to avoid systematic errors in assessing potential. For example, if inflation was coming in persistently below our expectations, it would be a strong signal that production capacity was higher than our estimate, and vice versa.  Now, in terms of setting monetary policy, the key question is where the economy is likely to be relative to potential several quarters down the road, and how that will affect future inflation.  If the economy is likely to be operating close to, or above, its capacity to produce, it is reasonable to expect that this will put upward pressure on inflation in the future (Chart 1). If this seemed likely to take inflation above target, the Bank would tighten monetary policy (that is, raise its key policy interest rate) to moderate demand and head off those pressures. On the other hand, if the economy is likely to be operating below potential, then there will be downward pressure on future inflation. If it looked that this would take inflation below target, the Bank would ease monetary policy to provide more room for the economy to expand.   
 2 BIS Review 99/2001  Thus, the emphasis on inflation control works symmetrically. It allows the Bank to take policy actions to prevent overheating, when the economy is strong and is pushing against its capacity limits, and to support growth when the economy is weak.  Let me now try to relate this to our recent experience in Canada.  If we go back to the fall of 1998, when the worldwide reverberations of the Asian and Russian financial crises were still very much with us, we can see from Chart 2 that our economy was operating below potential. Since this implied that there was a good chance future inflation would be below target, we eased monetary policy through the latter part of 1998 and the first part of 1999. Our economy rebounded strongly during 1999, and expectations were that it would continue to grow robustly—above potential—for some time, bolstered by strong domestic and U.S. demand. With signs of emerging capacity pressures, we then moved to gradually tighten policy in late 1999 and through the first part of 2000, to cool off demand and prolong sustained non-inflationary growth.   The slowing of the U.S. economy that began in the second half of 2000 was welcome because that economy had been growing very rapidly for some time and it was in danger of overheating. But what we, and most other analysts, did not anticipate was the collapse in U.S. business investment, particularly in the information and telecommunications sectors. This led to a sharper slowdown than expected. When this became apparent early in 2001, the Bank’s assessment was that it would lead to a moderation in growth in Canada, which would leave our economy operating somewhat below potential by mid-year. But we also expected that the pace of expansion would pick up in the second 
 BIS Review 99/2001 3 half of 2001 and strengthen further in 2002, returning us to potential output levels. So, although we proceeded to loosen monetary policy, we did so at a measured pace.  In the first half of the year, available economic information was broadly in line with the Bank’s expectations. By midsummer, however, evidence began to accumulate that the recovery in U.S. investment—a key factor in the expected pickup in growth in the second half of 2001—would be delayed and that the slowdown in that country would be deeper and last longer than anticipated. Economic activity outside North America had also begun to show more clearly the effects of weaker U.S. growth and of the ongoing global retrenchment in the information and telecommunications sectors. In Canada too, there were signs that domestic demand, which had held up through the first part of 2001, was softening and that the inventory adjustment was not as well advanced as expected.  So we revised down our growth projections. The implication of this, as we looked out several months down the road, was that the economy would be operating substantially below potential and that inflation would be below target. That is why, at the end of August, we again lowered interest rates to support domestic demand growth.  The terrorist acts in the United States, and their worldwide fallout, introduced a whole new layer of uncertainty into the global economic picture, further dampening near-term growth prospects.  I do not have to tell you how difficult it is to assess the ongoing economic effects of those disturbances, which may have had a significant effect on the psychology of North American households and businesses. But, as I said before, because monetary policy is forward-looking, we have to make a best possible evaluation of likely developments several quarters ahead.  As we look to 2002, the timing and extent of a recovery in economic activity will depend crucially on geopolitics and on how quickly confidence returns to normal. As we discussed in our November Monetary Policy Report, one can envisage two scenarios (Chart 3). In the first, confidence could be restored quickly, and robust growth could resume in early 2002, supported by the substantial monetary and fiscal stimulus already in place. In the second, confidence could stay fragile for some time, and growth would be anemic through most of 2002.   Note that, under either scenario, the Canadian economy would still be operating at levels that are below capacity by the end of 2002. This means that inflation would continue to be below target through next year.  How has the Bank responded to all this? To underpin confidence in the wake of the extraordinary uncertainty generated by the terrorist acts, we took the exceptional step of lowering our key policy interest rate by 1/2 of a percentage point on 17 September, outside our regular fixed announcement schedule. And we moved again to ease rapidly—by 3/4 of a percentage point, on 23 October, and by 1/2 of a percentage point, on 27 November.  The cumulative reduction in policy interest rates since the beginning of the year amounts to 3 1/2 percentage points, of which more than half—2 full percentage points—occurring since late August. This substantial amount of monetary stimulus will work to support a resumption of healthy growth in output, investment, and employment, given Canada’s solid economic foundations.  
 4 BIS Review 99/2001 In view of the ongoing uncertainties, it is still too early to characterize the economic outlook with great assurance. Nonetheless, signs that the geopolitical situation may be stabilizing and that households and firms are beginning to adjust to the new environment, suggest a somewhat greater likelihood that the Bank’s more optimistic scenario may come to pass than was the case a month ago.  In closing, let me stress that I have oversimplified how the Bank judges the performance of the economy relative to its potential. In addition, I have not mentioned all the factors that can influence the growth of potential or the future path of inflation. But I have provided the basic elements of the inflation-targeting approach that the Bank uses to help promote good economic performance.  Mr. Chairman, in my remarks today I focused, appropriately, on the contribution monetary policy can make to sustained economic growth. But I want to emphasize that, while low inflation is essential in this context, it is not sufficient by itself. Other policies, both macro- and micro-economic, must continue to focus on enhancing productivity and raising our production potential over the medium term.  This focus is extraordinarily important if we want to achieve sustained, solid economic growth and rising standards of living over time. We should not lose sight of it as we go through the current short-term difficulties.  
 BIS Review 99/2001 1 David Klein: A “package deal”? - the policy changes needed for 2002 and thereafter Prepared by Mr David Klein, Governor of the Bank of Israel, as background to a meeting with “Haaretz” economic journalists, Tel Aviv, 20 November 2001. *      *      * Clarification of the term The term “package deal” was the name given in the past to a plan of action agreed between the government and non-government entities-the employers’ and employees organizations-to achieve certain objectives. The objectives were usually to lower inflation and reduce the deficit in the balance of payments. Today we are facing a different situation: the economy is in recession, there is high unemployment, and there is no significant improvement in sight. In other words, it is clear that the current policy needs to be revised. Is a package deal necessary for this, or does the government have the required tools at its disposal to act alone? It is best to answer this question after identifying the policy changes needed to boost growth and raise employment without undermining stability and without increasing the balance of payments deficit. What characterizes the current policy? Policy is reflected by laws, government decisions, and agreements, some old ones, and some new. What set of laws, decisions, and agreements is relevant to today’s objective? There are two anchors to macroeconomic policy: 1. Fiscal policy, aimed at reducing the government’s size and debt. The implementation of the appropriate policy in this sphere will enable the tax burden and interest rates, mainly the medium- and long-term rates, to be reduced. Both of these factors are vital to growth. We know that the budget for 2002 is not positioned on the path needed to attain these goals: – The deficit will be greater than planned because the estimate of revenues is based on an unrealistic growth assumption. Moreover this will be the second year in succession with a deviation in the deficit, which undermines confidence in the government’s commitment to return to the downward deficit and debt path from 2003. – By far the greatest part of additional government expenses is directed to current expenses, and only a small part (less than one tenth) to financing investments. What is needed, therefore, to attain the objective, is: – To adjust the budget for 2002 to ensure that the deficit set by the government is adhered to;  – To alter the composition of government expenses so that the addition directed to investments increases. To do this, another subject must be addressed: Private legislation It has been shown conclusively that existing laws do not prevent private legislation from changing government decisions on budgetary aggregates (tax benefits are granted which reduce revenues, and laws are passed which raise expenses), imposing an order of priorities on the government different from the one it approved, and adversely affecting growth and employment. An amendment to the law is required which will ensure that all initiatives by Knesset members will have to be checked in the light of the budget policy determined by the government. All the private bills introduced in the last two years must be covered by this amendment. 
 2 BIS Review 99/2001 2. Monetary policy, aimed at preserving price stability and supporting financial stability. The more firmly established this stability, the lower the rate of interest needed to maintain it. Stability and low interest are another essential key to sustainable growth. Without stability, there is no investment, and without investment, there is no growth. Certain additional steps are required to complete monetary policy, just as in the case of fiscal policy: – The abolition of the ceiling on Treasury bills issues. – The abolition of the exchange-rate band. – The abolition of the remaining foreign-currency controls, and making the NIS fully convertible. – Unification of tax rates on interest income of individuals and mutual funds, without affecting total revenue from this source. These adjustments would shift the center of gravity of monetary policy from the banks to the financial markets, and enable price stability to be achieved at a lower rate of interest. Furthermore, and no less important, these changes would make the financial markets more efficient, improve their competitive structure, and thereby encourage savings and support growth. 3. In addition to the two anchors mentioned above, we must give attention to various aspects of the labor market and wages policy in the public sector. The relevant topics are: a. The law currently in force determines that the minimum wage is updated according to the average wage. To avoid exposing the minimum wage to irrelevant changes in the wage structure in the economy, and to comply with the original concept underlying the Law (ensuring a minimum income for workers at low wage levels), it would be better to link the minimum wage to the Consumer Price Index (CPI). In order to share the fruits of economic growth with those at low wage levels, the possibility of adding the rise in productivity should be examined. Efficient methods of enforcing the Law should be introduced. At the same time, the salaries of the most senior public-sector office holders, which are currently indexed to the average wage, should also be switched over to linkage with the CPI.  b. The policy of reducing the number of foreign workers, in particular the illegal ones, should be implemented. c. The policy aimed at replacing income support with a program to increase the participation rate in the labor force should be implemented.  d. A special work plan should be drawn up to retrain those who have been unemployed for more than a year. e. The programs of support for small and medium-sized businesses should be reviewed and strengthened, with special attention paid to those in outlying areas.  f. Wages policy should concentrate on the public sector. To carry out the policy of maintaining the real wage, the rules for determining wage drift (compensation for seniority; large differentials between grades; the pace of advancement through the grades; and other related expenses) should be amended. 4. Dealing with factories in difficulties A governmental approach must be determined to deal with the problems of factories in difficulties:  a. A legal framework is necessary (“Chapter 11”).  b. A process must be instituted to distinguish between factories whose continued existence cannot be justified on economic grounds, and those facing temporary difficulties. c. Any recovery program for a particular factory should require the participation of the owners (including investors in the capital market), creditors, and employees, and not just the government. On the other hand, they are all, including the government, entitled to some benefit if the recovery program proves successful. 
 BIS Review 99/2001 3 What is the next step? The professional team and working teams In a meeting called by the Minister of Finance which took place on 14 November, 2001, with the Chairman of the General Federation of Labour in Israel (the New Histadrut), the President of the Manufacturers’ Association, and the Governor of the Bank of Israel, a decision was reached to appoint a professional team. The team’s role would be to formulate a work plan such as that which I have outlined above. A work plan is not the same as an operative plan, and working teams must be appointed to go over the details. Four such teams can work in parallel: 1. One team will be led by the Budget Department, and will include representatives of the Prime Minister’s office. This team will formulate the change needed in the budget for 2002, both in the aggregates and in the composition of expenses; it will also deal with the amendment which will regulate the rules governing private legislation.  2. The second team will include representatives of the New Histadrut, and representatives of the Wages and Labor Agreements Department of the Ministry of Finance, and will formulate the overall changes needed in public-sector wages so that the policy of maintaining the real wage can be implemented.  3. The third team will include representatives from the Ministry of Finance, the New Histadrut, and the manufacturers. Its task is to look into the changes needed in the Minimum Wage Law, and ways of reducing the number of foreign workers in Israel.  4. The fourth team will include representatives from the Bank of Israel and the Ministry of Finance, and its function is to propose changes to remove the obstacles obstructing the conduct of monetary policy and to boost the development of the capital market.  The working teams can complete their tasks in a few weeks, so that the professional team will be able to submit its proposals to the forum which appointed it by the end of the year. Summary The main changes required must be instituted as part of the normal process by which the government reaches decisions. This necessitates the political agreement of the various members of the coalition, but not the agreement of the employees or employers. What is under consideration this time is not a package incorporating a wage and price freeze, a large devaluation, a change in the short-term interest rate, or the adjustment of subsidies, as was the case in the package deals of the 1980s. Some of these are not necessary at this time, some cannot be implemented on a practical basis, and some would cause more harm than good. In any event, the importance of the required change in fiscal policy far outweighs that of the changes mentioned above. In certain areas, mainly those connected with the labor market, it would be preferable, now as it was with earlier packages, to arrive at solutions with the agreement of the employees and employers. The package under discussion on this occasion is thus different from its predecessors. In the past, the issue was one of clearly defined, quantified, steps introduced for a specific time period. In the past it could have been asked “Who is giving, and who is receiving?” Today’s package must incorporate changes in the operating rules-laws, decisions, and agreements-without time limits being imposed. This is an adjustment to the policy path, and not just ad hoc changes, because the problems being dealt with are not ad hoc problems. Investments, growth, and creating job opportunities cannot be realized from today to tomorrow; creating a climate which will encourage them requires a transparent and credible long-term policy. 
 BIS Review 98/2001 1 Urban Bäckström: The Swedish economy Speech by Mr Urban Bäckström, Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank and Chairman of the Board of Directors and President of the Bank for International Settlements, to the Swedish Shareholders’ Association, Stockholm, 27 November 2001. *      *      * First a word of thanks for the invitation to this evening’s meeting. I intend to talk about the Swedish economy and monetary policy. The past year has been marked by a successive weakening of economic activity in Sweden as well as abroad. Forecasters all over the world have made sizeable downward revisions to the prospects for growth both this year and next. Consider the picture of the economic future that Consensus Economics compiles once a month from the predictions of 200 professional observers. At the beginning of this year the combined assessment was that in 2001 and 2002, GDP growth in the United States and Sweden would amount to between 2.6 and 3.5 per cent. It was foreseen that the slowdown would be comparatively moderate and be followed by a quick recovery. Today, growth in the United States is judged to be just a modest 1 per cent or so this year and even weaker in 2002. In Sweden, GDP is now expected to rise 1.4 this year and 1.7 per cent next year. In other words, it now looks as though the slowdown will be both deeper and more protracted than many observers counted on less than a year ago. We are experiencing a simultaneous slowdown in all the leading economies. After the terrorist attacks on 11 September, moreover, there is an even greater risk of the cyclical decline being more pronounced and persistent. The almost simultaneous and marked change that occurred in the global economic climate in the latter part of last year was triggered to an important extent by rising energy prices, higher interest rates, falling stock markets and the abrupt swing in corporate investment. Weaker demand led in turn to stock adjustments and thereby to further downward effects on orders and production. At the same time, falling asset prices, not least in stock markets, tended to subdue private consumption. On top of this, the terrorist attacks entailed a loss of production in the short run and postponed a cyclical upturn. In many respects, economic activity is following the normal cyclical pattern and is therefore not all that surprising. After a long period of expansion, sooner or later activity turns downwards while the economy gathers strength for a renewed upward surge. While there is nothing exact about the succession of cyclical phases, one can say that activity has always fluctuated more or less regularly. What was unexpected, however, is the rate at which activity has slackened. The downturn seems to have been accentuated by a reaction to the excessive optimism which the technological breakthrough had generated, giving rise to the notion of a new economy. We can all recall the virtually unbounded enthusiasm over the benefits that would flow from the new computer and telecom technologies. Expectations of a rapid future increase in profits and incomes inspired firms as well as households in many parts of the world, perhaps above all in the United States. Investment and consumption both rose and so did stock markets and production plans. This led in time to growing imbalances in the American economy, for instance between saving and investment as well as between current and more fundamental stock-market valuations. Investment was probably stepped up rather too quickly. Although optimism in other parts of the world did not become as excessive as in the United States, there were no doubt a good many investment, consumption and share-purchasing decisions that perhaps would not have been made if a more long-term view of economic development and more realistic expectations had prevailed. Important to learn from history History has taught us that euphoric phases of economic activity tend to end in a sudden change of mood. Economists of the Austrian persuasion see investment as the key to the economic cycle. In connection with a technological breakthrough, firms are liable to exaggerate the innovation’s impact on productivity. They may overestimate the conceivable improvement in productivity, for example, as well 
 2 BIS Review 98/2001 as the duration of the upswing. As a result, growth cycles generated by new technology not infrequently culminate with undue optimism and misplaced investment. When profit expectations ultimately fall back to more realistic levels, share prices drop. Corporate investment slackens as the economy’s aggregate capital stock is adjusted to match a more reasonable long-term return. This is accompanied by decreased household consumption, not least of capital goods, to match a more realistic assessment of the long-term development of income. The Austrian School also provides us with a fundamental insight into economic policy’s limitations. If a technological breakthrough leads to a period when the growth of investment and consumption exceeds what is sustainable in the longer run, there is bound to be a fall-off. After a supply shock of this type, measures of economic policy are simply not capable of preventing an adjustment to a more realistic appraisal of the future. The necessity of the adjustment means that the measures only postpone it and presumably tend to make it all the more painful when it does occur. History teaches us that after a period of what I would call “growing pains”, the optimism about what the new technology can achieve will be restored, albeit in a more orderly, realistic guise. In my opinion, neither the rapid fall-off in global activity nor the terrorist attacks on 11 September have upset the grounds for being optimistic about the new technology’s potential. Problems for many companies After the investment boom and the marked slowdown we are now experiencing, there is a risk of a good many companies having balance-sheet problems. One sign of this is the historically high September figure for the 12-month increase in the number of bankruptcies world-wide among companies with a credit rating from Moody’s. According to Moody’s assessments, we can expect an increasing number of bankruptcies up to the end of March. This has been accompanied by appreciably higher borrowing rates for companies with a low rating, as well as a down-grading of more and more companies. The group of firms with the highest credit rating has shrunk to a proportion that is small and even lower than at the time of the latest major slowdown in the early 1990s, for example. In view of the increased financing costs for firms with a low credit rating, there is a risk of more bankruptcies in the future, with contagious effects among other firms and sectors. For firms with a higher credit rating, on the other hand, the generally lower level of interest rates implies if anything that financing costs have been reduced. So the risk of increased problems with credit should not be exaggerated, though it does look as though to some extent at least, the present fall in activity stems from the supply side. Above all, it appears to concern an overly rapid and abnormally high investment in the IT and telecom sectors. Inflation prospects difficult to assess One consequence of the Riksbank basing its analysis on conditions in Sweden — and not being guided by the actions of other central banks — is that in the past the repo rate has been held at a considerably lower level than in the United States. There have also been periods when our instrumental rate has been below that of the European Central Bank. The central factor when the Riksbank sets its instrumental rate is the prospects for inflation one to two years ahead. A prospect of inflation above the 2 per cent target normally leads to a repo rate increase, while if inflation is expected to be lower than the target level, the repo rate should normally be lowered, and if the rate of price increases is forecast to lie around the target level of 2 per cent, the rate should be left unchanged. The economic outlook in the rest of the world ought to imply a weak tendency in Sweden as well, with an attendant easing of inflationary pressure and consequently a further reduction of the repo rate. However, the decision-making situation is not that simple. Three things in particular make the picture more complicated: (cid:1)(cid:2)Firstly, inflation is currently above the Riksbank’s 2 per cent target. The greater part of the increase is admittedly attributable to a number of clearly defined transitory factors that are calculated to drop out next spring. Food prices, for example, moved up in connection with mad-cow and foot-and-mouth disease. Moreover, electricity and telecom prices rose for reasons that did not seem to have to do with demand. But does this analysis hold or did the increase in inflation stem — wholly or in part — from an excessively overheated economic upswing? There are also survey data that point to rising inflation expectations. But the picture is not clear-cut. 
 BIS Review 98/2001 3 (cid:1)(cid:2)Secondly, the picture may be upset by the weak exchange rate. In relation to comparable long-term equilibrium exchange rates, the Swedish krona is currently very weak even though there has been some appreciation from the low earlier this autumn. With the important proviso that all else is equal between the economies, by itself the weak krona could warrant considerable differences in monetary policy between the Riksbank and other central banks. (cid:1)(cid:2)Thirdly, the Swedish economy is being stimulated by fiscal policy. A look at how household disposable income, after taxes and transfers, is developing this year and next illustrates this. Even with some increase in unemployment next year in connection with the economic slowdown, everything points to a sizeable increase in connection with increased public spending and tax cuts. So on the one hand we have a continuation of weak activity next year, on the other excessively high current inflation, a weak exchange rate that leads in time to a stimulation of exports, and an expansionary fiscal policy that feeds consumer demand. In addition, the current repo rate of 3.75 per cent is comparatively low, not least when one considers that inflation is around 3 per cent. The next question is how much importance should be accorded to each of the various factors and which side of the balance carries most weight. As regards the excessively high inflation at present, we have tried to analyse whether there are grounds for supposing that it stems from the Swedish economy having been more “overheated” during the recent upswing than we counted on earlier. The preliminary conclusion I believe can be drawn is that the explanation does not lie there. Most things suggest that inflation ought to fall back next spring as the transitory factors that pushed prices up drop out of the change figures. An alternative approach to whether the high inflation is temporary or more permanent involves looking at the development of by far the most important component of costs, namely wages. In that wage agreements have been completed, it is possible to arrive at a comparatively firm picture of how wages are developing, at least during this year and next. With reasonable assumptions about productivity, most things suggest that unit labour costs should be in line with the inflation target. This presupposes that the registered increase in inflation expectations, above all among labour market organisations, does not show up in wage increases; if that were to happen it would be very unfortunate and face monetary policy with new challenges. It is therefore important to take very seriously the discussion going on within the trade union movement regarding larger than expected price increases. The weak exchange rate, with the potential economic stimulus it represents via exports, is more complicated. In the past, a marked improvement in costs for Swedish exports relative to the main competitor countries has tended to lead to an increased export market share. At the same time, there is no denying that the international economic slowdown is particularly evident in markets of importance for Sweden’s economy. As long as those markets remain weak, a larger market share for Swedish firms will not yield a notable increase in volume. Another matter here is that in the IT and telecom sectors, on which the Swedish economy became increasingly dependent in the 1990s, the problems are not dependent on the krona’s exchange rate; here it is more global factors that are decisive. However, it can also be noted that the order inflow to manufacturing is now falling less markedly than earlier this year. There are certain signs of a levelling out, usually an early indication of a possible upturn in the coming quarters. Analysts’ expectations of this year’s profits for listed companies have clearly worsened during the autumn but this has been accompanied by a substantial upward revision of next year’s profits. So the overall appraisal of the krona’s exchange rate and its stimulatory effect is not entirely self-evident. Finally there is the question of economic policy’s aggregate impact on demand. What I have in mind is next year’s prospect of a relatively large increase in fiscal policy’s contribution to household disposable income, accompanied by low interest rates. An expansionary economic policy normally tends to stimulate cyclical activity, which implies that 2002 should be a fairly good year for domestic demand. However, there are at least two factors that could limit or counter this effect. One factor has to do with the lower share prices and the tendencies for house prices to stop rising and in certain cases to fall. In recent years, purchases of cars and other consumer durables have been stimulated by the appreciation of assets that feature in household wealth. Conversely, falling asset prices during the past year have tended to subdue these purchases. The stimulus from economic 
 4 BIS Review 98/2001 policy may accordingly be dampened or delayed as long as asset prices continue to fall. Of course, the situation will be reversed if share prices and property prices instead stabilise, or even begin to rise once again. Another factor is connected with the risks in the labour market. The redundancy statistics suggest that employment will level out or even fall next year, which may involve an attendant increase in unemployment. Households are already expressing such fears in Statistics Sweden’s surveys. Besides the direct downward effect on household disposable income, a weaker labour market may make people in Sweden more cautious when making purchasing decisions. Conclusions for monetary policy All in all, growth prospects for the short term are somewhat more unfavourable than when we published our most recent inflation forecast. However, the major economic policy realignment in a number of important countries looks like paving the way for a recovery after a time. But this does presuppose that households and firms really do start to consume and invest. Major risks here are saving imbalances and over-investment. In Sweden, too, there has been an expansionary realignment of economic policy that is helping to strengthen household income. Provided there is an international recovery, the weak krona should have a stimulatory effect on exports. As regards inflation, the rate since April this year has been above the Riksbank’s target. The increase is mainly due to transitory factors and I envisage that it will, as before, dwindle during the spring. This presupposes, however, that the price rise does not spread to other items or lead to wage increases. Another argument for a future easing of inflationary pressure is the existence of unutilised resources as a result of the slowdown. However, in my opinion, the Riksbank must watch developments closely to ensure that the recent rise in the inflation rate actually falls and does not stick. Most indicators appear to imply that inflation will be close to the target level of 2 per cent, or at least within a small margin on one side or the other. This evening I have tried to present a general account of my preliminary view of some aspects of assessments of the future path of inflation. I look forward to the continued discussion of these matters with my Riksbank colleagues. Our decision about interest rate policy is due at the meeting next Tuesday, 4 December. The result of our discussions will be published the following day, 5 December, as will the fourth Inflation Report of 2001. 
 BIS Review 98/2001 1 Ernst Welteke: The euro changes Europe and the world Speech by Mr Ernst Welteke, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, to the Japanese Bankers’ Association, Tokyo, 28 November 2001. *      *      * I Ladies and Gentlemen, First of all, I would like to thank you most sincerely for your kind invitation to speak to such a distinguished audience. It is always a pleasure for me to be here in Tokyo. I especially appreciate the opportunity to discuss with the financial elite of Japan the changes brought about by the introduction of the euro. Thank you very much.  The European monetary union is only 33 days from completion. On January 1st, the notes and coins of the single European currency will be circulated. Europeans will be able to pay bills using their domestic currency in all twelve member states of the Eurosystem. For the man in the street, this is a sea-change. In economic terms, however, the cash changeover is virtually a non-event. Europe has de facto had a common currency and a single monetary policy for nearly three years now.  The EU has been developing a common market for more than half a century. However, the member states of this closely-knit economic network have (almost) all used a currency of their own. In 1999, economic and financial integration made a huge leap forward, as eleven – now that Greece has joined, twelve – countries decided to embark on a common currency.  II What is this strange Europe like, that wakes up only when the business day in Japan is well advanced?  Let me start with a few figures. The euro area has a population of 300 million people – quite similar to the United States. The twelve countries have twelve national governments. People in the euro area speak eleven native languages. The euro area is the most open of the three large currency areas – the United States, Japan and Europe. Japan and the United States are our most important non-European trading partners. 17 percent of our six and a half billion euro GDP is generated by exports, and the current account is roughly in balance. Average per capita GDP stands at somewhat more than € 20,000 (roughly Y 2.2 million), a third less than in Japan. Differences between countries are considerable.  The public sector share in the euro-area economy accounts for nearly fifty percent of GDP, and the aggregate budget shows a small deficit. Aggregate gross public sector debt stands at 70 percent of GDP. Individual country figures, however, differ. For instance, gross public sector debt ranges from four percent of GDP (Luxembourg) to 100 percent of GDP (Belgium, Italy). Heterogeneity is a fact of life in the euro area. But homogeneity far outweighs heterogeneity in one crucial respect: we are united by our intention to form an integrated Europe with a common market as a strong and reliable partner for the world economy. III In addition, our monetary union is built on a host of common values and interests. The euro-area countries share a firm stability orientation. It is reflected in the institutional framework of the European Monetary Union.  The European System of Central Banks is a two-tier system. It consists of the national central banks and the European Central Bank, the ECB. Both the ECB and the national central banks are independent from any political interference.  Monetary policy decisions are taken by the ECB Governing Council, which consists of the six-strong ECB Executive Board and the Governors of the participating national central banks. The vote of very 
 2 BIS Review 98/2001 single Board member or governor carries the same weight notwithstanding the size of population of his home country. The rule is "one person, one vote". Unlike the centralized decision-making, the implementation of the single monetary policy is decentralized. National central banks provide the markets with liquidity, in accordance with the decisions of the ECB Governing Council. The primary objective of the European System of Central Banks is to maintain price stability. The ECB Governing Council defines price stability as an increase in consumer prices (measured in terms of the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices) of less than two percent a year.  The ECB Governing Council has opted for a two-pillar strategy to analyze prospective price movements over the medium term. In pillar one, the growth of a broad monetary aggregate is analyzed. This pillar takes account of the fact that, over the medium or longer term, inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. In pillar two, a wide range of other economic and financial variables indicating potential future price effects, are closely analyzed. The two-pillar strategy makes for a broad assessment of the potential risks to future price stability. The second stability-ensuring institutional feature of EMU – besides the ESCB – is the Stability and Growth Pact. It spells out how member states are supposed to ensure sound public finances, as the Treaty obliges them to avoid excessive deficits.  Wage policy is another national responsibility. In the most recent years, wage agreements have been settled roughly in line with productivity advances. Since the start of the monetary union inflation expectations have been low and stable. This reflects confidence in the Eurosystem’s policy, and helps in negotiating stability-oriented wage settlements.  To sum up: We have a single currency, the euro. Monetary policy decision-making is centralized, the primary objective of monetary policy being clearly specified: price stability. Stability-oriented monetary policy is underpinned by stability-oriented fiscal policy.  However, even in a watertight institutional and political environment, stability cannot be taken for granted. Stability must be earned, again and again, day by day. The German “Stabilitätskultur” – one may translate this as "stability culture" – is one of our most cherished exports to our European partner countries. European people now share a firm stability orientation.  IV How did the single monetary policy perform? At its start, the Eurosystem saw a period of hitherto unprecedented price stability. In 1998 and 1999, consumer prices rose by only 1.1 percent; in the year 2000, the inflation rate, at 2.3 percent, ran a little above the two-percent ceiling, after the sharp increase in oil prices. This year, after peaking in May, at 3.4 percent, the inflation rate has been decreasing. In October, prices were 2.4 percent higher than a year before. In the current environment of a weak world economy, the ECB Governing Council is expecting a further moderation of price movements. At its meeting on November 8, the Governing Council therefore decided to cut rates by half a percentage point. It has lowered its key interest rates during this year by 150 basis points, to 3.25 percent.  A generally stable currency, and markets that trust the stability-orientation of central banks, make for lower price increases at times of crisis.  In its brief history, the Eurosystem has already dealt successfully with three external shocks and crises. We have witnessed the Asian crisis in 1997-99, an oil-price shock in 1999-2000 and, most recently, the terrorist attacks. Europe did not escape unscathed from all these events. However, the low level of turbulence within the euro area contrasts with sharper reactions to similar events in the period before EMU existed. This means that we have withstood what has been regarded as the worst-case scenario for the new currency. The European currency area exhibits greater macroeconomic stability, to the benefit of all its citizens, and also to the benefit of the world economy at large.  
 BIS Review 98/2001 3 V The three large currency areas in the world – the United States, Japan and the euro area – together account for almost one-half of world output.  Currently, growth rates are dwindling simultaneously in all three major currency areas. That has very much to do with the higher degree of global integration, still underestimated by many policy makers. Global trade growth will probably slow down to only 1.3 percent this year, after 12 percent last year. The new round of trade talks recently launched in Doha is an encouraging signal in this respect. Among the major regions of the world, only China, the oil-exporting countries of the Middle East and Russia (including some neighboring countries) will show growth rates of a seriously positive magnitude. There is something like a global business cycle. However, there is no perfect synchronicity among different areas. Causes, consequences and repercussions differ in the three currency areas. This does call for area specific policy responses.  The US business cycle is close to a recession. Remember, less than a year ago, forecasters were wondering whether the USA would see a hard or a soft landing. The downward trend of the high-tech industry, and the corresponding overinvestment in IT, were prominent among the causes of the downward movement of growth rates. The savings rate rose abruptly and the labor market performed ever-worse. After September 11, the additional negative psychological impact had to be overcome.  Risk sensitivity initially increased steeply after the terrorist attacks. We have seen a widening of corporate, especially high-yield, spreads over government bonds. The increased risk sensitivity is a major reason why monetary easing has still not made its way through the entire (corporate) yield curve. More recently, the spreads have receded somewhat. They are, however, still above their pre-attack level. The United States responded quickly to the worsening economic outlook. The Fed lowered interest rates, the federal government substantially reduced taxes. Firms and markets are adjusting quickly. I have no doubt that the US economy will show rising growth rates again within a few months. Japan — no need to tell you — could not withstand the global downward trend, as the overall economic situation has not been favorable for years. The economy is still recovering from the effects of the prolonged banking crisis that followed the bubble economy of the late eighties.  Finally, the euro-area business cycle followed the global trend more closely than has been manifest in recent years. This can be seen as the outcome of closer links, owing to increased foreign direct and portfolio investment.  Exports and business investment led the slowdown in Europe. Growth rates diminished, employment gains came to a halt, and the prospects for next year have worsened over the past few months. Both business and consumer sentiment are tending to be weak. However, they are still higher than, for instance, during the recession of 1993. So is capacity utilization. Adjustments are taking place and will reinvigorate growth during the next year. As usual, expectations are adjusting faster than production. For Europe, psychological factors are no less important than for any other currency area.  Overall, the political situation in the world today is having a more pronounced impact on the world economy than in less troubled times. The degree of uncertainty is the factor to watch in global short-term economic developments.  European Monetary Union has repeatedly spared us turmoil in the euro area. On the other hand, it has led to tremendous changes within Europe. One of them – and one of vital interest to me – is the changing role of the Bundesbank in Europe.  VI Among the participating national central banks, the Bundesbank is the one that has seen the greatest changes induced by the changeover to a truly European currency. Before EMU, the Bundesbank had effectively – although not formally – been the central bank deciding the monetary policy for much of Europe. The Deutschmark was the key currency in Europe, and the second most important currency in the world. To this day, the Deutschmark is a byword for stability.  Now the Deutschmark is history, and the German central bank is an integral part of the supranational European System of Central Banks. The Bundesbank has been very active in the process of designing the ESCB. Important features of the system have been modeled on the Bundesbank.  
 4 BIS Review 98/2001 As the German central bank, we have relinquished our outstanding position in Europe. The leading role has been handed over – to the trustworthy hands of the ESCB. Decision-making in European monetary policy is centralized. That constitutes a major change in Europe. As long as the Bundesbank was the leading central bank in Europe, European monetary policy was designed to fit Germany, now it is designed to fit the euro area as a whole.  The Bundesbank contributes its vast experience in the field of economic and financial analysis. Extensive research and analysis have always been a foundation of German monetary policy. The Bundesbank is part of the intellectual infrastructure of Germany and of Europe – and we intend to remain such a "think tank".  In addition, the implementation of monetary policy is entirely in the hands of the national central banks, which deal with the monetary and financial institutions in their home country. Other decentralized functions are: (cid:1)(cid:2)The operation of the payment systems, which are interconnected in the TARGET system. (cid:1)(cid:2)The distribution of cash.  (cid:1)(cid:2)The holding and management of currency reserves.  And, it is the national central banks that explain the Eurosystem’s monetary policy to the general public in their respective home country. The role for the Bundesbank has changed tremendously. We have surrendered sovereignty, to become part of a larger system. This was not an easy process, but it was worth the effort.  VII For the greater macroeconomic stability envisaged by the architects of monetary union to become reality, it is essential for the member states to be convergent economies. A currency union, both stable and beneficial, needs convergence in all three respects: nominal, real and structural convergence.  As regards nominal convergence, inflation rates are the key criterion. The gap in inflation rates – as measured by the standard deviation of EMU country-inflation rates – has been basically unchanged since the launch of EMU.  As regards real convergence, I use the term here in the sense of the synchronicity of business cycles. The Governing Council of the European Central Bank sets a monetary policy appropriate to the euro area as a whole. A country whose business cycle gets grossly out of step might suffer if it is subject to a monetary policy that is inappropriate to its national economy.  However, marching in absolute lockstep is not necessary, as we know from past experience in the United States, where certain regions grow faster than others. The growth rates of states and regions within a currency union may differ to some degree. It is the size of the gap between actual and potential growth rates which matters. If potential output-growth rates differ, actual growth rates may differ as well. That does not necessarily indicate any lack of real convergence. In the longer run, stability must be built upon economic integration, which brings about structural convergence. An extensive body of theory has evolved on the characteristics of optimum currency areas. The most important feature is that prices and wages must be able to adjust flexibly. The mobility of goods, labor and capital will ensure market integration.  The European single currency has fostered stronger economic integration by means of foreign direct investment. In 1999, world FDI flows, at (cid:3) 888 billion, were more than three times as high as in 1995. Intra-EU FDI flows grew significantly faster over that period. In 1999, they were five times as big as in 1995. In addition, intra-EU direct investment has risen significantly since the start of EMU. In the year 2000, it actually rose by 50 percent. Today, intra-EU FDI accounts for one-quarter of global FDI.  The FDI statistics show clearly, first, that economic integration in the EU is intense, and, second, that economic integration increased fast after the launch of the single currency. These observations are borne out by the trade statistics. About one-half of the external trade of the euro-area member states is intra-euro-area trade.  
 BIS Review 98/2001 5 VIII It is in the financial markets that the benefits of a common European currency are to be felt most clearly. The implications of the euro are obvious: rising liquidity, deepening and widening of the money, bond and stock markets, reduction of transaction costs and abolition of currency risks. The euro speeds up financial market integration. Correspondingly, the functioning of the European Monetary Union depends heavily on a high degree of financial market integration. Its smooth functioning enables monetary transmission to work. Progress in this field is tremendous, but more is yet to come.  Those parts of the European financial markets that are crucial to the transmission of the Eurosystem’s monetary policy are already integrated to our satisfaction. The wholesale market for interbank liquidity in the euro area is now actually a single European money market.  In addition, European banks are interconnected in a common payment-system infrastructure. And improvements to the euro-area-wide payment system are being undertaken. A few days ago, the Bundesbank launched its new payment system RTGSplus (Real Time Gross Settlement), which improves security, reduces liquidity needs and expedites settlements of gross payments. Through this system, about 8,500 banks and credit institutions, including their branches all over the world, are accessible. The most impressive progress, in terms of integration, has been witnessed in the euro-area bond markets. Yield differences among the government bonds of the different participants have narrowed from more than five percentage points before EMU to some 30 basis points nowadays. The remaining spread is mainly due to the varying liquidity of the papers issued. Currency risks or divergent monetary policies no longer disturb the euro-area-wide diversification. In terms of outstanding amounts, the euro-denominated bond market is still significantly smaller than that denominated in US dollars. But in terms of new issuance, both markets are on a par. One reason for that is the sharp rise in the new issuance of corporate bonds. Here again, diversification within the euro area has increased. The issuers' nationality, as a determinant of the yield and performance of bonds, has been superseded by other factors, especially by a sectoral view. Accordingly, investors in the equity markets have shifted their perspective from country benchmarks to pan-European sector benchmarks. European equity markets are still small compared with those in the USA. The market capitalisation of domestic shares, as a ratio of GDP, reaches about 90 percent. The matching figures for the USA and Japan are 152 percent and 68 percent, respectively. Equity markets in the Euro area are growing fast. The ratio of new issuance to market capitalisation averages over 4 percent. This is twice as much as has been achieved in the USA or Japan. Further integration of equity markets in Europe is being hampered by the segmentation of both stock exchanges and clearing and settlement systems. A consolidation process has started, and should be fostered by legal harmonization in the field of financial services.  The degree of integration in the banking sector is mixed. On the one hand, wholesale markets and investment banking are largely integrated. On the other hand, commercial credits and retail banking still operate in national, segmented markets. However, a few European banks created by cross-border mergers are slowly starting to offer retail services at a standardised level for customers in more than one country.  The financial system in the euro area is still highly bank-dominated. At the end of last year, credit financing totaled about 108 percent of GDP. This is about as much as in Japan, and twice as much as in the USA. The picture is similar with deposits. In the euro area, they account for 80 percent of GDP, and for 110 percent in Japan, while the US figure is only about 40 percent. However, capital markets are increasing in importance in the euro area. Disintermediation is gaining ground. Financial markets have boomed in recent years and investment banks (as well as non-bank financial firms like institutional investors, pension and investment funds) have enlarged their market share. Disintermediation will be enhanced by the need for pension systems to rely more on funded retirement schemes. Since capital markets are more integrated than the banking sector, disintermediation will foster the integration of the entire financial system in Europe.  
 6 BIS Review 98/2001 Changes for the banking sector are in prospect once the new Basle Accord is applied. In general, we welcome the new accord if it helps to improve the allocation of capital. However, two special features of the German economy should be considered:  1. The German economy is largely dominated by small and medium-sized enterprises, known as the „Mittelstand“. 2. Our financial systems rely to a large extent on long-term financing. This long-termism of financing has contributed successfully to the stability and prosperity of our economy, as well as the financial system. That is why the Bundesbank argues that banking regulation should not discriminate against long-term financial relations.  Small and medium-sized enterprises with a revenue of up to (cid:4) 5 million make up more than 95 percent of all enterprises in Germany. This „Mittelstand“ forms the backbone of the German economy. However, their share of outside capital is significantly higher than with larger firms. A lower rating is therefore to be expected, unless other collateral or risk-lowering factors are taken into account. Here again, we favour a differentiated approach that does not put banks with a large exposure to medium and small sized enterprises at a disadvantage.  IX Banking regulation and supervision in Europe have become ever-more integrated, in keeping with the development of the single market. The introduction of the common currency in 1999 was therefore an additional factor contributing to the further harmonization of the regulatory and supervisory framework, accelerating the integration of financial systems.  Currently, we have a system of home-country supervision and extensive cooperation among European regulators and supervisors. This tried and tested framework is serving us well. Especially in the banking sector, integration is not yet so advanced as to justify pan-European supervision. Furthermore, tax systems, accounting standards and also banking systems vary to a degree that does not warrant unified banking supervision. As financial integration advances further, however, this situation may change in the future.  If, in future, once we have a truly European financial system, we will take steps towards a single supervisory structure. Those steps could probably start with the large, internationally operating, European banks.  In Germany, the government has recently drafted a bill on a new framework for financial supervision. The future "Federal Authority for Financial Services Supervision" will combine, under one roof, the supervision of banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions.  The Bundesbank’s role in the supervision of banks will be enhanced under the new law. This is a good thing, because there are good practical reasons for the participation of central banks:  (cid:1)(cid:2)Central banks, by providing cash and liquidity, by running payment systems, and by operating in the open market, have a good insight in banking behavior and solvency. Therefore, economies of scope arise by providing both, central banking and banking supervision.  (cid:1)(cid:2)Central banks have a responsibility for financial system stability, which is a prerequisite for the conduct of monetary policy. (cid:1)(cid:2)Central banks operate payment systems that are a potential source of systemic risks. (cid:1)(cid:2)And, at times of crisis, central banks have a role as mediators, as well as a potential "lender-of-last-resort" function. If liquidity assistance has to be provided for illiquid, but solvent, banks, national central banks would benefit from having "first-hand information", as supervisors, for the sake of maintaining or restoring financial stability. Hence, once a European framework is envisaged for financial regulation and supervision, it must necessarily provide for the meaningful involvement of the ESCB. There is, however, no single solution to fit all countries and all environments. In Japan, as I have learnt, you have adopted a different approach.  
 BIS Review 98/2001 7 X Let us share a few thoughts on the international role of the euro.  Three years into its life, the euro is the second most important currency in the world. It took over that role from the Deutschmark.  The euro has a share of roughly 13 percent in international currency reserves – about as much as the Deutschmark had before. In this field, the dollar is the unchallenged leader, at two-thirds of international reserves. The size, depth and liquidity of the dollar markets, as well as the widespread habit of using the dollar for interventions and for pricing commodities, explain its predominance.  As regards its use as a store of value, we find some evidence of the growing importance of the euro. 30 percent of all international securities outstanding are denominated in euro. This share is slightly above the aggregate share of the predecessor currencies shortly before EMU was launched. That leaves the euro as the second-most-important currency in the international securities markets. Again, the dollar is the dominant currency, accounting for one-half of all international securities outstanding.  The currency composition of international bank assets presents a similar picture. Again, the dollar is the leading currency, with a share of 40 percent, while the euro is in the process of catching up. From slightly less than one-quarter at the end of 1998, its share rose to 27 percent. What can we see from these figures? Although habits in the international use of currencies change only gradually, the euro has already won a respectable market share. Its market share roughly equals the economic weight of the euro area.  Further progress in the development of broad, deep and liquid financial markets is a precondition for the expansion of the euro’s international role. Increased international use of the euro, as a currency for international reserve holdings, for investment and financing purposes, might have some bearing on monetary policy, but this potential impact seems manageable. Hence, in the Eurosystem, we have adopted a neutral stance towards the internationalisation of the euro. We regard it as a market-driven process, and we neither hinder it nor foster it.  XI The euro currently plays a role in the exchange-rate regimes of 55 countries. Among these euro-minded countries are eight of the twelve countries willing to become member states of the European Union.  The motivation for aiming at joining the European Union is the prospect of stability and prosperity in a unified Europe. Soon after the Iron Curtain was lifted in 1989, the former communist states, with their centrally-planned economies, had negotiated “Europe Agreements” with the European Union. Those partnerships were meant to foster the transition process towards, first, democracies, and, second, fully-fledged market economies. Since then, a lot has been attained in terms of macroeconomic stability and prosperity. Two weeks ago, the European Commission issued its annual progress report on the accession process. That report confirms the prospect of ten countries joining the EU as early as 2004:  (cid:1)(cid:2)the three Baltic nations: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania;  (cid:1)(cid:2)five central and eastern European countries: Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia;  (cid:1)(cid:2)and the two Mediterranean islands of Cyprus and Malta.  The process of accession is organized in three stages. We are currently in the pre-accession stage. The next step will be that of accession to the EU, and the final stage might be full participation in European Monetary Union. Accession to the European Union is conditional on the fulfillment of the so-called "Copenhagen criteria". These comprise, First, "the stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights, and respect for, and the protection of, minorities". This political criterion is already met by all negotiating countries. 
 8 BIS Review 98/2001 Second, “the existence of a functioning market economy as well as the capacity to cope with competitive pressures and market forces within the EU”. All of the countries envisaging accession in 2004 are functioning market economies. The EU Commission, in its recent report, also expects them to be able to cope with competitive pressures and market forces within the EU in the near term. And, third, "the ability to accept the obligations of membership, including adherence to the aims of political unification, as well as Economic and Monetary Union". The EU Commission recognizes substantial progress, in candidate countries, towards the adoption, implementation and enforcement of the "acquis communautaire" – the Community’s legislation.  The Copenhagen criteria define the common ground for the future EU.  Accession to European Monetary Union is conditional on "a high degree of sustainable convergence" (Art. 121 of the Treaty), as specified in the Maastricht criteria. They stipulate nominal convergence in terms of inflation rates, sound public finances, long-term interest rates and exchange-rate stability. Candidate countries can join EMU two years after their EU accession, at the earliest, as they have to spend at least two years in the European Exchange-Rate Mechanism ERM II.  There are still considerable discrepancies between the candidate countries and the present EU member states in their macroeconomic and structural data. Accession of the twelve candidate countries will increase the EU population by roughly one-third. Nominal GDP, however, will rise by only five percent.  The discrepancies today are more pronounced than they were in the previous three rounds of enlargement. The wealth gap between the current member states and the accession candidates is large. Per capita GDP (measured in terms of purchasing-power parity) is only 44 percent of the EU average. Furthermore, there is a striking degree of heterogeneity among the candidate countries themselves. Per capita GDP measured against the EU average ranges from 24 percent (Bulgaria) to 83 percent (Cyprus). For convergence to be sustainable, it must be based on advanced economic and financial integration. The integration of the candidate countries with the EU runs deep. The EU is by far the most important trading partner of the accession candidates. Around two-thirds of their exports are destined for the 15 EU member states. In addition, two-thirds of capital inflows in the accession candidates during the nineties originated from the European Union. Real and structural convergence increase with ongoing economic and financial integration.  Ladies and gentlemen, EU enlargement is in fact a challenge. A lot of political work is yet to be done. Not only by the candidate countries, but also by the current EU, which has to reshape its institutions to be able to cope with the enlarged membership – probably 25 states in only two years time.  XII Ladies and Gentlemen, A stable and strong euro will serve as a catalyst of the ongoing process of European integration  – among the present member states and the accession candidates alike. Euro banknotes and coins – to be put into circulation in less than five weeks – will soon become the most obvious symbol of a unified Europe. Political integration should receive a boost then, too.  “The euro changes Europe and the world”. Yes, so it does. And it is a change for the better. A Europe united by a common currency implies that the world's second-largest economic entity is a stronghold of stability. I am sure that a stable currency will strengthen the foundations of an orderly world economy and of productive global competition. And, I am sure, that Japan as a major player in the world economy will benefit as well.  
 BIS Review 96/2001 1 Jean-Claude Trichet: The Euro - a major structural reform of the European economy Speech by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, Governor of the Banque de France, at the NIKKEI Euro Symposium, London, 5 November 2001. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure and an honour for me to be speaking here today, at the Nikkei Euro Symposium, in front of such a distinguished audience. I am particularly pleased to express my views on the euro and its prospects following the launch of the notes and coins, which will be a reality within 8 weeks The economic and financial ties between Europe and Japan have been strengthened significantly over the recent period : European investors and companies have stepped up their market presence in Japan these last two years ; likewise, Japanese foreign direct investments in the Euro area and Japanese portfolio investments in euro since January 1999 have highlighted the confidence in the European single currency. I would like to explain why the euro and Monetary Union have been successful from the outset, and the conditions and prospects for building on this achievement. I will then discuss the historical event of the introduction of banknotes and coins at the end of this year. I. The euro and Monetary union are based on a credible monetary policy, and contribute to an APPROPRIATE economic and monetary equilibrium in Europe 1. The euro is based on a credible, stability-oriented monetary policy a) I would like to point out that, from a technical point of view, the launch of the euro on financial markets, on 1 January 1999, has been an indisputable success, and that the Eurosystem, made up of the ECB and the National Central Banks of the euro area, has fully achieved the objectives assigned to it in the following areas: – operational efficiency, highlighted by the precise adjustment of banking liquidity and effective steering of short-term interest rates; – the security provided by the procedures and systems implemented, both for the execution of interbank transactions, and vis-à-vis large-value payments. The inter-bank market became integrated in early January 1999, right from the start of Monetary Union, thanks to the setting up of the Target system for the real-time transfer of large-value payments throughout the euro area and in other EU countries. – and, finally, the smooth functioning of the Eurosystem, which is an integrated organisation in which the decision-making centre works in constant contact with the national central banks on the implementation of operations. b) Together with many other factors, this technical and operational success has contributed to the high level of credibility of the single monetary policy which is based, in particular, on the independence of the European Central Bank and national central banks, and on the store of confidence inherited from the latter.  Moreover, contrary to popular belief, European Monetary Union did not start from scratch. For no less than 12 years before the launch of the euro, six of the twelve currencies which now make up the euro – and represent almost two thirds of euro-area GDP - had proven remarkably stable, and were not realigned within the ERM. This high degree of confidence also stems from the acknowledged efficiency of the operational set-up of the Eurosystem, which is based on the principle of decentralisation stipulated in the Treaty. The Eurosystem is a team. The European monetary team now comprises the ECB and the national central banks of twelve Member States, following the 
 2 BIS Review 96/2001 Bank of Greece’s entry on 1 January 2001. All the members of the Eurosystem work in close co-operation. c) The credibility of the Eurosystem lies, fundamentally, in its stability-oriented monetary policy strategy.  The Maastricht Treaty has given us a mandate for maintaining price stability. We have decided to be as clear and as transparent as possible by providing a clear definition of price stability: that is to say a year-on-year increase in the overall Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) of the euro area of below 2%. The aim of the single monetary policy is to ensure medium-term price stability, therefore creating a favourable monetary and financial environment for economic growth. Price stability offers an anchor for wage negotiators, and is a necessary factor for competitiveness, which is in turn essential for achieving balanced and therefore sustainable economic growth.  The euro area is however a complex financial and economic zone. For this reason, we have adopted a broader-based approach, taking into account all relevant data. We have thus based our monetary policy on two “pillars”. In view of the monetary origins of inflation in the medium term, we have assigned a key role to the monetary aggregate M3, which constitutes the first “pillar” of our monetary policy strategy. This pillar is based on a reference value which we set at 4.5% for the annual growth rate of the broad monetary aggregate M3. This monetary indicator is regarded as being the most compatible with medium-term price stability. Last December, we confirmed this 4.5% growth rate for M3. The concept of a reference value does not imply a commitment on the part of the Eurosystem to automatically correct deviations in monetary growth in the short term. The reference value of M3 is consistent with lasting price stability. Naturally, we also follow the counterparts of M3 closely, that is to say the sources of money creation, and especially lending to the economy and capital flows with the rest of the world. However, trends in monetary aggregates are not in themselves sufficient for assessing the risks to price stability. This is why we need an exhaustive description of the prevailing economic and financial situation. The second pillar of the monetary policy strategy is based on a broad range of variables acting as leading indicators of the outlook for euro area price developments. Our monetary strategy ensures a continuity from the monetary policies previously conducted by the national central banks, which now belong to the Eurosystem. This strategy has been well received by financial markets and the general public. In particular, the relatively low yields on long-term euro-denominated bonds confirm that the Eurosystem has retained the credibility store it inherited. d) Lastly, the credibility of the euro also results from the Eurosystem's constant efforts in terms of transparency and communication. I must stress here that the Eurosystem is one of the most transparent central banks in the world. Once a month, immediately after the ECB Governing Council meeting, the President of the ECB holds a press conference which starts with a precise report of the assessment of the Governing Council, and which is made available in real time on the ECB website.  The Eurosystem was the first central bank in the world to introduce, on 1 January 1999, the concept of regular, frequent, real-time communication in the domain of monetary policy. Other major central banks have since decided to follow us.  Being accountable, for an independent institution in a modern democracy – or, as it is the case for the Eurosystem, in a subtle constellation of democracies like the European Union – means being accountable to public opinion.  In this respect, both public speeches and testimonies by the President of the ECB to the attention of the European Institutions and public opinion, as well as those by the Governors of National Central Banks to the attention of national Institutions and public opinion, are of vital significance. Indeed, a crucial part of our collective duty consists in tirelessly explaining the reasons and the arguments that underpin the decisions of the Governing Council.  In December 2000, the Eurosystem decided to release, for the first time, its euro area economic staff projections, with a view to improving transparency and communication.  
 BIS Review 96/2001 3 Thus, from the point of view of the accountability of the central bank in a democratic society – that is to say the duty to explain, justify, convince, whenever possible, and take full responsibility vis-à-vis public opinion for decisions taken –, the Eurosystem strives to meet the highest standards of the main central banks in the world. 2. The euro significantly contributes to growth in Europe by enhancing the co-ordination of economic policies A few years ago, it was necessary to convince a great number of sceptics, in Europe as well as in the rest of the world, that the euro would really be launched. Many observers believed that the single monetary policy would never succeed ! Facts have disproved this conclusion. However, other observers still sometimes evoke the supposed fragility of the euro area stemming from the supposed economic and structural divergences between euro area countries.  How can we answer this important question? Firstly, monetary union does not necessarily imply that, at any given point in time, all participating countries will have the same rate of inflation or growth, even though the creation of the euro was based on the successful completion of a convergence process. Let us take inflation for example. Inflation divergences across countries or regions are quite natural in a monetary union.  In the euro area, long-term convergence to a common level of prices naturally gives rise to different inflation rates across countries. The convergence of productivity and living standards creates a trend towards price convergence.  Now, present differentials in the Euro area are not very large, in comparison with those sometimes observed in the United States, which is a long established monetary union of comparable size. My intimate conviction is that we will witness further European integration and, in the medium term, an increasing correlation of economic developments in the area. Several academic studies show that business cycles are becoming more synchronous across Europe.  Secondly, the question has often been raised as to whether EMU can be a success without some form of enhanced political union. Indeed, to achieve this, the correct mix is required between fiscal, economic and monetary policies.  In the European Union, Member States are responsible for conducting economic and fiscal policies. We therefore believe that these policies should be closely co-ordinated. Co-ordination is stressed in the Treaty itself, which requests that Member States treat national economic policies “as a matter of common concern” and subject them to a multilateral procedure. Naturally, this economic co-ordination can in no way undermine the independence of the ECB and the Eurosystem. Even more importantly, the euro area possesses institutional mechanisms which are conducive to an appropriate policy mix: the Stability and Growth Pact includes, on the part of the Member States, strict fiscal requirements. I will cite three economic justifications for the Treaty provisions that gave rise to the Stability and Growth Pact: – First, by keeping a rein on the fiscal policies of the EMU Member States, the Pact ensures a satisfactory policy mix within the euro area. This is essential for monetary policy, in order to counterbalance the fact that Europe does not have a federal government and hence no significant “federal” budget. Mutual surveillance and close co-ordination of fiscal policies are the responsibility of the "Eurogroup" and of the Ecofin Council. Keeping the deficit below 3 % of GDP, and achieving budgets that are "close to balance or in surplus" in the medium term, ensure a balanced policy mix throughout the euro area.  – Second, the Pact helps to prevent well-managed economies from having to bear an unjustified risk premium on interest rates, resulting from the poor management of other EMU economies, by setting up a penalty system for excessive deficits. – And lastly, the Stability and Growth Pact disproves the assertion that the euro area has no automatic stabilisers in the event of asymmetric shocks to a Member State. Indeed, by urging governments to aim at a fiscal position "close to balance or in surplus" in the medium term, the Pact enables them to allow budget deficits to increase during periods of specific national difficulties without exceeding the 3% reference value. In short, it enables countries 
 4 BIS Review 96/2001 to create a fiscal buffer during periods of normal economic conditions. This buffer can be drawn on to counter economic divergences or asymmetric shocks during economic downturns. But of course, the extent to which Governments can let automatic stabilisers play strictly depends on the initial level of the fiscal balance; obviously countries which still have fiscal deficits have less room than countries with budgets close to balance or in surplus. II. The Euro itself is a catalyst for further progress While many acknowledge that the introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999 was broadly successful, one may ask, at this juncture, what the conditions are for the full and ongoing success of the euro in the medium and long term. What is very encouraging in this respect is the fact that, in a number of areas, the euro in itself appears to be a catalyst for meeting these conditions. 1. The euro deepens and completes the single market a) The euro makes the completion of the single market possible. It enables the productive sector and companies to achieve significant economies of scale, and all European savings to be allocated to the most efficient investments. It also enhances the transparency of the market and boosts competition and innovation to the benefit of consumers. However, the ultimate objective of the single market could not be fully achieved while monetary barriers continued to prevent the free flow of goods, services and capital by imposing unpredictable and erratic exchange rate movements and transaction costs. The last step in this process will be the euro cash changeover at the end of this year; it will enable not only companies but all our citizens to enjoy all the benefits of using the same monetary instrument throughout Europe, just like Americans do today with the dollar throughout the United States. b) Moreover, the introduction of the euro brings about a significant change in the economic and financial environment.  The introduction of the euro has been a strong catalyst for mergers and acquisitions in the euro area. The European M&A market has been in 2000 one of the most dynamic in the world with operations totalling around one trillion euro.  The single monetary policy encourages structural changes in the financial sector, in both the euro area money market and longer-term capital markets. This gives euro area investors greater possibilities and improved financing and investment conditions. – From the beginning of January 1999, cross-border money market transactions increased sharply, to reach almost two-thirds of total activity on all money market segments. The unsecured deposit interbank market —which is mainly concentrated on the shortest maturities— is highly integrated. The integration of interest rate markets within the euro area is a key achievement which deserves to be underscored. EONIA and EURIBOR have provided the market with uniform benchmarks that are fully accepted by all market participants. This is reflected, for instance, in the amount of daily transactions and the huge development of the euro interest-rate swap market. These structural changes in the euro area money market have prompted market participants to concentrate their euro cash management activity in order to take advantage of the higher liquidity levels on the secondary market. Needless to say, such integration has to be brought to fruition in the other segments of the money market, i.e. the repo market and the short-term securities market. Further integration will enhance the efficiency of the euro area financial markets and will be beneficial to both borrowers and investors. – As regards stock markets and bond markets, major progress has been made in terms of integration. According to recent statistics, the euro, together with the dollar, appears to have been a major bond issuance currency in the first semester of 2001, with the euro accounting for close to 40% of total issuance. Furthermore, European investors have substantially diversified their bond portfolios since the introduction of the euro, prompted by the removal of the exchange rate risk. This enables them to achieve better performances for a given level of portfolio risk. 
 BIS Review 96/2001 5 Additionally, I would like to draw your attention to current trends in mergers or close co-operation between stock exchanges, securities settlement systems, clearing houses, and similar institutions. Had the euro not been created, would it have been thinkable that the Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam exchanges merge to create EURONEXT and recently conclude another major alliance ? Undeniably, the introduction of the euro is fostering very large-scale market restructuring throughout Europe.  There are still some barriers to further integration of EU capital markets. In this regard, the Eurosystem has welcomed the objective of the European Council meeting in Lisbon in March 2000, to accelerate completion of the internal market for financial services, and to set a tight timetable so that the Financial Services Action Plan may be implemented by 2005 ; a regular review of this Plan is made by European authorities, and progress is well under way. The Eurosystem also supports the strategic conclusions of the Committee chaired by A. Lamfalussy on the integration of the European securities markets, ratified by the European Council meeting in Stockholm in March 2001: we are convinced that the implementation of these broad guidelines and the new cooperation structures at the European level will help to improve capital allocation in Europe and foster developments on equity markets in line with monetary policy requirements. 2. The euro is an incentive for further structural reforms a) The euro, per se, is also a strong catalyst for structural reforms in all non-financial domains in Europe: a single currency facilitates the comparison of prices, taxes and earnings. The euro could encourage "cross fertilisation" of best practices through increased co-ordination of Member States' structural policies in areas such as the labour market, education and training, job creation incentives, effective welfare safety nets, etc. For this reason, the European Council, meeting in Luxembourg in December 1997, explicitly mentioned structural policies among the items selected for reinforced co-ordination. The Lisbon European Council further enhanced the medium-term strategy necessary for structural reform in the Union. The following developments are a step in the right direction: the emphasis on deepening the single market, the setting of indicators allowing comparisons of best practices among the Member States, and the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines which will examine the structural issues closely. The recent European Council meetings in Stockholm in March 2001 and Gothenburg in June 2001 confirmed these guidelines and even added a number of important issues such as the consequences of the ageing population in the European Union, the role of biotechnologies in economic growth, and the environment. The European Heads of State and Government, meeting in Ghent a couple of weeks ago, called for an acceleration of the whole process. All European countries must resolutely pursue the reforms they have already initiated. It must be acknowledged that much has already been done, in particular with the implementation of the single market. However, continental Europe is still experiencing levels of unemployment that are too high, despite the fact that the unemployment rate has been declining significantly in most of its economies for the past three years. According to the IMF, the OECD and central banks, 75% of unemployment is of a structural nature, i.e. generated by an environment which handicaps job creation. There is no doubt that EMU stimulates structural reforms on the labour market. With increased capital mobility and the smooth functioning of the single market, firms will become increasingly sensitive to the general environment in terms of their competitiveness when choosing a particular location in the euro area. The actual process of selecting an investment location within the euro area will be a major incentive for undertaking the necessary reforms. b) Besides structural reforms, a strong emphasis must be placed on competitiveness. Pre-euro economic policy required careful monitoring of the balance of payments and the foreign exchange and interest-rate markets. The authorities received constant feedback on key indicators affecting national economic performance and could then react accordingly. These indicators were sensitive, multiple and very reactive. At present, with the advent of the single currency, economic managers must monitor the relevant competitiveness indicators with even greater vigilance, as economic policy errors 
 6 BIS Review 96/2001 could have slower and more insidious repercussions, such as rising unemployment and weak growth. The rules of a market economy continue to apply to all euro area countries. Jobs are created by consumers – totally free to purchase whatever they wish – when they choose the goods and services that they deem to be best value for money. Companies – totally free in their investment choices – locate their business according to the relative competitiveness of the different possible sites. It is therefore necessary to monitor competitiveness even more closely than before, in particular unit production costs, and the tax and regulatory framework. The multilateral surveillance carried out in the context of the Eurogroup, will help monitor competition trends in each euro area country and in the zone as a whole and, where necessary, suggest appropriate adjustments. III. A smooth changeover to the Euro will also be a determining factor for Europeans’ confidence in their new currency Of course, the Eurosystem is at the heart of the euro cash changeover process. Our challenge consists in replacing all national monetary units by the euro in all monetary and financial relations of public administrations, banks, enterprises, businesses and citizens. The first contribution of the Eurosystem is the euro banknote production. Today, more than 12 billion banknotes have been manufactured, out of a total of 14.9 billion. The launch stock is almost ready. The manufacturing process has been carefully monitored, in accordance with state of the art security standards. The new banknotes combine many of the highly effective security features already used in the national banknotes of the euro area with a number of additional features specifically used for the euro. These security features provide all persons handling cash, especially the general public, with the means to carry out a rapid, easy, and effective examination of the euro banknotes. Special attention has also been given to the needs of the blind and partially sighted. The Eurosystem also plays a key role in the supplying process of euro banknotes and in the withdrawing process of former national monetary units. At the national level, each central bank of the euro area works in close co-operation with credit institutions, security companies, shopkeepers and police forces. This fruitful concertation is essential to the success of such a huge operation, on both fields of logistics and security. The “non-cash” euro is already in use The final stage of the introduction of the euro will include two changeovers: the changeover to the non-cash euro, which concerns all book-entry transactions (cheques, bank accounts, bank card payments, transfers, loans, etc.) and the changeover to the cash euro, which concerns banknotes and coins. This summer, banks in France started to systematically convert bank accounts into euros and provide customers with euro cheque books. In various participating countries, in particular France, all bank accounts have already been converted . It is now up to each citizen in the euro area to establish a new scale of values for the currency and to make payments in euro. In this respect, retailers have a fundamental role to play: their active participation and their readiness to accept payments in euro will greatly facilitate the euro changeover as a whole. The cash euro will be in circulation within 8 weeks As regards the cash euro, the main task now consists in frontloading the banknotes and coins so that, on 1 January 2002, transactions can be carried out smoothly in the best possible security conditions. To achieve this, frontloaded coins are supplied to credit institutions. Banknotes will soon be provided to them (as of 1 December in France). Retailers will also be provided with frontloaded banknotes and coins. Furthermore, in order to familiarise the public and to facilitate the giving of change as of 1 January 2002, individuals will be able to obtain, as of mid-December, packs of euro coins known as ‘euro starter kits’; these coins cannot be used for payments before 1st January 2002. As of 1 January 2002, banks will only deliver euros, retailers will give change in euro and ATMs will supply euro banknotes only. A few days after this date, almost all transactions will be carried out in euro.  
 BIS Review 96/2001 7 Beyond technical aspects, the Eurosystem –and also public authorities- have an important responsibility in informing the general public on the challenges ahead, the deadlines and the practical aspects of the euro cash changeover. The success of the global process depends heavily on the confidence of the general public and cash handlers as well. Preparing people to be well informed and to feel confident in using the euro banknotes and coins is the overall objective of the Euro 2002 Information Campaign conducted by the Eurosystem. This campaign aims to reach the general public through the mass media. It is closely supported by a Europe-wide Partnership Programme with more than 2 600 national and international organisations. It has now entered into an intensive information phase, since the unveiling of the euro banknotes and their security features by our President, W. Duisenberg, on 30th of August. As Mr Duisenberg stressed, this event was more than a mere technical presentation, but took on an historical and symbolic dimension. On 1 January 2002, we will have the honour of witnessing the largest currency changeover that the world has ever experienced. This will be the crowning achievement of a long economic and political process which led to the creation of Monetary Union on 1 January 1999. This unique event in European history will help to ensure lasting prosperity, which is not only in Europe’s interest but that of the rest of the world as well. Lastly, speaking in front of bankers, financial institutions, business executives and journalists, I would like to make the following remarks as regards the present situation: -first, the main message in the present exceptional circumstances, is that the first quality of all Institutions, all economic leaders, all enterprises as well as households is to keep one’s nerves. The best gift we could give the terrorists would be to change our plans, to cancel endeavours, to delay decisions, to reduce investment or consumption. We, Institutions, enterprises, individuals had and have projects : let us realize them, in time, and unchanged. -second, let us beware of fashion. It was still fashionable, a year ago, to embark on vibrant eloge of the new economy, to predict the end of the business cycle and to forecast for ever very high level of productivity progress and buoyant economic growth. To-day some kind of herd behaviour drives a lot of observers and actors in the opposite direction: overwhelming pessimism as regards the present situation and the economic future. Both attitudes are equally totally inappropriate. It is up to the Central Banks to remain moderate in their judgments, pragmatic and lucid in the various circumstances and to offer an anchor not only for monetary and financial stability but also for stability of judgment. -third, fostering confidence is a major contribution of the Eurosystem to the prosperity of the European economy. Confidence is a very precious ingredient in the present European conjuncture, as recently emphasized by the European Council in Ghent : confidence in the euro, in price stability, in its ability to be a highly reliable instrument for savings, in its medium and long term solidity. Confidence of the consumers in price stability underpins growth through dynamic household consumption – which is today a major motor of economic growth. Confidence of the savers underpins growth through a favourable financial environment.  Thank you very much for your attention. 
 BIS Review 96/2001 1 Laurence H Meyer: Before and after Remarks by Mr Laurence H Meyer, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, before the National Association of Business Economics, St. Louis, Missouri, 27 November 2001. *      *      * To promote macroeconomic stability, monetary policy must respond to changing economic conditions. On that premise, I always start my thinking about monetary policy by identifying what I like to call the outlook context. Is inflation likely to be stable, or will it rise or fall? Is the economy losing momentum rapidly or will it likely grow at or above trend?  The outlook context today must include both the state of the economy before September 11 and the implications of the events of September 11. At this point, of course, it is impossible to fully disentangle the contributions of the pre-September 11 momentum and the post-September 11 impact. Moreover, neither contribution is crystal clear--especially the latter, for which we have only early data. Conceptually, however, assessing economic prospects today requires us to blend the two considerations.  Then I will turn to the challenges policymakers face as a result of the complex forces identified in the outlook context. Here I will address three questions: Has monetary policy been less effective recently compared with earlier periods of aggressive easing to counter sharply slower growth or the onset of recession? What are the implications of facing a significant adverse shock at an already-low nominal federal funds rate? What is the appropriate relationship between monetary and fiscal policies, in general and today?  Let me remind you, before I proceed further, that my remarks today reflect my own views of the outlook and challenges facing monetary policy. I am not speaking for the Federal Open Market Committee or the Board of Governors.  Challenges facing the Fed immediately after the events of September 11 Before I turn to the outlook and the challenges faced by monetary policymakers, I want to discuss the Federal Reserve's reaction to the disruption of financial transactions and the increased demand for liquidity and bank lending that resulted from the events of September 11. When we think of September 11, we will always, first and foremost, remember the thousands whose lives were lost or were irreparably harmed--the personal tragedies. Immediately after the attacks, many others worked hard to restore a normal course of business, essential to avoid compounding the personal tragedies with economic dislocations. Doing so was especially a challenge for those involved in the financial services industry. The area in New York City hit by the attacks – including the two World Trade Center towers – housed many financial firms and constituted an important part of the infrastructure of financial markets. The events of that day could have disrupted those markets and the activity that they financed for a considerable time.  Instead, we learned once again that the financial sector is enormously resilient. In many cases, people needed only a cubicle and a computer to return to work. In contrast, restarting an airplane factory or an auto factory if its production had been disrupted would have taken an extremely long time. Such resumption of business by financial firms depended on careful planning in advance, on backup data, on software, and so forth. To be sure, securities markets and transactions, particularly the clearing and settlement in the government securities markets, were disrupted for a period. But financial markets and firms adapted and responded, contributing to the quick resumption of normal business.  The Fed, too, had many challenges at that time. One was that Vice Chairman Roger Ferguson was the only Board member in Washington D.C. on September 11. The Chairman was in Basel, I was in Beijing, and the two other Governors were elsewhere in the United States. This didn't diminish the ability of the Federal Reserve System to respond quickly and effectively. The Vice Chairman, together with the Reserve Bank presidents and staff members at the Board and the Reserve Banks, did a superb job.  We wore many hats on that day and the days immediately following. First, we acted as the provider of liquidity. Normal channels of borrowing and payments were disrupted. Some banks that were counting 
 2 BIS Review 96/2001 on receiving funds had to rely on the Federal Reserve instead. Security firms and businesses impeded in their usual borrowing turned to the banks, and, for primary dealer firms, to Federal Reserve open market operations, increasing the need for extra Federal Reserve liquidity.  The Vice Chairman issued a brief statement immediately after the attack that signaled the Fed's readiness to supply liquidity as needed: "The Federal Reserve is open and the discount window is available for meeting liquidity needs." We used every existing vehicle for injecting liquidity and even invented a new one--the use of large swap lines with foreign central banks to inject dollar liquidity. Discount window loans soared instantly from around $200 million to a peak of about $45 billion on September 12 and later, as markets began to function better, Federal Reserve repurchase agreements soared from $25 billion to nearly $100 billion. Second, we used monetary policy to counter what was sure to be a sharp adverse shock to demand and to bolster confidence that the Fed would do what was necessary to support the economy.  As supervisors, we and our sister banking agencies asked banks to work with their customers to meet legitimate credit needs. We benefited from our diverse financial system – one in which a strong banking system complements a dynamic capital market. When one is ailing, the other will often be – and in this case was – ready to take up the slack. And the banking system did its part admirably. We surveyed banks about whether they were limiting the drawdowns on pre-existing lines of credit. They informed us they were not. And we sought to understand the exposure of the banking system to the industries most immediately affected, such as airlines, insurance, travel, entertainment, and lodging.  We also had to focus on our own operational responsibilities, ensuring the continuation of vital payment services, including electronic transfers and check clearing. Finally, we had to work with market players to resolve clearance and settlement disruptions as a result of damage to telephone and other physical infrastructure. We were in touch with the banks and other participants in financial markets, we were in touch with the other banking and security regulators, and we were in touch with each other within the Federal Reserve System.  The Fed and other banking and financial supervisors have received much praise for their quick and effective response. Though pleased with our ability to cope, we recognize that the country now faces contingencies for which no one specifically planned. So, like many other organizations, we are looking for lessons to be learned and actions to be taken.  The outlook context  Of course, coping with the implications of the terrorist attacks for our financial infrastructure has been only a part of the difficult job we faced in recent weeks. Assessing the condition of the economy and the appropriate course for monetary policy have remained central concerns at the Fed. The outlook today is a complicated mixture of the momentum and forces at work before September 11 and the new set of forces as a result of the events of that day.  Forecasters today often begin by almost apologizing for even offering a point forecast of economic activity over the coming year, given the prevailing uncertainties. But we all have our jobs to do, including forecasters. Forecasters can offer us a careful assessment of the forces at work and some plausible scenarios of how they may interact. Policymakers have to begin with a best guess about the outlook to guide their policy response.  The uncertainties we face today reflect at least three considerations. First, we were still struggling to understand the severity of the slowdown and the prospects for recovery before September  11. Second, the effects of September 11 depend, to a major degree, on the psychological influences on households and businesses. I am often asked, by the way, whether I believe that the economy drives psychology or psychology drives the economy. I always respond that I believe the economy drives psychology; and that, if I believed the reverse, I would have become a psychologist. I will return to the role of psychology in a minute, and even admit its potentially important role in shaping the near-term prospects. The third consideration is that unexpected events – from additional terrorist incidents at home to how well the war on terrorism is going abroad – may be especially important in shaping the outlook.  
 BIS Review 96/2001 3 The state of the economy before September 11 We need to integrate two aspects of the state of the economy before September 11 into the current outlook. First, and perhaps most obvious, is the momentum of the economy and specifically how close the economy was to a rebound. Second, the strength of the rebound will ultimately depend importantly on the pace of underlying productivity growth and hence the average rate of growth possible once the economy reaches full employment.  Momentum before September 11. At least two schools of thought about the economy's momentum existed just before September 11. Some believed that economic expansion would resume within a quarter or two, while others foresaw a more protracted period of weakness. Though I viewed economic growth as perhaps bottoming out after slowing to a near-zero rate in the second and third quarters, I expected growth to build only slowly and therefore expected the pace of recovery through the first half of 2002 to be disappointing.  To understand the sharpness of the slowdown that still gripped the economy at the time, we have to begin with the period of exceptional performance in the second half of the 1990s. Many interpreted this experience as suggesting that old rules no longer applied and, as a result, discounted long-standing regularities between resource utilization rates and inflation and worried less about limits to sustainable growth. I was not inclined to this view. To be sure, higher productivity growth was likely for a considerable period. But the initial adjustment to the acceleration in productivity also brought temporary bonuses that were not likely to persist over the longer run. They took the form of a temporary spurt in demand growth – pushing the unemployment rate progressively lower – and a temporary disinflationary impetus, preventing the increased utilization rates from immediately raising inflation. The persistent above-trend growth and progressive increase in utilization rates suggested to me a danger of overheating and higher inflation. This concern encouraged a series of tightening moves in an attempt to slow economic growth at least toward the new higher trend and thereby prevent still higher utilization rates. In my view, a period of below-trend growth was likely to be required to unwind what I viewed as an unsustainably high rate of resource utilization.  As a result of a coincidence of forces, the economy slowed much more steeply than the Fed expected or intended. Besides the effect of monetary policy, a sizable rise in energy prices over 1999 and 2000 and into early 2001 contributed to an erosion of aggregate demand. But most important was the shock that hit the economy in late 2000 and early 2001 – a reassessment of the profitability of producing and owning high-tech equipment. This shock was manifest in both the financial markets and in the real economy. It resulted in a sharp correction in equity prices in the technology sector – the bursting of the technology bubble – and, at the same time, it led to a sharp retrenchment in the demand for and production of high-tech equipment. The economy slowed to the point where real GDP was nearly flat in the second quarter of this year and likely would have been nearly flat in the third quarter, even without the events of September 11.  The pre-September 11 prospects for recovery reflected the cumulative easing by the Fed, a sizable fiscal stimulus already in train, declining energy prices, and the normal internal dynamics that contribute to recoveries. I will return to these prospects for recovery in a moment.  Long-term growth prospects. The strength of the rebound expected before September 11 also was being shaped by the underlying pace of productivity growth. Recent revisions to the National Income and Product Accounts and other data, as well as the sharpness of the retrenchment in high-tech investment, had forced a reassessment of the prospects for longer-term productivity growth. The revisions suggested that, while that performance was still impressive, it was less exceptional than it had appeared before the revisions. In particular, the revisions had lowered the rate of productivity growth from 1998 through 2000 and, as a result, trimmed most estimates of the sustainable rate of economic growth going forward.  Before the annual NIPA revisions earlier this year, many had revised their forecasts of underlying productivity growth progressively upward to near 3 percent or even slightly higher, compared with the 1-1/2 percent rate achieved during the twenty-five years before the mid-1990s. The revisions suggested that underlying or structural productivity growth peaked at closer to 2-1/2 percent – still a remarkable improvement over the pre-1995 average but not quite as spectacular as many had thought. In addition, some of the earlier productivity growth, reflecting the frenzied pace of investment 
 4 BIS Review 96/2001 in high-tech equipment, now appears to have been unsustainable.1 Consensus estimates of longer-term productivity growth were revised downward to a range of 2 percent to 2-1/2 percent.  The effects of September 11 In thinking about the effects of the September 11 events, I find focusing on three subperiods to be useful. The first subperiod includes the third and fourth quarters and perhaps the first quarter of next year. The second is the remainder of a typical monetary policy forecast period, in this case through 2003. And the third is the longer run, beyond 2003.  The near-term effects. The near-term effects are dominated by the disruption to certain industries – airlines, in particular, but also other travel-related industries such as hotels, entertainment, and tourism – and the psychological effects on households and businesses. Policymakers can do very little over this timeframe to affect the outcome, other than to bolster consumer and business confidence by what they do and say.  We have a variety of measures of consumer sentiment. In normal times, these measures, in my view, offer relatively little predictive power for household spending. That is because the economy usually drives psychology and mostly not the other way around. As a result, we can predict consumer confidence with the same variables we use to predict household spending. Measures of consumer confidence have relatively little incremental value in explaining consumer spending in such periods.  During the Gulf War, however, we learned, if we did not already know, that in extraordinary times consumer confidence can change abruptly in a way not foreshadowed by the incoming economic indicators. Another way of saying this is that sometimes the equations we use to predict consumer confidence make dramatic forecast errors. Such errors may indicate an "exogenous" psychological shock and thus provide additional information to forecasters.  In the aftermath of September 11, it was widely expected that consumer sentiment would plummet and that the data would provide information about the severity of the psychological shock and help to forecast the projected cutback in consumer spending. Even before these data were available, many forecasters were calibrating the impact on consumer spending in terms of the Gulf War experience.  The two leading measures of consumer confidence rendered something of a split decision after September 11. The University of Michigan measure slid in September, but most of the decline occurred before September 11 and was broadly consistent with the deterioration shown by the incoming economic data. This measure has remained fairly stable since then. The Conference Board measure, on the other hand, declined sharply in October, but this sharper drop in the Conference Board measure brought it into closer alignment with the cumulative decline in the Michigan Index. So, surprisingly, at this point, whether September 11 significantly affected consumer confidence is unclear. At least, the effect is smaller than what many had expected.  We don't have good measures of business sentiment, but it is generally reasonable to mark down business spending plans in anticipation of a negative psychological effect if you are doing so for households. In the current case, businesses have apparently made an especially grim assessment of the near-term strength of the economy and orders for nondefense capital goods have plunged, resulting in further cutbacks in investment and downward revisions to the forecast in the near term. On balance, the magnitude of the further declines in consumer and business spending as a result of the events of September 11 is unclear. It seems, in my view, to have had a material effect on business spending and, perhaps, a somewhat smaller effect on consumer spending.  Of course, at times of high of uncertainty, the signals are typically mixed. So they are today. We have some signs of quite remarkable resilience. For example, the stock market plummeted immediately after September 11, but it has already returned to its pre-September 11 level. The exchange value of the dollar, measured against the currencies of a broad range of our trading partners, has remained                                                       1  Many forecasters during this period began to measure underlying or "structural" productivity growth in terms of the path of its components: multi-factor productivity growth and the contribution to productivity growth from capital deepening. Multi-factor productivity is the increase in productivity that is not directly related to the growth of non-labor physical inputs, specifically capital. Capital deepening is the increase in productivity as a result of the increase in the amount of capital relative to labor. The multi-factor productivity component is adjusted to remove cyclical influences. The capital-deepening component, on the other hand, reflects the year-to-year pace of investment and hence increments to the capital stock. The frenzy in high-tech investment, particularly in 1999 and into early 2000, resulted in an unsustainable pace of capital deepening. As a result structural productivity growth during this period was higher than would be sustainable when high-tech investment returned to a more normal pace. 
 BIS Review 96/2001 5 remarkably stable, despite the presumption that the September 11 shock would disproportionately affect the United States relative to our trading partners. Auto sales soared to record levels in October, prompted, to be sure, by zero-interest rate financing. They likely will fall back once the incentives are reduced, but, in any case, the surge signals that households are still willing to make large long-term commitments despite the uncertainty and risks of a recession. Moreover, non-auto retail sales have recovered some--though not all, to be sure--of the ground they seem to have lost in the immediate aftermath of September 11.  The rest of the short-run forecast. The consensus forecast today is generally described as V-shaped, starting from September 11. This description refers to the pattern of an outright decline in output for a couple of quarters, followed by a quick move to above-trend growth. The forces of recovery include an unusually aggressive macroeconomic policy response, including this year's easing of monetary policy to date and the stimulus associated with a series of fiscal policy actions--including those already implemented and those still under consideration. Until recently, I would have said "under consideration and expected," but recent developments have forced a reassessment of the certainty of a further stimulus package. I will return to the fiscal policy story in a moment.  But more stimulative policies are far from the only factor that should contribute to a rebound. Recoveries also reflect powerful internal dynamics. For example, the amplitude of declines in output during recessions is often determined to a major degree by the severity of inventory liquidation. Once firms have reduced their stocks to desired levels, they quickly raise production to avoid a further decline in stocks. Doing so helps kick-start recoveries. All the natural forces we expected to contribute to recovery before the events of September 11, while perhaps delayed, are likely to become part of the recovery in 2002. Aside from a rebound in inventory investment, these include the end of the retrenchment under way in high-tech investment. Just the return to flat investment spending, from the sharp declines of recent quarters, will give the economy an important boost. Such a rebound will likely be reinforced by a dissipation of gloom and resulting rebound in consumer confidence. Together these factors suggest the potential of a return to more solid rates of growth next year.  Forecasters, at such times as this, like to remind their audiences that they are making conditional forecasts. That is, their forecasts are based on certain assumptions. Of course, a forecaster has to be held accountable for his or her judgment about assumptions, as well as the forecast given the assumptions. But, in this case, a typical assumption is that the terrorist attack was a one-time event and is not followed by other disruptive and destructive events. Of course, the anthrax mail-attacks are another form of terrorism and may have already had an incremental effect on consumer and business psychology and behavior. They will divert additional resources into provision of security rather than production of final output. Until the last few weeks, most of the events that could materially affect the economy seemed more likely to be "bad" events damping near-term confidence and spending. But the more-rapid-than-expected progress of the war in Afghanistan reminds us of the possibility of upside surprises as well. In any case, we must recognize the heightened uncertainty to the forecast associated with the unusual degree of "event risk."  Longer-term considerations. The possible effects of September 11 on productivity growth are the major issues over the longer term. Three sets of forces could lower longer-term productivity growth.  The first is a reallocation of resources toward security away from the production of other goods and services. The purchase of increased security by a firm shows up as an added expense of producing goods. That is, business costs increase without resulting in higher measured output. Costs associated with security definitely are rising noticeably. In addition, some firms may diversify the location of their workers, increasing security at the expense of higher production costs. Financial firms, as well as firms in some other sectors, may build in redundancies to ensure continued operations in the event of future terrorist attacks. Firms may also add a larger buffer in the form of inventories to mitigate the supply disruptions that might follow terrorist attacks, retreating somewhat from just-in-time inventory management.  Many productivity shocks, in my view, are probably more to the level of productivity than to the growth rate of productivity. Of course, if the adjustment to the level occurs over a protracted period, it may feel like a shock to the growth of productivity. With a technological innovation, for example, the higher level of productivity is likely to emerge only gradually, as the innovation is disseminated through the economy. In addition, such a technological advance may not really be a one-time event but may be based on a continuing series of innovations. In any case, such innovations are likely to result in higher growth over a number of years. The effects of higher business costs associated with security are (we can hope) a one-time decline in the level of productivity. I expect the level effect to be completed 
 6 BIS Review 96/2001 within only a year or two, given the immediacy of the need. The result in this case is, therefore, a transitory effect on the growth rate of potential output for a year or two, followed by a return to the rate of productivity growth that would have prevailed in the absence of the higher costs for security.  The second set of forces that could lower long-term productivity growth relates to the federal budget. The increased spending on defense and homeland security are unlikely, in my view, to be offset fully by cuts in government spending for other programs or by higher taxes. As a result, budget surpluses will likely be lower over the longer run than otherwise. To the extent that they are, national saving will be lower, real interest rates will be higher, and private capital formation will be lower. As a consequence, the level of productivity will be lower than otherwise, with the growth effect spread over a considerable period. Given the link between national saving and productivity and the dimension of the expected effect, I expect that the resulting decline in productivity through the crowding-out effect would be small, perhaps not more than 1/10 percentage point a year for a while.  Third, a wide variety of other indirect behavioral responses are possible. For example, firms in general may be somewhat more averse to risk and less willing to make long-term commitments. Households may want a larger cushion of accumulated wealth, perhaps increasing the saving rate for a time. They may also reallocate their wealth toward safer and more-liquid assets.  These developments, on balance, would take a toll on longer-term productivity growth. Nevertheless, in my view, they are not large enough to alter the conclusion that the pace of innovation in information technology and other industries has raised underlying productivity growth to a rate faster than prevailed in the twenty-five years prior to the mid-1990s.  Still, the productivity story is exceptionally complex. On the one hand, we can take some comfort that underlying productivity growth should continue at a pace above that achieved from the early 1970s to the mid 1990s. On the other hand, the economy is suffering the consequences of a more recent decline in underlying productivity growth--a decline from the higher rate of underlying productivity growth enjoyed in the late 1990s and into early 2000.  Challenges facing monetary policy  Monetary and fiscal policymakers face many challenges under the circumstances. I will focus on the challenges facing monetary policymakers. One of these is calibrating monetary policy appropriately in light of fiscal policy.  Is monetary policy less effective than previously? Monetary policy before September 11 had eased by 300 basis points, the most aggressive easing over a comparable period in almost twenty years. However, many see the effect of that easing as disappointingly small. As a result, a question often asked today--indeed, almost always asked when the economy is in the midst of a recession or pronounced slowdown--is whether monetary policy is less effective today than it used to be. One explanation is the normal lags in response of spending to monetary policy actions. We would not, for example, have expected much effect through the second quarter and only a modest effect in the second half, based on past experience and the forecasts of our models.  But other factors, too, have contributed to the perception that monetary policy is less effective. These include the fact that the shocks weighing on the economy have been larger in magnitude and spread out in time and, partly as a result, forecasters in general have been continually revising down their forecasts of economic activity. Many have been surprised, in particular, by the sharpness and persistence of the retrenchment in high-tech investment and by the degree to which economic activity abroad slowed along with that in the United States.  Perhaps the most important consideration has been the evolution in overall financial conditions as monetary policy has eased. Monetary policy does not work through the effect of a decline of the federal funds rate itself on spending. Indeed, there is no direct effect here at all. Monetary policy works through the so-called transmission mechanism, through channels that include short-term private interest rates, longer-term private interest rates, equity prices, and the exchange rate. The effects on other rates and asset prices depend on the changes in the target funds rate relative to expectations already embedded in the financial markets and on changes in those expectations as a result of policy actions, statements accompanying those actions, and other developments. Other things being equal, a decline in the funds rate will lower short- and long-term private interest rates, raise equity prices, and 
 BIS Review 96/2001 7 depreciate the dollar. The combined effects can be quite powerful. In the current episode, however, other things have not been equal, and the dollar has not depreciated nor has the stock market appreciated. Of course, monetary policy presumably wouldn't have eased so much if the dollar had depreciated or the stock market had risen. At any rate, there has been painfully little pass-through from the funds rate to the operative channels, other than declines in private short-term interest rates. The absence of pass-through does not reflect a change in the fundamental effectiveness of monetary policy so much as the offsetting effect of other financial shocks that were occurring at the same time the Fed was easing.  One way of quantifying the degree of pass-through is to compute a financial conditions index that combines the effects of all the transmission channels into a single number. Goldman Sachs and Macroeconomic Advisers have developed differing methodologies for computing such an index. Basically, they weight changes in various financial conditions by their relative importance as determinants of private spending. The message from such indexes is that financial conditions have not improved since the Fed began to ease and, indeed, may even have deteriorated.  The response of overall financial conditions to monetary policy easing in this episode has been unusual, if not unique. In previous recession periods, financial conditions have generally improved as the Fed has eased, reflecting the pass-through to lower short- and long-term private rates, higher equity prices, and a lower exchange rate. The major reason for the failure of financial conditions to improve in this case is that one of the major shocks--the reassessment of the profitability of owning and producing high-tech equipment--was, at the same time, a shock to financial markets and to aggregate demand. The financial shock was the revaluation of equity values as a result of this reassessment--the bursting of the equity bubble in the technology sector. In addition, the dollar appreciated rather than depreciated, for reasons no one seems to fully understand. So two of the key channels in the transmission of monetary policy behaved differently than expected.  Whether or not long-term interest rates have fallen as much as would have been expected from historical regularities is more difficult to assess. One reason is that part of the decline in long-term rates occurred before the Fed began to ease, but in anticipation of that easing. In addition, the limited effect on long-term government rates may partly reflect the offsetting upward pressure from the change in long-term budget implications of recent and prospective fiscal policy measures. These include the large tax cut passed earlier this year, the effect on spending of the fiscal measures already passed in response to the events of September 11, and effect of further spending increases and further tax cuts now under consideration. The fiscal policy effects appear to be contributing to expectations of a robust recovery and a relatively quick and aggressive reversal of monetary policy. This presumption can be seen in the federal funds futures market, from which we can extract a forecast of the expected funds rate over the next year and a half. The market expects the funds rate to begin rebounding in mid-2002 and to rise significantly over the following year. Finally, rising risk spreads have boosted longer-term private rates, especially on below-investment-grade securities.  On balance, a number of factors have combined to restrain the economy, despite the sizable cumulative decline in the federal funds rate. I would not conclude, however, that monetary policy is in general less effective because of structural changes that may have occurred. But I do believe that the financial shocks that have occurred  –including the shocks to equity prices and the dollar – have required monetary policy to move more aggressively than otherwise would have been the case.  The implications of an initial low federal funds rate: hold our powder or respond especially aggressively to adverse shocks? On September 11, the federal funds rate was already low – 3-1/2 percent. Since that time, the funds rate has been reduced another 1-1/2 percentage points. Indeed, on September 11, there was less room to maneuver than in previous post World War II recessions. Does this mean that the Fed should "keep its powder dry," as some have argued, holding back on further easing in case the downturn turns out to be more serious or in case there are additional adverse shocks? I believe such a strategy would be misguided – indeed the reverse of what would be appropriate.  Given the initial low level of the nominal federal funds rate, we face the risk that, in what is arguably a worst-case scenario, that rate could be driven to zero, the practical limit for a nominal interest rate. This of course is the situation that has lately confronted the Bank of Japan and is referred to the problem of the zero nominal bound. In my view, the appropriate policy response, when confronted with such a potential limit, is to respond especially aggressively to any adverse demand shock, in effect, substituting speed of the move for the cumulative size of the easing. The danger in waiting is that 
 8 BIS Review 96/2001 inflation might drift lower, limiting the ability to drive the real federal funds rate into negative territory, as might be necessary to support a timely recovery. In the worst case, as in Japan today, inflation might turn to deflation, limiting the ability to lower the real policy rate even to zero.  The implication of starting with an unusually low interest rate is therefore not to go slowly but to more aggressively respond to any adverse shock. I did not view this consideration as relevant before September 11 and not even immediately after. But it was a consideration in my favoring the last 50-basis point move. At the very least, this line of reasoning is a powerful counter-argument to the "keep your powder dry" strategy.  Monetary and fiscal policies  The last of the policy issues I want to address is the relation and interaction between monetary and fiscal policies. Beginning in the Reagan Administration, a division of labor had evolved between these policies. Fiscal policy became less focused on short-run stabilization and more focused on longer-run considerations, such as promoting growth through reductions in marginal tax rates (the Reagan approach) or through reductions in structural budget deficits (the Clinton approach). This left short-run stabilization for the most part in the hands of the Fed.  Many argue that this focus fits with the comparative advantage of monetary and fiscal policies. It is widely believed that monetary policy has no effect on long-term growth rates for real GDP, aside from the benefits arising from achieving and maintaining price stability. In particular, beginning from a position of price stability, more accommodative monetary policy cannot raise the economy's long-term rate of growth. Monetary policy, on the other hand, is often viewed as having a comparative advantage in short-run stabilization. That advantage is based on the ability of monetary policymakers to change policy in a flash, compared with the difficult and often contentious process of legislating changes in taxes or spending, which are subject always to the threat of a presidential veto.  This characterization is, I think, quite fair. It describes differences in what Milton Friedman called the inside lag for the two policies--the lag between the shock and action in response to the shock. The inside lag is unquestionably shorter for monetary policy. But Friedman also noted an outside lag – the lag from the policy response to its effect on aggregate demand and spending. Here the lag for monetary policy is probably longer than for some fiscal policy actions – for example, for spending that can be implemented quickly, like extensions of unemployment insurance, and for some tax changes, including tax rebates or surcharges, changes in withholding rates, and some temporary investment incentives, depending on the specific design. Indeed, Friedman argued that the long and variable lags for monetary policy, due to outside lags, made monetary policy an unlikely instrument for short-run stabilization. Of course, some fiscal policy actions have very gradual effects as well – perhaps as gradual as those from monetary policy actions. These slowing-acting policies include changes in capital gains tax rates, supply-side responses to changes in marginal tax rates, and many programs where spending builds gradually over time.  Monetary and fiscal stimulus can complement each other when shocks are large and adverse and when interest rates are already low. However, putting together an appropriately stimulative fiscal package is not always easy. The political debate and resulting delay in implementing fiscal stimulus following the events of September 11  –even when all sides seemed to agree that a prompt fiscal response was appropriate – remind us that fiscal policy generally is not an agile or flexible instrument for short-run stabilization. One recurring problem is that virtually every fiscal change has some effect on the distribution of government benefits or taxes across taxpayers of different incomes. Every time we try to implement a stabilization package, we therefore get Republican and Democratic options that reflect their philosophical differences.  From Reagan through Clinton, it was widely accepted that good fiscal policy meant permanent changes with positive supply-side effects. To be sure, Republicans and Democrats always differed about how to implement such a supply-side fiscal policy. But when the need is for temporary demand-side stimulus, they differ even more.  The first principle in the design of a temporary demand stimulus is, virtually by definition, to avoid permanent changes that were not appropriate before the need for the demand stimulus. Permanent changes mean effects on out-year budgets--in this case lower surpluses, hence lower national saving, higher real interest rates, lower private investment and lower growth in productivity and output. This problem is not just in the future. Bond markets have become very aggressive in building in expectations of rising short-term rates over time into today's long-term interest rates. Higher long-term 
 BIS Review 96/2001 9 rates today in response to the long-term effects of permanent fiscal policy changes would offset part of the intended stimulus. The second principle for a temporary demand-side fiscal program is to implement policies that have a large "bang for the buck."  Even with agreement on these two principles, designing a temporary demand-stimulus package is a challenge. In general, temporary policies have effects that are more difficult to predict than those from permanent changes. And temporary policy changes typically leave a hole on the other side and therefore create other problems down the road. Still, on balance, a package of well-crafted, temporary, quick-acting demand-side fiscal measures would, in my view, make a constructive contribution to supporting and strengthening the rebound expected next year.  The current debate in the Congress about fiscal stimulus creates a challenge for forecasters and monetary policymakers alike. Monetary policymakers condition their policy on a forecast, and the forecast must include some assumption about fiscal policy. In most cases, and especially when fiscal policy was not a player in stabilization policy, this dependence of monetary policy on fiscal policy was not a serious issue. But today, the forecast for 2002 is quite sensitive to whether or not a stimulus package is implemented and to the specifics of the package. I, for one, have assumed that the Congress would reach a timely agreement and implement a package with temporary measures characterized by relatively high bangs for the buck. While I have some doubt that this will be the outcome, I have not changed my forecast yet.  Conclusion  The economy contracted in the third quarter and appears to be contracting again in the current quarter. Fortunately, a considerable amount of stimulus is already in train because of the combination of monetary policy easing and fiscal policy measures already enacted. The Congress may still pass additional fiscal stimulus before year-end. In addition, the internal dynamics that support recovery may soon come into play. In this case, the economy should gradually strengthen over next year. For the moment, the risks continue to be to the down side, but the front-loaded response of monetary policy has already made an important contribution to countering the further adverse shock and, in addition, has provided some insurance against downside risks. Once the economy shows signs of moving to a rate of growth above trend, the Fed will have to reassess the appropriate degree of stimulus and, at some point, begin the return to a more neutral policy.  
 BIS Review 95/2001 1 Birgir Ísleifur Gunnarsson: Monetary policy, economic growth and prosperity Opening address by Mr Birgir Ísleifur Gunnarsson, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Central Bank of Iceland, at a conference to mark the 60th anniversary of the University of Iceland Faculty of Economics and Business Administration, Reykjavik, 31 October 2001. *      *      * I would like to congratulate the University of Iceland’s Faculty of Economics and Business Administration on its 60th anniversary, its noteworthy activities and its contributions towards strengthening the Icelandic economy. I also wish the faculty every success for the future. At the same time I thank you for the honour I have been shown with this invitation to deliver the opening address at this anniversary conference. I have chosen to call my talk “Monetary policy, economic growth and prosperity.” I shall therefore focus on the role played by monetary policy in economic policy implementation, and its contribution towards economic growth and prosperity. And there is ample reason as well, because the most notable events in economic organisation this year have involved precisely the monetary policy framework and the Central Bank.  Price stability  Important changes have been made to central bank legislation around the world in recent years. There has been a gradual increase in support for the view that it is natural to set central banks straightforward targets which are suited to the instruments they use, and to strengthen their independence to take action and their financial independence while at the same time making firm requirements about transparency and accountability towards the government and general public. Treasury access to central bank funding was closed. Simple target-setting for central banks largely involved assigning a single main objective to monetary policy, i.e. to promote price stability, which means a low level of measured inflation. In some countries, central banks were assigned the task of defining their own main objectives, but elsewhere this was done by governments, or in cooperation between the government and the central bank. These viewpoints are reflected in central bank legislation of many countries and in the Maastricht Treaty’s provisions for the establishment and activities of the European Central Bank.  Another widespread central bank objective in recent years has been to contribute to the stability of the financial system, including payments systems. Many central banks have been devoting increasingly more scope to this topic, reflecting the need which has been identified following the deregulation of international capital movements. At global level, a much higher profile has been given to active monitoring of financial activities and maintaining an active overview of various risk factors in financial systems and the economy as a whole, in order to attempt to prevent serious shocks.  Persistent inflation is the result of lax monetary stance  There are good reasons for assigning central banks a single main objective, namely to promote price stability. Inflation is primarily a monetary phenomenon. Short-lived inflation can have many causes, but persistent inflation is the consequence of a lax monetary stance. In the long run, monetary policy therefore primarily has an effect on prices. Under normal conditions it only has a temporary impact on economic growth and employment. Since central banks broadly speaking have only one instrument, i.e. interest rates, and can therefore only achieve a single long-term macroeconomic goal, it is natural to set price stability as the ultimate monetary goal. This is not to say that price stability is a more important goal than, say, full employment, but simply that monetary policy instruments are inherently better suited to impacting prices. It is pointless to set objectives for monetary policy which it cannot achieve. Through price stability, a forward-orientated monetary policy can contribute towards creating a stable economic environment on which the long-term growth potential of the economy, namely growth and prosperity, is based.  The reason that central banks can have a widespread effect on interest rate formation in the markets through their interest rate decisions is that they have the exclusive right to issue money in the economy, i.e. base money. By controlling the price of base money, i.e. the interest terms at which 
 2 BIS Review 95/2001 financial institutions can borrow short-term capital from them, central banks can influence the volume and price of liquidity in the financial system. Central Bank interest rate decisions have an impact on short- and long-term interest rates, financial system liquidity, money in circulation and bank lending, exchange rates of currencies, other asset prices and, last but not least, market participants’ expectations about the future development of all these factors. All this, in turn, influences consumption and investment decisions of individuals and businesses, and thereby aggregate demand. The impact in individual areas can vary greatly from one time to the next.  The new Central Bank Act  The previous Central Bank Act dated from 1986 and was drafted over the period 1981 to 1984. It was a product of its time and did not reflect the perspectives that later established themselves. In the early 1990s the then Minister of Commerce appointed a committee to review the Central Bank Act, chaired by Professor Ágúst Einarsson, the current Dean of the Faculty of Economics and Business Administration. Following the committee’s work the Minister of Commerce proposed a bill to parliament for a new Central Bank Act which entailed sweeping changes from the 1986 Act, including what are now considered to be many of the necessary elements of central bank legislation. However, the bill was not adopted by parliament.  In May this year parliament passed a new Central Bank Act with the approval of all 56 members who were present for voting on the bill. A detailed account of the main changes from earlier legislation has been given in the Central Bank’s publications. See i.a. the Central Bank of Iceland’s Monetary Bulletin 2001/3 I shall only mention here that a single target was set for the Central Bank, i.e. to promote price stability. With the Prime Minister’s approval, the Bank was also authorised to specify a numerical inflationary target. The Bank was granted full independence to apply its instruments in order to achieve its main objective. Its financial independence was increased by precluding in law treasury access to short-term funding with the Central Bank, which had previously been precluded with an agreement between the Minister of Finance and the Bank. Provisions on transparency and accountability towards the Government and general public were made more focused.  As I mentioned before, one of the Central Bank’s main objectives is to contribute towards an active and secure financial system, or financial stability as it is often known. In recent years central banks in many countries have been increasingly devoting themselves to monitoring financial stability. This development is partly the product of financial market liberalisation and the deregulation of capital movements, and partly a response to shocks which have struck many countries, both currency shocks and banking system setbacks. Examples include the troubles encountered by banks in Finland, Norway and Sweden a decade ago and the crises that hit Asia and Latin America in the latter part of the 1990s. The Central Bank of Iceland has now built up a new organisational department, the Financial Stability Department, which has the main role of monitoring factors affecting financial stability. Twice a year the Bank publishes articles on this topic in its quarterly Monetary Bulletin, an annual main study in May and a shorter account in November. In addition, the Central Bank and Financial Supervisory Authority maintain close and productive cooperation, each seeking to ensure the security of the Icelandic financial system in its respective way.  Inflation targeting  To return to monetary policy itself, we should recall the joint declaration on the inflation target and changed monetary policy which was issued on March 27 by the Government and the Central Bank of Iceland. See the Central Bank of Iceland’s Monetary Bulletin 2001/2 With this declaration, the monetary framework was changed and inflation targeting was adopted, whereby the fixed exchange rate with fluctuation limits was replaced by a floating exchange rate. The inflation target was set at 2½%, measured as the twelve-month rise in the CPI. The declaration stated that if inflation deviated by more than 1½% from this target the Bank was obliged to bring it back within the tolerance limits as soon as possible. At the same time the Bank would be obliged to submit a report to the Government, which would be made public, stating the reason for the deviation, its planned response and the length of time that it expected to take to bring inflation back within the range. Since inflation was somewhat above the target when the declaration was made, the upper tolerance limit was set for 6% in 2001 and 4½% in 2002. Despite the abolition of the exchange rate fluctuation range, the Central Bank reserved the right to intervene in the interbank market for foreign exchange by buying and selling currency if it deemed this necessary in order to contribute towards attaining the inflation target, or if it viewed 
 BIS Review 95/2001 3 exchange rate swings as a threat to financial stability. In effect, this new policy was ratified with the new Central Bank Act.  The inflation target policy makes great professional demands upon the Central Bank. Although it was introduced at fairly short notice, the Bank had prepared itself for a conceivable change in the monetary framework for some time beforehand. An important aspect of the new policy is the Bank’s commitment to produce and publish inflation forecasts four times a year, projecting at least two years ahead. The Bank already had considerable experience of inflation forecasting and our studies have shown that it is no less capable in this field than other central banks that follow comparable policies. This success has been achieved through ambitious professional and theoretical work which is one of the Bank’s main focuses. We became aware that other central banks following the same kind of policy had noted and commented on how carefully Iceland had prepared for the introduction of inflation targeting. It is aimed to strengthen the Central Bank’s research and theoretical work still further, and it is worth pointing out that the new legislation specifically states that it should undertake economic research relating to its tasks.  Inflation targeting establishes itself  Inflation targeting policies have established themselves in recent years, with a correspondingly large reduction in the number of countries which apply policies based on fixed but adjustable exchange rates, or exchange rates within a fluctuation range. The reason is not least that it proved increasingly difficult to adhere to a fixed exchange rate policy in a world of deregulated capital movements. It could be said that prevailing opinion identified only two possible exchange rate options: a floating exchange rate or a completely fixed one, for example through membership of a currency union, unilateral adoption of some other currency or establishment of a currency board. The new policy has produced good results and is applied in countries including Sweden, Norway, the UK, Australia and New Zealand, along with several countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa. It can also be argued that the European Central Bank partly follows the same kind of policy.  From all the above it is clear that the Central Bank of Iceland has undertaken the major responsibility of ensuring price stability, which in the sense used in the joint declaration by the Government and Central Bank means a twelve-month rise in the CPI of 2½%. It is not the Central Bank’s role to ensure a specific rate of growth or level of employment, since its instruments are incapable of having any impact on them in the long run. However, it is acknowledged that ensuring price stability creates vital preconditions for economic growth and prosperity.  Inflation increased substantially this year and in June it passed outside the tolerance limits as defined in the March declaration. According to the Central Bank’s inflation forecast published in early August, the outlook that inflation would rapidly decelerate towards the end of this year and the beginning of the next, then would move inside the tolerance limits in the middle of next year, and the 2½% target would be reached in mid-2003. The forecast was based on the main assumptions of an unchanged exchange rate from the forecast day, a cooling of the economy and no wage rises in excess of agreements that had already been negotiated. The Central Bank will publish its next inflation forecast on November 8.  Tight monetary stance The Central Bank has applied a tight monetary stance for some time now, as reflected in its high policy interest rate. The policy rate is the rate of interest applying to the Central Bank’s repo transactions with credit institutions, i.e. interest on liquid funds that they borrow from the Bank. Monetary policy has been the subject of lively debate in recent weeks and months and the Bank has been under steady pressure to cut interest rates. As the Central Bank has repeatedly underlined, its viewpoint has been that lowering interest rates entails a greater risk than waiting for a while for tangible signs that the assumptions behind the August inflation forecast will hold good. It is crucial to bring inflation down swiftly, since it goes without saying that inflation is the worst enemy of both households and businesses. A tight monetary stance inevitably has consequences which are sometimes painful for households and businesses. There is nothing to be done about that. Households and businesses alike must accept the consequences of their actions and it is obvious that many of them have simply gone to excesses in their consumption, investments and borrowing in recent years. They will need to reduce their spending, cut costs and put their finances in order. That cannot be avoided.  
 4 BIS Review 95/2001 I also point out that the current account deficit is very large. Even though it has shrunk rapidly this year and will foreseeably continue to decrease substantially next year, it is still very large both in a historical and an international context. In order to achieve acceptable macroeconomic balance, a contraction in national income is unavoidable. Lower inflation and improved macroeconomic balance will also create a climate in which the nominal exchange rate of the króna can begin to appreciate.  Furthermore, I underline that interest rates definitely do have the same effect in Iceland as in other countries, and that our research and studies indicate beyond any doubt that the impact of monetary policy in Iceland is similar to that elsewhere. However, people need to understand exactly what monetary policy is capable of, and what it is not.  Transparency  Finally, I shall turn to issues which are no less important than those I have already mentioned. Greater central bank independence in recent years has been accompanied by much more stringent requirements about transparency and accountability towards the government and general public. This means that central banks should operate as openly as possible. They must give clear accounts of their policies and assessments of the economic and monetary situation and outlook, and explain in detail the assumptions underlying their monetary decisions. All this serves the purpose of informing the government and public as fully as possible about monetary policy, providing them with a basis for understanding it and, depending on the circumstances, making an independent evaluation of it. One way in which the Central Bank fulfils this function is with the publication of its quarterly Monetary Bulletin. Indeed, the new legislation states that the Central Bank shall, at no less frequent than quarterly intervals, publish reports on its monetary policy and monetary, exchange rate and foreign exchange developments and its measures in these areas. The Central Bank shall also issue an annual report in which it explains in detail its activities. In its annual report, the Bank outlines various other aspects of its operations and publishes a detailed itemised account of its operating expenses, more detailed, I believe, than any other institution in Iceland. To cite an example of the importance of transparency these days, in autumn 1999 the International Monetary Fund published guidelines for transparency of monetary policy which it firmly urged all member countries to adopt. The Central Bank of Iceland can definitely be said to fulfil these rules. By providing detailed descriptions of its policies and assessments of the economic and monetary situation and outlook, the Bank also contributes to professional and informed public debate on these issues. By the same token, greater responsibility is imposed on other commentators, since they have less scope for claiming lack of information. The Central Bank wholeheartedly welcomes professional public debate about the Bank and its policies, and takes part in such dialogue where it sees grounds for doing so. Lively, professional dialogue produces even greater understanding of the character and objectives of monetary policy. I hope to see students and teachers at the Faculty of Economics and Business Administration becoming involved in these issues in the future. There is always scope for new opinions in debates on current affairs. The debate in recent weeks partly reflects the fact that people are still absorbing the major changes that were made to the monetary policy framework this year.  A wide range of cooperation has taken place between the Central Bank and the University of Iceland in recent years. The Central Bank has supported research projects in its areas of activity, and published the findings in its journals. As the importance of monetary policy becomes increasingly recognised in economic policy implementation, it is vital for the University’s Faculty of Economics and Business Administration to give a high profile to monetary economics, both theoretical and practical. Monetary policy is transmitted through numerous markets and it is vital for people engaged on both the analytical and business sides to have a firm grounding in this field. Similarly, it is important for the dialogue on monetary policy to be conducted as far as possible on a firm professional basis. The Central Bank is eager to cooperate more closely with the faculty and other bodies on strengthening university level teaching in monetary economics and central banking. Ladies and Gentlemen: In this talk I have described the changes made in Iceland’s monetary policy implementation and new attitudes to monetary policy in much of the world. The main task of most central banks is to promote price stability, because it is recognised that by doing so they make the best contribution to economic growth and prosperity. Under the new monetary framework, the Central Bank of Iceland has been 
 BIS Review 95/2001 5 provided with the same mechanisms as central banks in most industrialised countries for creating such an environment. The Central Bank takes this role seriously and will strive to fulfil the conditions laid down by the new legislation and in the joint declaration which it issued with the Government on March 27. The global economic climate has been dramatically transformed in recent years and is still changing in the wake of the terrorist attacks on the USA on September 11. It is quite obvious that we in Iceland do not carry much weight in global economic terms. However, the situation in our immediate environment, especially among our main trading partner countries, is crucial to us. At the moment we are having a somewhat stormy ride. In this new environment, the role of everyone involved in economic policy-making in Iceland will be to act in a disciplined and responsible fashion. Doing so will be the main way to contribute to economic growth and prosperity in Iceland.  
 BIS Review 94/2001 1 Zeti Akhtar Aziz: The economic outlook for Malaysia in the aftermath of 11 September Special luncheon address by Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz, Governor of Bank Negara Malaysia, at the CFO Summit 2001 - The Economic Outlook in the Aftermath of 11 September, Kuala Lumpur, 8 November 2001. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen, Introduction Even before the events of 11 September the global economy was already experiencing a slowdown in growth. Although there were emerging signs that the downturn was beginning to level off, the events of September 11, have increased the uncertainty of this prospect. The issue before us today is thus to what extent these developments affected our own growth prospects? To what extent can we mitigate the adverse implications on our domestic sector. And most of all, what can each of us do in the current environment to better weather the economic slowdown?  It is my pleasure to be here today to have this opportunity to share some thoughts with you on the implications of these developments on the Malaysian economy.  Current global economic environment  After a decade of rapid expansion, the US economy entered a period of cyclical slowdown beginning in mid-2000, with GDP growth in the US slowing sharply from 8.3% in the first quarter of 2000 to less than a half percent in the second quarter of 2001. Given that the US absorbs about one-fifth of world exports, the slowdown has had far reaching implications on world growth. The sharper than anticipated US slowdown before 11 September was due mainly to the adjustments in the technology sector leading to cyclical declines in business investment and the unwinding of inventories accumulated during the boom period. However, consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of GDP in the United States and activity in the housing sector generally was still holding up prior to 11 September. This trend was supported by interest rate reductions by 300 basis points between January and August 2001 and the tax rebates. In addition, adjustments in asset prices were seen relatively moderate.  While the events of 11 September has affected business and consumer confidence, we need to distinguish between the immediate term effects and the longer-term prospects for recovery and growth. On an industry-specific basis, the impact is visibly seen in the tourism and travel-related industries and in the insurance sector. In the immediate term, it can be expected that activity will be dampened and some scaling back of expenditure and activity will take place. The unemployment rate has also been seen to rise and the recently released National Association of Purchasing Managers (NAPM) index, a short-term leading indicator of the US economy, showed a significant decline. Nevertheless, the preliminary estimates of US third quarter GDP show that the decline was somewhat less than expected. This allows for some cautious optimism. The US automobile industry also recorded its largest ever monthly sales in October as consumers responded to promotions by auto companies, indicating that the events of 11 September have not entirely curbed consumers’ propensity to spend. Furthermore, concerns for a sharp weakening in the US dollar have receded resulting in relative stability in the major exchange rates. Amidst these developments, there has however also been a simultaneous slowdown in the other major industrial economies resulting in downward revisions in the growth for Europe and Japan.  While these reports are hardly comforting, it is important to keep our assessments in perspective. The current external environment reflect reactions in the immediate aftermath of the attacks. Of importance will be how the consumers would behave in the coming months. The answer to this question is, in large part, still remains uncertain. Much depends on how households in the industrialised economies assess their near-term job and income prospects, and how these assessments evolve over time as events in global environment continue to unfold.  
 2 BIS Review 94/2001 The final outcome would depend not only on analysis of the plethora of economic data before us, but also on the policies emerging in the US, Europe and also the regional economies. Of course, the main factor would be consumer and investor responses to these policy changes. In the US in particular, the Fed has eased monetary policy further immediately following 11 September, bringing interest rates to their lowest level since the 1960s. The US Congress has approved a series of fiscal packages, bringing the total fiscal spending to about 15% of GDP. The prompt and co-ordinated monetary policy response across the globe demonstrates the commitment to support global growth and avoid a tailspin reaction that could lead into recession. In this light, while further economic weakness could be expected in the near term, positive consumer responses to policy changes would point to more positive medium-term prospects.  Given these emerging indicators, there is a preponderance of views that the current economic slowdown would not be prolonged, that recovery can be expected to occur in the second half of 2002. Other positive factors relate to the sharp inventory adjustment that has taken place which will allow an upturn in demand to be promptly translated into higher production activities. At the same time, structural changes at the corporate level including world wide cost-cutting measures would provide the foundations for a sustained recovery in global growth.  Ladies and Gentlemen, Weathering the slowdown  Being a highly open economy, Malaysia will continue to be affected by external developments. While we may not be able to directly reduce the impact of these developments on our external sector we can compensate for them by encouraging domestic activity. On the domestic front, Malaysia has over the years has built strong foundations that places us in a position to weather this current slowdown. The events of 11 September have not altered our positive economic fundamentals and our foundations. This will continue to provide businesses with the platform to sustain their activity.  Firstly, structural adjustments undertaken over the recent decades and the more recent measures taken since the crisis have resulted in a more diversified and productive economic base that is more resilient to external shocks. The recent strong performance of the services sector and positive growth in the agriculture and mining sectors in the first half of this year contributed to mitigating to some extent the decline in electronics exports. For the services sector the domestic content is high and several services sub-sectors are not linked to the manufacturing sector. These sectors continue to respond positively to domestic policies. Even within the manufacturing sector, domestic-oriented industries contribute about one-third of the total output of the sector. These sectors have benefited from the fiscal stimulus package and the low interest rate environment.  Second, the Government’s fiscal position remains strong, with outstanding debt being contained at 37% of GDP and the debt service to GDP ratio of 2.8%. The increased fiscal deficit has been financed from non-inflationary sources. Expenditure allocations have also been targeted to projects with immediate and high spin-off effects.  Third, inflationary pressures are contained, thus allowing monetary policy to remain accommodative. Our track record of low and stable inflation has also encouraged capital formation through a high savings rate.  Fourth, the current account surpluses continue to remain large thereby lending strength to the balance of payments. The current account of the balance of payments is expected to register a surplus of 7.9% of GNP in 2001. The decline in exports has been offset by corresponding reduction in imports as well as payments in services. This surplus is expected to continue to serve as a buffer to finance volatility in short-term flows.  Fifth, our external reserves have continued its rising trend and are ample and unencumbered. The external reserves level have now breached the end-2000 level. The figures for 31 October shows the reserve level is now US$30.2 billion. This reserve position is adequate to finance 4.9 months of retained imports and 6.3 times the short-term external debt.  Sixth, our external debt levels are low, reducing our vulnerability to the current slowdown in external demand. Total external debt was equal to 49.5% of GNP as at end-June, significantly lower than the peak of 64% recorded at end-1997. The overall debt service ratio is also low at only 5%, even with the slower export growth. In addition, the short-term debt component is low, accounting for 11% of total 
 BIS Review 94/2001 3 external debt and 18% of external reserves holdings, giving Malaysia one of the most favourable positions among regional economies.  Seventh, the Malaysian banking sector has been strengthened and is more resilient following the recent restructuring and consolidation that has been achieved. This is reflected by the higher capitalisation ratios, improved profitability and asset quality. The strong RWCR of 12.5% (end-September) and core capital ratio of 10.6% provides adequate cushion to absorb increases of NPLs from the economic slowdown. The latest stress tests indicate that the RWCR of the banking system is expected to remain well above the BIS minimum of 8% in view of the strong capitalisation of the banking institutions. Also domestic private debt to GDP has declined from the peak of 152% in 1998 to current level of 133% mid-2001.  Eighth, while we have seen an increase in retrenchment in the labour market, unemployment levels remain low. Of importance is that the educated labour force has the mobility to adapt to a changing environment. Efforts are focused on upgrading the quality of the education system. While some labour dislocation can be expected, efforts are being directed to encourage redeployment to alternate activities.  Ninth, our physical infrastructure is one of the best developed in the Asian region, facilitating production, trade and communication.  Tenth, the political stability and institutional arrangements in place allow for rapid, effective and co-ordinated decision making to deal with ongoing developments. It allows for prompt response and strategic planning in managing the management of the economy. Accelerated corporate restructuring involving some of the largest corporations in the country is also underway with increased attention being focussed on enhancing corporate governance.  Despite a more difficult external environment, these solid foundations have remained intact and will continue to provide Malaysia the ability to ride out this current phase of slowdown while ensuring our long-term growth prospects. More specifically, it will provide us with the agility to adapt, adjust and respond to changes in economic conditions, changes in comparative advantage and changes in opportunities that the current environment accords. The track record has shown that over the decades the economy has been able to shift to new areas of growth with changing opportunities and changes in comparative advantage. Prudent policies pursued and careful economic management have also accorded us with a high degree of flexibility in policy options in responding to the new challenges that have emerged. Our resilience is on account of the combination of our strong foundations, and the high degree of agility and flexibility of policy to respond to this difficult period thereby enhancing our ability to weather the current slowdown. Ladies and Gentlemen,  Of importances is therefore to look beyond the immediate term. Our history shows that the economic downturns in 1985, in 1998 and in the current period have been externally driven. As a highly open economy we will continue to be vulnerable to external developments. In these periods of adverse external conditions, domestic policy responses have however, been successful in restoring growth. The strategy adopted has been to be pre-emptive and to front load the policy initiatives. In addition, these efforts have generally been supported by further efforts to strengthen the economic base further and the restructuring and reform of the financial system. Despite the severity of the 1998 contraction, Malaysia recovered within a year with strengthened economic fundamentals. All this was possible given the strong foundations of our economy and financial system. All too often this has been taken for granted.  In the current period, the focus of policy is on promoting domestic sources of growth. It has so far allowed us to mitigate to some extent the adverse effects on the slowdown in the export-oriented manufacturing sector. In the first half-year, we saw positive growth recorded in the agriculture and mining sectors, construction sector as well as domestic-market oriented manufacturing industries. Going forward, pro-growth policies are targeted at improving consumer disposable income, increasing expenditure skills enhancement and improving infrastructure. The impact of these policies together with low interest rates would continue to filter into the domestic economy. Should global demand strengthen, Malaysia will be well positioned to see a strengthening in the second half of the next year.  The Government has therefore directed policy measures to strengthen domestic sources of growth. The expected impact of the US economic slowdown was already built into the fiscal stimulus package contained in the 2001 Budget and now in the 2002 Budget. Projects identified under the fiscal 
 4 BIS Review 94/2001 stimulus include those with high spill-over effects, low import content and short gestation period. Hence, higher allocations have been given to social services, education, training, low cost housing and health services.  In early 2001, amidst signs that the slowdown in the US economy was more severe than earlier expectations, further measures were taken in March 2001. The measures included an additional fiscal stimulus of RM3 billion and reduction in employees’ share of EPF contributions by 2% for one year are aimed at promoting consumer spending and overall economic activity.  Following the heightened uncertainty after the events of 11 September, an additional stimulus package amounting to RM4.3 billion was announced prior to the Budget 2002. This early announcement was aimed at providing enough lead time for higher expenditure to sustain growth. The focus of allocations has also been also skewed towards small projects for which funds would be promptly be disbursed.  Most recently, the Budget 2002 presented to Parliament in October reinforced the strategy to diversify further the economic structure by increasing the significance of domestic sources of growth. The Budget included measures to further promote economic activity through increasing domestic demand while strengthening the private sector’s resilience and competitiveness. In addition, to higher development expenditure, the focus of Budget 2002 was directed at raising disposable incomes via tax cuts and bonuses as a more direct measure to stimulate private consumption. Other fiscal measures and allowances were also aimed at providing further incentives to businesses.  The question has often been raised concerns the sustainability of the fiscal deficit and its potential for long-term risks to the economy. Previous prudent policies has accorded the Government the flexibility for this expansionary policy. The deficits has been financed from non-inflationary sources and the high rate of domestic savings has enabled access to such financing without crowding out the private sector. Prudent policies have also kept debt levels low. Debt levels, in particular the external debt position remains low. This continues to be an important strength of the Malaysian economy. Secondly, excess liquidity in the domestic money market and strong demand for Government securities means that new issues can be raised at low interest cost. The debt servicing would therefore not be a burden to future generations. Thirdly, the expenditure is well-targeted and has high potential to achieve the desired objectives. And finally, the plan is for a consolidation of the nation’s fiscal position with a reduced deficit in the year 2002 with a balanced position envisaged during the period of the Eight Malaysia Plan.  On the monetary front, the strategy has been to front load the monetary measures to provide a positive environment for the private sector. During the recent period, the already historically low lending rates have been effective in stimulating domestic demand both in terms of rising loans for residential property, passenger cars and consumer durables and for investments in the manufacturing and services sector. Interest rates were not raised with the growth in 1999 and when growth was exceptionally strong in 2000. Monetary policy during this period continued to be directed to support domestic activity in an environment of low inflation.  Following the increased uncertainty after the events of 11 September, the 3-month intervention rate was reduced by 50 basis points to 5% on 20 September to support domestic economic activities in the light of heightened potential for a more rapid economic slowdown. Currently, lending rates in Malaysia are now among the lowest in the region. In addition, specific measures have also been undertaken to increase volume and access to financing by SMEs. All these measures have contributed to positive growth in bank lending.  While addressing short-term developments, policy also continues to focus on long-term areas to strengthen further our foundations in the financial sector. With the successful completion of the consolidation of the banking sector, it became necessary to address the remaining overhang of corporate leverage. In this context, a series of aggressive measures has been taken to expedite the process of resolving the outstanding corporate debt of large corporations. Important changes has been implemented in the management and implementation of this corporate sector restructuring.  Similarly, the implementation of new rules with regard to corporate governance has also ensured improvement in standards and practices in the corporate sector. The Malaysian Code of Corporate Governance has been implemented and various changes have been effected to the Securities Commission Act 1993 and to the KLSE Listing Requirements to strengthen the regulatory and statutory framework for corporate governance.  
 BIS Review 94/2001 5 These developments in the economy and financial markets serve the ultimate goal to create an economy that is responsive to change and resilient to external shocks thereby increasing our prospects for long-term growth.  Conclusion Ladies and Gentlemen, Malaysia has a track record of ensuring that the economic environment is supportive of business activities. Policies that have been implemented have demonstrated our commitment to preserve the value of both domestic and foreign investments in Malaysia. While our foundations have provided us with the agility to adjust, and the flexibility of policy to respond the resilience to weather the current slowdown, it is recognised that we need to continue to strengthen our economic structure need to continue with determined perseverance so as to enable us to effectively manage external shocks without weakening our economic foundation.  While all these may provide some assurance, this will by no means ensure the desired results. The reactions and responses by the business and consumers are vital to the success of these policies. This requires an ability for a more balanced approach and distinguishing the longer-term economic prospects that are not biased by short-term concerns from the immediate term conditions. Within the context of domestic conditions, business must also be aware of global developments and the more competitive external environment. In this regard, we need to strive to increase efficiency and productivity to enhance our own competitiveness. Despite the current weaker conditions, businesses should not hold back making the strategic investments to ensure that they are well-positioned to benefit from an upturn when it occurs. Any hindrances to further progress should be eliminated and new business segments for growth should be sought out. Research and development expenditure should continue as this will be an important true sustainable source of competitive advantage in the global economy. An integral part of this strategy is the need for enhanced training and upgrading of human resources.  Bankers, in the meantime, should not overreact to the weaker short-term environment, and should continue to provide access to financing for viable projects to support the growth process. A more constructive approach needs to be taken by the financial institutions to assist borrowers, on their own initiative, to reschedule and restructure the loans of viable borrowers. Finally, consumers should spend productively and contribute to sustain domestic demand.  To conclude, the Government has acted swiftly to the global slowdown and the recent events in the US. The Government has done its part. It is therefore the private sector response that will be the key determining element in how Malaysia will weather the current challenging environment.  
 BIS Review 94/2001 1 Joseph Yam: Developing and positioning Hong Kong’s bond market Speech by Mr Joseph Yam, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, at the Forum on China’s Government Securities Market in the New Century, Hong Kong, 19 November 2001. *      *      * Introduction It is a great pleasure for me to be here today to share with you Hong Kong’s experience in the development of the bond market and our views on the future prospects of that market. Before I go into the subject, however, I would like to congratulate our friends from the Mainland on their superb efforts leading to China’s accession to the World Trade Organisation. The signing of the necessary documents a week or so ago marks the successful conclusion of 15 years of sheer hard work and determination, and the beginning of a new era in which the Mainland embraces globalisation in earnest, to the long-term benefit of China, the region and the world. I have no doubt that Hong Kong, in particular, will benefit tremendously from this. The international business community has been positioning itself, here in Hong Kong a free and open economy at the doorstep of the Mainland and an integral part of China to take advantage of the many opportunities that will open up in the years to come. As the international financial centre of China, Hong Kong is particularly looking forward to the opportunities arising from a much quicker pace of financial liberalisation in the Mainland after accession to WTO. Put simply, notwithstanding the gloom of global recession, the future of Hong Kong is bright. Bond market development Let me turn quickly now to bond market development. There are a few points that I would like to make immediately. The first point is a basic and obvious one, so obvious that it is often overlooked. This is that the bond market is a channel of financial intermediation for the purpose of mobilising savings into productive investment that promotes economic growth and development. There is a need for those involved in the bond market those responsible for its development and those making a profit or a living from it to be frequently reminded of this basic purpose. This is particularly so when considering the introduction of sophisticated products derivatives and the like. I have nothing against sophisticated financial engineering, or against the engineers being well remunerated, provided that the regulators and the market participants, both at the wholesale and retail levels, are capable of appreciating and coping with the associated risks. This may not often be the case. It is possible that, while these products theoretically make the market more efficient, in terms of spreading and managing risks, in practice the risks may be magnified, to the extent of creating systemic instability and disrupting the crucial flow of funds through that basic and important channel of financial intermediation. The second, again rather obvious, point is that the bond market is one of three broad channels of financial intermediation, along with the better developed, at least in this region, banking and equity markets. Less obvious, perhaps, is the importance of ensuring that the bond market commands a degree of robustness and efficiency capable of channelling suddenly enlarged flows of savings to investment that may be diverted from one or both of the other two channels as a result of crises there. These channels should reinforce each other in order that financial intermediation and therefore economic growth can continue in times of financial stress. We have witnessed how the US bond market helped substitute for bank intermediation in the credit crunch of the late eighties. We have also witnessed how the US banking system in turn played the back-up role when the bond market failed to intermediate funds as a result of the LTCM crisis, thus minimising the disruption to economic growth. In contrast, the less developed bond market in this region failed to provide the necessary backup when banks in a number of jurisdictions faced difficulties. Funds simply dried up and there were debilitating economic and financial consequences. Bond market development in this region is thus an urgent task. This task is, however, hindered by a third point, which is that the three channels of financial intermediation are in competition with each other. This is so to the extent that the development of the bond market, at least in this region, may have been inhibited by the rather more efficient banking and equity markets. Understandably, vested interests may have exerted a degree of influence to this effect, and this is one reason why the bond market, where it is underdeveloped, may have to be 
 2 BIS Review 94/2001 considered as a public good that justifies the involvement of the official sector in its development. This is indeed the case in Hong Kong, but it has come about only after a long period of agonising over whether such deliberate government involvement, in the freest economy in the world and without a continuing need for government borrowing to finance budget deficits, was appropriate. Perhaps with greater institutional integration in the provision of financial services, the lack of enthusiastic support in the development of the bond market from service providers in the alternative channels of financial intermediation will in time be transformed into co-operation or even initiative, thus obviating the need for government involvement. In the meantime, however, and having regard to the degree of financial sophistication of most economies in the region, some official sector involvement in bond market development seems justified. This might be in the form of facilitating development of the market infrastructure, ironing out administrative obstacles, helping with education, etc, rather than more direct or obvious forms of subsidy. Fourth, bond market financial intermediation need not be narrowly confined to just a domestic phenomenon. It can and should take on an international dimension. Through facilitating the inward investment of foreign savings, the source of funding for much needed domestic investments can be tremendously enlarged. This would also enhance the overall efficiency in the international allocation of funds, to economies that can provide a higher return commensurate with the risks involved. An economy with capital controls should therefore plan for the eventual internationalisation of the bond market, even though the associated financial liberalisation process can be quite a risky one. But risks are to be managed and not avoided, and the benefits of open markets far outweigh the costs in terms of financial instability. I can confirm this, even with the unpleasant experience of the financial turmoil of 1998. Free and open markets impose a valuable discipline on policy makers that is to be welcomed in the long-term interest of the people they serve. Fifth, and turning to the actual bond market development issues, there is a need to adopt a comprehensive approach. We should address the demand and supply sides, the environment in which they interact to discover the prices for the debt instruments, including market making arrangements and the determination of benchmarks, and the market infrastructure, including payment, clearing and settlement systems. Focusing on these issues individually, and this is the sixth point, there is usually strong latent demand for debt instruments, particularly in economies with a high savings rate. Between the low risk-return bank deposits and the high risk-return equity market, there should be a risk-return profile that fits that of debt instruments. The trick is how this latent demand, involuntarily trapped at the two ends of the spectrum, can be brought out and satisfied. Investor education and the creation of a retail network to market debt will help. But the costs of the latter can be quite substantial and possibly prohibitive, particularly in a low interest environment, if the retail banking system cannot be relied upon to support this wholeheartedly (which I am glad to add is not the case in Hong Kong). Furthermore, when government debt is used by the banking system as assets for acquiring liquidity support, the demand from the banks may easily crowd out the retail demand. Nevertheless, the institutionalisation of savings, if this could be organised, through for example the introduction of professionally managed provident fund schemes, should be quite effective in harnessing this demand. This would, at the same time, enable the retail demand to be transformed into a level of sophistication that, with the appropriate supply response, will greatly enhance the efficiency and robustness of the debt market as a channel of financial intermediation. The seventh point I wish to make concerns the supply side. For an economy with a continuing need to finance budget deficits there is of course a natural supply of debt instruments, unless, like Hong Kong, it has surpluses to spend. But the story does not end there. It is essential for this supply of government debt to be organised in such a way as to enable demands of different natures to be met. This requires a well structured, transparent and predictable programme, with a wide maturity spectrum. Thus, my eighth point concerns the interaction of demand and supply to discover price reliably and efficiently. This is relevant to both the primary and the secondary markets, and is best achieved respectively through well-structured tender and market making arrangements. These may involve last resort support from the regulators. There are many successful models of such arrangements and there is ample literature on them. The common objective is to ensure a high level of liquidity to facilitate reliable and efficient price discovery, thereby providing a benchmark yield curve upon which other issuers can confidently and accurately price their own, hopefully much bigger volume of, private sector debt. That is what we should aim for in the development of the bond market if it is to play a meaningful role in financial intermediation. 
 BIS Review 94/2001 3 My ninth point concerns the market infrastructure, and by that I mean the payment, clearing and settlement systems. This is regrettably the most neglected aspect in the development of financial markets, not just the bond market. Imagine how general investor confidence would be damaged if the financial instrument that an investor had bought got lost in delivery. Or if he had to wait a considerable amount of time to receive it after he had paid over the money, or if the money that he had paid over was not received by the vendor. I have often pointed out that governments spend huge amounts of money and efforts building the physical infrastructure to move people and goods around safely and efficiently, but that not even a small fraction of those resources is given to moving money and financial instruments around safely and efficiently. The result, very simply, is inefficient financial intermediation. Money is not mobilised to its full potential, and economic progress is undermined. The financial infrastructure that we want, to use a bit of market jargon, is one that enables, as soon as possible after dealing, RTGS DvP, namely, real time gross settlement with delivery versus payment for transactions in financial instruments (RTGS PvP or payment versus payment for foreign exchange transactions). This is what we have achieved in Hong Kong. Hong Kong’s bond market Let me turn now to the development of Hong Kong’s bond market and share with you our experience. As I said earlier, after agonising over this for a long period, behind the convenient argument that if there is a need for a market to develop it will develop by itself without the urging of government, we decided to get involved. The Exchange Fund Bills and Notes programme was subsequently introduced at the beginning of 1990. But the primary justification deployed then was the need for a money market instrument, targeted at the banks as customers, to facilitate monetary management rather than the development of the bond market. Nevertheless, we adopted a comprehensive approach to the task. We put together an innovative market making system that virtually guaranteed liquidity by allowing a handful of market makers to go short in any issue of our paper for as long as their overall holdings, with suitable haircuts, are long. This has now been replaced by an even more robust arrangement whereby short positions in particular issues are squared at the end of the day through overnight repos against other issues. We also built a paperless clearing, settlement and custodian system operated by our Central MoneyMarkets Unit (CMU), which also provided similar services to the larger volume of private sector debt. And, at the same time as we introduced our Real Time Gross Settlement payment system at the end of 1996, we moved on to DvP, or delivery versus payment, with real time and end of day capabilities. Meanwhile, the supply of debt has steadily been increasing. Corporate bond issuance has increased by 300 per cent in the last decade or so. We also have an increasing variety of products, including mortgage-backed securities and retail products brought to the market by the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation. All have been readily absorbed by the latent demand to which I also referred earlier. And with the recent introduction of the Mandatory Provident Fund schemes, the demand for bonds has been building up quickly. In 1991, the bond market has a size of only about 4 per cent of GDP. This has grown to 35 per cent last year, and the share of private sector debt is now at around 77 per cent. We have come a long way but there is still a lot of room for expansion, as evidenced by comparisons with bond markets in the G-3 economies. But our bond market has grown big enough and has been robust enough for it to provide some meaningful back-up in times of financial stress. In 1998-99 when, as property prices fell sharply and the financial turmoil led to deteriorating asset quality, the banks adopted a conservative stance in their lending, corporate bond issuance increased significantly. Positioning for the future Our present pre-occupation in the development of the Hong Kong bond market is to bring in the international dimension. As an international financial centre, we of course aspire to play a role in international financial intermediation. To achieve this, our efforts have been concentrating on two fronts. First is the establishment of bilateral linkages of the appropriate elements of our financial infrastructure with those of other jurisdictions wherever it is compatible to do so, and whenever the counterparts are willing. This basically is for the purpose of facilitating the cross border investments in debt securities. Our CMU was linked up with Euroclear and Clearstream in 1994, with the Central Securities Depositories in Australia in 1997, New Zealand in 1998 and Korea in 1999. We also have a standing offer in the region to link up our Hong Kong dollar RTGS payment system with other currencies with RTGS capability so as to achieve payment versus payment in foreign exchange transactions, in other words, to eliminate Herstatt risk. But I must confess that, for the former, there 
 4 BIS Review 94/2001 has not been a lot of traffic, and for the latter, there have been no takers, so far. I hope this is merely a reflection of the fact that the financial infrastructures of others are not yet ready for these types of linkages. But I really cannot see a more robust arrangement than what we have proposed for promoting and facilitating the international financial intermediation that is found so lacking in the region. But we shall be patient. The other front that we have been working on is the replication of our Hong Kong dollar financial infrastructure for the US dollar, the popular currency for international financial intermediation. We have late last year completed this for the debt clearing system and the RTGS payment system. We have linked these to the corresponding systems in the Hong Kong dollar financial infrastructure. I won’t bore you with the technical details. What this means is that we now have, in this time zone, a robust financial infrastructure for US dollar transactions that can accommodate, among other things, a US dollar bond market in this region. You do not have to wait until New York opens before you can achieve finality of settlement of your US dollar transactions in bonds or, indeed, in any US dollar denominated financial assets, if they are lodged with our CMU in Hong Kong. Furthermore, any Asian currency with an RTGS payment system, if it is linked up with our system, will be able to achieve PvP or payment versus payment for the two currencies in real time. We already have PvP for Hong Kong dollar versus US dollar transactions the first in the world. I have, as you are probably aware, drifted into the positioning of the Hong Kong bond market for meeting future challenges. We have, through our efforts in the development of the financial infrastructure, put ourselves in a position to play the ideal host to the bond market of the region, or of this time zone. I hope members of our financial community can leverage on this position of strength and bring issuers and investors of US dollar bonds to Hong Kong. Further development of the bond market is largely in their hands. As central banking officials, we in the Hong Kong Monetary Authority have done what we can appropriately do, in the provision of this public good a robust financial infrastructure. We can, of course, replicate this financial infrastructure for other currencies, and indeed we are currently exploring the possibility of doing so for the other major international currency not domiciled in this time zone the euro. And if this is appropriate, we can also transfer our technology to others through our advisory services. I am, in particular, thinking of the RMB financial infrastructure, which in my opinion requires urgent strengthening, not just for facilitating the development of the RMB bond market, but also for facilitating the many further measures in financial liberalisation following WTO accession. Meanwhile, our US dollar financial infrastructure in Hong Kong, coupled with the market making arrangements that have been well tried for over a decade, and the critical mass of financial institutions, is ideal for the launching of a US dollar bond programme for the Mainland. I understand, of course, that with foreign reserves well exceeding US$ 200 billion, there is arguably little need for the Mainland to raise additional foreign debt. But part of the outstanding foreign debt could be refinanced in Hong Kong through such a programme. Perhaps with a liquid market and a reliable benchmark yield curve established, similar to those of Exchange Fund paper in Hong Kong dollars, the overall borrowing costs could be lowered. This seems worth trying, for the downside risks are minimal and the benefits could be substantial, to the Mainland in terms of potential savings in borrowing and road show costs, and to Hong Kong, in terms of consolidating our position as the regional bond centre. And we are ready to play our part in the development of the RMB bond market in the Mainland, in accordance with the timetable associated with WTO accession, starting, slowly, with the establishment of joint ventures for underwriting and trading, and the development of RMB bond funds and so on. But what we hope for is that, in the fullness of time, the Mainland authorities can come around to accommodating full access to the RMB bond market from Hong Kong. I am sure there will be demand for RMB assets in Hong Kong, if the demand is not there already. I know that this matter, and other issues concerning financial intermediation of the RMB outside of the Mainland, raises complicated issues of capital account controls that need to be resolved cautiously. But I would like to reiterate my view that, with increasing economic integration between Hong Kong and the southern part of the Mainland, some, possibly an increasing degree of, mobility of capital between the two economies is inevitable. The choice is whether to channel properly this flow of capital openly and, if considered desirable, in a controlled manner, and to monitor it, or to leave it in the dark, when ironically it is performing the useful role in promoting the efficient use of capital in the two economies. There is a great deal that the free and open financial markets of Hong Kong can offer in RMB financial intermediation, and I am delighted that, at this important point in China’s economic and financial development, one of the themes of this conference is how this can be effected. I wish you a very fruitful discussion during the rest of this forum. Thank you. 
 BIS Review 93/2001 1 Klaus Liebscher: Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) - an important pillar of stability for the International Financial System Speech by Mr Klaus Liebscher, Governor of the Oesterreichische Nationalbank, at the symposium “The role of international institutions in globalisation”, Centre for the Study of International Institutions CSI, Innsbruck, 16 November 2001. *      *      * It was with great pleasure that I accepted the invitation to take part in the symposium on “The Role of International Institutions in Globalisation” and to deliver some thoughts about the Economic and Monetary Union and its role in the international financial system.  But first of all I would like to congratulate Dean Prof. Chen and Prof. Socher for their faculty initiatives to set up the “Centre for the Study of International Institutions”. I strongly do hope that this new centre will contribute to a better understanding for the functioning as well as the need of international institutions like the IMF, the Worldbank, the BIS and others safeguarding the economic developments in a world of liberalisation and globalisation. I really do wish you all the success needed for! It has always been the duty of monetary authorities to secure both monetary and financial stability. Yet, issues of monetary and financial stability have moved up prominently on the agenda, due to the growth of financial services, both in volume and in depth, the financial crises of recent years or the terror attacks of September, 11. With the globalisation of capital flows the vulnerability of countries to financial crises has increased. International institutions, especially the IMF, have in recent years played an important role in crisis prevention and crisis management.  The crises in Asia and other regions have directed attention towards the phenomenon of financial contagion both from the side of politicians as well as academics. Through the global network of financial markets a crisis in one part of the world may quickly spread via a chain reaction to other places, with the potential to destabilise the global financial system. These crises have transformed the international agenda: At the global level plans for a new international financial architecture have abounded and the future role of institutions like the IMF and the World Bank has been widely and intensively debated. Prominent economists like Paul Krugman, Joseph Stiglitz, Stan Fischer, Barry Eichengreen and, of course the Meltzer Commission have formulated quite diverse and controversial proposals. In this context I will focus my deliberations to the role of EMU and how the euro can provide for more stability for the International Financial System. EMU represents new opportunities and challenges for financial institutions and markets. Up to now, one can distinguish essentially between four types of stability effects which the euro's arrival has brought: exchange rate stability, price stability, financial stability and fiscal stability. To these four, let me add a fifth stability aspect given that EMU and the euro provide and will provide an anchor of stability for Central and Eastern European Accession Countries. Exchange Rate Stability First, exchange rate stability is directly related to the Single Market for goods and services, as well as development of financial markets in the European Union. The single currency has completely removed exchange rate risks for exporters and importers, debtors and creditors across the 12 countries of the euro area. Cross-border trade, investment and financial transactions are fostered and, in particular, small and medium-sized companies are encouraged to enter the euro area-wide markets. These developments increase competition, improve resource allocation and the investment climate and thus contribute to higher long-term potential growth in the euro area. This - if I may say so - internal "exchange rate" stability aspect has often been overshadowed by the disproportionate interest in US dollar/euro exchange rate. The dollar/euro exchange rate movements have, in fact, been fully in line with the dollar's historical fluctuations vis-à-vis the European currencies prior to the introduction of the euro. More importantly, the weight of the fluctuating part in exchange rate "baskets" is, in all Member States, now much smaller than in the past.  
 2 BIS Review 93/2001 For example, for Austria as a small open economy the external stability of the currency was of prime concern. With the introduction of the euro this has changed significantly because external trade is much less important for the euro area than it was for Austria.  Other than Austria which prior to the introduction of the euro followed a policy of tying its currency to the DEM, the Eurosystem does not have an exchange rate target. While Austria’s stability oriented currency policy made sense for a small open economy, it would not be wise to try to maintain a fixed exchange rate between the international currencies in an era of globalisation of financial markets and full liberalisation of capital transfers.  The euro area economy is far less open than the economies of the individual euro area countries. This tends to limit the impact of external economic developments and in particular of exchange rates and external prices on domestic euro area prices. Thus, the exchange rate channel of monetary policy transmission is less important for a large, relatively closed currency area, like the euro area, than for small open economies. However, as statistics show, the euro area is still more open than the United States. In 2000, exports of goods and services represented 19,1 %, whereas imports represented 18,7 % of the euro area’s GDP. This is more than the United States with a ratio of 10,7 % for exports and 14,4 % for imports. In such an environment, only a stability oriented and credible economic policy can contribute to sustainable and economically viable exchange rates. Of course, exchange rate developments cannot be ignored – the second pillar of the monetary policy strategy of the Eurosystem also contains information from the foreign exchange markets. Long-lasting and identifiable deviations from estimated “equilibrium” exchange rates can have very negative consequences for an economy such as a massive misallocation of resources. But so far, regrettably, there is no clear consensus in the economic literature on how to calculate equilibrium exchange rates. Given this and the general observation that we still move within the framework of what has happened over the past 30 years, the importance of the external exchange rate stability is somewhat overstated. It has also to be emphasised that the tragic events of September, 11 did not inject any turbulence into currency markets but the euro/dollar exchange rate continued to trade around its previous level. Hence, even though it may be too soon to make a firm statement but the very existence of the euro as well as the actions taken by the Eurosystem in conjunction with the Federal Reserve System are likely to have stabilised markets. Price Stability Second, as to price stability, most analysts agree that the monetary policy decisions of the ECB Governing Council have been appropriate. Since the beginning of EMU, the euro-area has achieved low inflation and expectations thereof and thus interest rates have been low. The Governing Council has made its decisions on the basis of its primary goal, price stability. It is worthwhile to restate the mandate of the Eurosystem. The primary objective of the Eurosystem, as the Treaty of the European Union defines it, is to maintain price stability in the euro area.  The Governing Council of the ECB has defined price stability as "year-on-year increases in the HICP for the euro area of below 2%". Furthermore, it was made clear from the outset that price stability should be maintained over the medium term. By unambiguously assigning the primary objective of price stability to an independent central bank, the Treaty recognises that focusing monetary policy on the maintenance of price stability in the euro area ensures that monetary policy will make the best possible contribution to improving economic prospects. This view is rooted in the fact, supported by practical experience and empirical evidence, that the benefits of price stability for growth are substantial. Without putting forward all the arguments, the maintenance of price stability helps to allocate resources efficiently both across uses and across time. Inflation causes economic agents to confuse transitory with permanent price changes, and therefore distorts their decision-making process. In evaluating investment opportunities, firms need to have confidence in the signals conveyed by relative price changes, and to discriminate between relative price adjustments and general changes in the overall price level. This process is facilitated in a situation of overall price stability. Price stability therefore improves the transparency of the relative price mechanism and can promote an adequate environment to increasing the growth potential of the euro area economy. Moreover, as experience has shown, stable prices minimise the inflation risk premium, thereby lowering long-term interest rates and helping to stimulate investment and growth. 
 BIS Review 93/2001 3 In order to maintain price stability, the Eurosystem has designed a monetary policy strategy wherein risks to price stability are assessed on the basis of two pillars. The first pillar assigns a prominent role to monetary developments. The second pillar is a broadly based assessment of a wide range of other economic and financial indicators. This all-encompassing and systematic approach guarantees that the Governing Council of the ECB takes into consideration all relevant pieces of information when assessing the outlook for price stability in the medium term. The Eurosystem´s two-pillar monetary policy strategy was particularly chosen to cater for a period of transition and uncertainty. The two-pillar strategy allows us - and indeed compels us - to follow closely and systematically a wide range of monetary, economic and financial indicators which may give indications on future inflation and economic developments at large. It easily accommodates the advisable shift in the relative weight attached to various variables.  What is more, the two-pillar strategy does not pretend the existence of certainty and stable economic relationships where there are in reality no such things. In this sense, it is a very honest strategy. To be transparent to the public, though, it requires special communication efforts by the Eurosystem. By all means, the two-pillar strategy is in my firm conviction clearly superior – particularly at the present juncture of considerable model uncertainty – to any mechanical rule-based approaches. The latter are usually taylored to specific views of how the economy operates and are therefore less likely to perform well in periods where these views might have to be adapted. Monetary policy rules usually derive their policy recommendations from a very narrow set of economic indicators only. In many cases they rest heavily on the output gap and the equilibrium real interest rate, which, as I have pointed out, are potentially very unreliable concepts at the present juncture.  Financial Stability Third, the financial stability of the euro area has been enhanced by the single currency; the latest developments have provided indisputable proof of this.  Generally, the implementation of monetary policy in the euro area has proved highly efficient. The Eurosystem has successfully introduced a market-oriented, modern and flexible operational framework. The money market has clearly benefited from this in its refinancing operations. Short-term interest rates have totally converged and the money market within the euro area has become fully integrated. As a result, we have an efficient and liquid euro money market, and banks benefit from the conformity of market conditions. The euro money market has widely used daily reference indices for interest rates, notably EONIA for overnight transactions and EURIBOR for transactions with longer maturities. These euro area indices were swiftly accepted on the market and form a common basis for pricing. Market participants are now able to manage their day-to-day funds in an efficient manner, incurring relatively low costs. The rapid integration of the euro area's money market was also supported by the developments in the payment systems infrastructure, above all the establishment of the TARGET system operated by the ESCB, which links the national real-time gross-settlement systems with the ECB's Payment Mechanism. The smooth functioning of the settlement of cross-border payments allows banks to trade safely throughout the euro area. Therefore the money market has gained a clear cross-border orientation, and some large banks have started to act as "money center" banks, based on a euro area-wide scope of activity. The broadening of the market and the increasing share of cross-border transactions have had a positive impact on the provision of liquidity: The wider euro area money market can now absorb liquidity shortages more easily than before, as banks can borrow more readily from foreign institutions or vice versa. When the terrorist attacks in the United States triggered some threats to the short-term functioning of the global financial market in the very beginning, the mere existence of the single currency and the consequent integration and deepening of the euro area financial markets contributed to financial stability not only in Europe. In addition, in the days following the attacks, the Eurosystem was able to react quickly and efficiently and succeeded in stabilising the markets and creating confidence in their functioning. The Eurosystem’s decision to immediately provide extra liquidity in euro, and in co-operation with the US Federal Reserve System and the euro area national central banks, in dollars, contributed to the rapid return to normal of the euro area as well as international markets. 
 4 BIS Review 93/2001 The euro area is not an island and global developments do affect the euro area economy of course. Hence, one of the requirements of a globalised world is a frequent exchange of information and views among policy-makers. The Eurosystem currently participates in the meetings of international organisations, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), and different fora, such as the G7 and G10. These exchanges are important to better understand economic developments and to fully analyse the spill-over effects in the economy arising from different policies. In a longer term context, the launch of the single currency and the establishment of a strong monetary policy player on the global scene have contributed to the efforts to enhance co-operation in the regulation and supervision of financial market institutions, as well as in the oversight of payment and settlement systems, both at the European and the global level. Fiscal Stability The fourth stability-related aspect in the euro area is the discipline of fiscal policies. The macroeconomic policies pursued in the euro area at present are, on the whole, more conducive to price stability, fiscal prudence and structural changes than at any time in the 1970s, 1980s or early 1990s. The convergence criteria to the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union have already been important in ensuring a stable environment.  They have also set a kind of standard beyond the euro area, above all in the EU Member States which have not yet adopted the euro, but also in the 12 candidate countries actively negotiating for membership of the European Union. In addition, the institutional set-up and different permanent procedures within the European Union aim to promote further the stability-oriented policies.  The multilateral surveillance and the Stability and Growth Pact are important tools here. The fact that the developments of all Member States' public finances are continuously scrutinised in detail by the ECOFIN Council implies peer pressure and shared responsibility.  Increasing competition together with this shared responsibility has also strengthened the incentives to improve the efficiency and viability of public sector, labour markets and pension system structures. At present, there are no major imbalances in the euro area which would require long-term adjustment. Economic policies in the euro area as a whole remain geared towards price stability, the objectives of the Stability and Growth Pact, wage moderation and structural reform. Further positive effects on economic growth should stem from the impact of tax reductions in several member countries and from the fact that financing conditions are favourable.  Thus, while it is natural for an economic slowdown to have adverse effects on Member States’ budgets, it is important that especially those countries with a budget position still not close to balance or in surplus and/or with high public debt-to-GDP ratios adhere to their medium-term consolidation plans. The current slowdown should not substantially change the scope for reaching the medium-term commitments they made under the Stability and Growth Pact and in the context of their stability programmes. A medium-term perspective and continuous consolidation are essential for the conduct of fiscal policy in all euro area countries. This would give a firm signal to investors and consumers, thereby supporting confidence and contributing to a recovery. While it may be perceived as more difficult to advance in these areas in an environment of weaker economic activity, the need to properly address rigidities should be much more obvious now than at times of buoyant growth. The current weakness should therefore be taken as a challenge to be met by stepping up reforms rather than allowing efforts to abate. Stability Anchor Finally, let me turn to the fifth stability aspect. EMU and the euro are an anchor for stability for Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs), among them several applicants for EU accession.  A more detailed analysis shows that the euro has become particularly important as a unit of account in international goods and service trade in the CEECs. Moreover, the euro is likely to play an ever larger role on the Central and Eastern European forex markets. The same is true of the euro as an investment and issuing currency for private users in the CEECs and, in the longer term, for pricing of goods and on the stock exchange. 
 BIS Review 93/2001 5 Even today, the euro is a key currency for Central and Eastern Europe. In most of the CEECs' monetary policy strategies, exchange rates play a vital role and, wherever they are not a formal or informal intermediate target, they are at least a key monetary policy indicator. In nearly all cases it is the euro upon which the CEECs' currencies are oriented, or to which they are formally linked.  European integration will only be truly successful if it reaches out to the whole of Europe. It is the concept of stability orientation that urges us to complete European unification. If we manage the enlargement process successfully, this will also be conducive to our endeavor to guarantee stability for the whole euro area. Such a mutual improvement is desirable in a very broad sense: political stability, financial market stability, macroeconomic and – in the particular interest of the Eurosystem – price stability.  There is no doubt that enlargement will encourage stability, growth and employment in a wider Europe. There is a consensus that the accession countries will reap substantial growth and employment benefits from their membership in the European Union. Still, let me also add a word of caution in this context: It may take quite a while before new entrants will be in a position to fully harvest these benefits. A fair share of realism is called for to avoid disappointment. The countries of Central and Eastern Europe have made successful and impressive progress on their way to EU membership. Yet more remains to be done. Sustainable monetary, fiscal and structural policy reforms are of prime importance in this context, as they help to establish the required real convergence with the European Union – a precondition for smooth accession to the EU. These reforms comprise, for example, sustainable low rates of inflation, sound public finances, stable currencies, flexible labor markets and efficient financial markets. Finally, the Central and Eastern European countries involved in accession negotiations will be confronted with the basic question of how Economic and Monetary Union features in the overall context of enlargement. As far as we can judge today, we see the economic and monetary policy integration of the candidate countries proceeding in three steps: In a first step, the candidates will accede to the European Union, then they will participate in ERM II, the exchange rate mechanism of the Union, and in a last step, they will introduce the euro as their national currency. Let me point out very clearly that the fulfillment of the Maastricht convergence criteria is not a prerequisite for membership in the European Union. But, of course, this does not mean that the convergence criteria are wholly unimportant for the accession countries today. While they may not represent criteria with which to judge a country's readiness for Europe, they may be signposts for stability-oriented policies, which of course must be devised in line with the particular situation the countries are in. To fulfill the convergence criteria is a necessary condition for participation in EMU. Future candidate countries for EMU must, as the current members have done, fulfill the convergence criteria of the treaty, not more but also not less.  From an overall perspective, I clearly welcome the European Union's plans for enlargement, as enlargement will help extend the zone of stability in Europe, strengthen Europe's international competitive position and will thus contribute substantially to prosperity, security and peace in the long term.  September 11th and their implications for monetary policy and international co-operation In his well-known address to the American Economic Association in 1968, Milton Friedman1 stated that: “The first and most important lesson that history teaches us about what monetary policy can do...is that monetary policy can prevent money from being a major source of economic disturbance. The Great Contraction might not have occurred at all, and if it had, it would have been far less severe, if the monetary authority had avoided mistakes.”  The terror attacks in New York and Washington on September 11th had immediate repercussions across the world, in particular in financial markets. In dealing with the immediate impact, the Eurosystem acted both in close co-operation with the Federal Reserve and on its own. The world’s leading central banks took prompt action to alleviate the ensuing liquidity crunch by providing markets with liquidity and subsequently cutting interest rates to prevent market crashes. They have thus acted as mature players that successfully forestalled crisis and injected confidence into battered markets.                                                       1 Milton Friedman (1968), „The Role of Monetary Policy“, American Economic Review, vol. 58, no.1. 
 6 BIS Review 93/2001 Are any general lessons to be drawn from this experience? Will concerted policy actions among central banks be more frequent in the future? It may sound confusing but such joint actions should be restricted to truly exceptional circumstances and extreme events. In addition, any such concerted action must be consistent with the principles of sound monetary policy. Even in exceptional circumstances, the euro area’s monetary policy must always remain clearly focused on the mandate of the Eurosystem and its primary objective of maintaining price stability in the domestic economy. What may differ in such circumstances, however, is the time profile of the appropriate policy actions best serving that objective and the degree of co-operation among central banks in coming to a common understanding of the situation in the case of an emergency. Without doubt, central banks can make an important contribution to limiting the international economic consequences that an extreme event like the September terrorist attacks may entail. However, apart from the immediate tasks of central banks in terms of ensuring the continued functioning of markets and of payment systems, the main contribution of central banks remains what it always has been: the maintenance of price stability. Confidence in the maintenance of price stability is the foundation for the effective functioning of a market economy.  Fostering trust and confidence in lasting price stability become not less but more important in the wake of extreme events and in the presence of unusual uncertainty. This remains the best contribution that monetary policy can make to securing a solid basis for growth and “domestic” as well as international stability. Asking monetary policy to do more or to serve other purposes, risks creating illusions about what monetary policy can do. As it has been aptly put by the Governor of the Bank of England, Sir Eddie George, in a recent speech: "It is important that the limitations of monetary policy - what it can and what it can't hope to achieve - are clearly understood. Otherwise expectations are likely to be disappointed, and disappointed expectations may lead to building pressure for alternative policy actions, which may not in the event be in our longer-term economic interest." This view on what monetary policy can do - and more important what it cannot do - is basically shared by all major central banks. Based on this "common understanding", central banks are thus likely to come to very similar conclusions on the appropriate course of policy given the respective mandates and prevailing conditions in the respective economies. Concerted actions should not come into conflict with the mandates and monetary policy strategies pursued by the participating central banks. Otherwise co-operation could lead to increased uncertainty about the future course of policy and compromise longer-term stability. This lesson also seems to stem from historical experience. On the whole, since the end of Bretton Woods efforts at policy co-ordination have been confined to addressing specific unusual circumstances such as severe currency misalignments.  Conclusion In concluding and summing up my remarks, I strongly believe that the best contribution that a large economy like the euro area can make to the international financial system is to ensure macroeconomic stability "at home" by pursuing policies which lead to sustainable non-inflationary growth in the euro area. Given the size of the economy of the euro area, a stability-oriented policy will help to create a favourable environment conductive to non-inflationary growth at the global level. 
 BIS Review 92/2001 1 Willem F Duisenberg: The introduction of the euro, the regions and the accession process Speech by Dr Willem F Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, at the plenary session of European Union Committee of the Regions, Brussels, 14 November 2001. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, It is a pleasure for me to be here today and to address the plenary session of the Committee of the Regions. Like many events in the still young life of the euro and my institution, the European Central Bank, this is in fact a premiere. In recognition of the composition of this Committee and its specific expertise, I should like to focus my remarks on two key issues, which – I believe – could be of particular relevance to regional and local authorities. First, I should like to explore an issue that has received a great deal of academic and media attention, and which could be considered particularly relevant from the perspective of regional and local authorities: the persistence of regional economic differences in relation to a single monetary policy in which – so to speak – one size fits all. Second, allow me to address some of the challenges connected with the forthcoming enlargement of the European Union and the eventual entry of the new Member States into the euro area.  But before doing so, let me emphasise that the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins is – at the moment – the most important challenge for the ECB and the national central banks (NCBs) of the euro area. The euro banknotes are currently being produced by 15 different printing works throughout Europe, including those of a number of NCBs. By the end of October 2001 over 13 billion banknotes had been produced – that is, significantly more than the 10 billion expected to enter circulation at the beginning of next year. The printing works are currently producing logistical stocks for the purposes of the changeover.  In order to ensure the smooth introduction of the euro banknotes and coins and the efficient withdrawal of national banknotes and coins, the logistics of the 2002 cash changeover have been determined well in advance. Within this general framework the changeover scenario is a national responsibility, in accordance with the principles of subsidiarity and decentralisation.  The Eurosystem is well aware of the importance of achieving a smooth cash changeover in order to maintain both public and financial market confidence in the single currency. One of the main concerns expressed about the cash changeover is the need for retailers to hold large amounts of cash during the first few days of 2002. In order to address this concern, a substantial number of measures are being implemented at the national level.  While a successful cash changeover is an immediate concern – and thus naturally at the centre of current public and media attention, – we should also bear in mind some of the longer-term challenges involved in making Economic and Monetary Union and the euro a lasting success. In this context, the relationship between the single monetary policy and the presence of regional economic differences in the euro area is probably of particular relevance and, in my view, also a topic of common interest to our institutions.  The Treaty establishing the European Community unambiguously lays down that the overriding objective of the single monetary policy is to maintain price stability in the euro area. This reflects the notion that the best contribution that monetary policy can make to sustainable long-run economic growth and rising standards of living is to maintain price stability.  A single monetary policy which is successful in fulfilling this objective will not necessarily imply that euro area regions or countries will always display similar price developments. Divergence in price developments across various regions or countries is a normal phenomenon in monetary unions. Such differentials in price developments represent relative price changes, which do not affect – and are not affected by – monetary policy.  Given the existence of a single monetary policy in the euro area, the ECB's monetary policy can only have an impact on the price level for the euro area as a whole. This is true irrespective of the number of countries or regions that are part of the euro area. This implies that the ECB's monetary policy must focus on price stability in the euro area as a whole. 
 2 BIS Review 92/2001 However, it is important to understand the sources of differentials in the rates of price changes among countries and regions in the euro area, since they may affect citizens' welfare and require national or regional corrective measures. One source of divergence in the rates of price changes across euro area countries or regions, which is often quoted in public debates, relates to the “catching-up processes”. We can witness such a catching-up process when a country or a region starts from a lower level of productivity – and thus income per capita – compared with other economies participating in EMU. During the transitional period, there may be faster productivity growth in sectors exposed to international competition in the catching-up economies than in the more mature economies. This, in turn, might be associated with faster price increases in the catching-up economies. This is a normal phenomenon within a monetary union and is not in itself a cause for concern. In this respect, I should like to stress that a substantial process of convergence in per capita income has already taken place in the euro area over the last few decades. Another source of divergence in the rates of price changes across euro area countries or regions may arise when countries or regions are affected by economic or policy shocks which are different in their nature or timing, or when, due to different economic structures, local economies respond differently to a common shock. One example of this would be a change in the oil price. Although this is a common shock to the whole euro area, countries and regions in the euro area can be affected to a different extent, depending on their particular demand for (or supply of) energy.  As differences in economic structures across countries are likely to remain in the future too, the fact that different regions in the euro area will face different economic shocks will be unavoidable. It is therefore crucial that national and local authorities have all the measures in place to facilitate a smooth and efficient adjustment to economic developments that affect countries and regions differently.  One important equilibrating mechanism in response to such shocks is fiscal policy, through the operation of automatic stabilisers and the adoption of specific measures in the case of adverse shocks at the regional and national level. However, this requires sound budgetary positions over the medium term in accordance with the Stability and Growth Pact. In this context, allow me to emphasise the responsibility of regional and local authorities to make an important contribution to the consolidation of public finances by exercising control over public expenditure. Another important adjustment mechanism is mobility in the factors of production. The process of European integration has already led to a significant convergence of financial and capital markets and capital is now highly mobile at the international level. However, labour continues to be barely mobile within many euro area countries and almost immobile between countries.  To this end, it is crucial – and I should like to encourage you – to make as much progress as possible in the introduction and acceleration of structural reforms aimed at increasing mobility, promoting flexibility in price and wage settings, enhancing competition and reducing distortions in product and labour markets. Without these reforms, the loss of competitiveness deriving from rigidities will become a source of national, or regional, unemployment and inefficient under-utilisation of resources. Stronger competition and the removal of structural rigidities will increase the flexibility of the economy and lower the adjustment costs associated with asymmetric shocks affecting one particular country or region. Although considerable progress has been made, much remains to be done.  Ladies and Gentlemen, allow me to also stress the importance of your role in contributing to informing European citizens about the dangers caused by divergences in price developments across countries or regions, which might arise as a result of excessive wage increases or the unsustainable expansion of profit margins at the local level. The more such developments become entrenched in the economy, the more they will lead to a loss in competitiveness and, eventually, to a loss in output and employment in the respective economies.  Clearly, our efforts to make the euro a success will require all of us to master – at home – the challenges which I have outlined. However, the European Union, and also the euro area, face an important external challenge – and this brings me to the second topic of my presentation: the EU accession process and the subsequent enlargement of the euro area. The fact that your Committee has established a liaison group with applicant countries bears witness to the substantial implications which enlargement will have not only for a central bank but also for representatives of regional and local authorities.  As you are well aware, to date 12 countries from central, eastern and southern Europe are involved in negotiations to become members of the EU and, ultimately, also of the euro area. The integration of 
 BIS Review 92/2001 3 such a large number of new countries into the European Union – which would imply almost a doubling of the current number of Member States – will be an enormous task for both sides and be without a precedent in history.  As I have just said, accession to the EU also entails significant implications for the economies of the accession countries themselves. For them, the main priority is indeed to foster the convergence process with the EU, both in real and in nominal terms. Thus, accession countries are aiming to achieve the European Union's standard of living, while at the same time seeking macroeconomic and financial stability. This process will entail profound and comprehensive adjustments in their real economies as well as in the careful design of sound economic policies.  Undoubtedly, significant progress has already been made in this respect. A substantial reallocation of resources, a strong reorientation of trade links towards the EU, a complete institutional overhaul and a sizeable development of the private sector are the most obvious signs of systemic change. However, these achievements should not give rise to complacency but rather be taken as motivation for further structural reforms. These reforms are needed in accession countries in order to further transform their economies into fully-fledged market economies, so as to enable them to cope with competitive pressures and provide the conditions for sustainable and non-inflationary growth. Given the positive impact of structural reforms on those countries' disinflation processes, there appears to be no contradiction between real and nominal convergence. Thus, both objectives should be pursued in parallel and the emphasis should not be focused on one target at the expense of the other.  In the context of real and nominal convergence, I should like to emphasise the important role played by sound fiscal policies. Although we judge the overall fiscal policy stance as being broadly satisfactory in most accession countries, budgetary consolidation efforts in some countries appear to have experienced a recent setback. In these few cases, a strengthening of efforts to return to the path of sound fiscal policies is crucial. A determined pursuit of fiscal consolidation is all the more necessary as the accession process and the completion of the transition phase are likely to place further demands on the budgetary situation, for example in relation to higher infrastructure investments or future reforms of the accession countries' health and social security systems.  Ladies and Gentlemen, I should like to conclude my presentation by answering one of the main questions which usually arises when a representative of the ECB talks about enlargement: will the accession process have consequences for the conduct of the single monetary policy? The answer is no. As I have already argued with regard to the issue of monetary policy and regional differences, the ECB's monetary policy can focus only on maintaining price stability in the euro area as a whole, irrespective of the number of regions or countries forming part of the euro area. Furthermore, the definition of price stability, as adopted by the ECB, should be seen as a lasting quantification of its primary objective. The purpose of a definition is that it should remain valid as a consistent and credible point of reference over time and in different circumstances.  Ladies and gentlemen, it has been a pleasure to be able to use this brief presentation to convey the perspective of a central bank on topics that are also of great interest to the Committee of the Regions.  Thank you very much for your attention.  
 BIS Review 92/2001 1 Kristina Persson: Sweden, EMU and the krona Speech by Ms Kristina Persson, Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at a seminar at Svensk Handel, Stockholm, 16 November 2001.  *      *      * Thank you for the invitation to come here. The theme is an important one, even if we do not yet know when a referendum will be held and whether a decision on EMU membership will be taken in Sweden. There is now just over one month left until 1 January 2002, when 307 million inhabitants of 12 European countries will have the same new banknotes and coins. 15 billion banknotes and 50 billion coins will come into circulation. In the course of a couple of months the national banknotes and coins in the eurozone will cease to be legal tender. The distribution and exchange will involve enormous challenges in terms of practical implementation, logistics and security. Yet I should imagine that many people will soon see it as a positive experience to be able to use the same means of payment throughout almost the whole of western Europe. Seeing the banknotes and shopping in euro prices across the continent brings home the existence of the monetary union in a more tangible way for the citizens of Europe. For us Swedes the euro will enforce our sense of being outside the euro. In addition, we have behind us a period during which the krona has weakened without this being apparent entirely motivated by fundamental factors. In my opinion, these are problems that are worth a closer examination. It is on these issues that I intend to speak today. The role of the Riksbank The role of the Riksbank in this context is to implement the decision taken by the government and parliament. The Sveriges Riksbank Act, which has governed our operations since 1999, states that “the Riksbank shall decide on the application of the foreign exchange rate system decided upon by the government.” The General Council of the Riksbank last expressed an opinion on the issue in 1997 when asked to respond to the government's investigative report. In its response to the submission the General Council emphasised that the economic advantages of a membership probably outweighed the disadvantages and that Sweden therefore should join the EMU from the start. The current Executive Board has not had reason to take a stance on the issue. Over the past few years we have regularly made technical preparations to enable a possible future membership to be implemented at no great cost and in a problem-free manner if and when a decision is finally taken. Economic consequences of a Swedish EMU membership The most obvious advantage with the disappearance of the currency borders is that which is normally known as transaction gains. This is the removal of the cost and inconvenience involved in exchanging currency when one visits or trades with different countries in the eurozone. Of course the foreign exchange costs in the eurozone were limited right from the start of the EMU in 1999, but they will now disappear completely. For the economy as a whole, however, this exchange of cash has involved a relatively small cost, which is nevertheless symbolically important. A somewhat larger cost has arisen from the handling charges the companies have been forced to bear to hedge against undesirable fluctuations in exchange rates. This cost disappeared as early as 1999 within the eurozone, but it is not particularly large in relation to our GDP – perhaps a few tenths of a percentage point. A single currency will promote competition within the EU and benefit the consumers, who will experience lower prices and thereby have more money in their pockets. When everyone uses the same unit of currency, it is easier to compare prices between countries. It will also be an advantage for the national economy as a whole, since competition facilitates the work on holding down inflation. Some differences in prices are unavoidable and arise from transport and information costs, but not all of the differences can be attributed to these costs. Despite the fact that we now have a common market with free trade for goods and services throughout the entire EU, there are still large differences in prices between different countries within the union. The average price difference is 16 per cent, 
 2 BIS Review 92/2001 which means that the difference is approximately 40 per cent larger than is the case between various states and regions in the USA. The price of a normal Volvo, for instance, can differ by 15 per cent or more from one country to another in Europe. Some of this difference is created by difference in cultures and languages, but new studies indicate that the actual psychological barrier involved in differing units of currency may bear a large part of the responsibility. The US economist Charles Engel, for instance, has calculated in extensive studies of price differences between the USA and Canada that a currency border creates price differences corresponding to a geographical distance of almost 8,000 km, even if the countries on either side of the currency border (as in the case of Canada and the USA) are entirely open to one another and share the same language and culture. The largest negative effects of having different currencies probably have to do with trade and resource allocation. In the same way that we believe inflation results in large national economical costs by creating uncertainty about future expenses and income, a fluctuating exchange rate does too. In addition, the allocation of resources in society is distorted by an exchange rate that is not fully motivated. The EMU has particular significance for trade. Many economists have long attempted to estimate this gain by looking at the extent to which fixed and relatively floating exchange rates affect trade and they have found a very small difference. However, a single currency is not the same as a fixed exchange rate. The practical and psychological differences are probably considerable. Professor Andrew K. Rose at Berkeley in the USA has, together with other economists, instead compared trade within monetary unions with the trade between countries without a monetary union, where he has made adjustments for such facts as monetary unions often share the same language, culture and regulatory framework. When Rose recently presented such a study for Sweden, his opinion was that the EMU could over the course of a few decades increase trade and integration by as much as 30-50 per cent. Rose himself admits that the figures are uncertain and other economists believe in much smaller trade gains. However, even the more cautious calculations indicate that the monetary union could provide considerable gains. For instance, Professor Torsten Persson estimates, using an alternative calculation of Rose's material, that the gains of a monetary union are only about one-fifth of what Rose claims. This would still involve a clear trade gain if the reasoning is applied to Sweden. Hopefully, the new debate stimulated by Rose's articles will lead to new insights in this very important field. What about the disadvantages? After all, giving up one's own currency also involves giving up a certain amount of one’s autonomy. The arguments against a possible Swedish membership of the EMU have often touched on the opportunity to pursue an independent stabilisation policy. The starting point for this is that the Swedish economy could for one reason or another find itself out of synch with economic developments in the eurozone, what is known as an asymmetrical shock. Having an independent monetary policy and currency would then give us the opportunity to stabilise our economy ourselves - act as a form of shock-absorber, which we will lose if we have a joint monetary policy governed by the prospects for inflation and the business climate throughout the eurozone. This was also the primary reason why the Calmfors Commission's report on the consequences of Swedish membership in the EMU1 came to the conclusion that Sweden should wait until its labour market and wage formation showed sufficient flexibility to deal with a serious disturbance. However, it should be noted that the Commission was envisaging a “small” eurozone with around 6 countries taking part, whereas now we are talking about 12 countries, representing 40-50 per cent of Sweden's trade. Moreover, in practice the Swedish business climate has rarely come seriously out of synch with the eurozone. When Sweden has done so, it has mainly been the result of mistakes in Sweden's own economic policy and not due to any unforeseeable external disturbance that has afflicted the Swedish economy. Also, in this respect Sweden has changed in recent years: the introduction of inflation targeting and expenditure ceilings should reduce the risks of new economic policy mistakes. In addition, there are strong indications that the correlation between Swedish and eurozone growth will increase if we join the EMU, as trade and integration with the euro countries will thereby be strengthened. We can see already how the long-term Swedish market rates have covaried strongly with those in the eurozone in recent years, even during periods with differences in business climate                                                       1 Report on the EMU investigation (SOU 1996:158). 
 BIS Review 92/2001 3 between Sweden and the eurozone. As far as a Swedish membership of the EMU would reduce these differences in business climate, it will lead to a long-term interest rate development that is more adapted to the business climate. If we still believe that Sweden could become radically out of synch with the rest of Europe, there is of course an alternative to using an independent exchange rate and monetary policy as shock absorbers. The more robust budget situation Sweden enjoys today, for example, should provide a slightly greater scope than during the early 1990s for using fiscal policy for the purpose of stabilisation. One can also imagine building up buffer funds to pay for reduced payroll tax in crisis situations (known as internal devaluation) of the type introduced in Finland.2 Another variant of an asymmetrical disturbance is that asset prices – the property market and stock exchange – due to a too strong economic development are forced up for a short while. However, in situations such as this, the required tightening can usually be managed with the help of fiscal policy. Naturally, stabilisation policy via the budget has its limitations since it only works with delay and is dependent on many other long-term considerations. In addition, the Stability and Growth Pact, which Sweden is included in whether or not a member of the EMU, provides a limitation on increased government expenses. The most important “shock absorber” even if we do not join the EMU, but especially if we do, is that wages can adapt to changes in the competition situation, i.e. that there is a high degree of flexibility and pliability in wage formation. It would thus be possible to avoid an increase in unemployment during an adaptation period. Naturally, it can be more difficult, politically, to achieve this than to adapt an exchange rate. A single monetary policy therefore requires greater discipline from labour market parties since the connection between wage costs/inflation and monetary policy will be less obvious than is the case today. The krona The reasoning I have pursued so far has assumed that the exchange rate actually functions as a shock absorber: that the floating exchange rate adapts to competitiveness and the business climate, i.e. that it strengthens against other countries when Sweden's economy shows better growth and weakens when the Swedish economy shows weaker growth than other countries. The exchange rate would thus counteract imbalances that arise. If Sweden alone were to suffer a negative disturbance that required prices and wages in Sweden to develop differently than those in the euro countries, a floating exchange rate would facilitate the adaptation. Here the development of the krona in recent years gives some cause for reflection. Does the krona really function as a shock absorber in practice? Or do fluctuations in the exchange rate risk being affected by so many other factors that the role as shock absorber is counteracted? It is difficult to see the most recent severe weakening of the krona as an adaptation to the fact that Sweden has come out of synch with the surrounding world. So what actually steers the krona rate? Since the 1970s the krona has weakened by almost 90 per cent against Sweden's most important competitor countries. Approximately half of this weakening can be explained by the fact that inflation in Sweden has been higher than in other countries. However, now inflation in Sweden is developing roughly in line with international inflationary trends. The weakening of the krona in recent years therefore cannot be explained by differences in the inflation rate. If we instead look at the exchange rate adjusted for inflation differences, the “real” exchange rate, we find some traditional explanations for much of the weakening that has taken place from the 1970s until the mid-1990s. Our terms of trade were weakened, productivity developed more weakly in Sweden than in other countries and during certain periods investors were concerned over a rapidly growing central government debt. However, developments during the latter part of the 1990s were rather different. The growth in productivity and GDP has been better and the inflation rate as low as the average among our main trading partners, while the central government debt has declined, which should have favoured a stronger krona. Nevertheless, the krona has depreciated.                                                       2  A more detailed discussion of the stabilisation policy tools within the EMU can be found in the report “Stability and stabilisation policy in the EMU” (SOU 2001:62), which can be downloaded from http://finans.regeringen.se/propositionermm/sou/index.htm. 
 4 BIS Review 92/2001 A small part of the most recent depreciation can be explained by real economy factors: the terms of trade have deteriorated slightly due to falling prices on telecom products; exports have declined more heavily in Sweden than in many other countries following on from the economic slowdown in the USA; and a falling order intake for exports has created a declining demand for the krona. However, there are also other explanations that are not directly concerned with real economy factors, but have instead been steered by financial flows, i.e. that the krona has been affected by a net outflow of capital from Sweden. The development of the krona and the stock market has shown a strong correlation since the beginning of 2000. This is probably connected with foreign investors selling Swedish shares in line with falls on the stock market, which has affected Sweden more than other countries, as a large part of the stock market value is owned by foreign investors. Moreover, Swedish investors have bought a large amount of foreign shares, which is probably connected with the new pension system and the freer investment regulations for the AP pension funds. It has been possible for the AP pension funds to increase their foreign exchange exposure, i.e. the percentage of foreign assets, from 10 to 15 per cent with effect from this year. The funds can increase their exposure by five percentage points a year to a maximum of 40 per cent in 2006. On top of this comes a factor that is difficult to explain on the basis of classical exchange rate theories. The krona is affected to a large extent by general unease on the global financial markets. During times of financial unrest the krona weakens when investors leave the Swedish market for ones considered a safer investment. This was particularly noticeable during the Mexico crisis of 1995 and the Asia crisis of 1997-98. The recent unrest on the financial markets in connection with uncertainty over the global business climate has once again had a negative effect on the krona. Following the terrorist attacks in the USA we saw a further depreciation of the krona (and for some other minor currencies), as well as a weak development in the stock market. Finally, the generally stronger dollar must be mentioned as one of the explanations for the weak krona. Some of the dollar's strength can be attributed to higher productivity in the USA, but most economists still believe the dollar to have been overvalued on the basis of traditional economic theory. The krona has thereby been steered to some extent by factors that are not connected with the economic situation and developments in the real economy. This means that the weak krona does not function fully as a shock absorber against the outside world. Sweden has an undervalued currency despite our economy developing as well as other countries' economies. The monetary policy problem is that a weak krona risks creating inflation via import prices, which in turn can force a tighter monetary policy stance than would otherwise be necessary. There are international examples of how the exchange rate, instead of acting as a shock absorber, has rather worsened the effects of an economic slowdown. Japan and Switzerland have experienced prolonged crisis periods during the 1990s, while their currencies have remained very strong and have thus caused problems for the export industry. One effect of the weakening of the krona that we have now is that the export industry and the competitive import industry should become more competitive in the short term. However, there are some structural problems here: an unmotivated weak exchange rate risks strengthening certain parts of the export industry that do not constitute expansive future sectors. Sweden's future hardly lies in competing with low costs and prices, but rather with quality, cutting edge technology and know-how. When the krona eventually appreciates to a level more motivated on the basis of fundamental factors, Sweden will have an industrial structure poorly equipped to meet the requirements of the future. Conclusions The Riksbank assumes that the krona will appreciate. It is possible that we have already seen the beginning of this development very recently. When the upturn does take place, it may prove even stronger than the Riksbank estimated in its latest Inflation Report. This does not prevent the fact that the recent valuation of the krona has brought new perspectives to the question of Swedish membership in the third phase of the EMU, i.e. participation in the eurozone. The volatility of the krona creates difficulties for export and import companies in making decisions regarding trade and investment. However well monetary policy functions, it still cannot supply the efficiency gains at the microeconomy level that ensue from a single currency. The effects on growth through both price competition over the borders and increased trade could be greater than we have previously often assumed. 
 BIS Review 92/2001 5 An independent monetary policy will of course remain the main argument against EMU membership. The question is how valuable this is. In part, I do not consider the risk very large of Sweden alone getting caught up in a crisis where these very instruments will be the best for stabilising our economy. In part, we have seen that the exchange rate can be governed for fairly long periods of time by factors on the financial markets that are not primarily related to the real economy. Instead of acting as a shock absorber for business climate developments in Sweden that are out of synch with other countries, there is a risk that the krona, by weakening more than motivated by fundamental factors, could instead upset Sweden's possibilities for stabilising its development. The economic gains of remaining outside the eurozone thus appear uncertain, while recent research indicates that Swedish debate has probably undervalued the integration gains from EMU. When you hold your first euro banknote next year and take a closer look at it, you will be able to see that Sweden is actually present, on the European map that adorns one side of every banknote. May I be permitted the cautious interpretation of this as a sign of things to come? 
 BIS Review 92/2001 1 Bank of Japan’s November report of recent economic and financial developments1 Bank of Japan, 19 November 2001 *      *      * The Bank’s View2 Adjustments in economic activity are becoming more severe, as the substantial decline in production is beginning to have an adverse effect on private consumption through decreases in employment and income. With regard to final demand, net exports (real exports minus real imports) continue to decline, reflecting not only a slowdown in overseas economies but also sluggish demand for IT-related goods. Business fixed investment also continues to decrease while the deterioration in exporting conditions persists. Housing investment remains sluggish and public investment is on a downward trend. Moreover, private consumption seems to be weakening gradually. Industrial production continues to decline considerably, reflecting these developments in final demand and also strong excessiveness in inventories of electronic parts and materials. Corporate profits are deteriorating, particularly in manufacturing, and the weakness in household income is becoming evident amid the decrease in the hours worked and the rise in unemployment. Turning to the outlook, as for exporting conditions, the prevailing view is that inventory adjustments in IT-related goods worldwide are expected to be mostly completed by around next spring. However, while the world economy has decelerated further since the terrorist attacks in the U.S., final demand of IT-related goods is likely to be stagnant for the time being. Moreover, if the downturn in U.S. private consumption persists, it may induce another round of adjustments in the Japanese economy, starting from the decline in exports such as of consumer goods.  Meanwhile, with respect to domestic demand, business fixed investment is expected to follow a downward trend, particularly in the IT-related sector, amid the decline in corporate profits. Private consumption will also continue to be weak along with deteriorating employment and income conditions and the more cautious consumer sentiment. Government spending is projected to follow a downtrend at the time when the substantial decline in exports and production is negatively affecting private consumption through the decrease in household income. Consequently, it may take quite a while for overall production activity to stop declining, although the decrease in the production of IT-related goods may eventually come to an end.  Overall, adjustments in economic activity, starting from the decline in exports since the beginning of this year, will surely dampen domestic demand further. At the same time, concern that another substantial decline in exports will exert downward pressure on the economy is growing. Moreover, while the economy continues to be in a fragile state, continuous attention should be paid to the risk of a negative impact on the economy induced by developments in foreign and domestic capital markets via corporate and household confidence. With regard to prices, import prices continue to decline mainly reflecting the softening of international commodity prices. Domestic wholesale prices are also declining faster from the effects of the decline in crude oil prices in addition to the continuous decreases in prices of electrical machinery and materials. Consumer prices are weakening owing mainly to the decline in prices of imported products and their substitutes. Corporate service prices continue to decrease. As for the conditions surrounding price developments, international commodity prices such as of crude oil and nonferrous metals remain weak. Also, with the prolonged adjustments in economic activity, the balance between supply and demand in the domestic market will increasingly exert downward pressure on prices. Furthermore, in addition to the declining trend of machinery prices caused by technological innovations, the decreases in the prices of goods and services reflecting deregulation                                                       1  This report is based on data and information available at the time of the Bank of Japan Monetary Policy Meeting held on November 15 and 16, 2001. 2  The Bank’s view of recent economic and financial developments, determined by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on November 15 and 16 as the basis for monetary policy decisions. 
 2 BIS Review 92/2001 and the streamlining of distribution channels will continue to restrain price developments. Overall, prices are expected to follow a gradual declining trend for the time being. Moreover, given the high degree of uncertainty regarding future economic developments, the possibility that weak demand will further intensify downward pressure on prices warrants careful monitoring. In the financial market, the overnight call rate is moving around zero percent as the Bank of Japan provided ample liquidity to the money market by aiming at maintaining the current account balances held at the Bank at above 6 trillion yen. Interest rates on term instruments basically continue to be level. The Japan premium remains negligible. Yields on long-term government bonds dipped and are recently moving around 1.35 percent. As for the yield spreads between private bonds (bank debentures and corporate bonds) and government bonds, while spreads between bonds with relatively high credit ratings and government bonds remain mostly unchanged, those between bonds with low credit ratings and government bonds continue to expand slightly. Stock prices continued to be weak, but are recently rebounding. In the foreign exchange market, the yen is currently being traded in the range of 121 -123 yen to the U.S. dollar. With regard to corporate finance, private banks appear to be more cautious in extending loans to firms with higher credit risks while they continue to be more active in extending loans to blue-chip companies. The lending attitudes of financial institutions as perceived by small firms are becoming more cautious. In corporate bonds and CP markets, the fund-raising conditions for firms continue to be generally favorable, although the issuing environment for firms with low credit ratings is deteriorating slightly. Credit demand in the private sector is declining faster mainly because firms are decreasing their business fixed investment while continuously reducing their debts. Amid these developments, private banks’ lending continues to decline at about 2 percent on a year-on-year basis. As for the amount outstanding of corporate bonds issued, the year-on-year growth rate is slowing due to the decrease in the issuance of corporate bonds with low credit ratings. Meanwhile, the amount outstanding of CP issued continues to be at a high level, significantly exceeding that of the previous year, due to the generally favorable environment for issuing CP.  The growth rate of money stock (M2 + CDs) in October remained relatively high while the rate declined slightly from the previous month.  Funding costs for firms continue to be at extremely low levels on the whole. Overall, the recent financial environment remains extremely easy in terms of money market conditions and interest rate levels. However, as private banks and investors are becoming slightly cautious in taking credit risks, the fund-raising conditions of firms with higher credit risks and small firms are apparently becoming severe. Hence, the developments in the behavior of financial institutions and corporate financing need closer monitoring. 
 BIS Review 91/2001 1 Roger W Ferguson, Jr: Certified public accountants - partners in financial stability Remarks by Mr Roger W Ferguson, Jr, Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants National Conference on Banks and Savings Institutions, Washington, 8 November 2001. *      *      * I appreciate the opportunity to participate in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' (AICPA) National Conference on Banks and Savings Institutions. As Certified Public Accountants (CPAs) serving the banking industry you contribute to our financial system as bank managers, financial executives, analysts, internal and external auditors, and advisers. Your role in strengthening the internal control and transparency of banking organizations is a major one that we, as banking supervisors, are increasingly recognizing in our risk-focused examination policies, capital adequacy approaches, and disclosure initiatives.  The impact of terrorist attacks  Recently you, as CPAs with key roles in our financial system, have seen at first hand financial institutions and other companies--and indeed our country--work to overcome the challenges caused by the attacks of September 11. Besides causing unimaginable personal loss and grief, the attacks rippled across our country, disrupting sales, production, and air travel and damping the confidence of consumers and businesses. And the attacks severely, if temporarily, disrupted financial market operations and activity.  As testimony to the resilience of the American spirit, the immediate impact of the attacks has proved transient. Our society and, in particular, our financial system are rebounding from the initial influences of the attacks. In the financial sector, market participants showed great creativity, flexibility, and resolve in addressing the difficulties that arose on September 11. To help the process, the Federal Reserve moved quickly to ensure financial market liquidity through record lending at the discount window and an infusion of funds through open market operations. We encouraged financial institutions to provide their customers reasonable relief, such as waiving late payment fees, extending loan terms, restructuring debt obligations and easing credit terms in situations arising from the September 11 attacks. Also, the Federal Reserve and other federal banking agencies jointly issued a statement indicating our willingness to work with banks when increased extension of credit to customers may have caused a temporary decline in capital ratios.  As companies directly affected by the attacks struggled to resume their business, the accounting profession assumed an important role. This was recognized in part by the release by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on September 14 that relaxed the auditor independence rules to permit auditors to help their clients with internal reconciliations and certain accounting-records-related recovery efforts. With the SEC's action, many accountants and auditors quickly assisted clients in reconstructing records and information. As a result, many private firms and financial institutions were able to move to off-site locations and quickly restart operations. We applaud your efforts and those of the businesses you serve.  The longer-term prospects for the U.S. economy remain sound, just as they were before September 11. Our flexible markets, entrepreneurial spirit, well-educated work force, and major advances in information technology provide a sound foundation for the long-term growth of productivity, employment, and standards of living. In the medium term, consumer and business behaviors will significantly affect the way our economy progresses. Policymakers have reacted vigorously to changing macroeconomic conditions. As you know, the Federal Open Market Committee has reduced its target for the federal funds rate by 150 basis points since September 11.  Banking supervision and accounting and disclosure  The Federal Reserve has long supported sound accounting policies and meaningful public disclosure by banking and financial organizations with the objective of improving market discipline and fostering stable financial markets. Effective market discipline can complement bank supervision and regulation. 
 2 BIS Review 91/2001 With sufficient accurate and relevant information, market participants can better evaluate counterparty risks and adjust the availability and pricing of funds to promote better allocation of financial resources.  The concept of market discipline is assuming greater importance among international banking supervisors as well. The most recent proposal to amend and augment the Basel Capital Accord, which was published in January and called Basel II, seeks to strengthen the market's ability to aid bank supervisors in regulating capital adequacy. It consists of three pillars, or tools: risk-based capital (pillar I), risk-based supervision (pillar II), and disclosure of risks and capital adequacy to enhance market discipline (pillar III). This approach to capital regulation, with its market-discipline component, signals that sound accounting and disclosure will continue to be important parts of our supervisory approach for many years to come. I understand that these efforts to enhance our capital rules will be addressed later today in a separate session, so I will not discuss them in depth. However, I would like to point out that our goal in the Basel process is to develop a risk-sensitive framework that provides appropriate incentives to banking organizations to maintain strong capital positions and sound risk-management systems. The history of the 1990s, which included episodes of global financial instability spreading from small countries through international capital markets and banks, underscores the need to maintain adequate capital in the internationally active banks. For the sake of maintaining financial global stability, I hope that everyone values that goal.  On an international level, Basel II would also improve disclosure by many banks in foreign countries as well as in the United States. The proposal recommends specific disclosures to convey better an institution's capital adequacy and risk profile. The incentives in Basel II should greatly diminish the opacity that cloaks many international financial institutions and help bring about a convergence in international norms on banking disclosure. I believe that counterparties will expect, indeed force, greater disclosure. Recent history certainly teaches us that understanding a counterparty's balance sheet and risk appetite is necessary for accurately pricing any transaction or even for deciding whether to engage in a transaction.  Increased supervisory emphasis on controls and risk management  The Federal Reserve also seeks to strengthen audit and control standards for banks. This goal is in large part due to our recognition several years ago that examining banks' business processes can provide a clearer assessment of their safety and soundness than focusing exclusively on transactions --that is, reviewing the means rather than the results. Examining such processes became more necessary after we recognized years ago that the widening use of derivatives enabled an institution to substantially change its risk profile within hours--possibly shortly after the conclusion of an examination. In addition, interim reporting is becoming more important in our monitoring of individual banks and the sector as a whole. The quality of management information and financial reporting is dramatically affected by internal control systems, including internal and external audit programs. Financial reporting and good internal controls are rising in importance with banking regulators because they directly affect our ability to promptly identify institutions in distress and work toward a satisfactory resolution.  My view is that the financial sector benefits when bankers, regulators, and auditors all focus on the quality of internal control systems. Banks benefit directly from having more efficient and effective operations and indirectly from improved audit efficiency and reduced regulatory burden. Auditors benefit from learning more about their client's business and better understanding the supervisor's perspective. As banking supervisors, we benefit from tapping the auditor's expertise in assessing systems of internal control. Auditor expertise is not sufficient, however. Auditor independence is also critical to the relationship between supervisors and the profession. Without it, the process breaks down; suspicions rise over auditor motives and the supervisor's ability to rely on auditor findings and recommendations is diminished.  The revisions of Basel II also address internal controls through a proposed capital charge for operational risk. Developments such as the widespread adoption of technology, large-scale mergers, e-commerce, and the increased prevalence of outsourcing, can increase operational risk. While the regulatory reforms are being developed--and in the interim before a formal revision to the Basel Accord--supervisors will continue evaluating management's ability to control operational risk.  This aspect of the effort to amend the Accord has been criticized by some in the industry either as unnecessary or as creating a formulaic approach that is only a crude approx-imation of a proper capital charge. I suggest the events of September 11 indicate that operational risk is an issue that 
 BIS Review 91/2001 3 cannot be ignored. I invite both internal and external auditors to monitor Basel II and offer their counsel on how best to reflect operational risk in capital.  Both managers and supervisors focused on the operational aspects of banking in the years leading up to year 2000, a date that was uneventful in large part because of the preparations that were made. Now we know that the possible loss of physical facilities and key personnel, which were generally not considered as part of Y2K planning, must be factored into financial firms' disaster-recovery scenarios. Similarly, providing reliable backup to key infrastructure--electricity, telephone, water--is likely to play a larger role in financial institutions' planning. As we go forward, the operational preparedness of regulated institutions will figure more prominently in our supervisory program.  The role of the external auditor in the banking sector  The Federal Reserve and other supervisory agencies have long recognized the key role that the accounting and auditing profession plays in assessing internal controls. Guidance issued by the Federal Reserve and other regulatory agencies reflects the important role that both internal and external auditing play in enhancing internal systems and monitoring risk. As required by statute, banking organizations with assets of more than $500 million must have annual independent audits. The banking agencies encourage all small institutions to follow suit. In a similar vein, the Basel Committee has produced extensive guidance on the roles of both the external audit and internal audit and the ways these can be factored into the supervisory process.  As I said, market discipline is becoming a key element of supervisory thinking, and market discipline depends on prompt, accurate financial information. External auditors help significantly in ensuring that financial statements are reliable and useful to the marketplace. Periodic financial statements of banking organizations are also used by the Federal Reserve in our risk-focused supervision programs. These reports contribute to pre-examination planning, facilitate off-site monitoring programs, and ultimately help in determining the institution's financial condition. A strong external audit program assists us in moving away from detailed, burdensome, and what some consider invasive examinations.  Supervised institutions might well decide to use the expertise of the external auditor for more than routine financial reports. External auditors could also review the quality of internal controls and systems and assess the internal audit function's scope and adequacy. We are all well aware that a strong system of internal control is the foundation for the safe and sound operation of the financial organization. Furthermore, a financial institution's board of directors is responsible for setting the control environment, and senior managers are responsible for laying down the internal control process. Recognizing that responsibility, I would not be surprised if boards of directors and senior managers are asking their external auditors to review the internal audit function and recommend improvements in light of the changed business environment post-September 11. External auditors should be prepared to answer such questions from directors as the following:  • Is the internal audit function appropriate for the size of our institution and the nature and scope of our business, and are we receiving unbiased assessments?  • Is our internal audit function competent given the current environment? • Are the resources available to our internal audit function adequate given the nature, complexity, and risk of our institutions' activities? • Are weaknesses being fully identified and reported promptly to us?  External auditors can also help federal regulators by encouraging financial institutions to frequently reassess and refine their risk-management practices. A risk-management system should continually monitor financial risks in a changing business climate, such as the outlook for credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, and operational risk.  Of course, the potential benefits of external audits can be realized only when audits are performed according to high professional standards. This is not a time when the accounting profession can be complacent. Each firm should review its own internal practices to ensure that audits are of the best quality, consistent with sound practices and high standards of ethics and independence. The peer -review process should be viewed as an opportunity to improve quality rather than a somewhat routine compliance obligation. I certainly encourage the auditing profession to police itself and to strive continually to improve audit quality. By doing so you avoid suspicions regarding the competence and 
 4 BIS Review 91/2001 judgment of independent auditors. Also keep foremost in mind that your ultimate client is not management but the shareholder. You need not only to watch for misleading financial statements but also for companies that apply the technical rules underlying accounting standards in ways that cover losses or otherwise obscure the condition and performance of an institution. Attention to these matters will help ensure that audits deliver their promised benefits, that transparency is enhanced, and that market participants and supervisors are better able to regulate the risk-taking of financial institutions in ways that promote financial stability.  Conclusion  In the face of a rapidly evolving external environment, I see wisdom in staying the course, encouraging improved risk-management processes and better disclosure. I also see, however, that the time is right for banks and other financial institutions, infrastructure providers, and utilities to work independently and, possibly, collaboratively, to yield a tougher, more resilient financial system. I am sure that regulators will support those efforts, and I encourage the accounting and auditing community to provide your professional support as well.  The accounting and auditing community has traditionally played an important role improving risk-management and disclosure practices. Whether manager, analyst, auditor, or adviser, CPAs truly are partners in the quest for greater financial stability. I appreciate the opportunity to share these thoughts with you today, and thank you for the important role you play.  
 BIS Review 91/2001 1 Tony Latter: Derivatives from a Central Bank perspective Speech by Mr Tony Latter, Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, at the Seminar Programme of the FOW Derivatives Expo, Hong Kong, 5 November 2001 *      *      * Introduction Why may central banks be interested in derivatives? Although it is dangerous to generalise, and no two central banks may see them in precisely the same light, there are certain aspects of derivatives in which central banks, including the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, probably have a common interest. I should like to review some of these today. For present purposes one does not need to be too precise as to what is meant by derivatives, save to note that the focus here is only on financial derivatives, although these do of course share many of the same basic characteristics as commodity or other derivatives. The textbooks give various definitions of a financial derivative: for instance, that it is a contract the value of which depends on or derives from the value of some underlying financial asset or index; or that it is an instrument which does not constitute ownership but only a promise or option to convey ownership. At its widest, the definition could embrace all futures, forwards, swaps, options, warrants, convertibles, asset-backed securities and so on, and all combinations or variations of those. At the end of the day it's probably fair to say that, although we may experience some difficulty in describing exactly what a derivative is, we can usually recognise one when we encounter it. The interests of the central bank in derivatives will tend to be rather broader than those of any commercial bank, trader or broker, because of its multiple policy responsibilities. The issues can be conveniently grouped under four headings: infrastructure, supervision, information, and operations. Infrastructure HKMA is probably fairly typical of most central banks in developed financial centres in having a general concern for the stability and development of the financial infrastructure, but without necessarily being involved directly in the provision of that infrastructure, of which derivatives nowadays form an indispensable part. Derivatives have brought substantial benefits to the commercial community, in facilitating hedging and hence business planning more generally, and have enabled the financial institutions to offer a progressively wider range of services and greater efficiency in the intermediation process, as well as to exploit market imperfections and other trading opportunities for their own gain. The range of available derivative products in Hong Kong is extensive. Exchange tradable derivatives include futures and options on the Hang Seng Index as well as on individual Hong Kong stocks and, since the launch a few weeks ago, on a selection of leading stocks of certain overseas exchanges. Exchange traded interest rate products include one-month and three-month HIBOR futures; and futures contracts on three-year Exchange Fund Notes are expected to commence trading later this month. Less visible, perhaps, to the outside observer, but no less important, is the trading of over-the-counter derivative products among financial institutions. Fewer high frequency statistics are available for OTC activity than for exchange-based activity, but the Bank for International Settlements publishes regular estimates and has recently released the results of its comprehensive triennial survey of activity in the world's foreign exchange and related derivative markets. The HKMA has in parallel released some details of the Hong Kong data which we collected and submitted for that survey.1 Briefly, in the three years up to April 2001, while, roughly in line with experience elsewhere in the world, turnover in the foreign exchange market in Hong Kong declined, activity in OTC derivatives - essentially currency swaps and options, and interest rate swaps, options and forward rate agreements - rose by just under 10%. Interest rate products accounted for almost two thirds of the total of this derivatives activity. The apparent buoyancy of interest-rate related activity may be partly attributable to the growth of composite products such as structured notes which include an option or swap element. Some of the                                                       1  A fuller account will appear in the forthcoming November issue of the HKMA Quarterly Bulletin. 
 2 BIS Review 91/2001 growth in the interest rate swap market has also been associated with the continuing development of the Hong Kong dollar bond market, where well-rated names may combine issuance of longer-term fixed-rate paper with a swap to secure floating-rate Hong Kong dollars at sub-HIBOR, or, particularly in the case of some international borrowers, link this also with a currency swap to obtain US dollars at sub-LIBOR. As regards exchange traded products, there has been a recent surge of activity in HIBOR futures. This may owe something to the steep downtrend in interest rates this year, which could have prompted both those who expect it to continue and those who are content to lock in borrowing at current low rates, to enter the futures market in order to speculate or hedge on their respective hunches. All in all, as these various examples illustrate, the derivatives infrastructure in Hong Kong has developed well to meet the evolving requirements of the business and financial communities. Supervision Despite for the most part providing a beneficial service, derivatives trading also has the potential to bring disaster. Mere mention of the word Barings is no doubt sufficient to make the point. It is for this reason that the relevant authorities exercise supervision of derivatives activity. In the Hong Kong context, HKMA supervises the banks and other deposit taking institutions to ensure suitably prudent behaviour, while the SFC regulates exchange trading and the other players. I should perhaps make the point here that supervision is not aimed at suppressing activity, but rather at ensuring that risks are properly identified and managed and that disasters which might threaten systemic stability are avoided. Particular emphasis is placed on ensuring that management possesses sufficient understanding of the derivatives business and the associated risks, and has the appropriate internal mechanisms in place for monitoring and control. Officialdom in general, and central banks more especially, are sometimes characterised as being opposed to speculation and, by extension, as being suspicious of derivatives, which are often regarded as a convenient vehicle for speculation. That characterisation is mistaken. We are not opposed to speculation. Indeed, we recognise very clearly that financial markets cannot operate efficiently if the speculator is excluded. He plays a key role in the price formation process and is the essential counterparty to the hedger. The textbooks tell us that if the speculator stabilises prices he makes a profit, while if he doesn't he loses. The fact that speculators still exist is then taken as prima facie evidence that their activity is on balance stabilising, although I am also conscious of the counter-argument, namely that they are destabilising and lose money, but the population of them is constantly being replenished by fools who think they can do better. However, although we acknowledge the generally positive role of speculation, we are very much opposed to manipulation. The key distinction is that, whereas the speculator takes a view based on the price which he observes in the market and acts upon it, the manipulator uses his resources and the advantage of a dominant market position to try to influence the price - in other words, he is a potential price setter rather than a price taker. Particularly in small markets where relatively small deals may be able to move prices significantly, we need to be alert to this potential problem, which may, if unattended, seriously undermine one's vision of competitive, efficient markets. Information The prices at which derivatives trade contain information which may usefully supplement other market data available to central banks as a means of monitoring expectations and sentiment. Let me give just two examples. First, in the foreign exchange market, whereas the forward rate may provide a point estimate of the expected future rate, data on option prices for different strike prices can provide a probability distribution for the future rate. This additional information, available only as a by-product of derivatives trading, may be of interest to market analysts, including the monetary authorities. Within the HKMA we have conducted some research into this, which we are in the process of discussing with academics and other technicians. Second, with exchange traded products, where levels of activity are clearly visible, sudden surges or collapses in turnover may hint at shifts in sentiment for one reason or another. Although it may not always be clear what story best fits a particular statistical movement, it is sensible to be alert to such developments and try to understand the signals which they may give. 
 BIS Review 91/2001 3 Operations It may be considered natural for central banks, like any other financial institutions, to be active on their own account in the derivatives markets. Nevertheless, there are perhaps one or two cautions which might apply in the case of central banks. If a central bank is trading for profit - as it would usually be when, for instance, managing its foreign currency reserves- it may be presumed to follow the normal trading strategies of any portfolio manager, within specified guidelines and subject to appropriate risk controls of course. Derivatives may usefully be part of that, providing an efficient avenue for pursuing trading or hedging opportunities. It seems entirely reasonable for the central bank to be allowed to operate in this way, but, in derivatives as in the cash markets, the central bank may need to balance the objectives of fund management against those of its own monetary or exchange rate policy. There is also a question whether derivatives should be used as a deliberate tool for monetary policy purposes. Typical examples would be use of foreign exchange forwards or options to assist in maintaining exchange rate stability. A couple of years ago, partly in response to some academic debate on the subject, the HKMA did in fact examine the case for the Exchange Fund to write currency options. We concluded as follows: "… the writing of currency options by the HKMA appeared to be technically feasible and might be consistent with currency board principles if properly designed ….. In theory at least, the writing of currency options by a central bank could be a useful tool in helping to stabilise exchange markets under certain conditions …. However, … the theoretical benefits seemed to be outweighed by the disadvantages … [including] the complications that the writing of options would bring to the currency board system, and the possibility of negative perceptions that the HKMA was engaging in risky activities or lacked the means to support the currency board system in the spot market."2  The feasibility and advisability of using derivatives as a monetary instrument are subjects which have been debated over the years by academics and policymakers, and a few countries have relevant experiences to tell. A number of points seem worth making. First, in most instances, if you are confident in your monetary policy you should probably be up front in supporting it by your actions. If you don't possess sufficient resources for that support, you should certainly think twice before leveraging yourself in derivatives, even if it can be demonstrated that such a strategy might, if successful, be profitable - for the potential downside could be considerable. Second, although central banks and governments are nowadays much more transparent about their operations than previously, use of derivatives may in some instances provide some temporary disguise, but disguise would seldom be a very healthy reason for selecting a strategy. Third, as implied in the above quotation, the perception continues to exist that derivatives are a particularly risky activity, or one which might signal some degree of desperation. Despite the fact that such views may be irrational, a central bank may need to acknowledge public sensitivities and err on the side of conservatism in its operations. Fourth, in searching for the most cost-effective or reliable avenue for monetary operations, it should be borne in mind that the derivative markets may be more fickle and less liquid than the cash markets, perhaps the more so at the very moment when you might be most tempted to use them. In sum, I do not currently see a convincing case for using derivatives as a monetary policy tool. In the final analysis, however, a central bank is entitled to keep all its options open and to surprise the markets if it so wishes, provided that it is ultimately accountable for its actions. Conclusion I have tried to briefly explain some of the angles from which central bankers generally, and the HKMA in particular, view derivatives. This is perhaps a rather dry topic and I feel sure that there are many more interesting and challenging aspects of derivatives which will be discussed during these two days of seminars related to the Derivatives Expo.                                                       2  Record of discussion of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee Sub-committee on Currency Board Operations on 5 November 1999, reproduced in HKMA Quarterly Bulletin, February 2000. 
 BIS Review 91/2001 1 European Central Bank: Press conference – introductory statement Introductory statement by Mr Willem F Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank and Mr Christian Noyer, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, at the press conference, held in Frankfurt, 8 November 2001. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here to report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB.  The Governing Council conducted a comprehensive and in-depth examination of monetary and economic developments. Against the background of the available evidence, it analysed the implications for the maintenance of price stability in the euro area, taking a forward-looking and medium-term perspective. As a result, the Governing Council decided to lower the key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points. At this new level, the key ECB interest rates continue to be appropriate to ensure a favourable outlook for price stability over the medium term. In assessing the information which has accumulated over the past few weeks we concluded that inflationary pressures have further diminished. This was particularly apparent from the information under the second pillar of the ECB's monetary policy strategy, while information relating to the first pillar was also judged consistent with today's decision. The Governing Council considered today's assessment to be in line with available forecasts and its view of economic developments in the period ahead. It is expecting these views to be broadly confirmed by further incoming information on the economic situation. The ECB will publish its own projections in the December issue of the Monthly Bulletin.  Let me elaborate somewhat on the assessment provided under the two pillars of the monetary policy strategy of the ECB. With regard to the first pillar, after having grown at a strong pace over the previous few months, M3 growth increased further in September. However, the recent evolution needs to be seen as a reflection of an increased liquidity preference of investors in an environment of a relatively flat yield curve until August, developments in global stock markets and a surge in financial market uncertainty following the terrorist attacks of 11 September. In addition, the growth of credit to the private sector has continued to decline over recent months. Overall, despite the acceleration in M3 growth, current monetary developments do not signal risks to price stability in the medium term. We will continue to closely examine the underlying dynamics of monetary growth.  Regarding the second pillar, much clearer signals of a further reduction of inflationary pressures from the demand side have accumulated over recent weeks. Euro area real GDP growth will be weak in the second half of 2001. This is to be seen against the background of the ongoing weakness of the world economy, which depresses the demand for euro area exports. As a consequence, and also taking into account the high degree of uncertainty following the terrorist attacks of 11 September, the current environment is likely to lead to delays in investment activity and, to some extent, also to negatively affect private consumption growth in the euro area. Real GDP growth in the euro area is expected to remain below potential growth also for part of next year.  Further ahead, however, the conditions exist for a recovery to take place in the course of 2002 and economic growth to return to a more satisfactory path. The uncertainty currently overshadowing the world economy should diminish, and there are no major imbalances in the euro area which would require longer-term adjustment. Economic policies in the euro area as a whole remain geared towards price stability, the objectives of the Stability and Growth Pact, wage moderation and structural reform. Further positive effects on economic growth should stem from the impact of tax reductions in several member countries and from the fact that financing conditions are favourable.  As regards the outlook for prices in the euro area, recent developments confirm our earlier expectation of a gradual decline in inflation rates, resulting from the unwinding of the previous increase in energy prices and the absence of further shocks to food prices. In addition, and crucial for the medium term, two factors support the view that wage developments are less of a risk than was previously the case. First, the slowdown in economic activity should contribute to containing inflationary pressure stemming from the labour market. Second, there is now sufficient evidence that the increase in consumer price inflation was temporary, and this will help to keep inflation expectations low. Looking forward, inflation 
 2 BIS Review 91/2001 rates over the next few months will probably show some volatility, on account of base effects resulting from previous price movements. However, such short-term fluctuations should not distract from the medium-term trend. We can now expect that price stability will be safely restored in 2002. This view is confirmed by bond yield developments, which are consistent with financial markets expecting inflation rates in the euro area to be clearly below 2% over the medium term. Overall, as our assessment now points to a further abatement of inflationary pressures, this allowed us to reduce the key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points. This follows three previous interest rate reductions this year, bringing the total decrease to 150 basis points. The new level of interest rates is appropriate to maintain price stability over the medium term. This, in turn, will favour an environment conducive to restoring higher economic growth in the euro area. Interest rates across the entire yield curve are now very low by all measures and liquidity conditions are supportive to economic growth. At this juncture, I should like to recall our position as regards the impact of slower economic growth on the euro area countries' fiscal positions. While it is natural for an economic slowdown to have adverse effects on Member States' budgets, it is important that especially those countries with a budget position still not close to balance or in surplus and/or with high public debt-to-GDP ratios adhere to their medium-term consolidation plans. The current slowdown should not substantially change the scope for reaching the medium-term commitments they made under the Stability and Growth Pact and in the context of their stability programmes. Let me again emphasise that a medium-term perspective and continuous consolidation are essential for the conduct of fiscal policy in all euro area countries. This would give a firm signal to investors and consumers, thereby supporting confidence and contributing to a recovery. In their efforts to further expand the production potential of the euro area, governments should also give greater impetus to the implementation of structural reforms. Fiscal reforms, including those related to pension systems as well as to the level and composition of public revenue and expenditure, would provide the correct incentives. Labour and product market reforms will be beneficial to employment growth in the euro area and will improve the resilience of the euro area economy to adverse shocks in the future. While it may be perceived as more difficult to advance in these areas in an environment of weaker economic activity, the need to properly address rigidities should be much more obvious now than at times of buoyant growth. The current weakness should therefore be taken as a challenge to be met by stepping up reforms rather than allowing efforts to abate.  Finally, I would like to inform you that the Governing Council has decided that, as from today, it will – as a rule – assess the stance of the ECB's monetary policy only at its first meeting of the month. Accordingly, interest rate decisions will normally be taken during that meeting.  At the second meeting of the month, the Governing Council will deal for the most part with issues related to other tasks and responsibilities of the ECB and the Eurosystem. After the second meeting of the month, a press release on the ECB's monetary policy decisions will no longer be issued. Obviously, if warranted by the circumstances, the Governing Council can still decide to change the key ECB interest rates at any time, regardless of previously scheduled meetings (as was recently demonstrated by the decision to lower interest rates on 17 September 2001). We are now at your disposal for questions.
