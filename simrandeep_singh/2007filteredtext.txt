 ben s bernanke: the economic outlook testimony mr ben s bernanke, chairman board governor u federal reserve system, joint economic committee, u congress, washington dc, 28 march 2007. * * * chairman schumer, vice chairman maloney, representative saxton, member committee, thank invite morning present update outlook u.s. economy. i begin discussion real economic activity turn inflation. economic growth unite state slow recent quarters, reflect part economy’s transition rapid rate expansion experience precede year sustainable pace growth. real gross domestic product (gdp) rise annual rate roughly 2 percent second half 2006 appear expand similar rate early year. the principal source slowdown economic growth begin last spring substantial correction house market. follow extend boom housing, demand home begin weaken mid-2005. by middle 2006, sale new exist home fall 15 percent peak levels. homebuilder respond fall demand sharply curtail construction. even so, inventory unsold home rise level well recent historical norms. because decline house demand, pace house-price appreciation slow markedly, market experience outright price declines. the near-term prospect house market remain uncertain. sale new exist home flat, balance, second half last year. so far year, sale exist home hold up, indicator demand mortgage application home purchase, mortgage rate remain relatively low. however, sale new home fallen, continue decline start yet lead meaningful reduction inventory home sale. even demand house fall further, weakness residential construction likely remain drag economic growth time homebuilder try reduce inventory unsold home normal levels. development subprime mortgage market raise additional question house sector. delinquency rate variable-interest-rate loan subprime borrowers, account bite le 10 percent mortgage outstanding, climb sharply recent months. the flatten home price contribute increase delinquency make refinance difficult borrower little home equity. in addition, large increase early default recently originate subprime variable-rate mortgage cast serious doubt adequacy underwrite standard products, especially originate past year so. a result deterioration loan performance, investor increase scrutiny credit quality securitized mortgages, lender turn evidently tighten term standard apply subprime mortgage market. although turmoil subprime mortgage market create severe financial problem many individual families, implication development house market whole le clear. the ongoing tighten lend standards, although appropriate market response, reduce somewhat effective demand housing, foreclose property add inventory unsold homes. at juncture, however, impact broad economy financial market problem subprime market seem likely contained. in particular, mortgage prime borrower fixed-rate mortgage class borrower continue perform well, low rate delinquency. we continue monitor situation closely. business spend also slow recently. expenditure capital equipment decline fourth quarter 2006 early year. much weakness recent month type capital good use heavily construction motor vehicle industries, see soften demand type capital good well. although pullback explain recent moderation growth output, magnitude slowdown somewhat great would expect give normal evolution business cycle. in addition, inventory level industry – again, notably industry link construction motor vehicle production – rise course last year, lead firm cut production good align inventory sales. recent indicator suggest inventory adjustment process bi review 31/2007 1 may largely run course motor vehicle sector, remain imbalance industry may continue impose restraint industrial production time. despite recent weak readings, expect business investment equipment software grow moderate pace year, support high rate profitability, strong business balance sheets, relatively low interest rate credit spreads, continue expansion output sales. investment nonresidential structure (such office buildings, factories, retail space) also continue expand, although unusually rapid pace 2006. thus far, weakness house part manufacture appear spill significant extent sector economy. employment continue expand job loss manufacture residential construction offset gain sectors, notably health care, leisure hospitality, professional technical services, unemployment remain low historical standards. the continue increase employment, together pickup real wages, help sustain consumer spending, increase brisk pace second half last year continue well maintain far year. growth consumer spend continue support economic expansion come quarters. in addition, fiscal policy federal state local level impart small stimulus economic activity year. outside unite states, economic activity major trade partner continue grow briskly. the strength demand abroad help spur strong growth u.s. real exports, rise 9 percent last year, robust world economy continue provide opportunity u.s. exporter year. growth u.s. real import slow 3 percent 2006, part reflect drop real term import crude oil petroleum products. despite improvement trade performance, u.s. current account deficit remain large, average 6-1/2 percent nominal gdp 2006. overall, economy appear likely continue expand moderate pace come quarters. a inventory unsold new home work off, drag residential investment wane. consumer spend appear solid, business investment seem likely post moderate gains. this forecast subject number risks. to downside, correction house market could turn severe currently expect, perhaps exacerbate problem subprime sector. moreover, could yet see great spillover weakness house employment consumer spend occur thus far. the possibility recent weakness business investment persist additional downside risk. to upside, consumer spend – prove quite resilient despite house downturn increase energy price – might continue grow brisk pace, stimulate more-rapid economic expansion currently anticipate. let turn inflation situation. overall consumer price inflation come since last year, primarily result deceleration consumers’ energy costs. the consumer price index (cpi) increase 2.4 percent twelve month end february, 3.6 percent year earlier. core inflation slow modestly second half last year, recent read somewhat elevate level core inflation remain uncomfortably high. for example, core cpi inflation twelve month end february 2.7 percent, 2.1 percent year earlier. another measure core inflation monitor closely, base price index personal consumption expenditure exclude food energy, show similar pattern. core inflation, good measure underlie inflation trend overall inflation, seem likely moderate gradually time. despite recent increase price crude oil, energy price last year’s peak. if energy price remain near current levels, great stability cost produce non-energy good service reduce pressure core inflation time. of course, price oil commodity difficult predict, remain source considerable uncertainty inflation outlook. increase rent – market rent owner’s equivalent rent – account substantial part increase core inflation past year. the acceleration rent may result part shift demand toward rental house family find homeownership le financially attractive. rent begin decelerate demand owner-occupied house stabilize supply rental unit increases. however, extent time expect slow yet clear. 2 bi review 31/2007 another significant factor influence medium-term trend inflation public’s expectation inflation. these expectation important bear whether transitory influence prices, change energy costs, become embed wage price decision leave last imprint rate inflation. it encourage inflation expectation appear contained. although core inflation seem likely moderate gradually time, risk forecast upside. in particular, upward pressure inflation could materialize final demand exceed underlie productive capacity economy sustain period. the rate resource utilization high, see clearly tightness labor market. indeed, anecdotal report suggest business difficulty recruit well-qualified worker range occupations. measure labor compensation, though still grow moderate pace, show sign acceleration past year, likely part result tight labor market conditions. to sure, fast growth nominal labor compensation necessarily portend high inflation. increase compensation may offset high labor productivity absorb – least time – narrow firms’ profit margin rather pass consumer form high prices. in circumstances, gain nominal compensation would translate gain real compensation well. underlie productivity trend appear generally favorable, despite recent slow measures, markup price unit labor cost high historical standards, outcome certainly possible. moreover, economy grow moderate pace time, seem likely, pressure resource utilization ease. however, le benign possibility tight product market might allow firm pas high labor cost prices. in case, increase nominal compensation would translate increase purchase power worker would add inflation pressures. thus, high level resource utilization remain important upside risk continue progress reduce inflation. in regard monetary policy, federal open market committee leave target federal fund rate unchanged, 5-1/4 percent, since last june. to date, incoming data support view current stance policy likely foster sustainable economic growth gradual ebb core inflation. because core inflation level conducive achievement sustainable growth price stability, committee indicate statement follow recent meet predominant policy concern remain risk inflation fail moderate expected. however, uncertainty around outlook increase somewhat recent weeks. consequently, committee also indicate future policy decision depend evolution outlook inflation economic growth, imply incoming information. thank you. i would happy take questions. bi review 31/2007 3 mario draghi: reflection monetary financial policy – governor baffi’s monetary policy address mr mario draghi, governor bank italy, centro di economia monetaria e finanziaria “paolo baffi”, università commerciale luigi bocconi, milan, 15 march 2007. * * * the “paolo baffi” centre monetary financial economics invite give talk revive custom “reflections monetary financial policy” interrupt decade. i think would appropriate start new series explore personality monetary policy paolo baffi, centre dedicated. baffi governor bank italy five difficult year country known. it easy discus problem beset monetary policy year decision take use today’s language. since then, condition italy’s economy politics change radically, prevail opinion link money economy, role central bank, objectives. the lexicon monetary economics mutated. the year paolo baffi helm bank italy, period exceptional economic political difficulties, mark start transition towards present manner interpret conduct monetary policy. review year help u recall importance institutional conquest take granted. intellectual root institutional framework paolo baffi one first professional economist take bank italy; 1936. he take leadership bank august 1975, day guido carli’s resignation, first governor make career within bank. many write bear witness intellectual evolution choice economist whose outlook embrace equally theoretical interest policy concerns. in 1935, italy invade ethiopia, baffi’s mentor, giorgio mortara, carry campaign international sanction impose italy giornale degli economisti. baffi, twenty-four time, come favour international economic cooperation, anxious nationalistic illusion entertain professor, retort accusation “internationalistic illusions”. the young man obviously see ahead old one, soon suffer effect nationalism transform anti-semitism. what interest u here, however, fact baffi attribute sound judgement time “diet classical text economic liberalism”.1 this leave endure mark train economist reflect subsequent theoretical output, le policies, influence formidable constraint exist time governor. economic liberalism, accord luigi einaudi, much economic doctrine way reasoning, take apparently simple rule and, systematic use theory, derive indirect distant effect often opposite proponents’ intentions. undoubtedly, one main characteristic baffi’s think focus indirect effects, link various element economic system. his concern make plain relation real financial phenomenon root “national monetary balance sheet” develop aftermath war, embryo today’s financial accounts. in 1953 baffi member committee appoint pronounce reform iri’s bylaw future role. while majority committee favour creation ministry state hold company increase role iri promote economic growth, baffi others hold solution lay sound regulation market.2 1 p. baffi, “giorgio mortara e la banca d’italia”, id., nuovi studi sulla moneta (milan: giuffrè, 1973). 2 ministero dell’industria e del commercio, l’istituto per la ricostruzione industriale (turin: utet, 1955), vol. ii, pp. 575-85. bi review 31/2007 1 the 1960s 1970s were, admission baffi’s predecessor, governor carli, period political power closely interweave monetary, financial supervisory policy; also dangerous time repercussion performance economy, later.3 in first half 1970s, particularly 1973 1976, dense web constraint rule develop regard banks’ portfolios, subsidize credit, interest rates, capital movements. baffi never come openly this, scepticism, root read classical text economic liberalism, secret anyone inside bank italy. to understand central bank’s modus operandi year must consider powerful influence exert predominant economic culture. it market culture. it influence, combine vest interests, often direct economic policy towards solution follow market. in italy, keynesianism acquire foothold academia towards middle 1960s version gain credence among policy-makers distinctly dirigiste flavour prevail internationally: economic policy support demand earn plaudit politician economists, generally, beyond actual keynesian propositions, saw broad government intervention economic activity, especially investment, mean perpetuate growth 1950s. development, industrialization social distributive conflict issue attract best mind vision political leaders. what ask monetary policy produce growth, capital formation, narrow gap italy european partners, balance-of-payments equilibrium. price stability secondary concern. the autonomy central bank view essential stability. in italy, interest focus real economy; role money, cause effect inflation common subject inquiry. baffi’s study money thus constitute notable exception. the discussion franco modigliani 1967 top management bank italy development econometric model exemplify difficulty describe problem monetary policy time use today’s language criteria. in meet governor carli define bank’s main objective foster sufficient level income allow investment would close distance italy member european economic community.4 the governor mention price stability subordinate aim, interpreted, moreover, solely alignment level international prices, say objective defence competitiveness. the pre-eminence objective price stability formal sanction; share public opinion, comprehend academic political circles. monetary management increasingly entrust administrative control credit, namely ceiling growth bank lend (introduced 1973) requirement bank invest part portfolio long-term fixed-income securities. initially design allocative purpose support private investment, instrument almost immediately employ macroeconomic purpose facilitate finance treasury. effective rapidly curb aggregate demand, continue use end 1980s spite allocative cost fact soon come circumvented. treasury bill main instrument finance treasury. at auction customary bank italy submit bid guarantee security offer would take floor price. since often set level market would subscribe whole quantity issued, oblige bank make systematic intervention prevent control liquidity creation. the interbank market anaemic inefficient. head government treasury minister listen bank italy, bank limit independence use instrument monetary policy. the discount rate fix treasury, albeit basis proposal governor, nearly every act bank formally subject government’s oversight. the prerequisite autonomy central bank comparable enjoy today’s european system central bank lacking. 3 g. carli, intervista sul capitalismo italiano, edit e. scalari (bari: laterza, 1977), p. 42. 4 g.m. rey p. peluffo, dialogo tra un professore e la banca d’italia, vallecchi, florence, 1995, p. 54. 2 bi review 31/2007 the transition towards “monetary constitution” in summer 1975, baffi succeed carli, italian economy fall deep recession since war, trigger oil shock credit tighten agree international monetary fund order counter imbalance external accounts, upsurge inflation depreciation lira. the shock hit italy height expansionary cycle, time extreme weakness economic policy management. wages, rise annual rate 20 per cent, lose link productivity. the devaluation-inflation spiral seem untamable, least perverse system indexation. the treasury’s deficits, push increase public spend control, exceed value compatible non-inflationary financing. the central bank, unheeded, watch sidelines. in international arena, prevail view role monetary policy changing. the bundesbank announce money supply target since 1974, federal reserve, paul volcker, would adopt quantitative monetary target 1979. in conclude remark read 31 may 1976, baffi, recall similar opinion einaudi carli dramatic moments, observe severe limitation impose institutional framework allow bank italy freedom action. in time financial imbalance wage inflation, stressed, “control money supply abandon order avoid, least postpone, bad evils”. however, baffi give pursue fundamental goal: move italy towards institutional arrangement field monetary policy would guarantee monetary stability long run. this process would actually get way start 1980s, “divorce” bank italy treasury promote treasury minister beniamino andreatta governor carlo azeglio ciampi. during era governor, baffi launch “campaign persuasion” direct public opinion political forces. it conviction monetary policy, order successful, back consensus society objectives, include price stability. italy still far situation. in baffi’s view, prevail determine decision regard public finance wage trend alliance different political social group fuel inflation. in governor’s view first requirement reform monetary constitution principle safeguard monetary stability become linchpin monetary policy. however, consider insurmountable obstacle absence within italian legal framework provision, germany, expressly entrust central bank task defend currency. a systematic search make argument support assign bank autonomous responsibility fix pursue monetary base objectives: internal meet possibility repeatedly raise call government enter commitment effect use suggestion similar import put forward international institution european economic community international monetary fund. a one baffi’s lead collaborator recalled, invite bank’s legal expert delve every legal nook cranny search desire precept.5 the absence well-defined institutional framework make necessary adopt complicate logical exercise argue favour defence currency: baffi principle “no taxation without representation”, violate inflation insofar cause arbitrary redistribution, one call upon give central bank task defend currency. in “campaign persuasion” baffi frequently discuss monetary policy choice press. he believe announce monetary objective factor transparency would durably alter central banks’ modus operandi. a say later, “the action central bank long cloak silence, perhaps never again. whereas past silence see guarantee independence, today achieve give explicit account one’s actions”.6 5 m. sarcinelli, “governor baffi’s monetary policy”, banca nazionale del lavoro, quarterly review, no. 179, december 1991, pp. 513-35. 6 banca d’italia, annual report 1978, p.158. bi review 31/2007 3 baffi strongly oppose tangle credit foreign exchange administrative control monetary policy conducted. he find profoundly unsatisfactory “in direct central bank action way suffocate system posse valid parameter mechanisms; constrain volume credit potentially express flow monetary base possible regulate flow; channel flow credit”. he convince cost distortion produce administrative control substantial last monetary effect ephemeral: long run aggregate bring “back line basic economic conditions”. monetary management em negotiation baffi win battle straitjacket impose market. the emergency tackle, exceptionally difficult situation face regard tax wage force continue use administrative constraint put place predecessor early years. monetary policy constrain fact price stability explicitly target belief consensus italy. he convince monetary rule, however necessary well formulated, could replace discipline decision conduct society whole follow, precede, adoption discipline. accord expression use conclude remark annual report 1975, monetary management year “coming resemble economy siege”. at begin 1976, political, business, trade union academic pressure lead ease liquidity conditions, low level official reserve open government crisis trigger violent attack lira, presage underestimate end previous year, lead close foreign exchange market forty days. the turbulence foreign exchange market continue year up down succession restrictive measure include exchange credit controls, reintroduction ceiling loans, increase compulsory reserve rise discount rate total nine points. these step effective bring external balance back equilibrium, replenish official reserve repay foreign loans. the exchange rate fell one third; inflation rise 23 per cent slow 12 per cent. recourse administrative credit foreign exchange measure avoided. contemporary document confirm baffi use administrative control also show convince use could rule give influence exert state market. late 1978, dramatic year saw kidnap assassination aldo moro kill escort, negotiation begin italy’s membership european exchange rate mechanism. not consider acceptance external constraint provide powerful support curb factor − rents, wage public expenditure − prevent italy definitively overcome emergency last long threaten stability country’s institutions. baffi’s position cautious: recognize belong european monetary system could help bring inflation, believe result agreement domestic policy start make enter exchange rate commitment. during negotiation baffi advocate system broad fluctuation band 6 8 per cent central parity participant countries. this idea disagreeable bundesbank, fear inflexible exchange rate partner mark high inflation low credibility. baffi well aware risk constraint associate exchange rate parity unrelated performance fundamental economy. he fear result italy achieve three previous year term replenish reserve adjust current account balance payment might jeopardize participation mechanism would force lira appreciate real terms, detriment exports. italy join ems, broad fluctuation band apply rest system members. the exchange rate constraint help damp inflation first half 1980s. it symbolic value perceive political social force prerequisite italian participation european integration, bank italy able implement counter-inflationary monetary policy. baffi’s caution regard cogency exchange rate constraint may prove excessive, perhaps, system realignments much frequent could predict exchange rate mechanism agreed. at time, availability 4 bi review 31/2007 broad fluctuation band, argue for, allow degree freedom monetary policy thus limit risk speculative attack typify fix exchange rate regimes. in baffi’s words, mechanism permit “a soft transition, without jumps, discontinuity market rate trigger destabilize speculation often enable reap enormous profits”.7the legacy paolo baffi this proper place recount well-known judicial affair force paolo baffi resign governor 20 september 1979, totally exonerate charge two year later. a late said, incrimination oblige contend “for two year bad money justice system even worse”. quite apart machination behind scene indictment, major repercussion bank italy, must admit institutional architecture day – director general’s responsibility include bank supervision also member board director imi – weakness, late rectified. if result achieve battle inflation partial baffi’s governorship, success come course 1980s 1990s trace seed sow commitment new monetary constitution. during governorship question separate responsibility government central bank posed. the process subsequently set motion produce first abandonment prohibition monetary finance treasury, assignment bank italy power set discount rate, formal recognition independence and, finally, formal mandate, within framework european system central banks, work objective price stability. the full achievement independence nevertheless take another fifteen years, major legislative reform and, lastly, international treaty. in 1980s early 1990s, course reform initiate spur part bank italy, broad efficient money government security market created. the effectiveness indirect instrument monetary control increased. paolo baffi governor perhaps best symbolically portray ferryman ideas, exertion image implies. his intellectual heritage liberal, embrace leaven modernity find political economic culture day. but action fetter harshness times. these years, let u forget, bitter social conflict, year terrorism. paolo baffi’s awareness drama social problem painfully acute, well know close year

nationalbank, arrange bank finland, ivalo, 23 march 2007. * * * thank invite talk financial stability danish perspective. speech governor torbenielsen i start give outline danish financial system change nordic bank landscape. i talk role danmark nationalbank safeguard financial stability. look ahead, one priority area stress test danish financial system. our ambition learn bank affect economy stress situations. finally, i touch upon topical issue, namely lend households, household debt house prices. the danish financial system change nordic bank landscape the danish bank sector heterogeneous dominate two large bank groups, danske bank nordea, cover 45 percent danish bank market. there small number medium-sized institutions, jyske bank, sydbank, nykredit bank fih, total market share almost 20 percent. and 150 small bank share residual market share 35 percent. 2 bi review 31/2007 compare nordic countries, concentration ratio denmark – measure concentration ratio cr5 – stand out. however, nordic bank market amongst consolidate europe – similar small european economies. in large country like germany uk find concentration ratio around 20 35 percent, respectively. the bulk bank consolidation nordic country take place – case denmark – shortly bank crisis finland, norway sweden early 1990s. we experience second wave around turn century formation nordea spectacular case. and recent event danske bank purchase sampo bank last autumn. there significant presence foreign bank denmark dominate nordea. foreign bank subsidiary hold around 30 percent total assets. expansion foreign bank denmark typically stem organic growth via new branch subsidiaries, instead accomplish via merger acquisitions. bi review 31/2007 3 the presence foreign bank denmark comparable norway sweden. the finnish situation exceptional, since nordea bank finland count swedish subsidiary sampo bank danish subsidiary. with danske bank acquisition sampo bank, two big player nordic-baltic bank market danske bank nordea. danske bank large term lend total assets, nordea great regard equity market value. the role danmark nationalbank safeguard financial stability danmark nationalbank monitor assess financial stability denmark. the danmark nationalbank act 1936 state danmark nationalbank shall ”maintain safe secure currency system country, […] facilitate regulate traffic money extension credit”. the approach danmark nationalbank consider general risk financial system rather risk individual financial institutions. the latter task danish financial supervisory authority. at danmark nationalbank define financial stability state exits: "when financial system robust enough problem experience within sector spread prevent financial market function provider capital financial services." and actually solve task relation financial stability? firstly, seek analyse key risk financial sector. this include situation unlikely arise, could potentially involve high cost society. we perform stress test financial system order calculate large adverse impact exist buff able absorb. we publish analysis annual financial stability report since 2002. denmark now, years, enjoy favourable economic conditions, benefit financial sector, danish bank institution show record-high earnings. overall, financial institution late financial stability report find robust, still seem black cloud horizon could threaten financial stability denmark. another task danmark nationalbank relation financial stability ensure denmark secure effective financial infrastructure safely use settlement payments, security trade financial transactions. danmark nationalbank statutory obligation oversee payment settlement system denmark. 4 bi review 31/2007 part imf's financial sector assessment program danish financial sector 2005-06 ass core element danish financial infrastructure relation international standards. the imf recommend changes. danmark nationalbank work responsible system ensure necessary improvement made. however, blindly adhere recommendations. for example, imf recommend establish buff pool ensure settlement security transaction retail payment even large participant able settle payment obligations. danmark nationalbank find best safeguard ensure participant easy flexible access liquidity, combine participants' large portfolio security pledge collateral loan danmark nationalbank. the figure show large danish bank institutions’ maximum net outgo payment ratio liquidity reserve 2005 day bank institution large payment obligation exclude settlement. the figure show danish bank plenty liquidity reserve even large bank fail settle. consequently, currently see need special measure ensure settlement danish systems. a third area look situation financial system affect dramatic external events. these could act terrorism, widespread epidemics, natural disaster situation financial system threaten collapse. danmark nationalbank chair task force participation financial supervisory authority sector representative late spring present suggestion ensure coordination financial institutions' business continuity plan situations. finally, danmark nationalbank act lender last resort danish banks. danmark nationalbank extend loan bank urgently need liquidity cannot procure market, even though bank solvent. fortunately, rarely call that. should situation occur necessary rescue ail bank, danmark nationalbank's position market-based solution found. nothing definite say beforehand danmark nationalbank's role. it would depend concrete assessment situation – direct indirect – consequence danish bank system danish society. bi review 31/2007 5 stress test a i mention before, imf visit denmark connection financial sector assessment program. the overall conclusion

mr ardian fullani, governor bank albania, meet “the bank system 2007: governor communicate market”, tirana, 26 march 2007. * * * distinguish participants, consider today’s meet special importance line institutional tradition intensive communication general public, particularly main market stakeholders, i would like thank participation. i think meet increase degree mutual understanding, aim enhance financial market efficiency. allow start address, make brief summary late macroeconomic developments. likewise 2005, albanian economy, even last year, continue path towards macroeconomic consolidation. the country’s gdp estimate 5 percent growth real terms. this growth associate price stability, denominate average annual inflation 2.4 percent. the monetary conditions, characterise historically low interest rate stable exchange rate, favour rise investment consumption economy. particularly, reflect even rapid credit growth, sustain economy growth. the fiscal development result within program levels, contribute consolidation public finance budget deficit control. the extension country’s economic activity associate increase foreign trade exchanges. the balance payment 2006 record positive terms, sustain exchange rate stability. from boa’s monetary policy viewpoint, i would like underscore year 2006 coincide change previous direction. initially july late november 2006, boa’s supervisory council rise key interest rate 0,25 pp, lead 5,5 percent, 5 percent end june 2006. the bank albania decision reflection number risk factors, whose presence constitute potential risk long-term inflation performance, which, i re-emphasise, legal viewpoint, constitute primary objective. the bank albania confident decision appropriate serve orient inflationary expectation within target range. end-2006 first quarter 2007, well current inflation forecast indicate successful direction. however, i avail opportunity re-emphasise remain totally commit successfully monitor current development implication may entail future development. our focus continue control inflationary pressure economy. to end, i would like attract bank system attention new project bank albania, go assist u lot regard. our researches, business consumer sentiment succeed attain appropriate dimension condition lack financial market expectation inflation, exchange rate key interest rate. in near future, new requirement make bank system, precisely i previously said: which bank’s expectation inflation, exchange rate repo rate short long run. personally, i consider new challenge bank system; therefore i would insist whole bank system deal seriously problem, timely incorporate scientific analysis research centre organisational structures. i confident bank system already understand that, inter alia, time institution pay attention development economy, intensify analysis current future developments. another issue i deal address monetary policy decision-making perception implementation. give current stage financial market development albania, high level euroization objective subjective factors, i would say monetary transmission efficiency yet parameter develop financial markets. the currency market still bi review 31/2007 1 concentrated; specific segment characterise insignificant trade volume high volatility. effective liquidity management important element us, which, central bank, go beyond mechanic management excess liquidity withdrawal injection case shortage. by manage liquidity, aim implement monetary policy decision make bank albania supervisory council market. liquidity management intend control short-term interest rates, keep line monetary policy decisions. concretely, frequent use instruments, besides main instrument bank albania, reflect bank albania’s determination term control short-term interest rates. i would also like point prevent solve situation liquidity shortage excess sufficient achieve liquidity management goal central bank; effective liquidity management ensure smooth re-allocation among bank system operators. a result liquidity concentration, would reduce short-term interest rate volatility. in framework, 2007, bank albania start application new regulation “on repurchase reverse repurchase agreements” bring novelty intervention effective distribution bank system liquidity. this development regulatory framework foster repo market among commercial banks. it contribute establishment active inter-bank liquidity market active liquidity management commercial banks. not information also real time transmission unquestionable importance financial market. in context, i would like emphasize though central bank necessary statistic estimate banks’ position operations, expect work enhance transparency regard. to encourage bank

“regulatory change european bank – outcome bank economy poland”, warsaw, 14 march 2007. * * * welcome session devote sepa project – single euro payment area – context polish payment system. when google sepa, first website result list site scottish environment protection agency, closely follow ecb’s website sepa (single euro payment area). the pagerank site 6, mean important internet. since introduction euro banknote coin 2002, consumer able make cash payment throughout euro area single purse use single currency. the sepa project represent next major step towards close european integration; allow consumer make cashless payment throughout euro area single account basic conditions, regardless location. in 2002, bank industry take challenge project create european payment council (epc). the epc define new rule procedure euro payments. to that, involve stakeholder euro area, also country european union, poland obviously included, well iceland, liechtenstein, norway switzerland. community outside euro area thus opportunity participate euro payment systems, able adopt sepa standard practices, thereby contribute establishment single market payment services. the epc plan first sepa product come market begin next year. therefore, today’s bank forum excellent opportunity in-depth discussion role place polish payment infrastructure sepa world. lady gentlemen, i please present discussant panel, alphabetical order: mr. ryszard drużyński, vice president raiffeisen bank polska, mr. krzysztof kalicki, president management board deutsche bank polska, mr. ronnie richardson, president management board kredyt bank, mr. witold zieliński, vice president management board citibank handlowy. i would like discussion broad dynamic, that's feel free join it. first, i would like draw attention fact change ahead u need move towards integrate payment market, bring substantial economic benefits. the sepa introduce comparable services, also foster competition drive innovation. institution able embrace new technological development offer customer additional service benefit new integrate market. in competitive integrate economy, forward-looking view require retail payment level safety efficiency comparable best national system place today. undoubtedly, approach considerably influence balance power european market payment services, well local market. the propose mechanism favour consolidation process sector payment infrastructure providers, possibly also bank sector itself. sepa stand (s)speed, (e)efficiency, (p)positiveness (a)automatisation. it important sepa project view “one-shot operation”, rather continually evolve project foster european integration, seek improve aspect euro area retail payment market ongoing basis. the sepa also make notable contribution so-called lisbon agenda, aim foster competitiveness ensure continuous development european economy. the national bank poland, forward-looking act institution, support development polish bank sector, participating, two year now, target system, proceed intensive preparation transition bi review 29/2007 1 new platform – target2. it worth remind initiative lead considerable drop charge cross-border transfer euro correspondent banking, although time drop benefit mainly banks, hardly clients. sepa consist follow elements: single currency, single set euro payment instrument – credit transfers, direct debit card payments, efficient process infrastructure euro payments, common technical standards, common business practices, harmonise legal basis, ongoing development new customer-oriented services. i sure many wonder "why sepa?". to answer question think like europeans. currently, euro area economy unable fully exploit benefit monetary union. customer face difficulty make euro retail payment euro area countries, payment often turn time-consuming. a long case, euro cannot view fully implement single currency. despite introduction euro 1999 development target, common large-value payment system euro, low-value electronic payment (i.e. retail payments) continue process differently throughout euro area. overall, number variety payment instruments, standard process infrastructure retail payment really change since introduction euro. in environment, facilitate flow payments, company substantial number cross-border payment maintain bank account country business. imagine enterprise poland keep bank account voivodship order operate efficiently, voivodship different settlement system different legal regulations. would enterprise situation able operate efficiently now? what would mean cost competitiveness polish bank price payment services? this fragmentation affect cross-border payment also national euro payments, prevent innovation competition euro area level. payer payee may also subject different rule requirement depend country origin. the creation common framework create opportunity innovative payment solution offer irrespective national borders. the goal sepa thus create integrated, competitive innovative retail payment market non-cash euro payments, which, time, conduct entirely electronically. a such, sepa benefit customers. new payment instrument available throughout euro area, make life easy consumer business. consumer need one bank account. from account, able make euro credit transfer direct debit payment anywhere euro area easily make national payments. they could, instance, pay rent child study abroad, pay holiday home, pay service provide european companies, e.g. mobile telephone services, insurance companies, utilities, etc. people live, work study outside home country long need one bank account home another one abroad. the use payment card efficient, consumer able use card euro payments. this reduce necessity people carry cash. innovative service offer consumer irrespective national borders. the long-term goal bank industry sepa payment instrument use electronic form. payment easily combine e-services case individual corporate clients. these include e-invoicing, mobile internet payment initiation, airline e-tickets, credit advice e-reconciliation. a consequence, consumer spend le time handle payments. everything easier, fast cheap ... long term. payment card become favourite payment instrument consumers, increasingly replace cheque cash payments. the use card thus expect grow future. thank creation single euro payment area, acquirer able process sepa-compliant card payments, even across borders. in sepa environment, merchant able choose card payment process entity euro; increase competition reduce costs. 2 bi review 29/2007 point-of-sale terminal euro area become increasingly standardised. a consequence, wide choice terminal providers, merchant able accept wide range card single terminal. the increase competition payment card system also drive fees. this vision anticipate benefit integrate europe, question i would like ask panelist today follows: will sepa reinforce competitiveness polish entrepreneurs?; how fast act?; what role play play ensure success polish economy, enterprise consumer sepa era? it seem key question answer forum sepa polska could develop, month come, optimal strategy launch new payment product polish market. let’s also look local situation. by provide new payment instrument euro area-wide infrastructures, sepa ensure bank expand business compete euro area level, bank offer service easily individual euro area. bank also expand business offer customer value-added service top sepa products. it worth refer regulation no 2560/2001 european commission, establish principle equal charge cross-border payment comparable domestic payment within eu, turn create imbalance bank fee cost cross-border payments. this imbalance overcome handle cross-border payment reorganise become efficient inexpensive handle national payments, primary goal sepa. an aspect deserve particular attention discussion sepa harmonisation law within payment area. the propose payment service directive (psd) establish necessary legal framework sepa payment also apply exist national payment products. the aim directive harmonise market access requirement non-bank payment service providers. this create level play field enhance competition national markets. the directive provide clarity certainty regard core right obligation user provider payment services. it also provide necessary legal framework sepa, harmonise existing, differing, national legal requirements. please note eurosystem see sepa “an integrate market payment service subject effective competition distinction cross-border national payment within euro area.” over long term, euro area payment become domestic, reach level safety efficiency least par best perform national payment system today. let u consider together potential benefit sepa polish market participants. the follow question seem particular importance here: • what’s role place polish payment infrastructure sepa world? • will sepa increase consolidation polish bank sector? • will sepa reinforce competitiveness polish entrepreneurs? • what role play play ensure sepa contribute success polish economy increase consumer satisfaction? • what benefit may polish payment market participant gain poland join euro area? now, let ask president take floor. bi review 29/2007 3 bi review 28/2007 1 svein gjedrem: the economic outlook norway address mr svein gjedrem, governor norge bank (central bank norway), invite foreign embassy representatives, norge bank, oslo, 22 march 2007. the address base assessment present norge bank’s press conference follow executive board’s monetary policy meet 15 march, monetary policy report 1/07 previous speeches. please note text may differ slightly actual presentation. the chart pdf-format find norge bank’s website. * * * excellencies, lady gentlemen, first all, i would like welcome norge bank. this event give opportunity discus development norwegian economy present norge bank’s view economic outlook norway. it also give u occasion discus issue mutual interest informal setting. the norwegian economy affect several positive supply-side shock last decade. i think term effect increase global trade free flow labour across national borders. i want discus shock impact economic growth inflation. these shock also affect price norwegian house market, strong impact income petroleum sector thereby transfer fund norwegian petroleum fund. economic development monetary policy norway orient towards low stable inflation, annual consumer price inflation close 2.5 per cent time. norge bank operate flexible inflation target regime. both variability inflation variability output employment give weight interest-rate setting. inflation decelerate markedly end 1980s mid-1990s since low stable considerably low variability earlier. over past 5-10 years, inflation fairly close to, somewhat low target. 2 bi review 28/2007 the norwegian economy grow strongly, follow pronounce upswing since summer 2003. growth strong economic upturn mid-1990s. the continuous growth period recent year long ever record quarterly national accounts, include figure back 1978. average real growth rate past three year well 4 per cent. since economic recovery started, gradually broadened. capacity utilisation high industries, report limit capacity regions. the number unfilled vacancy rising, labour shortage report almost every occupational category. there shortage drivers, pre-school teachers, supervisors, engineers, carpenters, architects, auditors, accountants, it personnel health workers. it probably since 1970s find widespread report purely physical production constraints, example form shortage rig equipment petroleum industry shortage plank, concrete insulation construction industry. bi review 28/2007 3 unemployment fall markedly past year. the pace decline level unemployment reminiscent two early cyclical peaks, one mid-1980s one begin end 1990s continue present decade. both boom culminate sharply accelerate cost wage inflation. supply-side shock norwegian economy the combination strong growth, high capacity utilisation low inflation reflection favourable global development number positive supply-side shock norwegian economy. the global expansion recent year result strong growth norwegian export industries. employment increase unemployment declined. the favourable labour market boost household optimism support private consumption. strong demand growth solid profitability also pave way growth business fix investment norway. so far, weaken u house market pronounce spill effects. growth china india strong euro area experience broad-based upturn. global growth probably le dependent demand good service u case earlier. the global expansion also result high price many norwegian export goods. the increase oil price past 4-5 year important. high oil price long period 4 bi review 28/2007 boost oil investment prospect high investment level sustain come years. oil price peak around usd 75 per barrel summer 2006. late autumn, price fell. current future price indicate market participant believe price remain usd 60 per barrel come years. a fall price number commodity market begin 2007 raise question whether pronounce price rise recent year reversed. the experience previous commodity price cycle indicate rise price gradually lead increase supply reduce demand. this turn lead fall prices. follow long period expansion, international financial market mark unrest around end february. it still early say whether turbulence signal weaken global growth prospects. increase integration china, india emerge economy world trade, conjunction low tariff reduce trade barriers, lead decline price import finish goods. this effect strengthen significant increase share import low-cost countries. for example, clothe footwear, audiovisual equipment, furniture white good show strong price declines. low price import consumer goods, combine high price commodity exports, result strong improvement norway’s term trade. since 2002, term trade bi review 28/2007 5 improve 40 per cent. a similar situation see since world war i, earn ship industry export industry exceptionally high period. the supply foreign labour increase markedly eu enlargement 2004. over past two years, labour inflow account 30 per cent growth labour force. norwegian company also able considerably bold undertake new assignment investment know procure labour throughout europe. in addition increase labour inflow poland, lithuania central european countries, long benefit inflow labour sweden. many worker temporary assignment consumption primarily concentrate home country. the norwegian economy see net capacity increase. inward labour migration delay fall unemployment expansion. it also reduce bottleneck economy curb impact fall unemployment wage growth. labour inflow also dampen effect wage growth, probably wage level foreign worker somewhat low norwegian labour. moderate wage growth reduce labour costs’ share mainland business-sector income, particularly tradable good sectors. in manufacturing, wage share show trend fall since mid-1990s level low since 1970 past years. 6 bi review 28/2007 the wage share fall also many oecd countries. emerge economies’ entry global trade result sharp increase supply labour. the result fall global price labour relative return capital. the wage share equilibrium may therefore reduced. increase possibility relocate production abroad may weaken labour’s bargain power moderate pay demands. during current upturn, also see rise price domestically produce good service low imply historical relationship inflation wage productivity growth. increase competition product market may dampen rise prices. in survey norge bank’s regional network 58 per cent company respond competition increase past 2-3 years, 15 per cent report competition decreased. in retail trade services, almost 70 per cent respond competition intensified. many company experience increase competition attribute entry operators, include foreign operators, market. bi review 28/2007 7 the norwegian business sector quick integrate information technology. this apply company compete international market supply good service domestic market. in comparison countries, particularly productivity gain bank service sector stand out. example automate process swift payment financial industry improve inventory management system commerce transport. in sum, positive supply side shock increase growth capacity norwegian economy, play part keep inflation low level. monetary policy assessment monetary policy influence economy lag. norge bank set interest rate view stabilise inflation close target medium term. the interest rate path provide reasonable balance path inflation path capacity utilisation. when reduce interest rate 2003, demand output rapidly pick up. however, take long time employment rise next phase pick-up employment fall unemployment also long. but upturn enter mature phase. the enterprise regional network report capacity constraint limit growth. unemployment fall markedly past year. wage growth appear rising, far gradually. price many input service build material rise markedly. consumer price inflation also expect pick ahead. thus, interest rate rising. 8 bi review 28/2007 the experience previous business cycle show wage price inflation may increase markedly late phase upturn. high interest rate counter development. however, must also prevent inflation become entrench well 2.5 per cent. we therefore mindful effect high interest rate krone exchange rate inflation low. positive supply-side condition hold inflation far suggest gradual approach, ass effect interest rate increase new information economic developments. at meet 15 march, norge bank’s executive board present interest rate path show chart. the board decide key policy rate lie interval 4-5 per cent period publication next monetary policy report 27 june, conditional economic development broadly line projections. furthermore, key policy rate expect move 5 per cent around end 2007. economic development uncertain. the uncertainty surround interest rate ahead illustrate shade area chart, intend capture outcome 70 per cent probability. long-term interest rates, income growth house price favourable economic development norway impact development property markets. house price rise sharply past 14 years. real house price almost trebled. the rise house price considerably strong early span long period. with exception month 2003, house price rise continuously since 1992. this second long period rise real price since 1819. statistic early year exist. bi review 28/2007 9 norway country house price show strong rise long period. house price inflation particularly high ireland netherlands, denmark, uk spain also stand out. the country house price inflation high country economic growth strongest. since price rise tandem many countries, natural look common drive forces. with increase cross-border flow intermediate goods, capital increasingly labour, price largely reflect growth competition global economy. if capital labour become expensive one country, business relocate production. price fix factor production, property, hand reflect income development different countries. consequently, rise property price tend high country income growth highest. 10 bi review 28/2007 external domestic interest rate low environment solid growth. long-term interest rate fall sharply nominal real term since begin 1990s. inflation decline contribute fall nominal interest rates. a stable inflation environment also result low real interest rate investor become certain returns. furthermore, would appear high save part world push long-term interest rates. save high oil-producing countries, china asian countries. long-term interest rate norway largely shadow external interest rate like country norway keep inflation check. norwegian household primarily finance house purchase mean floating-rate loans. long-term interest rate still considerable importance provide information future path short-term interest rate borrower expect time. unusually low short-term interest rate probably also boost rate increase house price recent years, effect reverse interest rate raise normal level. short-term interest rate influence path house price past 15 years, period low interest rate follow period high interest rates. norge bank’s key policy rate therefore limit importance house price inflation period 15 20 years. the house stock norway, number good 2.2 million dwellings, show little change one year next. a result, high demand house primarily translate high price short term. in 1990s, house start norway fairly low relation growth number households. moreover, population growth high recent years, largely reflect bi review 28/2007 11 high level immigration. in 2006, population increase 40 000 number household roughly 30 000. furthermore, migration pattern norway follow business cycle. migration densely populate area rising. demand high standard new build regulation also push house construction cost thereby house prices. the main determinant house price inflation long income, unemployment, interest rate residential construction. over past years, inward migration domestic migration pattern may also contributed. in past year, however, house price inflation high imply factors. a large share increase 2006 cannot explain previous patterns. development since begin 1990s may engender expectation house price continue rise. this may increase house purchase pure investment purpose induce young buyer enter house market early otherwise. the house market may state euphoria. the rise house price accompany sharp increase household debt. in norway, household debt almost twice level disposable income, debt income ratio high ever. it high sweden uk, low denmark netherlands. norway among country high share owner-occupied dwellings, around 80 per cent. this high proportion partly account high mortgage debt households. in recent years, new loan product also launched, facilitate mortgage equity withdrawal. house wealth become liquid. borrower great scope choose repayment profiles. we cannot identify exact level household debt sustain time, rapid build-up debt make household vulnerable. 12 bi review 28/2007 house investment household sector whole fully debt-financed, mean increase net debt. it would appear household save fall markedly norway recent past. save negative latter half 2006, first time save fall since 1988. the pronounce fall save indicate household take great chances. at time, government revenue save high. the long period prosperity government budget surplus may engender sense security also affect household save house purchases. petroleum government pension fund – global high oil gas production high prices, combine high returns, result rapid rise value government pension fund recent years. the norwegian authority successful ensure bulk petroleum wealth benefit norwegian society whole. both state’s ownership interest state’s direct financial interest petroleum activity (sdfi) tax system important. the company extract oil earn reasonable return investment incentive invest, economic rent essentially accrue general public. the authority far also successful smooth spend petroleum revenue time. this important several reasons. first, mislead look upon cash flow bi review 28/2007 13 petroleum activity income. the appropriate economic perspective see transfer cash flow foreign investment way transfer capital one account another – petroleum foreign securities. by so, diversify risk. second, size cash flow petroleum activity varies. if petroleum revenue spend accrue, would lead wide fluctuation demand norwegian economy. third, petroleum revenue spend impact competitiveness norwegian business industry. a high level substantial variation petroleum revenue spend would negative impact internationally expose industries. the establishment government pension fund – global spend guideline petroleum revenue part response challenges. the fund approach nominal value one year’s gdp may reach two course next decade. this base assumption oil price remain high next year fall usd 30 per barrel. the government base withdrawal fund average real return 4 per cent finance current expenditure. give spend rule, return may come finance 15 per cent government expenditure 10 years, clearly show sound management petroleum wealth generate considerable benefits. the return represent future income forego draw wealth today. but even source income, 80 per cent 14 bi review 28/2007 expenditure must cover sources. finance large pension payment disburse come decade demand event. i talk supply-side shock positive effect norwegian economy. norway reap benefit globalisation increase international trade free labour flow across national borders. globalisation also challenge although i delve speech today, i would delight discus issue question answer session. thank attention! donald l kohn: asset-pricing puzzles, credit risk, credit derivative remark mr donald l kohn, vice chairman board governor u federal reserve system, conference credit risk credit derivatives, washington dc, 22 march 2007. * * * good afternoon. i please participate board’s conference credit risk credit derivatives. song han, matt pritsker, hao zhou work hard put together stimulate program cutting-edge research area.1 your conference focus improve understand credit risk credit derivatives, i begin talk take step back discuss wide range asset markets, understand also limited. then i examine research conference help sharpen focus broad range asset markets. at federal reserve, considerable interest credit risk credit derivatives. a market develop become complete, facilitate risk transfer diversification, thereby increase resilience financial system. with participant come rely market manage risk, focus increasingly liquidity structure. we work closely private sector strengthen clear settlement infrastructure understand market function stress. but emphasis today structure mechanic credit market rather information contain price observe markets. we federal reserve use information nearly every area responsibility. for example, role bank supervisor protector financial stability, monitor credit spread financial institution early warn sign possible financial stress. in role monetary policy makers, analyze information credit-risk market get read cost capital business forward-looking indicator health corporate sector implication future macroeconomic developments. extract information asset price a consequence, staff federal reserve put considerable effort research asset price report result research policymakers. one reason try understand expectation households, businesses, market participant future. expectation critical understand economy development financial system. of course, look great deal data nonfinancial side economy, gross domestic product (gdp) growth, unemployment rate, change price good services. these data certainly reflect expectation always transparent way. and, data take time compile never available real time. because financial asset price embody expectation future, also contain forward-looking information prospective developments, many available continuously instantaneously. we pay attention extensive range asset prices, include treasury security (both nominal real), corporate debt equities, derivatives. although easy, use asset price tease information expectation help u interpret predict pace economic activity prices. the price asset reflect future cash flow investor expect receive own asset. the price also reflect risk premium, excess expect return risk-free rate investor require hold risky asset portfolios. each asset’s risk premium depend asset’s risk – measure possible variability cash flow expect level – investors' risk aversion, represent extent investors’ appetite risk. and try measure understand element risk premium, addition embed expectations. 1 mike gibson, song han, matt pritsker, hao zhou, board's staff, contribute remarks. bi review 28/2007 1 in equity markets, corporate earn future cash flow affect equity prices. give market’s outlook corporate earn – embodied, example, prediction market analyst – make crude estimate risk premium equity difference ratio trend earn price real long-term treasury yield. on occasion, go use structural economic model decompose risk premium component relate risk investors’ risk appetite. in credit market, relevant future cash flow coupon corporate debt, le allowance expect loss future defaults. in one exercise, forecast future default simple regression model estimate credit-risk premium difference corporate yield treasury yield excess would require compensate investor estimate expect credit losses. we also estimate term structure credit-risk premium repeat analysis use debt different maturities. to judge market price risk might tell us, try understand result credit-risk premium relate source information, strength business balance sheets, historical level risk premiums, premium observe relate markets, like equities. this approach help u ass current attitude expectation market participant well possible future movement risk premium alternative scenarios. we look price treasury market market interest rate option future infer investors’ expect future path monetary policy uncertainty path. to so, need model term premium tease link long-term interest rate investors’ expectation future short-term rates. we also compare treasury yield curve price treasury inflation-protected security infer expect inflation, key variable track monetary policy makers. although use variety technique extract information asset prices, learn limits. first, asset price tough work with. they change rapidly subject short-run technical factor – swing price relate fundamental persistent shift supply demand. second, perhaps even important, asset price embody risk investors’ risk attitude complicate vary time. we must use model extract information risk risk preference prices, model simplification reality, recognize result approximation underlie attitude circumstance thus subject error. asset-pricing puzzle researcher well aware difficulty decompose asset’s require return component relate expect future cash flows, risk aversion, risk. moreover, risk preference relate predictable way across market often appear so. for example, risk preference require fit consumption data good market inconsistent risk preference imply price equity market. this problem well know economist everyone room know "equity-premium puzzle." the equity premium define return investor expect earn broad equity index excess return u.s. treasury security. although theory suggest equity premium relate investors’ risk preference well fundamental volatility corporate sector, difficult find plausible risk preference rationalize high level historical equity premium. also, observe require return appear vary time, understand reason fluctuation. both problem complicate interpretation implications, any, movement equity market macroeconomy. the equity-premium puzzle aspect behavior financial asset price difficult reconcile economic theory experience relate markets. a second puzzle "credit-spread puzzle." the spread corporate bond similar-maturity treasury bond compensate investor risk bond’s issuer default recovery default bond low. credit-risk spread vary substantially cycle, right low side historical experience. however, long periods, actual percentage loss corporate bond well historical average credit spread maturities, especially high-grade, short-maturity segment market. again, difficult reconcile observation 2 bi review 28/2007 standard model investor preferences. other explanatory factors, different tax treatment corporate treasury bonds, appear explain part puzzle. a third puzzle concern behavior financial market volatility. volatility measure expect volatility derive option price vary time way easy link economic fundamental variation expect return asset markets. moreover, relationship financial market volatility volatility macroeconomic variable gdp well understood. a fourth puzzle relate price risk concern term premium, additional compensation investor require hold longer-term securities. we estimate treasury market term premium decline substantially recent year unusually low levels, contribute inversion yield curve. but understand why, consequently know extent see permanent decline term premium – perhaps due general reduction volatility economic activity inflation past twenty-five years. or may see temporary decline due influence recent macroeconomic condition special factor affect demand long-term bonds. in addition well-known puzzles, also large number puzzle across asset market i group common theme risk harmonization. risk-harmonization puzzle concern whether give risk price way market risk traded. in absence transaction costs, broadly defined, law one price hold – risk-free arbitrage – risk price way markets. in fact, risk harmonization limit transaction costs, view broad way, quite material many markets. a broad notion transaction cost include direct fee pay transact trade also full set risk involve arbitrage among markets. these include various type basis risk, risk long short position expose risk different market might offset other. another important risk model risk, risk misjudge apparent price anomaly trade owe correct model. some conference paper focus market risk harmonization appear incomplete. how common lens credit risk improve understand paper conference contribute overall understand credit risk, well risk associate volatility liquidity, price financial markets. one contribution conference view many asset-pricing puzzle common lens credit risk. this approach hold hope address various puzzle internally consistent way help u understand puzzle may related. one strand literature equity-premium puzzle attempt explain puzzle somewhat controversial refinement standard risk preferences. the first paper conference examine plausibility preference analyze whether also explain average pattern credit spread bond market. the result mixed. part credit-spread puzzle explained, lend credence preferences, suggest two puzzle related, part remain unexplained. and paper identify good model situation firm force default one research direction may help explain remain part credit-spread puzzle. this research direction pursue separate paper conference. a second paper conference also study relationship equity price credit risk different perspective ask whether credit risk appropriately price stock markets. to address question, focus company heavily expose systematic risk financial distress – is, relatively likely experience financial distress future downturn – study whether stock earn positive premium risk. the main find investor company earn premium distress risk stock market. this result suggest possible failure risk harmonization stock market, turn raise deep question identify failure risk harmonization arbitrage away. in short, paper conference deepen knowledge asset-pricing puzzles, also highlight new aspect puzzle remain explained. bi review 28/2007 3 how credit derivative market improve understand this lead last topic, credit derivative market provide new way u uncover market perception risk. like derivative (such option swaps), credit derivative allow credit risk unbundled trade independently type risk, make easy price measure different type risk. here i focus two examples. the first involve ability infer market's perception default risk. in bad old days, ten year ago, best way infer credit risk price corporate bonds, bond price contaminate difference coupons, taxes, option-like features, bond covenants, illiquidity corporate bond market itself. all feature mean model error involve process result credit-risk measure noisy potentially biased. now, instead look bond market measure default risk, increasingly turn market credit default swaps, cds. cd standardize corporate bonds, and, time, also become liquid. they therefore provide u new, many case precise, measure credit risk. these measure turn sharpen measure price puzzles. in addition, cd market help u strip credit-risk component bond prices, market also give u clear picture important non-credit-risk component bond prices, liquidity, priced. the second example involve price default correlation. default correlation measure tendency firm default time. suppose bank make set loan appear safe look individually. whether loan likely default nearly time represent difference whether bank remain healthy potential become insolvent. for reason, model default correlations, correlation change economic conditions, one important input measure portfolio credit risk banks. default correlation model also important bank regulator heavily emphasize within basel ii capital standards. collateralize debt obligations, cdos, one number financial instrument whose price sensitive pattern default correlations. a result, price instrument provide u forward-looking picture market’s perception default correlation indication risk change correlation priced. of course, paper conference demonstrate, price correlation-sensitive instrument is, put generously, somewhat le straightforward. for reason, substantial model risk involve make inference prices. nevertheless, price instrument provide blurry view default correlation i expect improve time credit derivative market continue grow mature. credit derivatives, like derivatives, zero net supply, and, abstract important issue counterparty credit risk, neither add subtract stock financial risk economy. they do, however, provide new more-efficient way share hedge risk exist, facilitate transfer risk will evaluate bear them. a consequence, credit derivative market continue develop deepen, guess, guess, clean measure credit risk will, else equal, reduce cost arbitrage market improve harmonization risk across market – one asset-pricing puzzle i highlighted. two puzzle i describe early credit-spread equity-premium puzzles. at least part puzzle may due imperfect risk share among active market participants. if indeed part puzzle, financial innovation credit derivative may, again, else equal, reduce long-run average risk premium equity credit markets, time, facilitate risk share among currently active market participants, provide participant adequately understand manage risk products. that said, time tell whether speculation point correct. conclusion my message today federal reserve place lot emphasis understand financial asset price help meet public policy objectives. but so, handicap extent understand important aspect financial asset 4 bi review 28/2007 priced. your work researcher field – portion show-cased conference – helpful begin explain puzzles, recent technique idea together data series generate new market hold promise progress future. so, i keep work longer. your contribution important nation’s central bank. please, go solve puzzles. bi

markets. take together, change transform process credit demand meet credit risk allocate managed. a i discuss, i believe development generally enhance efficiency stability credit market broad financial system make credit market transparent liquid, create new instrument unbundling manage credit risks, disperse credit risk broadly. interestingly, first time witness innovation derivative market lead type benefits. later, i briefly draw parallel recent development credit derivative development agricultural future mid-nineteenth century. for benefits, development pose significant challenge market participants. the complexity instrument create difficulty respect valuation, risk measurement, risk management. also, trade certain instrument time run well ahead development infrastructure necessary clear settle trades. although impressive progress make toward address challenges, i believe need continue attention market participant policymakers. recent development the evolution credit market spur astonish growth new credit instruments, particularly credit derivatives. the notional amount credit derivative outstanding double year past five years; total $20 trillion end june 2006, accord statistic compile bank international settlement (bis). the bulk credit derivative outstanding consist single-name credit default swaps, single-name cds, reference obligation single obligor.1 derivative sometimes fault complexity, charge cannot level single-name cds: the risk single-name cd essentially simply buy sell short bond. single-name cd make 70 percent credit derivatives, accord bis. the bulk cd trade investment-grade segment corporate credit market, although cd trade involve high-yield name expand quickly. most recently, cd reference asset-backed security high-growth part market. single-name cd use build block construct credit derivative reference portfolio issuers. these so-called multiname cd make remain 30 percent credit derivatives, accord bis. some multiname cd quite straightforward, index actively-traded name particular market segment. some, however, indeed quite complex; include certain structure credit derivative unbundle risk portfolio name tranche different seniority dramatically different risks. credit derivative index currently fastest-growing liquid area credit markets. they create first actively trade market segments: investment-grade high-yield 1 a cd provide purchaser protection cost default credit event reduce market value underlie reference obligation (usually bond loans). reference obligation obligors know “names.” bi review 28/2007 1 name north america europe. recently, new index create market segments, include security back commercial mortgages, subprime residential mortgages, european leverage loans.2 among complex credit derivatives, credit index tranche stand important development. a credit index tranche expose investor particular slice loss due default among name one credit derivative indexes. the so-called equity tranche bear disproportionate share total credit risk underlie index. for example, equity tranche might expose first 3 percent losses. other tranche would cover remain percentile loss, sum tranche reproduce exposure entire index. a i discus minutes, one factor behind complexity credit index tranche loss exposure depend level default also correlation default across issuers. another instrument credit markets, similar credit index tranche, collateralize debt obligation, cdo. a cdo pool portfolio fixed-income asset tranched liability structure familiar securitization markets. for example, bank long use similar liability structure fund credit card loan consumers. the common type collateral cdos asset-backed corporate security syndicate loans. cdos back loan refer collateralize loan obligations, clos. the growth clos certainly effect market syndicate loans. of course, syndicate loan new instrument. they around since 1970s. but recently, secondary-market liquidity syndicate loan improve dramatically, part demand loan clos. this improve liquidity transform loan buy-and-hold investment trade assets. market participant work standardize documentation trade credit default swap reference loans. these so-called loan cd already start trade small amounts. the development new instrument market facilitate nonbank institutional investor turn help investor expand participation credit markets. data participation nonbank institutional investor difficult come by, data available syndicate loan markets.3 historically, loan syndications, include loan commitment term loans, predominantly fund banks. but period 2001 2006, amount term loan u.s. nonfinancial corporation rise $100 billion $350 billion, nonbank share lend rise le one-half roughly two-thirds. the institutional investor loan include mutual funds, insurance companies, pension funds, hedge funds. in mid-1990s, mutual fund important type institutional investor markets. more recently, identify ultimate source institutional demand become difficult. for example, 2001 2006, two-thirds institutional term loan purchase collateral issuance clos. although institutional investor undoubtedly predominant investor clos, little know hold various type institutions. also, much make increasingly important role hedge fund credit markets, hedge funds, turn, increasingly manage asset behalf endowments, pension funds, institutional investors.4 asset manager clearly play increasingly important role credit markets, whether manage mutual funds, clos, hedge funds. the decision asset manager increasingly drive preference institutional investors. and decision asset manager large influence price credit, even type credit whose price historically drive decision banks. 2 a leverage loan commonly define syndicate loan, typically risky borrower, interest rate least libor plus 125 basis points. 3 standard poor’s leverage commentary data, “leveraged lend review,” 2006:q3. 4 one industry survey forecast institution account roughly half hedge fund inflow 2007, virtually zero 2000 (“hedge funds,” international financial services, london, march 2006, p. 3, chart 7). 2 bi review 28/2007 benefit recent development the new instruments, markets, participant i describe bring important benefit credit markets. i touch three benefits: enhance liquidity transparency, availability new tool manage credit risk, great dispersion credit risk. in list benefits, i strike strong resemblance happen right credit market happen historically market derivative introduced. for example, market agricultural commodity unite state reap benefit standardize future contract wheat commodity introduce middle nineteenth century.5 historically, secondary market corporate bonds, loans, asset-backed security illiquid transparent. liquidity [msg1] market improve time still quite poor. for example, half outstanding corporate bond even trade first three month 2006.6 individual bond tend somewhat liquid immediately issued, trade activity decline quickly thereafter investor put bond buy-and-hold portfolios. also, short corporate bond difficult. the dramatic improvement credit market liquidity spur credit derivatives. one way measure improvement liquidity bid-ask spreads. for investment-grade corporate bond – relatively liquid part bond market – bid-ask spread average 64 basis point last year.7 the bid-ask spread single-name investment-grade cds, however, typically 10 basis point less, usual bid-ask spread investment-grade credit index 2 basis points. the liquidity secondary market loan also improve recent years. trade volume total $239 billion 2006, $102 billion 2000.8 a key factor drive improvement secondary-market liquidity expand participation nonbank institutional investors. these investor active manager credit risk, consequently appear place high value liquidity. along liquidity, transparency credit market also improve time. corporate bond market transparent thank regulatory change take effect 2002. dealer must report nearly corporate bond trade nasd within fifteen minutes, nasd immediately report trade data market. for asset-backed security loans, price transparency available specialist vendor aggregate disseminate dealers’ prices. for example, syndicate loan market, one vendor currently aggregate data seventy trader price nearly 6,000 loan daily. price many credit derivatives, include single-name cds, credit derivative indexes, credit index tranches, widely available service bloomberg reuters. complex credit derivative cdo tranche exception this: they remain largely illiquid nontransparent. enhance liquidity transparency promote good risk management market participant facilitate broad participation credit markets. liquid market make easy access historical price data thus permit good measurement credit risks. measure risk accurately allow price accurately. a transparent market accurate price attractive wide array investors. in effect, good liquidity transparency low cost entry credit markets. in addition enhance liquidity transparency, recent development credit market equip market participant new tool take on, hedging, manage credit risk. these new tool allow investor easily customize credit risk portfolios. investor construct diverse portfolio much low transaction cost compare purchase portfolio corporate bond even single-name cds. a derivatives, index readily use either 5 see randall s. kroszner (1999), “can financial market privately regulate risk? the development derivative clearinghouses recent

reuters loan price corporation, www.loanpricing.com/analytics/pricing_service_volume1.htm . bi review 28/2007 3 reduce take credit risk. in contrast, corporate bonds, lack well-developed security lend market make difficult shed credit risk short selling. the enhance transparency liquidity credit market development new instrument customize risk characteristic credit exposure result wide dispersion credit risk. although significant participation nonbank institutional investor long hallmark u.s. credit markets, development facilitate great risk-bearing entity bank highly regulate depository institutions. on face, wide dispersion credit risk would seem enhance stability financial system reduce likelihood credit default weaken one financial institution class financial institutions. some express concern transfer risk bank heavily regulate depository institution lightly regulate unregulated entities. some specific concern quite legitimate. for example, i discus moments, bank transfer credit risk entity mechanism expose bank counterparty risk entities, transfer fully effective bank manage counterparty risk prudently. however, concern transfer credit risk outside bank system seem base questionable assumptions. for example, observer believe credit risk manage effectively bank generally heavily regulate entity transfer credit risk. but unregulated le regulate entity principle subject more-effective market discipline bank because, without safety net support them, creditor strong incentive monitor limit risk-taking. in fact, many focus danger risk transfer highly leverage entity might vulnerable sharp widen credit spreads, significant portion risk transfer outside bank system transfer institutional investor far le leverage banks. challenge associate recent development the benefit development new instrument market i describe fully realize market participant address various risk-management challenge pose use instruments. i discus three challenges: limit counterparty credit risk, model default correlation, improve infrastructure clear settle credit derivative trades. but i discus risk-management challenges, i want emphasize fundamental risk credit market change new instrument traded. credit risk may trade among market participants, eliminate risk. investor credit market still expose risk issuer may default obligations. and event default, investor still expose risk recovery rate low expected. the management default recovery risk present nothing fundamentally new investors. instrument like single-name cd credit derivative index simply replicate sort credit exposure always existed. from perspective financial stability, i believe important risk-management challenge credit market management counterparty credit risk. i mention early institutional investors, include hedge funds, active credit markets. i also note bank trade credit risk use new instrument credit derivative cdos, must take care limit counterparty credit risk might result. bank commonly rely collateral mitigate counterparty credit risk over-the-counter derivatives. credit derivative exception. also, bank universally require hedge fund counterparties post collateral cover current exposure and, exceptions, cover potential exposure future market movements. but give grow role hedge fund credit markets, appropriate ask whether dealer bank enough collateral protect stress scenario go well beyond recent benign experience credit markets. default correlation distinctly new aspect credit risk. the value credit index tranche cdo tranche sensitive number default among set issuer also correlation defaults. the senior tranche suffer loss scenario many correlate defaults. the value senior tranche fall default correlation rises. the value first-loss tranche rise default correlation rises. and somewhere middle capital structure tranche whose value roughly insensitive correlation. the mathematical relationship 4 bi review 28/2007 tranche value correlation depend particular model use forecast defaults. this dependency expose dealer investor so-called correlation risk model forecast default correlation turn incorrect. correlation risk challenge measure manage, fairly recently market participant learn hard lesson challenges. in may 2005, widen credit spread several automotive company lead sharp movement price credit index tranche seem catch market participant surprise. their model correlation risk seem lag behind development new tranched credit products. since then, much energy devote build good model correlation risk, i believe fair say much work remain do risk consider fully understood. these risk-management challenge go unnoticed market participant themselves. in 2005, private-sector group, counterparty risk management policy group ii, crmpg ii, chair e. gerald corrigan, produce report highlight many issues.9 that report also make number useful recommendation market participant could address challenge i mention here. it encourage find market participant take lead role make improvement risk management need fully reap benefit innovation credit markets. the third final challenge i discus infrastructure. the rapid growth trade credit derivative recently outpace development infrastructure necessary clear settle trades. post-trade process largely manual, attendant inefficiency risks. by early 2005, credit derivative dealer huge backlog unconfirmed trades, even though greatly increase back-office resources. unconfirmed trade increase potential material inaccuracy trade records, cause mismeasurement mismanagement market risk counterparty credit risks. market infrastructure improve collective action market participants. in 2005, stimulus necessary collective action provide private sector public sector. crmpg ii call attention grow backlog risk pose market participant call convene industry roundtable address them.10 prudential supervisor take lead. in september 2005 call fourteen lead dealer federal reserve bank new york, supervisor collectively make clear concern risk pose grow backlogs. the supervisor wisely avoid temptation design improvement market infrastructure. instead, simply insist backlog reduce leave dealer meet (and become know feed 14) figure market participant best achieve objective. the market participant recognize automation key; manual process simply scalable. both dealer asset manager embrace use depository trust & clear corporation’s deriv/serv electronic confirmation service. the result dramatic. between september 2005 december 2006, aggregate credit derivative confirmation outstanding thirty day fourteen dealer decline 92 percent despite continue rapid growth trade volumes. with encouragement support supervisors, large group dealer asset manager turn attention address backlog equity derivative markets. conclusion credit market undoubtedly continue evolve year come. in short run, rapid change pose significant challenge market participants. cooperative initiatives, crmpg ii feed 14, contribute greatly ensure challenge meet successfully identify effective risk-management practice stimulate collective action necessary, notably achieve improvement market infrastructures. the recent success initiative 9 counterparty risk management policy group ii (2005), toward great financial stability: a private sector perspective, july 27, www.crmpolicygroup.org .

european central bank, hear economic monetary affair committee european parliament, brussels, 21 march 2007. * * * madame la présidente, madame et monsieur le membres de la commission economique et monétaire, c’est avec un intérêt chaque fois renouvelé que je parais, tous le trimestres, devant votre commission afin de poursuivre le dialogue de la banque centrale avec le parlement. la banque centrale européenne est, vous le savez, très attachée à cet exercice qui contribue à rendre notre action transparente vis-à-vis du citoyen européen. je commencerai mon intervention par une évaluation de la situation économique et monétaire. anschließend werde ich auf die unterschiede, die bei den geldpolitischen transmissionskanälen den usa und dem euroraum bestehen, sowie ihre praktischen auswirkungen eingehen. zum abschluss möchte ich die bedeutung von preisstabilität au sozialpolitischer perspektive erläutern. economic monetary issue since previous appearance european parliament december last year, newly available information serve confirm assessment economic growth euro area continue expand robustly. in addition, cross-check economic monetary analysis underline existence upside risk price stability medium long term. accordingly, 8 march govern council ecb decide increase key ecb interest rate 25 basis points. our decision increase key ecb interest rate march contribute ensure medium longer-term inflation expectation euro area remain solidly anchor level consistent price stability, prerequisite monetary policy make ongoing contribution towards support sustainable economic growth job creation euro area. let explain assessment underlie decision outlook economy risk price stability. start economic analysis, accord eurostat’s first estimate, quarter-on-quarter growth rate real gdp euro area fourth quarter 2006 0.9%, previous expectations. both domestic demand export make significant contribution growth, confirm sustain broad-based nature current expansion. the information economic activity various confidence survey indicator-based estimate support assessment economic growth continue 2007. look ahead, condition remain place euro area economy grow solidly. global economic growth become balance across region and, moderate somewhat, remain robust, provide support euro area exports. domestic demand expect maintain relatively strong momentum. investment expect remain dynamic, benefit extend period favourable finance conditions, balance sheet restructuring, accumulate ongoing strong earnings, gain business efficiency. consumption also strengthen time line development real disposable income employment condition continue improve. this outlook economic development also reflect new ecb staff macroeconomic projection foresee average annual real gdp growth range 2.1% 2.9% 2007 1.9% 2.9% 2008. in govern council’s view, risk surround favourable outlook economic growth broadly balance short term. at long horizons, risk lie mainly downside, relate possibility renew increase oil prices, fear rise protectionist pressure concern possible disorderly development owe global imbalances. turn price developments, annual hicp inflation 1.8% february 2007, unchanged january 2007. the low annual hicp inflation rate since summer 2006 predominantly due low energy prices. look ahead, last year’s volatility energy price lead significant base effects, affect profile annual inflation rate year. accordingly basis current level oil price oil price futures, annual inflation rate likely fall spring summer rise towards end year hover bi review 27/2007 1 around 2%. the new ecb staff macroeconomic projection point annual hicp inflation average 1.5% 2.1% 2007 1.4% 2.6% 2008. at policy-relevant medium-term horizon, outlook price development remains, govern council’s view, subject upside risks. these stem possibility renew oil price increase additional increase administer price indirect tax beyond announce decide thus far. more fundamentally, strong currently expect wage development would pose significant upward risk price stability, particularly view favourable momentum real gdp growth. it therefore crucial social partner continue meet responsibility wage agreement take account present relative price competitiveness positions, still high level unemployment many country well productivity developments. the govern council monitor upcoming wage negotiation euro area country carefully. turn monetary analysis, confirm prevail upside risk price stability medium long horizons. annual m3 growth unchanged 9.8% january, remain high rate observe since introduction euro. at 10.6%, annual growth rate loan private sector also remain strong january. this reflect continuation upward trend growth borrow non-financial corporation see since mid-2004. meanwhile, growth household borrow show sign moderation recent months, albeit remain still high rates. take appropriate medium longer-term perspective, late development confirm continuation persistent upward trend underlie rate monetary expansion. furthermore, follow several year robust monetary growth, liquidity situation euro area ample plausible measures. the robust expansion money credit environment ample liquidity point upside risk price stability medium long term. monetary development therefore continue require careful monitoring, particularly background solid expansion economic activity continue strong property market development many part euro area. to sum up, assess price trend important look short term volatility inflation rates. at policy-relevant horizon medium term, risk price stability remain upside, relate particular strong currently expect wage development context robust ongoing growth employment economic activity. give vigorous monetary credit growth environment already ample liquidity, cross-check outcome economic analysis monetary analysis support assessment upside risk price stability prevail medium long term. monetary policy transmission euro area u in remark today i would also like discus difference similarity transmission monetary policy euro area us. optimal monetary-policy action depend nature shock hit economy, present future expect economic environment and, importantly, transmission mechanism monetary policy actions. these element precise bear comparative exercise highlight parallel difference monetary policy different currency areas. for example, order compare monetary policy decision federal reserve european central bank, must analyse, among things, structure economy operating, economic structure institution determine function monetary policy transmission mechanism and, therefore, indirectly influence design policy. be monetary transmission mechanism unite state significantly different euro area? apply economics approach question two different angles: statistical structural analysis. statistical analysis study business cycle property aggregate data, gdp inflation u euro area. by apply battery statistical tests, approach seek ass whether macroeconomic time series display similar different dynamic pattern cycle two areas. a relate approach apply statistical technique identify way monetary policy innovation propagate economy. but statistical analysis imperfect difficult see – base solely aggregate data statistic – whether difference statistical pattern originate shock economic structures, 2 bi review 27/2007 feature economic structure institution responsible particular aspect transmission monetary policy impulses. structural analysis concentrate – fundamentally – two relate aspects. first, construct measure price wage rigidity: express frequency price wage adjustments. in economy rigid good labour market – where, example, labour practice contractual institution hamper prompt transmission shock wage – macroeconomic adjustment shock take long run course and, importantly, fall disproportionately production employment. second, structural analysis provide evidence sensitivity inflation expectation past inflation developments. the relevance inflation expectation transmission mechanism subtle central. an inflationary shock tend persistent wage price rigidity greater, unless inflation expectation find insensitive inflation history solidly anchor around objective central bank. again, important implication monetary transmission. a shock inflation fast dissipate – even price wage relatively rigid – inflation expectation firmly anchored. now, statistical approach generally fail spot significant difference across two areas, structural analysis come two main conclusions. the first that, euro area, price distinctly le flexible unite states.1 second, inflationary shock dissipate quickly euro area despite rigidities, inflation tendency return long-run norm reasonably quickly. survey-based measure inflation expectations, example, suggest ecb’s influence expectation seem become much strong since establishment euro.2what implication policy? i mention two them, stem notion appropriateness policy cannot judge abstract terms: policy need carefully calibrate underlie economic structure.3 first, relatively rigid economy, adjustment fall primarily quantities. so, central bank generally well-advised avoid volatile policy paths, condition transmit unwelcome volatility economy often necessitate corrective, countervail action road. second, inflation expectation look forward – central bank’s intention – backward – inflation history – call persistence policy direction. again, central bank move policy rate around response twist turn data would circumstance limit impact economy. when inflation process forward-looking euro area, policy shift lack persistence little impact longer-term interest rates, expectation – ultimately – macroeconomic price decisions. counterfactual policy evaluation difficult conduct necessarily conditional long list technical assumptions. nonetheless, recently conduct counterfactual policy-evaluation exercise suggest since 2001 – compare flexible economy par excellence, u – policy intervention great stabilize effect economy. in tune structural condition 1 the eurosystem make important contribution analysis price rigidity euro area. a summary extensive research project conduct jointly ecb national central bank provide altissimo, f., m ehrmann. and f. smets (2006), “inflation persistence price set euro area: a summary inflation persistence network evidence” ecb occasional paper 46, frankfurt main: european central bank. the paper report average duration cpi price spell euro area 4.3 quarters. by comparison, m. bils p. klenow, “some evidence importance sticky prices”, journal political economy 112, 2005, calculate average duration cpi price unite state 2.2 quarters. other phillips curve-based analysis broadly confirm results. for euro area, see j. gali, m. gertler d. lopez-salido, “european inflation dynamics”, european economic review 45(7), 2001, j. gali, m. gertler d. lopez-salido, “erratum”, european economic review 47(4), 2003. 2 the consumer survey inflation expectation compile european commission good barometer sensitivity short-term inflation expectation recent inflation dynamics. result present term difference percentage respondent believe price increase percentage respondent believe decrease stabilise. prior euro cash changeover close relationship qualitative indicator actual inflation developments, correlation coefficient near 1. however, since cash changeover, correlation two series drop 0.4. 3 christiano, j., r. motto m. rostagno (2007), “shocks, structure policies? the euro area u 2001” (forthcoming journal economic dynamic control) argue along line basis structural estimate model euro area us. bi review 27/2007 3 prevail euro area, overall degree accommodation deliver ecb ample, albeit back-loaded, persistent.4 of course, keep interest rate unprecedented low level two year half would part feasible policy, without consistent sign expectation well-anchored inflationary shock hit economy time downturn quickly reabsorbed.5 social benefit price stability let turn last point today i would like emphasise critical role quantitative definition price stability orient expectations. i mention persistent condition price stability change transmission channel way partly alleviate structural shortcoming economy. in euro area, notwithstanding structural rigidity impede price wage adjustment – rigidity cannot correct central bank – well-anchored inflation expectation partly compensate make transmission mechanism le inefficient would otherwise. but welfare analysis also draw attention other, perhaps even fundamental, channel price stability enhance growth prospect contribute live standard citizens. first, market economy, price system play key role efficient allocation resource alternative uses. price pressure specific market signal profitable investment opportunity firms. price stability improve quality signal price convey household firms, easily recognise change relative price different goods, allow make well-informed consumption investment decisions. by contrast, inflationary environment, price provide blur signals: price increase specific market either indicate strong demand investment opportunity simply reflect general increase price level. by help market force guide resource us use productively, price stability contribute sustainable increase productivity employment, ultimately high standard living. second, price stability contribute low level nominal real interest rates. inflation erode real value nominal claim and, inflationary environment, lender typically require inflation risk premium compensate inflation risk associate investments. by contrast, creditor require risk premium price stability ensured. by reduce inflation risk premia, price stability result low level real interest rates, thereby make investment project profitable. by support investment, low interest rate contribute high level employment economic growth. third, well know inflation act like tax hold cash. inflation increase price transaction service money. while certainly palpable economic phenomenon euro area today, handful hyperinflation episode economic history still make so-called “inflation tax” one widely know example undesirable consequence inflation. by set “inflation tax” negligible levels, price stability minimise transaction cost economy whole. this benefit citizen daily basis, even position protect inflation. finally, inflation bring arbitrary redistribution income wealth. the vulnerable group society typically suffer inflation. they relatively high share save invest cash save accounts, real value easily erode inflation. their limit access financial market leave little room evade “inflation tax”. in respect, pensioner live pension entitlement save accumulate work life constitute group particularly vulnerable inflation. price stability ensure real value pension entitlement save maintained. 4 the counterfactual conduct christiano, et al (2007), op. cit. 5 see particular follow speech (published ecb website): j.-c. trichet, “monetary policy credible alertness” (jackson hole, 27 august 2005) “activism alertness monetary policy” (madrid, 8 june 2006). 4 bi review 27/2007 today, level inflation euro area threshold definition price stability, “less 2%, close 2%”, medium long-term inflationary expectation euro area solidly anchored. against background, social benefit price stability often take granted. i therefore like stress undesirable social economic consequence inflation, namely inefficient allocation resources, high level interest rates, regressive inflation tax, arbitrary redistribution income wealth detriment vulnerable, and, last least, economic instability, low growth low job creation, benchmark one ass social benefit price stability. this credible commitment maintain price stability important live standard european citizens. and fellow citizens, accord surveys, profoundly attach price stability. i thank attention. bi review 27/2007 5 y v reddy: globalisation monetary policy – emerge issue

new year you. for dr. rakesh mohan, holiday issue, described. for me, festival issue also, since i telugu. so, address form share festive mood also. a may aware, today festival celebrate new year state maharashtra, call gudipadwa marathi-speaking people, number 70 million. it also celebrate 65 million kannada-speaking people "ugadi". we, 80 million telugu-speaking also celebrate festival ugadi. the festival mark new year day people follow southern indian lunar calendar. this calendar reckon date base salivahana era (salivahana saka), begin count suppose date found empire legendary hero shalivahana. the satavahana king shalivahana (also identify gautamiputra satakarni) credit initiation era know shalivahana. the shalivahana era begin count year year correspond 78 ad gregorian calendar. thus, year 2000 ad correspond year 1922 salivahana era. in terminology use lunar calendar, ugadi fall chaitra sudhdha paadyami first day bright half hindu month chaitra. the telugu kannada people celebrate festival great fanfare; gather extend family sumptuous feast de rigueur. the day, however, begin ritual shower follow prayers, eat specific mixture neem buds/flowers bitterness, jaggery sweetness, raw mango vagaru , tamarind juice sour. this mixture, call “ugadi pachhadi” telugu “bevu-bella” kannada, symbolize fact life mixture pleasure pain, accept together equanimity. people traditionally gather listen recitation religious almanac (panchangam) come year, general forecast year come. this panchanga sravanam, informal social function elderly respect person open new

holiday would choose tomorrow festivities. friends, indian may argumentative telugu argumentative love freedom choose – even ugadi festival day, even base read celestial stars. in festive mood last two day year telugus, let wish deliberation conference "advances open economy macroeconomics" productive pleasant time. i recognise number eminent economist north western university u university participate conference i would like extend hearty welcome them. i congratulate economist igidr, rbi indian university contribution conference. let extend personal warm welcome guest country – believe "atithi devo bhava". i would like take opportunity share think possible rethink may occur regard globalisation could affect open economy would choose – extent public policy choices. that would lead share challenge conduct monetary policy, world currently le certain cost benefit globalisation. i afraid, i may repeat i say forum recently but, i hope contextualise presentation. in recent period, reassessment cost benefit associate globalisation seem take place. domestic structural reform emerge economy unlock pent-up domestic demand and, turn, enable great realisation huge potential growth. so, cause rethink – develop emerge economies? firstly, traditional postulate capital flow capital-surplus develop country capital-scarce develop countries, seem disprove recent years. the world's large economy, unite states, currently run current account deficit, finance substantial extent capital export emerge market economies. of course, argue so-called “global imbalances” reflection incomplete globalisation. but fact remain long globalization happen incomplete, public policy manage consequential "imbalances". secondly, globalise world, context monetary policy set, often lead confrontation impossible trinity – independent monetary policy, open capital account manage exchange rate. the theory hold best, two three would feasible. in practice, however, shift preference away corner solution respect financial imbalances. currently, intermediate solutions, early regard “fuzzy”, become increasingly relevant. moreover, recognition difference trade financial integration – first point jagdish bhagwati – le certainty today corner solution past. thirdly, practical level, recent experience seem indicate globalisation may accentuate potential conflict impact fabric societies, particularly, view rise corporate profit couple reduction share remuneration labour. in regard, i strike mr. john micklethwait, editor-in-chief the economist report say interview, mention lead daily yesterday (march 18, 2007). he say context process globalisation: "but far globalisation goes, i worry one thing: look inequality, particularly america, rich get even rich median income barely budged. what interest last couple quarters, begin see sign wage begin rise. what see last ten year return capital increase dramatically return labour proportionately go down? what happen prospect downturn, inequality become much big issue american elections. around world already much big issue, include place like japan. the corporate bos japan pay 35 time median worker paid. in america, 411 times." fourthly, wide-spread concern gap international trade rule regulations, impasse multilateral trade negotiation consequently, rise number regional bilateral trade arrangements. 2 bi review 27/2007 fifthly, rapid pace globalisation monetary financial relationship accompany improvement international financial architecture. manage financial crisis remain largely national responsibility. a unctad’s trade development report, 2006 noted: ‘‘the bulk adjustment case external imbalance often concentrate group develop transition economies, despite fact source imbalance may occur develop world’’ (overview, p. 38-39). in wake developments, grow expression heighten sensitivity cost associate globalisation. it recognise ultimate analysis, public policy important role manage cost benefit globalisation. to quote chairman bernanke: ‘‘further progress global economic integration take granted…as past, social political opposition openness strong… much arise change pattern production likely threaten livelihood worker profit firms…the natural reaction affect resist change, example, seek passage protectionist measures’’ (jackson hole, 2006). in brief, unfold path global economic integration consequently, preference open economy beset unknown uncertainties. in broad setting, let u look emerge challenge monetary policy. first, consideration relate maximise output employment weigh much upon monetary authority maintain price stability, particularly develop countries. the twin-objective often enshrine legal provision except inflation target mandated. however, domestic inflation increasingly become le sensitive domestic output gap potentially sensitive world output gap. each country may, therefore, take holistic approach trinity free flow capital, fix manage exchange rate independent monetary policy. the impossible trinity often manage emerge economy ensure close coordination monetary public policies. second, central bank often concern stability / variability inflation rather level prices. however, inflation process become highly unclear, amidst uncertainties; central bank face need recognise importance inflation perception inflation expectation also, distinct inflation indicators. the distinction inflationary expectation current inflation perception context inflation policy also worth bear mind. furthermore, often not, expect

finland central bank belgium, luxembourg netherlands, bank finland, helsinki, 16 march 2007. * * * we today witness could consider historic event. the governor two central bank minute sign agreement, bank finland become partner group use joint information system central bank cash management – cashssp – cash single share platform. i glad josé manuel gonzález-páramo, member executive board ecb responsible banknote directorate, able join important event, together belgian guest partners. i know also colleague bank finland appreciate presence all. a know, cashssp product originally develop year ago national bank belgium manage country's cash handle requirements. over years, product update today capable meet broad range requirement place systems. the benelux country enjoy tradition strong long-standing cooperation, top which, always know progressive think open approach change. it therefore completely natural that, come time consider modernise systems, first look close neighbours. this also case introduction development eurosystem bring pressure change respective national information system cash handling, example. the netherlands luxembourg natural partner belgium – already user cashssp. how bank finland come project? we place information system set meet currency supply needs, – technically functionally – become outdated. almost two year ago, plan start replace system new ones, already reach point project plan build new system ready, formal approval pending. at time, however, receive information belgian system willingness offer system euro area central banks. we take matter nbb, soon appear cashssp, already expressively named, would also suit bank finland's needs. for us, key selection criterion were: • it enable streamline work flow best economically sensible way, make widespread use modern bar code techniques, instance. • it reduce need resource input it offer almost fully-fledged system well equipment run system. • it support harmonisation eurosystem's cash distribution function towards single euro cash area. • it line eurosystem's mission, strategic objective organisational principles. have decide join cashssp, negotiation commence necessary agreements, price policy detail operational framework. it clear, try find common denominator information technology, business option share cost benefits, negotiation necessarily simple easy. in course process, cooperation partner have, however, show understand question raised, negotiation take place constructive fruitful atmosphere; expression effort sign agreement, bank finland's cashssp project formally launched. at practical level, already prepare project long time. bi review 26/2007 1 despite comprehensive cooperation agreement, success cashssp base confidence party involve quality ongoing cooperation. the party commit help best ability. an excellent example assistance nbb already provide u form system installation user training. in broad context, cooperation national central bank cashssp project significant case new, truly european approach central bank operations, evolve within eurosystem. member ncb's look way deepen cooperation flexible creative manner, develop area specialisation basis relative strengths. this is, without doubt, welcome development. accord organisational principle eurosystem, adopt govern council, "potential synergy economy scale shall identify exploit extent feasible", "the eurosystem shall energetically pursue organisational option ensure effectiveness, efficiency prompt action". develop division labour especially important, eurosystem need improve cost efficiency significant degree. many activity large fix cost thus delegate central bank avoid duplication costs. this kind pool actually one promise way pursue efficiency goal set organisational principles. for reasons, bank finland take positive attitude drive efficiency deep cooperation. however, condition progress field still bear mind. in particular, governance account system must build carefully "pooling" arrangement, ensure cost benefit adequately measure shared, user get sufficient control pool service produce developed. this is, course, necessary kind trust require delegation tasks. it also conformity organisational principle emphasize value transparency accountability. secondly, expect eurosystem central bank participate emerge division labour basis reasonable reciprocity. this reciprocity also conform nicely organizational principles, accord "all member eurosystem shall contribute strategically operationally goal system". the bank finland part – ncb's – actively analysis relative strength consider capacity participate emerge division labour balance way; user pool services, also service provider. so i expect willingness participate future pool scheme proportion prospect host services, feel usefully contribute. however, i expect condition i mention prove great obstacle progress important deepen operational cooperation within eurosystem. good governance model pool scheme develop – perhaps along line mark cashssp project – ncb's find niches, make strong contribution success efficiency system whole. to finish, let congratulate work order make cooperation agreement possible also express appreciation national bank belgium useful innovative work. thank you. 2 bi review

junbo, deputy governor people’s bank china, “2006 china financial forum”, beijing, 26 december 2006. * * * distinguish guests, lady gentlemen: i’m please attend 2006 china financial forum jointly hold china society finance bank financial news. this forum take theme “a harmonious society – social responsibility china’s financial sector”, great significance, theme reflect characteristic times, also align objective construct socialist harmonious society, highlight practical question face financial sector china, i.e., role financial sector play social responsibility take core modern economy. it fair say u financial practitioners, especially lead positions, must take issue seriously. not long ago, i publish article entitle “push forward construction harmonious socialist society develop financial system disadvantaged”. today, i’d like take opportunity talk background concept put forward, definition financial system disadvantaged, key aspects. 1. background concept a know all, modern society, finance economy interdependent. since china’s reform opening-up, economy grow stable fast pace. while overall national strength keep improving, deep-rooted problem emerge accumulated, lead structural imbalance economy society, reflect uneven development among regions, rural urban areas, among industrial sectors. one direct outcome “three imbalances” emerge grow group disadvantage regions, sector people. the support involvement financial system one important factor define development disadvantage group. the financial sector make great endeavor undertake pilot program area, particular support development central western china, development agriculture, rural area farmers, reemployment laid-off workers, poverty reduction initiative student loans. we’ve put forward theories, carry trials, gain experiences, positive negative. but general, theories, practice experience drive isolate event instead systematic plan. there theoretical conclusion make strategic perspective construct harmonious socialist society, practice guidance thereof. because absence systematic financial theory, institutional policy system guide push ahead construction harmonious society, difficult display synergy entire financial sector cause. in new century, especially since 16th cpc national congress, clarify strategic importance build socialist harmonious society socialist society construction drive. in addition, conclude 6th plenary session 16th cpc national congress adopt decision major issue concern construction harmonious socialist society. a center modern economy, finance able play important role construction socialist harmonious society. so far, financial sector fully adapt endeavor build harmonious socialist society. we need make major breakthrough financial reform future. one major task conduct theoretical analysis utilize financial sector support build harmonious socialist society, find way sector so.. since structural imbalance major strain, finance make due contribution solve structural imbalances. to specific, financial sector move away concept “favoring rich poor”, provide, base market principle, necessary support industrial sectors, region group short fund lag behind economic social development. this requirement financial sector support harmonious economic development, also responsibility. a such, i believe necessary put forward bi review 26/2007 1 concept “developing financial system disadvantaged” fully display function financial sector construction harmonious socialist society. 2. definition concept “finance disadvantaged” refer finance activity underdevelop area groups. so far china, mean support render disadvantage sector agriculture primary one, less-developed region mainly central western china, disadvantage group farmer laid-off worker urban areas. it fair say finance disadvantage represent revision traditional finance seek immediate return. generally speaking, country immature financial systems, opportunity available small group population certain capital accumulation, short capital accumulation deprive development opportunities, subsequently benefit economic growth. however, mature financial system various financial institution appropriate institutional arrangement, possible give financial support people region lack capital accumulation equip productive skill resource one way another, opportunity grow develop. therefore, conform principle efficiency market economy, finance allocate resource backward region industrial sectors, help improve welfare disadvantage groups, make benefit economic growth promote harmonious society. internationally, two type financial support disadvantage industrial sectors, people regions, namely direct government involvement indirect policy guidance government. direct government involvement mean government establish policy financial institution lend disadvantage industrial sector regions, policy guidance mean government adopt preferential policy guide market increase input disadvantaged. policy support important feature finance disadvantaged. however, finance disadvantage policy financial activities, relatively complete financial system include commercial, cooperative charity financial activities,. specific form finance disadvantage vary country country. generally speaking, relatively complete financial system disadvantage least include three aspects: financial institutions, legal system policy supports.. first, full spectrum financial institution provide finance disadvantaged. a lot country put place well-developed system, include government-backed financial institutions, private partners, commercial institution private lend institutions. they interact complement support development backward regions, industrial sector disadvantage groups. for example, far support agricultural development concerned, u government-backed agricultural lend institutions, farmer cooperative financial institutions, commercial financial institution private lend institutions; japan, agriculture, forestry fishery finance corporation act policy financial institution, japan agricultural cooperative cooperative financial institutions; india, cooperative agricultural lend institutions, policy financial institution commercial bank work together support agricultural development; addition, 40 country government establish agricultural insurance scheme conduct agricultural insurance business. to support development backward regions, various country apply policy finance, development finance, supportive measures. so far, 750 financial institution (40% latin america) work sole purpose develop backward regions. almost every african country set bank regional development. to support disadvantage groups, 150 country pension insurance institutions, half country world establish policy medical insurance institutions. furthermore, many country student loan scheme various forms, play important role promote economic development social stability. second, legal system govern finance disadvantaged. most country regulate financial institution fully-fledged legal framework, strictly separate financial legislation regulation regulate commercial finance target policy cooperative finance, latter group financial institution law free intervention. thus, able serve agriculture, rural areas, disadvantage industrial sector group better. many country promulgate special law emphasize importance finance disadvantaged, federal agricultural loan act, agricultural credit union act, community investment statute us, law japanese development banks, law japan 2 bi review 26/2007 scholarship society japan, kfw-gesetz (law kfw development bank) germany, law korean development bank, law long-term credit bank korea south korea, act agricultural intermediary credit development company india, etc. these law gradually improve support safeguard development financial institution disadvantage regions, industrial sector groups. third, system supportive policies. investment less-developed region disadvantage industrial sector disadvantage group low efficiency, diminish returns, high risks; therefore, unlikely secure capital investment completely market-oriented. a such, lot country provide preferential policies, capital infusion development financial institutions, guarantee, tax holiday, interest subsidy, etc. for example, german government guarantee liability kfw incur support development disadvantage industrial sector regions, grant special treatment tax exemption zero dividend payout shareholders, allow profit use increase capital. japan development bank exempt local tax, state tax corporate tax. the korean government guarantee principal interest payment financial bond issue korean development bank’s support development disadvantage industries. the u federal government provide credit guarantee private financial institution give credit backward regions. in build railway network western states, federal government grant various favorable financial policy railway company boost finance capabilities. 3. the focus develop finance disadvantage china we make progress develop financial system disadvantaged, lot compare develop country order build harmonious socialist society. in opinion, make effort follow three key aspect order develop financial system disadvantaged. first, new measure take create financial system disadvantaged. since reform, financial institution establish disadvantage china, fully fledged. for example, structural operational problem rural financial institutions, extensive operational mode, weak management, low profitability, yet-to-be improve staff quality, high risk associate rural credit cooperatives; agricultural bank china fully function major player commercial finance farmer rural economy; risk compensation, share transfer mechanism sound policy agricultural loans, guarantee mechanism rural area agricultural insurance yet developed. there enough innovation financial institution supportive policy meet need farmers’ productive activity livelihood. generally speaking, room improvement financial system disadvantaged, include traditional financial institutions, policy, development, commercial cooperative financial institutions, also include innovative financial institution venture capital investment, guarantee, insurance, leasing, micro-credit financial institutions. endeavor make create system various type financial institution coexist, complement compete other, well-defined function responsibility satisfy demand disadvantage industrial sectors, group backward region financial services. it worth mention that, micro finance, new measure poverty reduction, evolve micro loan farmer 1970s, micro-credit micro-businesses 1980s, finance seek commercial viability loan coverage. it become important part financial system disadvantaged. we make trial micro finance past, future, explore development mode multiple player line chinese situation draw positive negative experience countries, micro finance truly effectively support majority disadvantaged. second, progress make create legal system finance disadvantaged. the finance disadvantage part financial system, carry feature conform general principle financial system one hand; other, development follow certain special rules. thus, necessary strengthen legal system finance disadvantaged. the first strengthen legislation policy finance. from international perspective, primary principle separate law type policy financial institutions. policy bank china legal framework; instead, regulate reference law regulation govern commercial banks. this hind smooth operation policy banks, also affect position themselves. therefore, must actively explore bi review 26/2007 3 independent legislation policy financial institutions. administrative regulation may promulgate gradually become laws. second, strengthen regulation guide informal finance. informal finance, complement formal finance, play role boost economic activity rural area poor region promote regional economic development extent. however, due absence law regulations, contain lot hide risks. in recent years, informal finance’s positive role increasingly recognized, legal framework develop time. therefore, law regulation create improve protect legitimate informal financial activity crack loan sharks, underground banks, illegal fundraise illegal activities. third, adopt new measure policy support finance disadvantaged. policy guidance support government common develop finance disadvantaged. government support multifaceted mutually reinforcing, include legal, economic administrative measures, direct indirect. a mention earlier, inception development finance disadvantage various countries, see government support play central role. finance disadvantage base effective combination government credit market credit, reflect synergy government support market performance. to specific, firstly, government provide reliable source capital specialize financial institutions, provide guarantee policy lend ensure sustainability operations. second, emphasis lay upon coordination fiscal financial policies, reflect tax break fiscal subsidy relevant financial institution activities, close cooperation fiscal financial departments. third, transfer payment go disadvantage groups, industrial sector backward region form agricultural insurance, unemployment insurance minimum subsistence, support risk management debt service capability. these personal opinion toward financial system disadvantaged, food thought. hope provoke research area, hopefully practice make financial sector socially responsible build harmonious society. i’m open question challenges. thank you! 4 bi review 26/2007 emmanuel

president deutsche bundesbank, university pune, pune, 15 march 2007. * * * 1 introduction dear mr. jadhav, member university pune, lady gentleman this first visit india. although i fly ten hour ago, i already quite impress i see brief time here. the official slogan indian ministry tourism is: “incredible india!” this almost perfect description impression far. my speech entitle “challenges pose (financial) globalisation”. regard globalisation, isn’t term attract nearly much attention past ten years. it quite justify say globalisation implication “topic decade”. and i think globalisation likely maintain position foreseeable future. the process globalisation various facets. hence, many angle one might look process (for example, historical, political, social, economic). not surprisingly, remarks, i shall take central banker’s point view: i shall focus mainly economic implication ongoing global integration. besides financial aspect globalisation, i shall cover real economic aspect well, since feature cannot meaningfully separated. 2 globalisation: basic remark characteristic let start make basic observation respect globalisation. globalisation term refer pretty often media, politician economists. however, single definition globalisation actually mean single key figure measure scale evolution time. to me, useful approach define globalisation that, quite fundamentally, term “globalisation” describe ongoing process international division labour. in wake process, domestic market good services, well labour markets, become interlink interdependent internationally. in absence single yardstick gauge extent globalisation evolving, useful look various development that, combination, reflect process quite well. primarily, three element characterise globalisation. first: the steadily rise volume global trade, whose growth rate exceed global gdp long time now. on average, global trade grow 50% fast world gdp past 35 years. during 1990s, global trade even grow twice fast global gdp. among reason explain development, number factor particular relevance. more good service become tradable. in addition, company economy become involve foreign trade. a result, degree real economic openness many countries, measure total export import good service ratio gdp, increase significantly. in german case, relevant figure amount roughly 75% last year, compare 60% 1990. second: the ongoing internationalisation production processes, measured, example, grow volume foreign direct investment (fdi). fdis increase considerably since 1970s. accord unctad figures, worldwide fdi stock amount usd10 trillion 2005. about 77,000 transnational enterprise roughly 770,000 branch involved. fdi flow among develop country still account majority fdi flows. the share develop country recipient fdis, though, increase markedly past years. however, investment concentrate countries, mainly asia. third: the increase openness many economy financial terms, measure ratio sum external asset liability domestic gdp. for germany, figure currently amount roughly 340%, three time high 1990. compare develop countries, bi review 31/2007 1 germany among high degree financial openness. in addition, increase financial openness many economy also reflect strongly rise international capital flows, example, term cross-border security transactions. the process globalisation evolve among develop country many decade now. therefore, contrast observer might think, current process globalisation per se neither new special uniqueness. rather, logical outcome effort exploit benefit division labour international scale. however, pace process increase rapidly decade now. in particular, decline cost telecommunication transportation main driver development. in addition, skill level many region world improve considerably quality good service produce formerly rather underdevelop countries. additionally, change face globalisation fact globalisation nowadays extend large group country past. more country formerly rather close economy open world market. thus, new player enter global stage become increasingly relevant economic power and, result, competitor establish develop countries. a consequence, process globalisation lead shift weight within global economy. this shift nothing exceptional. it quite natural development simply reflect continuously evolve global economic landscape. within process, china india, particular, gain particular relevance past decade, economic political terms. in case india, little doubt world’s large democracy emerge global economic power. it economic growth average 8% past four years, place among world’s fastest-growing economies, inflation remain largely contained. it dynamic development foreign trade, instance, quite impressive, too, thus lead rise share volume global trade. “india go global” – title book publish last year imf – appropriate description india’s recent development. i think outline process globalisation among important factor fuel global growth dynamic see four year now. and likely keep so, least medium-term future. imf estimate suggest that, unless witness rather unexpected incidents, 2007 fifth consecutive year above-average increase global real gdp. after outline major characteristic current process globalisation, let continue elaborate implications. 3 implication challenge globalisation 3.1 real economic implication in various part world, quite lot people rather sceptical think real economic implication globalisation. in fact, often indistinct fear globalisation mainly risky development negative consequence clearly prevail. at heart concern develop country fear loss job well pressure social security systems. while recognise associate challenges, fact globalisation basically positive phenomenon cannot stress much. what benefit globalisation? accord foreign trade theory, international division labour, exploit comparative cost advantages, leads, competitive conditions, efficiency gain increase average per caput income. compare situation without foreign trade, economy concern great consumption possibilities. in addition, globalisation increase product variety, beneficial consumers, enlarge input output market companies. finally, globalisation intensify competition, thus foster innovation, accelerate dissemination technological expertise. but economic theory underline globalisation positive process. besides theoretical aspects, empirical evidence clearly show develop country opt world economy associate global exchange good services. 2 bi review 31/2007 in turn, actively participate globalisation process prerequisite increase real income live standard population, impediment it. to me, obvious globalisation, among factors, make crucial contribution increase wealth part world. however, integration formerly rather close economy world economy process set prudently. otherwise, integration process might impact negatively domestic economy well-being population might increase risk crisis instead enhance chance prosperity. this true real sector, especially financial sector task liberalise capital flows. the process open world economy need accompanied, among things, regulatory supervisory system strengthen financial institution ability manage risk well strengthen resilience financial economic system whole. thus, domestic factors, all, major importance country wish benefit globalisation. india’s approach liberalise capital flow part far-reaching economic reform initiate early 1990s, prove well-founded strategy. with gradual cautious steps, carefully phase sequence across country, india successfully pave way strong position see today. let continue look closely relationship globalisation monetary policy, certainly special interest central banker. 3.2 globalisation monetary policy for central banks, important understand force transmission channel globalisation order calibrate monetary policy stance adequate way give domestic goal monetary policy. two aspect special interest central banks: first, way globalisation change domestic inflation processes. second, way globalisation alter transmission monetary policy measure – words, change short-term interest rate – economic system. by large, first aspect closely relate real globalisation, whereas second question deal consequence financial globalisation. globalisation inflation the ongoing increase real globalisation coincide decline inflation rate worldwide. it surprise parallel development give causal interpretation along line increase real globalisation drive inflation rates. and, indeed, past six years, price manufacture import euro area rather stable, thus dampening, thing equal, increase overall consumer price index. the development could observe mature economy well. this prima facie evidence seem support view globalisation main factor low inflation rates. however, i quite sceptical whether story globalisation adequately capture aspect important explain decline inflation rates, least euro area. first, increase trade volume relative gdp process already way 1970s 1980s. however, inflation rate period substantially high today. second, effect increase trade labour-abundant economy affect relative prices. it well-known fact that, aggregate price level rate change, relative price effect ultimate influence. it monetary policy that, medium long term, pin trend inflation. globalisation might contribute observable decline cross-country trend inflation positive price shock create environment central bank could use “the opportunistic approach disinflation”. but seem convince explanation bulk industrial countries. third, even immediate relative price effect trade emerge economy benign inflation industrial country commonly assumed. the rapid industrialisation economy like china india lead sharply rise energy demand countries. this demand contribute markedly increase oil commodity price past couple years. it bi review 31/2007 3 difficult estimate net effect development overall price level industrial countries. but, view, reason assume overall outcome one benign inflation outlook. take together, reason exercise caution regard popular globalisation story inflation. in words, view, real effect globalisation inflation process issue interest monetary policymakers. but, end day, importance commonly attach globalisation force le clear popular view often assume. the decline trend inflation worldwide good explain monetary policy many country gear towards price stability, enhance increase independence central bank achieve goals. globalisation play supportive role, but, final analysis, monetary policy responsible medium long-term inflation outcomes. financial globalisation transmission monetary policy another aspect globalisation potential crucial implication impressive growth cross-border financial flows. a domestic asset price increasingly determine global factors, transmission channel monetary policy measure might change well. this especially relevant long-term interest rate constitute one main variable monetary policy influence economic outcome inflation. doe globalisation mean monetary policy lose leverage domestic long-term interest rates? and so, mean monetary policy become ineffective? i want go much details. let make two points: first, even true long-term interest rate increasingly determine global capital market, mean render monetary policy ineffective. one workhorse international macroeconomic theory, mundell-fleming model, deal precisely issue 40 year ago. and familiar result that, long operate flexible exchange rate, monetary policy become effective high degree capital mobility is. the exchange rate channel compensate decline ability influence long-term rates. second, one might debate whether influence long-term rate important way central bank achieve goals. issue transparency, independence credibility monetary policy are, view, far important stabilise inflation expectation thus safeguard price stability. 3.3 globalisation financial stability aspect apart likely influence inflation conduct monetary policy, financial globalisation increasingly affect financial stability aspect well. the term “financial stability” broadly describe financial system’s ability perform key function efficiently, include stress situation period profound structural change. this embrace efficient allocation financial resources, settlement payment security transactions, spread price risk. the importance many central bank attach stability financial system increase substantially past years. regard financial globalisation, main reason development internationalisation financial flow increase degree integration national financial system therefore also heighten risk contagion event turbulence. financial stability issue are, least implicitly, also task central banks. what basic rationale behind conclusion? the central banks’ primary objective safeguard monetary stability, thereby facilitate sustainable growth development, base prerequisite stable financial system. in fact, monetary financial system stability intertwine phenomena: monetary stability maintain financial system sufficiently stable transmit monetary policy signals, example. in turn, stable financial system unthinkable without monetary stability, necessary, albeit sufficient prerequisite financial stability. with respect current challenge or, rather risk financial stability, let finally rather briefly mention two development continue – even increase – global relevance. 4 bi review 31/2007 first aspect: global imbalance the issue global imbalance continuous part nearly every analysis deal risk world economy past years. the term ‘imbalances’ refer today’s uneven pattern trade and, closely relate this, capital flow among major country regions. in connection, u current account attract attention among economist policymakers well. basically, today’s situation characterise fact us, particular, record large trade deficits, thus require substantial net capital inflows, country – especially emerge asia, also oil export country – provide capital sizeable trade surpluses. today’s uneven pattern global trade capital flow accompany massive accumulation foreign exchange reserve – mostly asian oil-exporting surplus regions. this reveal unprecedented accumulation foreign exchange reserves, follow large current account surplus many emerge market countries, much part global imbalance u current account deficit. global imbalance ongoing matter concern since still harbour latent risk disorderly unwinding, substantial negative consequence global economic growth, employment stability. thus, successfully rebalancing global economy remain press issue global relevance. undoubtedly, goal achieve combine policy action party involved. second aspect: search yield risky asset the search yield risky asset one main topic time record-low interest rate major economic regions. key central bank interest rate well long-term market interest rate move upwards meantime, remain rather moderate historical standards. therefore, search yield risky asset still seem define action many market participants. despite mark correction various financial market quite recently, ongoing sign relatively low risk premia still increase use leverage instruments, credit markets. both development reflect rather pronounce feel complacency among many market participants. this raise question whether risk appropriately reflect price various financial assets. why search yield entail risks? the search yield risky asset might profitable investment economic condition remain favourable present. however, unexpected deterioration macroeconomic environment, instance, could trigger turnaround sentiment widespread repercussions. it therefore key risk adequately take account price appropriately. the ongoing search yield risky asset warrant close monitor central banks. 4 conclude remark globalisation, define process international division labour, quite natural process economic environment evolve continuously. basically, beneficial country participate process. however, degree country benefit opportunity open market determine mainly domestically influence factors. india show integrate successfully global exchange good service become emerge market economy major importance. moreover, (financial) globalisation pose various challenge domestic global economic monetary policy environment. the analysis challenges, origin possible implications, remain top many central banks’ agenda. cop successfully challenge continue vital foster sustainable growth development many part world hence matter global interest. bi review 31/2007 5 david dodge: promote sound economic policy globally locally remark mr david dodge, governor bank canada, america society council americas, new york, 29 march 2007. * * * it three year since i last opportunity address council americas. since then, global economy continue expand remarkable pace. indeed, past five years, grow five-year period since second world war. in opinion, much performance credit increasingly widespread acceptance need liberalize worldwide financial trade order. many country close outside world actively engage global economy. notable example china, india, and, within americas, chile. many state twenty five year ago would consider "less-developed countries," within sphere former soviet union, experience benefit economic openness, million people lift extreme poverty. in canada unite states, understand many – although certainly – interest, economic geopolitical, increase number country take part liberalize financial trade order. while clear successes, particularly asia, also clear disappointments. within latin america, perhaps disappointment successes. and even latin american country take real step join global economy, anti-globalization sentiment remain quite strong. so today, i want talk factor lead either success setback progress towards liberalize global framework trade finance. then, i want talk particular challenge face promote active involvement global economy country throughout latin america. i confine remark economics, although challenge clearly extend well beyond domain. develop global policy framework the best place begin aftermath world war ii. delegate monetary financial conference bretton woods, new hampshire, begin create economic order trade could flourish, postwar reconstruction could take place. lead strong contingent american, british, and, i may say so, canadian representatives, delegate set establish new international institutions. these would serve table around policy-makers would gather work could call "rules game" new financial trade order. over time, policy-makers new institution real success develop rule game several important areas. early on, establishment international monetary fund (imf), international bank reconstruction development, would become world bank. later, general agreement tariff trade launched, would ultimately become today's world trade organization (wto). and time, organisation economic co-operation development (oecd) evolve become venue financial authority could gather discus best promote strong economy liberalize markets, free trade, sound macroeconomic policies. initially, rule game mean apply many so-called "first world" nations, include unite states, canada, western europe, japan, australia, new zealand. and many year second world war, rule develop serve country reasonably well. indeed, global economic order sufficiently successful number nation begin see economy citizen could benefit take part it. and so, nation begin adopt policy framework need become engage increasingly inter-connected global economy. i'll say minutes. but first, i want discus struggle policy-makers keep rule game relevant, give change nature global economy. bi review 31/2007 1 update rule game the need keep rule game update surprise. after all, world economy change tremendously past decades. enormous advance transportation, communications, information technology lead widespread gain productivity massive change structure world economy. while go on, new economic powerhouse emerged. in response developments, rule game evolve somewhat, institution support global financial trade order. but blunt, neither rule institution fully keep times. to illustrate point, i'm go say word imf particular. the fund critical establish rule monetary policy exchange rate year immediately follow second world war. but recently, imf perceive country irrelevant, activity spark resentment outright hostility countries, include latin america. a major source hostility perception irrelevance fact fund evolve step global economy. and lack evolution contribute fund's inability prevent even mitigate international crisis asian crisis 1997 argentinean crisis 2001. in absence global co-operation update rule game, effective imf support rules, see drift towards regional initiatives. and rather use imf efficiently pool international reserves, country china set accumulate high level reserves. i make several speech place need strengthen surveillance function imf, improve governance, make representative today's global economy. i repeat argument here; interest detail recommendation imf, i'd invite read lecture i give one year ago princeton university. the point i want make today strengthen imf could help country – include latin america – willingly support engage fund. and would increase chance country would willingly engage global economy. unfortunately, recent years, attention canada unite state focus mainly asia. we work hard help asian economy integrate global economy take rightful place policy-makers' table. we've encourage country play rule game respect international trade, particular, support accession wto. but time, become concern nations, notably china, always follow rule game respect monetary exchange rate issues. rather deal issue strengthen imf, g-7, include unite states, often deal country-by-country basis. my contention u g-7, particularly unite state – truly belief liberal financial trade order – lead effort strengthen multilateral institutions, imf. not would strong imf effective forum deal policy challenge see asia, would also effective encourage country latin america engage fully liberalize financial trade order. policy challenge central south america because recent focus asia, have, many ways, neglect need promote economic progress development backyard. we need pay equal attention encourage global economic involvement promote appropriate policy hemisphere, country latin america citizen share benefit globalization. but simple task. the challenge latin america differ asia regions. and task make difficult table around economic policy-makers hemisphere regularly gather. there organization american state (oas), deal mainly political strategic issues. there cemla, deal limit range issue common central banker americas. there inter-american development bank, project-oriented policy-oriented. and imf, country latin america caribbean island nation divide among four executive directors. in short, really need table around economic policy-makers america gather. unfortunately, oecd americas. 2 bi review 31/2007 if oecd americas, would do? essentially, could serve function original oecd western europe. it could forum economic policy-makers would discus best promote strong economy sound monetary, financial, fiscal policies, well promote liberalize market free trade. i know table could created, could ensure discussion would fruitful one oecd. but create table could positive step, i would interest hear think discussion period. monetary policy let take minute discus issue could deal oecd americas. i'll begin subject area: monetary policy. the first point make latin america overcome history high inflation and, occasionally, hyperinflation. high inflation hold back economic development latin america, also devastate effect poor citizens, cannot shield pernicious consequences. inflation exacerbate problem already skew income distribution. some country make substantial progress get inflation control keep control. i think chile, mexico, recently, brazil. in cases, central bank give sufficient independence government task control inflation, although i hasten add independence brazilian central bank never formally legislated. these central bank able make progress adopt inflation-targeting framework, support float exchange rate. in latin american setting, inflation target tremendously helpful promote macroeconomic stability, facilitate investment, importantly, aid vulnerable member society. indeed, low-inflation environment allow bank offer credit household first time – often crucial first step escape poverty. i'll say bank sector moment. i also mention small nation caribbean central america achieve low inflation, quite appropriately, fix exchange rate u.s. dollar. but celebrate monetary progress, must also consider country trouble monetary policy history: argentina. this country natural advantage need one rich hemisphere. but argentina consistently fail live potential, bad policy choice largely blame. the independence argentina's central bank repeatedly undermined, unfortunately, current policy path choose government lead high inflation country. of course, argentina alone regard. perhaps important thing canada unite state demonstrate support country make right policy choices. in way, show citizen government right path development. that bank canada work closely banco central de chile, banco de méxico, banco central brasil, provide support technical assistance implement inflation targeting. financial system policy next, i'll say word financial system policy. here, i'm refer rule govern bank financial sector, well policy support sound clear settlement systems. this area often overlooked. a sound stable bank sector is, course, enormously helpful encourage investment, lead increase employment economic activity. and, i mentioned, extend access credit broad segment population critical step towards economic progress. with increase access credit, poor member society enable break poverty trap. progress financial sector area quite good several country number years. indeed, one could argue progress latin america financial system policy asia. the result commercial bank unite states, canada, europe, expand region. but important also encourage local financial institution latin america. in long run, sound vibrant bi review 31/2007 3 financial sector place everybody's interest, even financial institution would face increase competition markets. another point make policy must put place encourage development local capital market across latin america, begin government bond markets. it capital market financial institution save efficiently turn productive investments, stimulate economic growth help alleviate unemployment poverty. clearly, oecd-like table, policy-makers latin america learn other, experience canada unite states, could tremendously helpful area. it would beneficial forum economic policy-makers could gather discus issue devise solution help strengthen financial sector policy across americas. fiscal policy now let turn fiscal policy. in many ways, achilles heel latin american economic policy. there example sound fiscal framework region, although i would point chile, adopt prudent policy sequester windfall gain realize sharp increase price exports. elsewhere, mexico brazil make progress, although much might like see. and even improvement, country still lack anchor fiscal policy, although i acknowledge that, often not, problem political rather economic. that's different situation many oecd country 1960s 1970s. but helpful fiscal authority oecd receive support analysis carry institution, well colleague around oecd table. this another area regional table america would tremendous help. fiscal authority region could gather exchange policy advice develop strategy deal situations. and civil servant could gather share best practice regard tax expenditure issues. we canada unite state offer advice. but, ultimately, fiscal policy latin america political problem, people government latin america solve it. trade policy the final area i want address trade policy. we agree open trade key economic development. canadian american clearly benefit free trade, reasonable degree support trade liberalization. however, latin america, much great resistance free trade, much great popular support protectionist policies. indeed, number country choose adopt trade policy impede growth jeopardize improvement live standards. but government canada unite state generally favour advocate free trade, always act beliefs. and since poor job demonstrate willingness live principle espouse, surprise canada unite state unable convince neighbour america best way raise income lift people poverty take challenge free trade global competition. one way u good job work diligently towards resumption doha round trade talks, show great willingness open market product latin american country comparative advantage. i recognize easy me, central banker, say need confront protectionism. but political problem canada unite state solve. these area – monetary policy, financial sector policy, fiscal policy, trade – i see four major economic policy challenge latin america. and four area would helpful forum economic policy-makers americas, forum could facilitate great co-operation hemisphere. my remark today reflect long-standing tradition bank canada work central bank colleague throughout hemisphere. but beyond bank's collaboration region, canada enjoy endure connection americas. more canadian travel latin america caribbean part world outside unite states. canada join oas sign nafta early 1990s. our involvement america grown, encourage democratic transition, increase commercial 4 bi review 31/2007 investment opportunities, movement people. and canada's engagement continue grow. in speech last month, prime minister note canada "will seek re-engage relationship throughout americas, partner mexico, caribbean, central south america." conclusion lady gentlemen, allow conclude. the prosperity enjoy canada unite state testament ability free market generate wealth raise live standards. we understand gain come build strong global financial trade order, back appropriate rule game. other government work hard engage global order they, too, understand benefit bring citizens. we face two challenges. first, must think globally best update rule game take account evolve nature global economy. second, must act locally, within hemisphere, help neighbour see integration global economy everyone's interest. neither task easy. they require patience persistence. and along way, encounter government incline withdraw process engage global economy. but can't let difficulty dissuade u goal. to delegate bretton woods, task rebuild world's economy must appear daunt indeed. and time political see task appear lacking. but eventually, spirit co-operation overcome obstacles, policy-makers gather around table international institution build liberalize financial trade order – order lead prosperity know today. it time rekindle spirit co-operation build table americas, benefit global economy spread throughout hemisphere.

integration raise public awareness eurosystem’s role support financial integration process. before i focus content report, let first explain decide regularly prepare publish report. the eurosystem keen interest integration efficient function financial system europe, particularly euro area, give relevance fulfilment core tasks. in particular, financial integration key importance conduct single monetary policy, well-integrated financial system enhance smooth effective transmission monetary policy impulse throughout euro area. furthermore, financial integration highly relevant eurosystem’s task contribute safeguard financial stability. it also fundamental eurosystem’s task promote smooth operation payment system also relate safe efficient function security clear settlement systems. finally, accordance treaty establish european community, eurosystem supports, do without prejudice objective price stability, general economic policy community aim, inter alia, “sustainable non-inflationary growth”. financial integration, increase efficiency foster development financial system, help raise economy’s potential strong non-inflationary economic growth. the ecb entire eurosystem fully support effort private sector well european commission, european parliament council minister enhance integration development european financial system. in respect, let emphasise area financial integration ecb work close effective co-operation european commission primary responsibility field. a such, new ecb report complements, work commission aim enhance european financial integration. ii. summary content report let turn content report draw attention principal findings. our report structure three chapters. the first set ecb’s assessment “the state financial integration euro area”. this assessment base set quantitative indicator develop ecb.1 the second chapter, entitle “special features”, contain in-depth analysis select issue relate financial integration. the third chapter, “eurosystem activity financial integration” provides, overview contribution eurosystem towards integrate develop financial market europe. 1 from on, report contain indicator previously appear ecb report “indicators financial integration euro area”. the recent edition report release september 2006. the indicator continue update bi-annually ecb’s website. bi review 31/2007 1 ii.1 indicator state financial integration the ecb’s assessment state financial integration euro area cover money, bond, equity bank markets, well market infrastructures. the evidence confirm degree integration vary market segment generally advance market segment close single monetary policy, especially money market. the unsecured money market fully integrate since introduction euro, repo market also highly integrated. the full integration large-value payment system instrumental achieve result. government bond market become considerably integrate similarly corporate bond market receive major boost introduction euro subsequently achieve high degree integration. progress also make integration euro area equity markets, equity return increasingly determine factor common euro area country rather country-specific ones. however, areas, financial integration need enhanced. for example, euro area security infrastructure underpin bond equity market yet sufficiently integrated. similarly, retail bank market continue le integrate bank market segments. this situation also reflect fragment european retail payment system address detail one special features. ii.2 special feature the second chapter, “special features”, comprise in-depth assessment select issue relate financial integration. in edition report, special feature typically address major policy issues, may also contain analytical article subject financial integration. the topic mainly select basis importance eu’s financial integration agenda relevance pursuit ecb’s tasks. this first report cover follow three topics: “monetary policy financial integration”, “strengthening eu framework cross-border banks”, “the sepa initiative implication financial integration”. the first special feature, “monetary policy financial integration”, focus impact financial integration monetary policy transmission mechanism. deep integration broaden range finance source investment opportunity create economy scale. it allow economic agent share risk effectively, thus improve ability mitigate even offset consequence idiosyncratic shock might affect individual economy within euro area. a well integrate financial system is, therefore, crucial conduct single monetary policy, enhance smooth effective transmission monetary policy impulse throughout euro area. for example, well-integrated financial sector, cross-country difference way bank adjust interest rate change policy rate limited. indeed, thank increase financial integration, difference diminish time, contribute fact transmission mechanism operate broadly similar way across euro area countries. however, discrepancy interest rate pass-through across country seem persist, may reflect, addition different structure financial institution markets, lack sufficient financial integration. similarly, level type indebtedness household non-financial corporation play role transmission monetary policy. our analysis show difference across country could relate degree integration development respective financial systems. it emphasised, however, significant change occur financial sector since start monetary union increase choice financial product available finance, generate tangible benefit household non-financial enterprises. overall, conclude process financial market integration underway, yet complete, conducive smooth transmission monetary policy across euro area. nevertheless, great financial market integration could eliminate remain difference therefore facilitate transmission single monetary policy within euro area. 2 bi review 31/2007 the second special feature, “strengthening eu framework cross-border banks”, focus importance cross-border bank foster integration bank sector. while cross-border bank first foremost market-driven process, public sector play significant role provide policy framework adequate support cross-border activities. this special feature provide overview recent development cross-border bank

cooperation supervision cross-border banks. accord assessment eu supervisory arrangement already substantially enhance two significant measures: introduction lamfalussy approach bank sector adoption revise regulatory framework home-host country interaction capital requirement directive. additionally, several initiative underway ensure benefit improve institutional set fully reap various eu forum monitor progress make field. at time, discussion emerge whether may beneficial move time towards integrate supervisory arrangements. our analysis conclude find broad-based review eu supervisory

integration”, consider european bank industry’s initiative enhance integration retail payment system europe. the eurosystem support initiative act catalyst. the introduction single retail payment system natural complement introduction euro banknote coin necessary step towards integration retail payment market. the aim sepa project enable customer make efficient cashless payment throughout euro

feature conclude that, bank industry make substantial progress towards integrate retail payment market, commit introduce sepa instrument procedure january 2008 migrate critical mass customer payment end-2010, issues, transparency interoperability, still need finalised. ii.3 eurosystem activity financial integration the report’s third chapter, “eurosystem activity financial integration”, provide overview main eurosystem activity 2006. this chapter show ecb whole eurosystem contribute number way financial integration development, build expertise special nature public institution active market intense relationship market participants. we generally distinguish four activity contribution: (i) give advice legislative regulatory framework financial system direct rule-making; (ii) act catalyst private sector activities; (iii) enhance knowledge, raise awareness monitor state european financial integration; (iv) provide central bank service also foster european financial integration. i provide example four activities. with respect shape financial system’s legislative regulatory framework, i would like mention, example, eu security clear settlement infrastructure. it current bi review 31/2007 3 fragmentation represent major obstacle integration european security markets. great integration security clear settlement system crucial low post-trading cost cross-border security transactions, exploit potential economy scale establish european level playing-field. moreover, clear settlement infrastructure directly affect performance major task ecb, pertain implementation monetary policy via framework collateralisation monetary policy (and intraday credit) operations, safeguard financial stability promotion smooth operation payment systems. several public sector initiative aim achieve efficient, safe integrate post-trading market infrastructure european union. the ecb closely involve work participation clear settlement advisory monitor expert group (cesame) legal certainty group. let also mention – important development 2006 – that, european commission’s request, european industry association exchange post-trading infrastructure member sign “european code conduct clear settlement” last november. the ecb also participate relate monitor group chair commission. i turn function describe “acting catalyst private sector activities”. by mean area standard-setting establishment common infrastructures, cooperation private agent financial sector necessary competition. however, cooperation may fail materialise without support catalyst. the ecb entire eurosystem play role, account competence objectivity numerous contact market participants. the short-term european paper (step) initiative promote development pan-european short-term paper market market players’ voluntary compliance core set standard encompass step market convention. this convention sign 9 june 2006. since then, 32 step-compliant programmes, amount eur 166 billion, launch step label. the ecb support step initiative since inception 2001. during preparatory phase, ecb facilitate coordination among market players, contribute step task force financial market association aci provide legal assistance. the eurosystem’s ongoing contribution step market focus two main activities. first, june 2008, ecb nine eurosystem’s ncbs provide technical assistance step secretariat concern step label process, whereby ultimate responsibility grant withdraw step label fully rest step secretariat. second, ecb regularly produce statistic yield volume step market publish website. from next week onwards, daily statistic make available. follow publication yield statistics, step market accept non-regulated market collateral purpose eurosystem credit operations. turn research monitor activities, i would like mention ecb-cfs research network “capital market financial integration europe”, set 2002 ecb centre financial study frankfurt. the current research focus three areas: (i) relationship financial integration financial stability; (ii) eu accession, financial development financial integration; (iii) financial system modernisation economic growth europe. the network organise series conference attend academics, market participant policymakers, one host september 2006 deutsche bundesbank entitle “financial system modernisation economic growth”. furthermore, i would like mention that, every year, network award five “lamfalussy fellowships” promise young researcher undertake project field financial integration. finally, respect provision central bank service also conducive financial integration, example i choose wholesale payment system, target development target2. after rapid integration euro area money markets, closely relate establishment target system, plan launch single technical platform, target2, late year promote integration financial market affected. this achieved, particular, harmonise service level, single price structure, harmonise set cash settlement service central bank money “ancillary” systems, retail payment systems, clear house security settlement systems. 4 bi review 31/2007 in november 2006 eurosystem publish third progress report target2, inform market participant eurosystem’s decision price legal issues, contingency procedures, test migration activities. the report also confirm 19

project, namely definition user requirement basis market contributions. the scope project determine take account result public consultation. the govern council decide subsequent development phase early 2008. iii. conclusion this bring end presentation i would like conclude follow remarks. from presentation, may notice many different facet that, together, contribute financial integration shape european financial system. since central bank core financial systems, closely follow development foster integration. the ecb entire eurosystem devote substantial amount resource task convince important area progress european economy, within framework establish lisbon agenda. indeed progress make far towards integration development european financial system european achievement, creation euro make decisive contribution. finally, i also like stress that, financial integration important driver increase efficiency financial system, financial efficiency also depend factors. among degree

currency healthy serbian economy speech mr radovan jelašić, governor national bank serbia, roundtable “stable currency healthy economy”, belgrade, 16 february 2007. * * * lady gentlemen, mr yves thibault de silguy, the role national bank serbia well define law adopt mid-2003, maybe particular point copy eu treaty provision european central bank. the definition read follows: “the primary objective nb shall achieve maintain price stability. in addition primary objective, nb shall also pursue objective financial stability. without prejudice primary objective, nb shall support economic policy government republic serbia, act accordance principle market economy.” hence, law clearly define main objective – “to achieve maintain price stability” – say nothing growth, employment, exports, wages, roads, etc... the reason almost develop country adopt law – thankfully copy – simple enough: nothing contribute growth economic development, high employment growth export stability prices. this assertion prove right develop country course last two decades. all argument remind story 1860s prince mihailo reign serbia people debating, believe not, whether serbia need railroads. the comment like: “foreign machines, foreign machine drivers, foreign managers, expense." and, clearly define objective central bank need achieve, mean achieve strictly specify – though serbia, like country region, often much important find good excuse face reality. in simple words, law clearly define assignment without delineate mean realize it! “experts” serbia still engage theoretical discussion monetary policy while, time, think term exchange rate only! the fact relate exchange rate, however, show role nb set exchange rate never insignificant 2006 volume interbank trade foreign exchange never vigorous last year – increase much 189%. of course, still long way go achieve fully market-determined exchange rate, like example switzerland, right track get fast! we need a) still deep forex market, b) buyer seller engage forward trade abandon "euro cost costs" principle, c) exchange dealer trade exclusively banks. moreover, first two week year when, expected, demand foreign currency go substantially, nb intervene interbank foreign exchange market session one day only. do need another proof exchange rate freely formed? last year's inflation 6.5% serbia match level achieve neighbours. to illustrate, apply foreign exchange regime currency board, bulgaria record 6.5% also, bosnia 6.0%, hungary reach 6.5% romania 4.9%. build this, primarily low inflation record final quarter 2006, 2007 national bank serbia target low band 4-8% core inflation corridor, set already august 2006. let u note role monetary policy. last year key year serbia, finally recognize monetary policy represent significant powerful tool whose importance cannot overstated! this important point make, especially serbia, i honesty say first time modern proper monetary policy pursued! i find quite normal understandable person may come street čačak, novi sad belgrade ask national bank serbia one objective objective “to achieve maintain price stability” “to achieve growth development, high employment rates, exports, etc,” nb need sterilize excess money finance sterilization. but question raise “economists” “experts” – well, cause much concern! i get feel people try ignore valuable experience 1970s 1980s. many expert seem sleep past 20 year – economic science develop regardless! experience time well summarize bi review 30/2007 1 conference budapest month ago, 19 january 2007, jacques de

imagine live without it. it always mind – buy thing plan future, borrow give present – would feel strange count increase prices! because u 3 decades, abnormal situation become normal feel abnormal inflation. true, inflation, easy budgeting, plan, breathe, etc. price change time exchange rate unstable, never really comparable rest world, today’s calculation simply apply tomorrow, let alone day after. the true role nb governor: job would far easy i choose cover institution’s inefficiency mean inflation currency depreciation. but time changing, for, let remind you, serbia still process transition take time yet complete! if nothing else, stability price currency least impel many come much creative “explanations” price rises. only year ago, increase price milk, cable tv public transport service blame exchange rate… in course past year, nb create stable economic environment successfully slash inflation, force government policy maker face reality. and reality unyielding: inflation create jobs, push gdp up, and, perhaps importantly, inflation create welfare anywhere world! be possible that, even devastate consequence 1992-1993 hyperinflation country’s economy, serbia

one clear lesson history position lost. it always possible throw away advantage ill judge decisions. any widespread operational disruption fear security could also damaging, one reason tripartite authority spend much time improve crisis response management. but absence disaster structural factor i discuss seem likely favour concentration financial business city. first, entry china india international market associate massive expansion international trade finance relation overall world gdp. that seem likely continue major factor growth london past. fifteen year ago people worry development information technology would undermine centre like city london. when anyone could log receive market information trade real time, wouldn’t trader flee hurley burley relocate other, quiet cheap financial centre even city altogether? what seem happen opposite. the reduce cost collate information trade distance lead operation relocate london city become even important cluster financial activity. the technology could allow dispersion business instead allow great concentration.12 so whereas 1997 large share market turnover frankfurt’s eurex market come trader base germany (over 80%), large share 2005 come uk (with 45%). a asset trade remotely, may drive growth centre like london large pool skilled financial workers. the growth european capital market relative traditional commercial bank reinforce process. historically, european equity market small relative economy us. with around $30 trillion assets, euro-zone financial market still significantly small $50 trillion us. but europe close gap. in 2005 12 hm treasury, “the location financial activity euro”, 2003. bi review 29/2007 5 eurozone’s financial stock grow 20%, compare around 6% us. and euro-zone’s financial depth increase twice pace u past 10 years.13 if gap continue narrow, i expect favour growth london main centre europe’s capital markets. the development capital market asia behind still i would expect see continue rapid growth market next decade. the rationalisation bring single financial market europe push direction. the number central counterparty (ccps) clear house ownership halve europe since 1999. and 650 merger acquisition eu bank sector 2001 2005, quarter cross-border within europe. but process way go european financial sector become consolidated, financial institution become large complex, tend become intensive user capital markets. the major uk banks’ trade book assets, example, account 30% balance sheet asset compare little 15% back 2000. what countervail – centrifugal pressures? the creation canary wharf, expansion office space square mile west end help allow rapid expansion recent years. but course london expensive city high land labour costs. so see financial firm outsource function like it support, system development hr within uk europe india. that seem likely continue growth trade management london may well lead proportionate growth jobs. on current trend might expect great concentration high value, high skill job london. conclusion so back question: wave persistent stream? the answer is, spotted, both. reader bank’s financial stability report (next edition due next month) – read financial news – know financial market buoyant recently; particular premia risk credit market low profit growth bonus spectacular. some may well crest wave. however, reason i set afternoon, london also benefit long last strong current. we may expect cycle turn stage – london affect international position. but good reason expect london enhance position global financial centre long term. and implication rest economy risk faces. it continue affect labour market, house market, distribution wealth income. and sharpen dependence british economy wide international movement financial markets. i plan return implication come months. 13 mckinsey global institute, mckinsey & company's economics research institute. 6 bi review 29/2007 bi review 29/2007 1 frederic s mishkin: inflation dynamic remark mr frederic s mishkin, member board governor u federal reserve system, annual macro conference, federal reserve bank san francisco, san francisco, california, 23 march 2007. * * * under dual mandate, federal reserve seek promote price stability maximum sustainable employment.1 for reason, federal reserve acutely interest inflation process, good understand past – give inherent lag monetary policy affect economy – try forecast future. we economist make important stride understand inflation dynamic recent years. to sure, substantial gap knowledge remain, forecast still famously imprecise task, increase understand offer hope central bank able continue perhaps even improve upon successful performance recent years. today, i outline i see key stylize fact research recent year uncover change dynamic inflation present view interpret findings. the interpretation important implication think conduct monetary policy think might happen inflation next couple years. i address two issue final part talk. before i continue, however, i stress view i express necessarily colleague federal open market committee (fomc). the empirical evidence change inflation dynamic to see research discover evolution inflation dynamic recent years, let’s explore follow questions: (1) what available evidence change inflation persistence recent years? (2) what available evidence change slope phillips curve? (3) what role variable play inflation process? inflation persistence to answer first question, need measure long effect shock inflation last. specifically, need know whether inflation tend revert quickly initial level, whether effect shock persist – is, lead change level inflation extend period. the obvious way measure inflation persistence regress inflation several lag calculate sum coefficient lag inflation. if sum coefficient close 1.0, shock inflation long-lived effect inflation. in words, inflation behave like random walk, inflation go up, stay up. if sum coefficient drop well 1.0, shock inflation temporary effect inflation, inflation soon revert back trend level. the evidence so-called autoregressions u.s. data suggest inflation may grow le persistent time. in particular, autoregressions run use roll sample fix width of, say, twelve years, sum lag coefficient often fall noticeably unity sample advance include recent data. figure 1 illustrate tendency, core personal consumption expenditure (pce) price index measure inflation. a see, coefficient sum decline 0.6 since late 1990s, although dot line indicate confidence interval estimate wide still include 1.0. this result appear robust addition explanatory variable regression, although make modification tend reduce extent estimate decline.2 finally, it’s worth note 1 i want thank michael kiley, jean-philippe laforte, deborah lindner, david reifschneider, john roberts, jeremy rudd extremely helpful comment assistance speech. 2 two recent study report mark decline inflation persistence unite state nason (2006) williams (2006). their find treat carefully, however, analysis staff federal reserve board suggest modest change methodology, lengthen sample period, correct small-sample bias, change 2 bi review 29/2007 u.s. phenomenon, study find similar result number countries.3 (i might proudly note pass staff federal reserve system responsible much research. to avoid bore you, i refrain provide reference research, version speech board’s web site include information provide nuanced discussion results.) recent work jim stock mark watson (2007) provide alternative and, me, quite intuitive way think inflation persistence. they estimate model decompose inflation two components. the first component, think underlie trend, follow random walk, shock component persist indefinitely thus affect trend inflation rate go forward. the second component serially uncorrelated shock, mean shock temporary lead transitory fluctuation around trend. stock watson allow volatility two kind shocks, trend temporary, vary time. stock watson find importance trend shock relative temporary shock start rise end 1960s unite states, peak mid-1970s, stay elevate next ten years, decline historical low (upper panel figure 2). when relative importance trend shock become high, 1970s early 1980s, inflation become highly persistent. under conditions, inflation go up, trend component typically particular price index use analysis, alter magnitude statistical significance estimate decline persistence. 3 levin piger (2004) find significant decline inflation persistence since 1980s major european economy well japan, canada, australia new zealand. however, o’reilly whelan (2005) find little evidence recent decline persistence euro area whole. bi review 29/2007 3 rise tandem inflation stay up. in contrast, temporary shock relatively important, true 1970s mid-1980s, change inflation tend reflect change temporary component, trend. a result, fluctuation inflation tend fade away, imply inflation persistence much lower. in context stock-watson model, then, inflation rise double-digit level "great inflation" period 1970s early 1980s, persistence become high trend rate inflation move around lot – is, trend inflation become unanchored. although importance trend component fall markedly since 1970s, estimate produce stock watson suggest still large enough economically meaningful. the bottom panel figure 2 illustrate point; see, estimate trend (the solid line) drift bite since mid-1990s. of course, estimate inevitably imprecise degree. for example, cecchetti et al (2007) employ slightly modify version stock-watson procedure recent paper find inflation persistence fall low estimate trend gross domestic product (gdp) price inflation almost perfectly flat 2.2 percent past years. in contrast, cogley sargent (2005), use different modification procedure, obtain result line original stock watson paper. finally, follow-up work staff member federal reserve board suggest degree persistence find technique vary across different measure inflation. thus, empirical evidence question vary. nonetheless, i think fair say inflation become le persistent past two decade underlie trend may yet perfectly stable. 4 bi review 29/2007 when cecchetti co-author apply type analysis countries, result remarkably similar. in particular, canada, italy, unite kingdom, importance trend shock begin rise late 1960s early 1970s decline mid-1980s. france follow similar pattern, although rise begin bite earlier, 1963. in short, country experience similar "great inflation," trend inflation become unanchored. germany japan short period high persistence inflation, persistence begin decline around 1969 germany around 1979 japan. cecchetti co-author conclude rise subsequent decline inflation persistence thus worldwide phenomenon. bi review 29/2007 5 slope phillips curve in traditional phillips-curve equations, inflation depend past value inflation, unemployment gap (the difference unemployment rate estimate natural rate), variable relative price energy import prices. when researcher estimate equations, typically find coefficient unemployment gap decline (in absolute value) since 1980s, often mark amount.4 in words, evidence suggest phillips curve flattened. the find inflation le responsive unemployment gap, take face value, suggest fluctuation resource utilization small implication inflation use case. from point view policymakers, development two-edged sword: on plus side, imply overheat economy tend generate small increase inflation. on negative side, however, flat phillips curve also imply give increase inflation costly wring system. we quantify latter consideration use so-called sacrifice ratio – number year unemployment 1.0 percentage point great natural rate reduce inflation rate 1.0 percentage point. average estimate obtain comprehensive battery equation specification suggest sacrifice ratio may 40 percent large – is, may 40 percent costly reduce inflation two decade ago. be really bad news? i return question later. role variable inflation process empirical evidence suggest inflation also become le responsive shocks. the two oil price shock 1970s associate large jump core inflation, whereas recent surge energy price similar effect. this reduce sensitivity manifest traditional phillips-curve model substantial decline estimate coefficient energy price term equations. because term equal change relative energy price multiply share energy aggregate output, energy price effect inflation appear fall account great energy efficiency economy.5 in contrast, unpublished empirical work staff federal reserve board suggest that, take rise share import account, influence import price core inflation unite state change much context reduced-form forecast models.6 at time, influence exchange rate movement import price – so-called pass-through effect – may fall substantially, least accord studies.7 if so, influence exchange rate fluctuation domestic inflation may le was, one control change volume foreign trade. what interpretation give change inflation dynamics? in interpret stylize fact change inflation dynamics, must first recognize base reduced-form relationships, thus correlation necessarily true structural relationships. because explanatory variable inflation 4 study present evidence mark decline sensitivity u.s. inflation unemployment measure resource utilization include robert (2006) williams (2006). unpublished work staff federal reserve board indicate result generally hold across variety regression specifications, estimation methods, data definitions. other study find similar decline many foreign industrial economies; see, among others, borio filardo (2006) ihrig others (forthcoming). however, empirical evidence question exact magnitude, timing, statistical significance change remain subject debate. 5 hooker (2002) find oil price movement 1980s 1990s little effect core inflation, contrast substantial influence previous decades. recent empirical work carry federal reserve board confirm hooker’s find use data 2006; however, work also hint surge energy price since 2004 may large influence core inflation. 6 interestingly, ihrig others (forthcoming) find sensitivity inflation movement import price fall several foreign industrial economies. 7 for evidence u.s. exchange rate pass-through effects, see marazzi others (2005). hellerstein, daly, marsh (2006) also find pass-through decline unite states, although considerably small amount. empirical result develop country report sekine (2006). 6 bi review 29/2007 regression influence change economic conditions, change underlie monetary policy regime likely source change reduced-form inflation dynamics. this problem especially acute structural relationship involve expectation factor directly observable cannot include reduced-form regressions. in cases, cannot use reduced-form equation disentangle effect unobserved factor – may drive change monetary policy – influences. the important development monetary economics i witness now-long career recognition expectation central understand behavior aggregate economy. theory tell u inflation expectation must key drive force behind inflation. this dependence long implicit traditional phillips-curve analysis, expectation – explicit form – also central feature increasingly popular new keynesian phillips curves, current-period inflation function expectation next period’s inflation resource utilization. therefore, natural first place look explanation change inflation dynamic possible change expectations-formation process. the first stylize fact discuss early inflation persistence, rise 1970s great inflation, since decline much low level. an intuitive way think rise fall inflation persistence result un-anchoring trend inflation period great inflation, re-anchoring recent years, work stock watson suggests. when think drive trend inflation, inflation expectation – particularly long-run expectation – come mind. a de-anchoring inflation expectation would surely lead trend inflation become unanchored, whereas anchor inflation expectation particular level would necessarily lead stabilization trend inflation hence decline inflation persistence. do indicator inflation expectation support story? they certainly do. consider measure expect inflation come twelve month report livingston survey. a illustrate dash line figure 3 , measure expect short-run inflation – adjust constant factor convert cpi basis pce basis – soar 1970s fell back markedly 1980s early 1990s. over past years, short-run series fluctuate around 2 percent, month-to-month movement correlate swing energy prices, one might expect. an even strike story tell survey-based measure expect long-run inflation use frb/us model, dot blue line figure 3.8 when look long-run series (which closely relate expectation policy objective short-run measure), see public’s expectation stand high level 7-3/4 percent start 1980s, information first begin collected. from point on, however, expectation fell steadily 1980s 1990s process re-anchoring continued. by 1998, process apparently completed, since time public’s expectation – least accord particular measure – steady rock. estimate inflation compensation derive index treasury yield also remarkably stable recent years. figure 3 also reproduce estimate trend inflation produce stock-watson procedure (the solid line). a see, series le track survey-based measure long-run expectations, suggest anchor long-run inflation expectation recent year may explain find mark decline inflation persistence. anchor inflation expectation deus ex machina. it must come somewhere, since milton friedman’s adage “[i]nflation always everywhere monetary phenomenon” still true, monetary policy must source change evolution long-run inflation expectations. during 1960s 1970s, federal reserve number central bank maintain policy stance that, inadvertently not, easy average allow actual expect inflation drift markedly many years. since late 1970s, however, federal reserve many central bank increase commitment price stability, word actions. the feed pursue preemptive strike rise inflation 1994-95, 1999-00, 2004-06, well preemptive strike potentially deflationary force fall 8 the frb/us series splice data two survey expect long-run inflation – hoey survey financial market participant 1981 1989, survey professional forecaster 1990 on. after splicing, 50-basis-point constant factor subtract series put pce price index basis, assumption survey respondent report expectation cpi inflation, pce inflation. (the average wedge cpi inflation pce inflation 50 basis point 1980 2006.) i make similar adjustment livingston survey data plot figure 3 put pce price basis. bi review 29/2007 7 1998 2001-04. the result low stable inflation also, seen, strong anchor long-run inflation expectations. the pursuit more-aggressive monetary policy control inflation achievement anchor inflation expectation also help explain stylize fact inflation dynamics. with expectation inflation anchored, give shock inflation – whether aggregate demand, energy prices, foreign exchange rate – small effect expect inflation hence trend inflation. these shock much le persistent effect actual inflation. the recent experience surge oil price seem consistent story. the price west texas intermediate crude oil rise $30 per barrel late 2003 peak almost $75 per barrel july last year. during episode, inflation appear boost temporarily strikingly small amount, contrast 1970s oil price shock lead large, persistent increase inflation. interestingly, monetary policy could work flatten estimate phillips curve even without favorable expectational effects, simply move aggressively stabilize inflation output. a theorem literature optimal control state implement policy adjust instrument stabilize particular variable effect, limit, drive correlation instrument target variable zero. thus, monetary policy successfully stabilize inflation resource utilization could well lead small estimate coefficient unemployment gap traditional phillips-curve equation. research carry quite different model macroeconomy former colleague columbia, jean boivin marc giannoni (2006), john robert (2006) federal reserve board, support conclusions. in particular, analysis suggest change way federal reserve conduct monetary policy – include change parameter monetary policy reaction function volatility shock function – may account reduction coefficient resource utilization traditional phillips curves.9 9 clarida, gali, gertler (2000) make similar argument, dissent view, see rudebusch (2005). 8 bi review 29/2007 what particularly attractive highlight good anchor inflation expectation probably primary factor drive change inflation dynamic one explanation cover many stylize fact – application occam’s razor. indeed, i always become confident theory explain number different facts.10 this i attract view inflation expectation key drive factor inflation process. of course, many factor also influence inflation, provide possible explanation recent change inflation dynamics. for example, small coefficient unemployment gap energy price traditional phillips curve equation may reflect influence low less-variable inflation frequency firm change prices. in context low-inflation environment, firm may conclude leave price fix long period little cost, cause inflation le responsive shocks, particularly transitory. in way, monetary policy may affect slope phillips curve without affect manner expectation formed. also, mid-1980s first year decade, energy price movement small transitory. we see future markets, oil price far-dated future contract move much le spot price period, suggest people expect quick reversal rise oil prices. such transitory shock energy price would presumably small effect inflation more-persistent oil price shock 1970s early 1980s. increase globalization source increase competition may also low sensitivity domestic inflation aggregate demand, thereby flatten phillips curve. however, evidence last point limit inconclusive.11 policy implication these stylize fact – inflation become le persistent respond le aggregate demand supply shock – lead inappropriate policy advice. if take fact structural attributable factor monetary policy, might interpret suggest federal reserve could respond le shock yet confident inflation would remain low level. in addition, small coefficient unemployment gap traditional phillips-curve models, seem imply sacrifice ratio go up, might lead u think reduce inflation costly require long period high unemployment. a result, policymakers might decide attempt would worthwhile would le likely try reduce inflation undesirably high. if use model simulation exercises, flat phillips curve might also suggest get inflation particular desire level could take inordinately long time. however, instead attribute observe change inflation dynamic good monetary policy resultant good anchor inflation expectations, policy conclusion unwarranted. under alternative interpretation, reason inflation become le persistent monetary policy, carry dual mandate promote price stability maximum sustainable employment, vigilant maintain low rate inflation average. but monetary authority become complacent think could get away react shock that, mistake view, long potential cause inflation rise persistently, inflation expectation would surely become unhinge again. in short, complacency might arise current low inflation persistence might result deja vu return u era like great inflation. these exactly concern express tom sargent’s (2000) book rise fall u.s. inflation, worry misunderstand inflation process might lead high-inflation equilibrium. 10 this milton friedman’s theory consumption function one favorite piece empirical research. what extraordinary book handful regression nonetheless show basic idea permanent income right theory explain numerous fact derive numerous studies. this book widely read graduate student nowadays, be. 11 see borio filardo (2006) ihrig others (forthcoming) oppose view issue. borio filardo provide evidence global output gap may important conventional domestic output gap determination inflation; moreover, argue effect rise time. however, ihrig co-author find borio filardo’s result sensitive small change specification; also find little support independent role global output gap evidence globalization account fall coefficient domestic gaps. bi review 29/2007 9 if inflation indeed become le persistent good monetary policy anchor inflation expectation solidly, monetary authority may find le need induce large swing economic activity control inflation. this key benefit establish strong nominal anchor. because public become confident feed right thing, expectation behave manner make economy stable begin with. if hypothesis correct, cyclical movement interest rate need great necessary expectation unanchored. however, favorable circumstance persist long monetary authority continue ratify public’s expectations. consistent dual mandate, feed must therefore continue respond aggressively shock potentially persistent adverse effect inflation real activity. because long-run inflation expectation key driver trend inflation, monetary authority need monitor long-run inflation expectation closely. if find lose credibility markets, inflation expectation begin drift rise (or fall below) desire level, must take action restore credibility. at federal reserve, understand importance health economy anchor inflation expectations. this federal reserve official continually reiterate commitment maximum sustainable employment price stability, will make preemptive strike inflationary deflationary pressures, remain vigilant development economy could lead persistent departure inflation level consistent price stability. my view – recent change inflation dynamic result primarily better-anchored inflation expectation structural change simply achievement persistent low rate inflation – imply good news: potentially inflationary shocks, like sharp rise energy prices, le likely spill expect actual core inflation. therefore, feed respond aggressively would necessary inflation expectation unanchored, great inflation era. indeed, help explain recent sharp rise energy price much benign effect real economy 1970s – point then-governor ben bernanke make three year ago. although solidly anchor inflation expectation indeed highly desirable, could pose bite problem monetary policy level somewhat rate prefer policymakers. under circumstances, central bank would likely interest shift public’s expectation favorable direction. whether adjustment would easy difficult is, unfortunately, quite uncertain understand expectations-formation process well. in early model use rational expectation assumption, change inflation expectation relatively easy thus imply sacrifice ratio extremely low, suggest monetary authority could shift inflation little cost. however, historical record suggest permanently low inflation expectation may require keep monetary policy tight substantial period, result considerable output employment loss time. on hand, christy david romer (2002) point out, federal reserve 1970s overestimate cost reduce inflation estimate sacrifice ratio arthur okun economist time prove high.12 a historical note, provide one explanation federal reserve’s tolerance high inflation time. the disinflation october 1979, carry federal reserve leadership paul volcker use words, procedures, action sharp break past, produce much low cost disinflation policymakers anticipate 1970s. i think consideration leave u fairly wide bind cost might permanently shift long-run inflation expectation already anchored. on one hand, historical record give u little reason think cost would minimal simple model rational expectation might suggest. on hand, overly pessimistic estimate prove wrong past. 12 okun (1978) estimate 10 percent reduction real gdp one year would reduce inflation rate 1.0 percentage point. by mid-1980s, however, federal reserve board staff estimate sacrifice ratio roughly half large. 10 bi review 29/2007 implication inflation forecast i argue attractive explanation recent change inflation dynamic expectation become good anchored. inflation le persistent likely gravitate trend level determine long-run inflation expectation settled. what implication forecast future inflation? in framework, first priority determine inflation expectation may anchored. this task somewhat tricky. accord late read survey professional forecaster (spf), long-term inflation expectation currently around 2 percent, measure pce price index fomc emphasized. the private forecaster appear hold view many years, give long-run expectation cpi inflation spf run around 2-1/2 percent since late 1990s, average historical wedge cpi measure pce measure inflation 50 basis points.13 of course, view professional forecaster may representative average person firm thinking. if turn financial markets, find inflation expectation extract comparison yield treasury inflation-protected security (tips) standard treasury security seem consistent anchor perhaps little 2 percent term pce inflation.14 i say “seem consistent,” cannot sure least one item use extraction, premium pay investor compensate inflation risk. in case households, long-term inflation expectation reuters/michigan survey run much high number years, around 3 percent. however, figure seem overstate light persistent bias find short-term inflation expectation report survey. correct bias, survey result probably line pce inflation close 2 percent.15 a firms, unfortunately good data inflation expectations. more information score would particularly welcome, expectation general area worthy study. take together, data suggest long-run inflation expectation currently around 2 percent. that said, i think clear evidence point range estimates; moreover, range uncertain assumption need tease point estimate available data. so, although i think 2 percent reasonable estimate current long-run expectations, i don’t want overstate precision figure. we still face uncertainty regard, policymakers must cautious place much confidence one estimate. if long-run expectation fact 2 percent, actual inflation likely head next year two? while recognize embarrassingly wrong prognostication often turn be, i think reasonably optimistic core pce inflation gradually drift late twelve-month read 2-1/4 percent. this process may take light recent rebound price gasoline petroleum products. these price increase boost cost produce many non-energy good services, firm gradually pas high 13 recently, survey professional forecaster (spf) begin report long-run expectation pce price index well cpi. long-run expectation pce price inflation 2 percent late release, rate indicate frb/us estimate since late 1990s. (the frb/us estimate since 1991 derive spf read expect long-run cpi inflation le average historical wedge cpi measure pce measure inflation 50 basis points.) interestingly, long-run expectation cpi inflation spf tick 2-1/3 percent late survey, suggest private forecaster may low estimate average cpi-pce wedge 30 basis points. such revision would line current board staff estimates, indicate wedge decline recent year stand 30 basis points. 14 inflation compensation – difference nominal index treasury yield – recently 1/2 percent. however, two adjustment necessary translate inflation compensation estimate expect long-term inflation pce price basis. first, difference nominal index yield equal sum inflation expectation inflation term premium, must subtract estimate premium. give term premium nominal treasury yield extremely low present, inflation term premium probably le 25 basis point currently, could even zero. second, inflation series use index treasury security cpi, pce price index, must subtract estimate wedge two measure inflation. if use 30 basis point wedge expect private forecaster late read spf, index nominal yield appear consistent expect long-term pce inflation 2 percent little higher. 15 accord reuters/michigan survey, long-term inflation expectation household currently around 3 percent, past years. this survey specify price index. however, expectation companion one-year-ahead expectation come 75 basis point high actual pce inflation since 1990, suggest may systematic bias response reuters/michigan survey relative measure inflation. if bias also apply longer-run inflation expectations, household expectation may line pce inflation run vicinity 2-1/4 percent long run. bi review 29/2007 11 cost customers, monthly read change core price likely high otherwise would be. once process completed, however, might expect consumer price inflation move good alignment long-run expectation thus settle around 2 percent. of course, understand empirical link measure expect inflation actual inflation sufficiently poor thing could well go awry forecast. moreover, many thing could happen come month alter outlook, recent fluctuation energy market swing gdp growth illustrate. look medium term, i le optimistic prospect core pce inflation move much 2 percent absence determine effort monetary policy. for part, assessment – i stress subject considerable uncertainty – flow view long-term expectation appear well anchor level far current rate inflation. if so, substantial decline inflation would require shift expectations, shift could difficult time consume bring about, i note earlier. a i mention start, central banker acutely interest inflation process. this i think topic lot choose talk today. i hope find muse subject useful. reference bernanke, ben (2004).

governor central bank republic turkey, bursa chamber commerce industry, bursa, 11 january 2007. * * * distinguish industrialists, businessmen, dear guest member press, this first series meet plan 2007, become traditional platform aim bring representative real sector together directly. firstly, i wish thank dünya newspaper bursa chamber commerce industry organize meet thereby give opportunity exchange information view economic outlook distinguish industrialist businessmen like you. in first part speech, i would like present general evaluation year 2006 special emphasis inflation, explain policy implementation share forecast regard 2007 light current data available. then, i would like, more, mention growth, employment current account deficit share public many times, constitute major item economic agenda. i elaborate do regard medium long term. distinguish guests, the primary objective bank achieve maintain price stability, lay central bank law. the central bank pursue continue pursue monetary policy objective determination within context historical mission responsibility, state legal framework guideline determine 2001. in framework, inflation target determine jointly government; choice monetary policy tool implementation principle determine central bank. in words, central bank provide instrumental independence law. the instrumental independence enable central bank design implement monetary policy medium term perspective. distinguish guests, follow establishment institutional legal framework monetary policy accordance modern central bank principles, significant step take fight inflation. thus, rapid disinflation process experience inflation target attain four consecutive year due macroeconomic policies, especially fiscal policy implement consistently inflation targets. the inflation rate 7.7 percent realize end 2005 low figure, record last thirty-five years. however, price stability could achieve yet despite favorable development achievements. our fight inflation still continues. it forget long challenge process confirm inflation figure 2006. when consider deterioration inflation bring economic social life, see fight indispensable significant; one determinant factor shape future economy, society, country solid foundations. distinguish guests, now, let briefly mention development inflation 2006, basic reason lead divergence target application monetary policy within process. 2006 year supply shocks, seasonal condition external factor determinant inflation. a begin 2006, upward trend inflation observe especially first seven month annual inflation go 11.7 percent july. the lead factor drive inflation upwards period soar unprocessed food product price end 2005 due unfavorable weather conditions. annual rate increase price group become 21.8 percent july. bi review 28/2007 1 fluctuation market depreciation turkish lira due negativity global liquidity condition increase uncertainty perception regard country may-june period lead increase price commodity price foreign currency besides import good affect inflation figure unfavorably. another important factor influential first half 2006 accelerate increase price crude oil commodity price international markets. this increase, accompany depreciation turkish lira lead rise domestic energy price play key role increase inflation figures. a slow-down price increase observe august due decrease price gold oil international markets, stabilization financial market re-appreciation turkish lira effect decisiveness fight inflation expectations. nevertheless, inflation remain high due sustain upward trend unprocessed food products, ramadan-based effect belated reflection depreciation experience turkish lira follow date. look end-year inflation main expenditure groups, see annual inflation remain target clothing, footwear communication groups, whereas go beyond target groups. in respect, rigidity inflation service group constitute important handicap fight inflation 2006 previous years. end-year inflation become 12.2 percent group. rent service group show great increase annual inflation rate 20 percent remain general consumer inflation. inflation figure 12.9 percent transportation service another important factor determine inflation rate service group. distinguish guests, consumer price increase 0.23 percent monthly basis remain expectation last month 2006 year 2006 end annual inflation single digit 9.65 percent. this figure well end-year target 5 percent. although divergence inflation target experience country implement regime, upset u observe great divergence target first year embark full-fledged inflation target regime. a requisite principle accountability, detail “open letter” elaborate reason divergence together policy measure take send government soon possible make public. dear guests, due rapid increase inflation first seven month 2006, quite high expectation especially april may, fluctuation experience financial market uncertainty perception create political developments, inflation expectation diverge inflation target. inflation expectation 12-months increase 8.1 percent july 5.5 percent april; 24 month increase 6.1 percent july 4.7 percent april. upon emergence possibility permanent deterioration expectation cause inflation diverge target medium term, monetary policy committee make effective use short-term interest rate basic policy instrument. within context, committee implement strong tighten policy increase policy rate 425 bps 17.5 percent june-july period order put end deterioration medium long-term inflation expectation also render inflation target attainable medium term. follow strong monetary tighten monetary policy committee measure take financial stability, fluctuation financial market gradually decrease medium long-term inflation expectation partially improved. in regard, inflation expectation 12 24 month decrease 7.1 percent 5.6 percent respectively, end-2006. the monetary policy committee keep policy rate unchanged period august- december 2006 due improvement observe inflation expectations, mild progress international liquidity condition gradually favorable outlook future course inflation compare first half year. 2 bi review 28/2007 dear guests, i would like draw attention two rather important factor decision regard short-term policy rates. firstly, decision central bank take regard short-term policy rate affect economic activity certain lag, case economies. that bank consider course inflation medium term rather current course take decision policy rates. the bank also pay attention consistency course inflation medium term targets. however, settlement medium-term approach country experience chronic inflation long time like take time important handicap fight inflation. therefore, recognition adoption medium-term approach unit within economy bear great importance policy decision interpret accurately implement effectively. thus, put special emphasis subject report announcement make bank. secondly, bank make use wide set data order foresee medium-term course inflation. the bank publish “inflation report” quarterly. this report announce public numerical inflation forecast medium-term approach together consistent policy response. however, new information obtain new development change projection numerical inflation forecast regard course inflation. the forecast publish bank evaluate within framework note change condition regard economic environment change. distinguish guests, now i would like briefly talk significant factors, may affect outlook inflation. first all, support private consumption demand inflation downward direction, cause tight monetary policy stance, expect continue forthcoming period. although development crude oil price strong repercussion course inflation indicate positive outlook recently, oil energy price still constitute major risk factor affect inflation targets. unprocessed food prices, remarkable weight within inflation basket, another factor uncertainty future course inflation due fluctuation course show sharp move owe seasonal conditions. elimination price rigidity service sector also bear great importance fight inflation. practice increase supply competition sector needed. on hand, see unfavorable effect fluctuation period inflation eliminate thank completion primary effect depreciation turkish lira inflation end 2006. nevertheless, rapid change global risk perceptions, international liquidity condition result fluctuation experience domestic financial market risk factor may cause inflation go beyond figure temporarily foresee. consider viewpoint fiscal policies, note one factor ensure maintenance downward trend inflation medium-term sustainability fiscal discipline revenue policy consistent target without hesitations. within context, closely monitor effect adjustment revenue policy primary public expenditure inflation inflation expectations. the achievement structural reform support increase efficiency via improvement competition investment environments, contribute downward trend inflation. the structural reform process determine effect also expectations. unceasing maintenance step area important permanency downward trend inflation. even considerable improvement observe today comparison first half year, medium-term inflation expectation high target risk factor regard inflation outlook. this due possibility expectation bring deterioration price behaviors. dear guests, although political development regard negotiation european union may come forefront, interruption delay may occur, process mean bi review 28/2007 3 convergence develop economy economic terms. together imf, also function important anchor domestic foreign economic units. this perspective, influential expectations, preserved. when development evaluate altogether, see monetary policy committee preserve cautious stance. the bank implement policy aim achieve inflation target determine 4 percent year 2007, 2008 2009. currently, foresee inflation target achieve long cautious stance monetary policy fiscal discipline maintain income policy implement accordance inflation target expectation manage effectively. distinguish guests, the float exchange rate regime basic element inflation target regime currently implement. the exchange rate regime determine government. the central bank responsible design implementation exchange rate policy regime. level rate float rate regime determine foreign exchange supply demand market conditions. the short-term value turkish lira determine development foreign exchange supply demand, behavior market player short-term expectations; whereas long term determine economic fundamentals, course structural reform medium long-term expectations. the basic policy instrument central bank inflation target regime short-term interest rates. both economic literature experience country show that, impossible central bank keep interest rate foreign exchange rate control time economy international capital movement free ours. therefore, central bank implicit commitment regard level foreign exchange rate, policy towards render turkish lira valuable. when look period start 2001 float exchange rate regime embark now, see number fluctuation foreign exchange rates, recent observe may-june period. similar fluctuation may experience future. the course conduct central bank regard foreign exchange market quite clear. the risk foreign currency bear market players. the fluctuation experience clearly display type risk may arise time manage effectively. economic unit ensure require protection risk regard balance sheet modern sense within scope risk management principles. remarkable attainment obtain bank sector within context. the private sector also need adopt similar approach respect. the reason i attach special importance subject put emphasis similar expression almost speech draw attention possible risk economic unit may confront float rate regime increase awareness. otherwise, deterioration bring mis-management risk affect economy whole. dear guests, when course value turkish currency versus foreign currency 2002 take account, observe long tight monetary fiscal policy maintained; structural reform implemented, political stability maintain decisiveness macroeconomic stability sustained; basic tendency favor appreciation turkish currency. this process turkish currency increasingly prefer investment every robust economy although subject occasional interruptions. therefore, value turkish currency emerge clear consequence. determination foreign exchange rate market condition requisite float exchange rate regime imply bank shall undertake transaction foreign exchange markets. a also explain detail announcement call “monetary exchange rate policy 2007”, central bank undertake transaction foreign exchange market two objectives. the first one transaction daily foreign exchange purchase auction implement transparently method accordance certain rule serve bank’s purpose reserve accumulation. the central bank purchase foreign exchange market via 4 bi review 28/2007 auction supply foreign exchange abundant moderate reserve-increasing strategy. the second situation bank undertake transaction direct intervention order prevent exist possible excessive volatility foreign exchange rates. these intervention neither mechanic symmetric. the bank evaluate change occur foreign exchange rate regard condition take decision intervention accordingly. a result foreign exchange purchase auction direct intervention implement within scope foreign exchange policy, net purchase 44.8 billion usd market make period five year 9 january 2007. follow foreign exchange purchase embark april 2002, reserve bank increase 199 percent reach 60.8 billion usd 29 december 2006. dear guests, now i would like mention growth performance turkish economy thing do respect. the turkish economy grow consecutively last 19 quarters. gross national product grow 8.8 percent real term second quarter 2006; growth rate decrease 3 percent third quarter due monetary tighten fluctuation financial market june july. therefore, accumulate real growth 41 percent average growth rate 7.6 percent 2001. look possible short-term outlook growth move evaluation process structural change dynamic growth turkish economy, i wish emphasize slowdown observe economic activity third quarter 2006 necessarily mean stagnation experience last quarter 2006 that. consider these, foresee growth rate last quarter 2006 may remain low level due basis effect create high growth rate 2005. however, annual growth rate 2006 may realize around 5 percent accordance program. in light current information, foresee annual growth rate start increase second half 2007. the turkish economy record remarkable improvement towards overcome period fluctuate growth rate thank macroeconomic stability environment establish last five years. the determine factor growth rate private sector consumption investments. private sector’s consumption expenditure rise 36.4 percent real term period 2001 third quarter 2006, public expenditure rise 15.5 percent acceleration especially last two quarters. look investment side, see private sector’s investment spend increase 134.3 percent real term public investment spend go 14.1 percent. the high increase observe investment spend also indicate investment-oriented basis growth widen production capacity increasing. another resource growth high increase efficiency. accumulate efficiency increase 39.3 percent last five years. the high efficiency rate support growth process without inflation one hand contribute sustainability growth other. the export great contribution growth recent year contribution keep grow gradually. the turkish economy open doors. accumulate annual export rise 167.5 percent november 2006 compare year 2001. the total trade volume last year reach 220.8 billion usd constitute 57 percent national income. bi review 28/2007 5 dear guests, the new structure grow process country indicator significance macroeconomic stability, lie basis price stability growth competition. accord global competition index, turkey become one country increase competitive power 2006 draw ahead 12 rows, rank 59 within 125 countries1. maintenance growth establishment sustainable growth process indispensable requirement increase social wealth, final objective economic policies. therefore, today everyone focus thing do sustainability growth process economy rather daily market transactions. when successful country sample regard growth development process considered, see certain phase growth process. these phase growth base factor accumulation; increase efficiency; research development activity innovation respectively. turkey currently go process growth base increase efficiency. however, ensure permanency growth medium long-term necessitate focus research development activity besides increase efficiency go process growth base innovations. dear guests, it obligatory private sector establish medium long-term strategy rather short-term ones, order last long within domestic foreign competition environment gradually become challenge owe change domestic dynamic increase openness. elimination unfavorable condition bureaucracy, politics tax regulation primary item list factor affect competition negatively turkey bear great importance respect.2the key factor ensure development principles3 governance public private sector. a great improvement record term principle governance year 2000 improvement almost indicator observed. it coincidence improvement principle good governance one macroeconomic performance intersect. however, clear much achieve compare european countries. good governance key role ensure macroeconomic stability render process permanent. therefore, one pre-requisites sustainable growth process. structural reform bear great importance regard. the research carry respect oecd countries4 reveal economic growth rate country engage rapid comprehensive structural reform increase vast amounts. additionally, structural reform complementary. halt progress structural reform one field prevent attainment favorable outcome reform make fields. reform remove defect social security system; prevent unregistered economic activities; provide labor market flexible structure via education; restructure tax system; continue reform financial sector incessantly increase efficiency agricultural sector give priority country. on hand, consider growth dynamic process, important strengthen macro reform micro measure search strategic approach accordance change need newly emerge structures. the public private sector engage cooperation

efficiency; establish strong transparent balance sheets; shift towards capital markets; pay attention principle risk management pay effort allocation resource research development activities. parallel this, bank increase contribution sustainability growth diversification credit offer private sector. dear guests, upon mention growth process country, i would like dwell another important item agenda, employment. look data labor market, see number employ increase 2002. this increase apparent especially sector agriculture. 660 thousand new job create last year sector agriculture september 2006. a comparative improvement unemployment figure record parallel increase employment. when compare period last year, decrease 0.6 points, unemployment rate become 9.1 percent september 2006. nevertheless, favorable development labor market yet arrive satisfactory level. the main reason delay weakness improvement labor market despite result take field economy structural problem labor market. agricultural sector lead list structural problems. a rapid transition process experience agricultural sector sector agriculture result structural change economy go through. the share agricultural sector total employment decrease 38 percent 2001 28 percent september 2006. it expect transition agricultural sector sector agriculture within process structural change country continue come year additionally, high employment tax observe sectoral structure employment restrict rise employment one hand; cause employment shift unregistered activity other. the increase unregistered employment prevent increase employment permanent increase volatility. work age population keep grow due high rate population growth country. the limit educational facility meet labor power demand qualification vis-a-vis increase work age population lack labor possess qualification compatible structural change economy problem detain possible improvement labor market. all problem prevent unemployment rate fall speed parallel increase employment. however, problem unemployment social consequence besides economic one render solution problem inevitable. therefore, long-term supply-side policy put effect order find permanent solution problem unemployment. in respect, via ensure implementation active policy create employment provide resource new investments, investment atmosphere improve strengthen relationship real financial sector. additionally, educational policy orient towards increase labor power compatible labor demand put effect. besides, unregistered employment registered, give priority lead unfair competition necessitate decrease tax burden employment gradually. dear guests, finally, i wish briefly mention current account deficit, frequently occupy agenda. current account deficit one sensitive point turkish economy. with retrospective look, see current account deficit grow fast period growth rate accelerate due structural peculiarity turkish economy. the period current account deficit bi review 28/2007 7 decrease surplus experience year growth rate decrease crisis break out. this structure show u current account deficit bear structural quality rather cyclical one. this process identify followings: improvement record respect macroeconomic stability decrease general level interest rates. this decline interest rate increase consumption investment demand credit demand accordingly one hand; lead decrease domestic save other. the rise expenditures, especially investment spend increase demand machinery equipment; demand meet import due structural peculiarity turkish economy. this process lead enlargement difference domestic save investments, indicator current account deficit cause need foreign resource arise. with help macroeconomic stability inflow foreign capital, turkish currency appreciate process reiterate give way increase current account deficit environment resource provide foreign borrow become option. a similar process experience due improvement record macroeconomic stability last five year remarkable increase observe current account deficit owe effect high speed growth. the current account deficit reach 34.4 billion usd october per annum ratio current account deficit national income third quarter 2006 become 8.5 percent. however, reason besides finance method examine order determine extent risk current account deficit pose regard macroeconomic balances. current account deficit today basically originate fast increase investment comparison savings. additionally, high increase observe energy price especially crude oil price influence increase current account deficit vast amount. the calculation point case energy price remain fix level year 2002, ratio current account deficit national income 3.6 point low third quarter 2006 compare current level. a result process structural change progress obtain macroeconomic condition recent years, quality finance current account deficit improved. long-term capital prevalent resource capital inflow october 2006 annual level 25.3 billion usd. this figure alone meet 3.4 percent current account deficit. foreign direct investment inflow country period record level 21.4

cashssp – cash single share platform remark mr guy quaden, governor national bank belgium, occasion sign cash single share platform contract bank finland central bank belgium, luxembourg netherlands, bank finland, helsinki, 16 march 2007. * * * dear governor, dear erkki, dear colleagues, first all, let thank kind invitation organise event. the eurosystem entity equivalent anywhere world. for me, creation ecb raise doubt usefulness ncbs. in fact, reverse true. luxembourg, country central bank, create one transition single monetary policy. nevertheless, integration eurosystem obviously influence life institutions. i think two change necessarily apparent outside world. the first due fundamental change actual role ncbs, participate management world's second important currency. the decision take frankfurt take collegiate basis govern council. this mean every governor ncb must properly prepare deal issue consider level. they concern single monetary policy also eurosystem's sphere activity, financial stability payment systems. in recent years, ncbs therefore extend strengthen analysis capacity. a large proportion staff nowadays involve various level preparation decision "taken frankfurt". the investment resource substantial, result enrichment job content employees. the second change concern operational aspects. one eurosystem's basic operate principle high degree decentralisation. our ncbs remain contact point financial institution economic agent country eurosystem. however, concept decentralisation evolve since eurosystem first formed. to quote word eurosystem's mission statement: "we commit good governance perform task effectively efficiently, spirit cooperation team work". this elaborate organisational principles, state "that potential synergy economy scale shall identify exploit extent feasible". furthermore council task force erkki member mandate govern council "to prepare proposal discussion decision issue relate role, objectives, function operational modality eurosystem". in view, crucial role play independent think thank. have say i believe time ripe top-down decision, room ncbs – particular medium-sized ncbs – initiate voluntary collaboration development joint project exploitation synergy follow bottom approach. i think also long term vision eurosystem call shift pure centralisation decentralisation model apply past towards model pool consolidation. in view, cash ssp partnership fit perfectly framework. the introduction euro banknote provide excellent opportunity nbb modernise reengineer it-application cash handling. the goal twofold: first all, manage cash flow efficiently, within central bank central bank main customers, financial institution cash transport firms; secondly, improve security cash

27/2007 t t mboweni: the benefit good host – fifa world cup south african economy address mr t t mboweni, governor south african reserve bank, corporatesport directors’ dinner, johannesburg, 20 march 2007. * * * honour guest lady gentlemen: 1. introduction it often i land share podium someone like mr jake white, coach national rugby team. after all, sport coach central bank governor common? this probably question currently ponder over. perhaps, one common aspect centre around target u have. for mr white win match tournaments, case ensure inflation remain within target range. there subtle difference however. a long mr white meet target, everyone happy (apart opposition). meet inflation target necessarily keep south african happy – particularly evident increase interest rate order keep inflationary pressure check. consumers, usually highly indebted ones, always complain increase interest rate pensioner argue case little late. so issue whose job easy still much open question. however, i definitely go get involve scrum lineout jake order answer question. i intention give away penalty, sin-binned cite afterwards. whatever case, i think swap roles. i don’t know mr white would central banker, i certain national team good coach. i feel safe grind share platform mr tim modise. both job involve communication, communicate behalf sport i passionately follow. i ardent kaizer chief supporter, regrettably wait till next year renew league glory. i please least team lead pack, team tshwane bank based. i leave rugby mr white, let rather use occasion highlight economic benefit south africa host major international events, particular sport event fifa world cup. 2. host mega event the wave globalisation sweep across world two decade impact community beyond economic financial spheres. it also impact way global community interact area education sport. a world become increasingly integrated, opportunity emerge country host organise today become know mega events. since 1994, south africa become important venue host events. host major sporting, cultural economic event significance many country since provide important catalyst growth development. a result potential, professional various discipline marketing, finance, economics tourism show increase interest understand dynamic host mega events. today, university unite state america, unite kingdom australia offer course various aspect sport education, include sport market sport tourism. this trend also become evident south african tertiary education likely intensify future. south africa fair share host major sport event since 1994 african cup nation 1994, rugby world cup 1995, cricket world cup 2003. in addition, south africa also host major conference attract global interest. the important inter alia include unite nation conference sustainable growth 2002 attract 60 000 delegates, well unite nation conference bi review 27/2007 1 racism 2001, mention few. major conference convention centre build major city high degree utilisation. this year, south african reserve bank collaboration south african national treasury host g-20 meet minister finance central bank governors. preparation meet ongoing year. preparatory meet hold south africa member countries. these event attract high level official south africa world’s important economies. three major meet hold south africa course year. apart successfully host events, south africa also bid host two important global sport spectaculars, namely 2006 fifa world cup final cape town’s bid host 2004 olympic games. south africa narrowly fail win bids, fortunately second attempt host fifa world cup final successful know, host event 2010. 3. the economic implication host mega event there grow interest economic consequence host mega events. the economic advantage host event automatically outweigh costs. in environment scarce resources, opportunity cost host mega event always attract close scrutiny. government generally require commit considerable resource host events; resource could use elsewhere economy. in instances, may involve acceleration spending, additional allocation diversion expenditure us regions. for example, successful bid 2004 olympic game could see resource divert area country cape town, whereas world cup game see wide distribution benefits. a problem relate correctly estimate costs. for example, report last thursday expect cost london olympic game 2012 already four time high estimate time successful bid. finally, cost weigh expect revenue positive spin-offs, also difficult quantify. in many instances, revenue stream remain long event held, finance costs. numerous study commission various country determine economic financial implication host mega event see bohlmann h r: predict economic impact 2010 fifa world cup south africa. may, 2005. university pretoria. work paper 2006-11, review studies. the montreal olympic game 1976 consider many economic financial failure. host olympics montreal plunge city huge debt burden repay full recent years. similarly, study show benefit korea host fifa world cup final 2002 fell far short initial expectations. the country leave over-supply large stadiums, subsequently demolished. notwithstanding negative outcomes, country reap positive net benefit host events. the broad conclusion proper plan mega event tend generate positive spin-off short long run. a study conduct los angeles sport entertainment commission follow 1984 los angeles olympic game estimate income tourism increase almost us$9 billion result host games. the study conclude host major event could beneficial city carefully planned. the barcelona olympic game 1988 today consider model plan mega event. the barcelona game integrate urban renewal strategy economic outcome barcelona host olympic game significant. unemployment barcelona reduce significantly 18.4 per cent 9.6 per cent 1986 1992 20.9 per cent 15.5 per cent country whole. overall growth barcelona say increase pace never see before, even decade host games. similarly, sydney olympic game take place 2000 plan way generate positive spin-off well beyond actual event. in case sydney, city planner focus infrastructural development venue game venue could use 2 bi review 27/2007 subsequent sport events. it claim sydney olympic game beyond sport triumph. a aware, south africa 2010 fifa world cup final bid preparation host event progress. there considerable reputational risk associate host 2010 world cup finals, success world cup final germany put even pressure u raise bar. we stand benefit experience advice country successfully host similar events. a i note earlier, already host numerous events, although none perhaps scale fifa world cup finals. research show south africa also stand benefit host 2010 fifa world cup finals. accord grant thornton study conduct 2003, event expect contribute r21 billion economy whole, generate r7 billion tax revenue create 150 000 jobs. it possible fully accurately estimate potential gain economy host world cup final ex-ante. however, little doubt proper plan intervention relevant stakeholder potential benefit maximised. the spin-off term tourism, communication television technology, transport infrastructure name significant. tourism become increasingly important source revenue economy account 10 per cent total export receipts, almost double 10 year ago. this number expect increase result world cup finals. 4. growth investment south africa preparation world cup come time economy experience strong economic growth. the persistent adherence prudent macroeconomic policy authority result country’s solid economic performance recent years. south africa experience long upswing business cycle last almost 7.5 year date. the average growth rate 1994 2003 measure around 3 per cent, last 3 years, growth average 5 per cent. in fourth quarter 2006, annualised growth measure 5,6 per cent. the growth spread across sector economy exception agriculture. underpin strong growth positive trend investment growth. it interest note gross fix capital formation ratio gdp around 12 per cent begin decade. it around 19 per cent. this significant shift economy lose sight of, trend likely continue light government’s asgisa growth strategy. central strategy strong focus infrastructural investment. a indicate late budget review, government public enterprise infrastructure expenditure next 3 year estimate amount r416 billion. this investment raise current growth, also allow sustain future growth medium long term improve transport, communication electricity provision. these improvement expect ease bottleneck current future growth exports. this particularly case come investment transport infrastructure, whether rail, air, road ports. government make special budgetary allocation total r8,4 billion build stadiums. this addition municipality committed. furthermore, r9 billion allocate national government municipal transport, road precinct upgrade relate word cup games. apart budget provisions, investment requirement event dovetail well plan infrastructural investment next years. the 2010 world cup final help maintain focus infrastructural investment expenditure project gautrain, new stadium communication technology, name few. much need airport expansion also take place anticipation influx tourist event. a note late budget speech minister finance, impetus provide world cup result revolution municipal plan public transport forward think urban development. 5. the world cup monetary policy where monetary policy fit this? of course, world cup final begin 2010 keen spectator supporter bafana bafana, much directly impact fortune team. i leave capable hand mr carlos parreira team. we keep eye different ball different goal. through excite growth bi review 27/2007 3 phase experiencing, monetary policy ensure inflation keep control. in word ensure maintain inflation within 3-6 per cent target cpix. excessively high growth bring potential inflationary pressure monetary policy sensitive to. in economic parlance, refer output gap, difference potential non-inflationary output economy actual output. from monetary policy perspective, determine whether growth experience purely cyclical. if case, likely experience inflationary pressure would require reaction part. however current growth trend structural, is, reflect increase potential output economy development necessarily inflationary sustainable. unfortunately, estimate potential output simple task estimate subject high degree uncertainty. our view light enormous structural change productivity growth economy, much high growth experience recent year structural nature. current research bank estimate potential output economy least around 4,5 per cent more. this compare estimate around 3 per cent le 1990s. we appear well way achieve 6 per cent sustainable growth asgisa targeting, spin-off event fifa game go long way towards ensure sustainable story. at time, monetary policy remain vigilant ensure growth occur stable macroeconomic environment price stability. 6. growth current account balance payment one consequence high growth investment expand deficit current account balance payments. in recent months, international financial market view current account deficit country vulnerable capital movement consequently exchange rate adjustments. current account deficit excess 6 per cent gdp appear south africa course last year cause quite bite excitement analyst community. in fourth quarter last year experience significant widen current account deficit, deficit trade account balance payment double third fourth quarter 2006. a note last mpc statement, much import momentum fourth quarter, however, ascribe 140 per cent increase volume oil import compare third quarter. it important highlight relate inventory build-up appear exceptional unlikely oil import sustain levels. in fact, normal import volume oil final quarter last year, deficit-to-gdp ratio quarter would comfortably le 6 per cent gdp. south africa able finance current account deficit relative ease precisely positive growth prospect south africa. it also need point current account deficit also represent side coin robust capital expenditure growth country experiencing. a substantial part increase import capital good intermediate goods, contribute increase productive capacity economy increase export go forward. the mpc continue monitor development around current account deficit potential risk inflation outlook stem possible currency depreciation. it is, however, important market analyse driver current account deficit, understand underlie trend qualitative dimension rather concentrate mere figure percentage gdp possibly draw inappropriate conclusions. 7. conclusion there big difference win bid world cup finals, adequately prepare event. while cannot afford complacent, i convince south africa take successfully host event reap positive benefit economy whole. we embrace opportunity host mega event part process create opportunity citizens. the world cup final attract huge global audience, apart actual visitors, exposure positive country. 4 bi review 27/2007 finally, busy sport year ahead us, current cricket world cup game go, rugby world cup final around corner. in monetary policy decision making, rely somewhat forecast inflation. my current central forecast cricket rugby team go well year. a forecast, ass risk forecast. in case i would venture say risk firmly positive side, good probability show two lot silverware end year. allow wish mr white springbok best endeavour rugby world cup final france. we fully behind believe take bring cup home. you dare disappoint people south africa. i thank you. bi review 27/2007 5 tarisa watanagase: the prospect thai economy monetary policy speech dr tarisa watanagase, governor bank thailand, japanese chamber commerce (bangkok) dinner talk, bangkok, 16 march 2007. * * * president banno, fellow bankers, distinguish business leaders, lady gentlemen, good evening. "first all, i would like thank japanese chamber commerce (jcc) invite speak dinner." japan's relationship thailand long history encompass many aspect – trade partner, investor major contributor thailand's economic development. japan rank thailand's number one trade partner investor. in 2006, japan contribute 16.3 percent thailand's total trade, net foreign direct investment (fdi) japan constitute 32.6 percent thailand's total net fdi inflows. it therefore pleasure share view thai economy – outlook challenges, well monetary policy, you. i would like structure talk cover three key areas. first, i touch briefly overall condition economy. secondly, relation first one, i elaborate recent monetary policy decisions. finally, concluding, i share view prospect challenge face thai economy. let begin economy. the past year one challenge time thailand, term political economic aspects. on economic side, uncertainty heighten external internal factors. the impend threat global imbalance become even pronounced. the dwindle confidence u dollar continued, bring massive capital inflow region, result across-the-board currency appreciation. at time, rise oil price continue put pressure inflation first half 2006. consumer investor confidence, meanwhile, cloud linger political uncertainty bring delay consumption investment decisions, well government spending. a domestic demand weakened, export become main driver thai economic growth. despite negative environment, overall economic performance quite satisfactory. the economy prove resilient, growth momentum continue overall economic stability improved. regard internal stability, headline inflation come peak 6 percent second quarter 2006 3.3 percent last quarter 2.3 percent february year. core inflation fell peak 2.9 percent april 2006 1.4 percent february – well within target range. overall external stability remain sound. the current account turn surplus since august register surplus 1.2 billion u dollar december 2006, overall surplus 1.5 percent gdp year 2006. meanwhile, reserve short-term debt also rise further. the economy register growth rate 5 percent 2006, respectable number, backdrop external internal disturbances. the recent slowdown consumption investment could trace confidence factor. political uncertainty unwarranted strengthen currency prompt introduction reserve requirement short-term capital inflows, together amendment foreign business act that, unfortunately, happen successively within short period time, negative effect consumer business confidence. however, believe momentum lost, uncertainty postpone consumption investment decisions. evidently, retain earn total asset average q1-q3 2006 17.6 percent, high average 13.3 percent 2005, capacity utilization rise 74.2 percent 2006, indicate investment production capacity pipeline. to sum up, challenge abound, weather relatively well far. this attribute fine combination economy's resiliency appropriate policy stance. by appropriate policy stance, refer “right” policy “right” reason “right” time. bi review 27/2007 1 let's turn monetary policy. monetary policy's main objective maintain monetary stability. by mean price stability confidence value currency. thailand adopt inflation target since may 2000. under inflation targeting, emphasis give maintain core inflation within target range and, time, achieve balance growth path. we use 1-day repurchase rate policy instrument keep quarterly average core inflation within target range 0-3.5 percent. if inflationary pressure heighten thereby increase possibility core inflation breach target, interest rate raised. bear mind time lag 4-8 quarter change policy rate fully transmit rest economy, policy consideration need forward-looking. upward inflationary pressure past years, due high oil prices, tame monetary tightening. we raise policy rate 13 time august 2004 june 2006, bring policy rate 5.00 percent 1.25 percent per annum. hike policy rate bring money market commercial bank interest rate high past 2 years. our policy response prove timely, inflation second round effect well contained. recently, domestic demand, particularly private consumption investment, show sign slowdown, economic momentum export expect moderate, give prospect global economy 2007. since inflationary pressure subside line ease energy prices, monetary policy could ease support expansion economy. the mpc, thus, low 1-day repurchase rate, policy rate, 4.75 17 january meet 25 basis point reduction 28 february expect pursue downward path interest rate cautious manner. this accommodative monetary policy stance help stimulate domestic demand support economic sentiments, cut financial cost prepare stage private investment recovery confidence returned, likely 2nd half year. have consider recent economic condition monetary policy, turn prospect challenge thai economy move forward, go deal them. lady gentlemen, year, expect economy continue face number important challenge internally externally. internally, political uncertainties, adversely affect private sector's decision invest, likely stay next general election. externally, threat impend global imbalance remain high, global economy expect slow down. moreover, risk volatile global financial market lingers, baht could continue appreciate u dollar. it may great concern whether thai economy resilient enough withstand adverse environment. however, believe sound fundamental appropriate policy stance would prepare economy well long term. face internal challenges, monetary policy stance become accommodative mention earlier. the reduction policy rate effectively transmit low money market rate well low commercial banks' retail rates. to date, 4 major thai commercial bank reduce deposit rate 3 cut lend rates. the downward interest rate path help improve sentiment low cost funds, would support recovery domestic demand, particularly, investment. the outlook thai economy within next year remain positive. the bot's forecasts, incorporate aforementioned risks, show thai economy grow 4-5 percent 2007 4-5.5 percent 2008. such growth rate respectable light challenges. regard challenge arise volatile global financial market appreciation baht, thailand, relatively small still shallow financial market like many emerge market economies, vulnerable fast-moving international capital. rapid movement capital flow negative impact export import sectors, could pas adverse effect real sector financial sector eventually jeopardize economic stability. the rapid appreciation baht particularly last quarter last year, prove inconsistent economic fundamental much out-of-line rest region, inevitably force bank thailand implement reserve requirement capital inflow break rapid one-way momentum preserve overall stability several capital account measure prove unsuccessful. 2 bi review 27/2007 lady gentlemen. i would like reassure always welcome genuine foreign capital flow investor continue so. the measure implement december mean affect genuine investor clear beginning. the measure announce 18th december clearly state capital inflow form foreign direct investment (fdi) exempt reserve requirement. and late on, turn genuine flow still affect measure, attempt find alternative option alleviate pressure baht adverse effect productive sectors. to date, exchange control measure effectively slow appreciation baht. on average, nominal effective exchange rate february strengthen 0.5% relative january, compare appreciation 1.7% november 2006 first half december – measure implemented. after successfully slow one-way appreciation momentum, allow great flexibility measure without compromise need contain excessive volatility – provide fully-hedging option category inflow cover reserve requirement measure. we closely monitor hedge requirement. if implementation effective, lift reserve requirement keep hedge requirement. in safeguard economic stability foster long term growth, bot also look beyond immediate horizon. however, overcome challenge global dynamism long run, monetary financial stability alone sufficient. the challenge thai economy make sustainable gain productivity increase flexibility, efficiency, competitiveness amidst dynamic global economic condition structure. in respect, need promote sound stable macroeconomic environment carry necessary reform real sector financial sector. the real sector must work continuously improve productivity enhance competitiveness. so far, reform effort private public sector make promote transparency, strengthen governance improve quality human resources. in long term, government plan embark key infrastructure investment projects, include expansion mass transit network bangkok, water resource management, integrate logistics system. these public investment ease bottle-necks without exert much pressure external stability allow firm focus improve efficiency productivity. on financial sector, bank thailand play important role strengthen financial infrastructure. the financial sector master plan (fsmp), place since 2002, move second phase. fsmp aim broaden access financial service potential users, promote competition financial service order enhance financial efficiency resiliency ensure financial sector perform well global competitive environment. we already see significant consolidation increase efficiency bank sector first phase fsmp ended. in addition fsmp, amendment introduction number legislations, new financial institution act deposit insurance act, foster efficient financial sector. on supervisory side, also continue effort enhance financial sector's resiliency unfavorable disturbance early adoption ia 39, currently underway, new basel capital accord end next year. fsmp improve supervision complement structural reform real sector bring strong foundation economic growth stability. structural reform real sector continue need concert effort private public sector well support foreign investor like here. the bot commit necessary work strong financial sector provide supportive environment infrastructure private sector prosper. lady gentlemen, essence talk today reassure performance thai economy satisfactory that, despite adverse environment challenge face thai economy, i strongly believe thai economy able continue perform favorably move forward. we strongly commit implement appropriate policy help foster growth, stability resiliency economy strengthen solid foundation. in closing, i would like express appreciation japanese business contribution progress thai economy years. here's hop continue build strengthen foundation great relationship. again, i deeply grateful opportunity, thank kind attention. bi review 27/2007 3 t t mboweni: the role south african reserve bank protection consumer address mr t t mboweni, governor south african reserve bank, national consumer forum conference celebrate world consumer right day, johannesburg, 15 march 2007. * * * honour guests, lady gentleman 1. introduction thank invitation address occasion celebration world consumer right day. a consumer often forget rights, often say south african consumer among apathetic come assert rights. consumer reason existence business, world consumer right day accordingly deservers support. the relevance theme conference; “holding public private sector accountable” without question. the south african reserve bank play important role south african economy, action impact directly consumers. it therefore essential institution south african reserve bank fully accountable consumer autonomy enjoy. in address afternoon, i expand role south african reserve bank, particularly respect consumer, and, line theme conference, i highlight effort ensure full accountability. 2. monetary policy consumer the south african reserve bank, like central bank countries, unique position economy. the operation bank govern term south african reserve bank act, associate regulation constitution republic south africa. the act regulation describe framework structure bank, way manage action may take. the constitution prescribe objective bank protection currency interest sustainable economic growth development. the bank interpret mandate achievement maintenance price stability. in february 2000 inflation target framework adopt south africa inflation target set government. the bank, therefore, line inflation target central banks, goal independence. however, pursuit target, bank guarantee operational instrument independence. in words, apply interest rate policy without interference government. in term mandate, keep cpix inflation, (i.e. headline consumer price inflation exclude mortgage interest costs) 3 6 per cent per annum continuous basis. in carry mandate, direct impact consumer impact monetary policy inflation interest rates. the question often ask is, target inflation? low inflation interest south africans, irrespective whether consumers, business people, retirees. inflation, continuous increase general price level, imply continuous decline value money, imply erosion purchase power consumers. the bank aim limit decline achieve price stability. however, important note price stability imply price good service change all. relative price market economy always change response change relative scarcities, example drought, food price likely increase. it also generally case consumer vulnerable ravage inflation poor. the wealthy member society good position hedge inflation example borrow money buy non-monetary assets. the wealthy often asset easily protect expect inflation. bi review 26/2007 1 inflation adverse effect distortion tax system, also result increase uncertainty make economic decision-making difficult. high inflation usually also accompany great price variability. the confuse price signal make price system le efficient, result low level investment growth. we also often ask employment economic growth primary objective monetary policy. a note constitution, inflation objective itself, interest sustain growth. it go without say target monetary policy something monetary policy achieve. it view bank although monetary policy impact cyclical unemployment growth, cannot determine long-run trend real growth. growth long run determine real variable supply-side factors, include government policy general macroeconomic environment monetary policy contribute to. monetary policy play important role shape macroeconomic environment economic agent operate. the best contribution monetary policy make provide low stable inflation environment conducive sustainable long-term growth. the main monetary policy tool disposal bank interest rate. essentially bank set repo rate, rate bank borrow us, turn affect interest rate economy. it could see somewhat ironical order protect consumer inflation, mean achieve likely impact negatively consumer high interest rates. unfortunately, part bank way avoid this. at times, increase interest rate keep inflationary pressure check draw criticism particularly borrower expect increases. i note however, depositor saver happy interest rate increase. perhaps publicity give plight negatively affect interest rate changes. it emphasise bank act interest consumers, irrespective whether borrower depositors, set interest rate appropriate level ensure inflation target achieved. low inflation allow generally low nominal interest rates. furthermore, bank build credibility inflation-fighting policies, interest rate cycle likely low amplitude. hopefully strong interest rate cycle see 1980s 1990s thing past. by achieve sustain low inflation, believe interest rate adjustment moderate certainty result consumer producers. ultimately would like achieve virtuous circle low inflation, moderate interest rate cycle high sustain economic growth. at time possible action consumer could threaten inflation target, responsibility take appropriate action. in past three year see household consumption expenditure increase extremely high levels. credit extension bank rise high rates, household indebtedness also increase record highs. some explain number positive development economy apart low interest rates. these include strong household balance sheets, high real income increase employment. our monetary policy action second half last year part attempt dampen inflationary potential high consumption expenditure. there danger emanate excessive borrowing, particularly interest rate start rise consumer find overcommitted. in accept credit, consumer understand right fall prey aggressive market credit. for reason gratify bank adopt code good conduct market credit. the national credit act, implement middle year provide protection consumers. there however always two side every transaction, consumer also act responsibly take debt. 3. accountability bank a note earlier, operational mandate keep cpix inflation 3 6 per cent bank autonomy conduct monetary policy. it well recognise autonomy go hand hand accountability. thus, one primary measure accountability relate bank perform relation operational mandate. monetary policy successful achieve inflation target since september 2003 cpix move within target range. this allow reduction repo rate 650 basis point june 2003 april 2005. in 2006, response perceive risk inflation 2 bi review 26/2007 outlook, monetary policy committee increase repo rate 50 basis point four consecutive meet june. despite adjustment, economic growth remain strong expect growth rate around 5 per cent sustained. although monetary policy cannot claim credit, contribution economy’s robust growth performance last couple year well recognise many circles. our accountability extend beyond simply achieve inflation target. since announcement inflation target south africa, ambiguity ultimate goal monetary policy removed. the smooth conduct inflation target framework imply great deal trust confidence part public central bank’s ability determination achieve target. without credibility eye public, central bank’s policy goal easily achievable. since introduction inflation target policy framework, bank introduce number initiative improve transparency communication stakeholder enhance credibility monetary policy. in fact, communication play important role fulfil bank’s obligation accountability. for example, decision monetary policy committee (mpc) announce meet televise medium conference, motivation decision explained. medium representative also opportunity question monetary policy decision policy stance. the publication bi-annual monetary policy review also broaden understand aim conduct monetary policy. the review analysis development factor influence inflation, ass recent policy development consider outlook inflation. in conjunction statement mpc meetings, publication shed light monetary policy deliberations. monetary policy broad economic issue discuss stakeholder monetary policy forums, host bi-annually bloemfontein, cape town, durban, east london, gauteng, kimberley, mafikeng, polokwane, port elizabeth nelspruit. these forum provide discussion monetary policy broad geographical spectrum involve large cross-section stakeholders, include trade union representatives, analysts, academics, medium general public. the bank ultimately accountable parliament representative body people south africa, annual report submit parliament. i also meet periodically member parliamentary portfolio committee finance. after publication bank’s quarterly bulletin, presentation make committee highlight

government provide fund recapitalise weak public sector banks. even though public sector bank continue dominate indian bank system, account nearly three-fourths total asset income, increase competition bank system lead fall share public sector banks, increase share new private sector banks, set around mid-1990s. it clear begin new phase indian bank competitive pressure, domestic external, catch need bank continuously reassess reposition business plans. future challenge indian bank a broad challenge face indian bank are: threat risk globalisation; implementation basel ii; improvement risk management systems; implementation new account standards; enhancement transparency disclosures; enhancement customer service; application technology. globalisation – challenge well opportunity the wave globalisation sweep across world, throw several opportunity accompany concomitant risks. integration domestic market international financial market facilitate tremendous advancement information communication technology. there grow realisation ability country conduct business across national border ability cope possible downside risk would depend, inter alia, soundness financial system. this necessitate convergence prudential norm international best practice well consistent refinement technological institutional framework financial sector non-disruptive consultative process. open capital account the committee full capital account convertibility (chairman: shri s.s. tarapore) observe full capital account convertibility regime, bank system would expose great market volatility, necessitate enhance risk management capability bank system view liquidity risk, interest rate risk, currency risk, counter-party risk country risk arise international capital flows. the potential danger associate proliferation derivative instrument – credit derivative interest rate derivative also need recognise 4 bi review 25/2007 regulatory supervisory system. the issue relate cross-border supervision financial intermediary context great capital flow emerge need addressed. basel ii implementation the reserve bank commercial bank prepare implement basel ii, decide allow bank time adhere new norms. a deadline march 31, 2007 compliance basel ii, decide october 2006 foreign bank operate india indian bank presence outside india would migrate standardise approach credit risk basic indicator approach operational risk basel ii effect march 31, 2008, schedule commercial bank require migrate basel ii march 31, 2009. it widely acknowledge implementation basel ii pose significant challenge bank regulators. basel ii implementation may also see compliance challenge. but time, offer two major opportunity banks, viz., refinement risk management systems; improvement capital efficiency. the transition basel i basel ii essentially involve move capital adequacy capital efficiency. this transition capital use much capital need become significant factor return-on-equity strategy year come. the reliance market ass riskiness bank would lead increase focus transparency market disclosure, critical information describe risk profile, capital structure capital adequacy. besides make bank accountable responsive better-informed investors, process enable bank strike right balance risk reward improve access markets. improvement market discipline also call great coordination bank regulators. improve risk management system basel ii bring focus need comprehensive risk management framework deal various risks, include credit market risk inter-linkages. bank india also move individual silo system enterprise-wide risk management system. while first milestone would risk integration across entity, next step would entail risk aggregation across group specific risk area also across risks. bank would, therefore, require allocate significant resource towards endeavour. in india, risk-based approach supervision also serve catalyst banks’ migration integrate risk management systems. however, take account diversity indian bank system, stabilize rb effective supervisory mechanism another challenge. corporate governance to large extent, many risk management failure reflect breakdown corporate governance arise due poor management conflict interest, inadequate understand key bank risks, poor board oversight mechanism risk management internal audit. corporate governance is, therefore, foundation effective risk management bank and, thus, foundation sound financial system. therefore, choice bank make establish risk management corporate governance system important ramification financial stability. bank may cultivate good governance culture build appropriate check balance operations. there four important form oversight include organisational structure bank order ensure appropriate check balances: (i) oversight board director supervisory board; (ii) oversight individual involve day-to-day run various business areas; (iii) direct line supervision different business areas; (iv) independent risk management, compliance audit functions. in addition, important key personnel fit proper jobs. furthermore, general principle sound corporate governance also apply banks, irrespective unique ownership structures. implementation new account standard derivative activity bank increase brisk pace. while risk management framework derivative trading, relatively new area indian bank (particularly bi review 25/2007 5 structure products) essential pre-requisite, absence clear account guideline area matter significant concern. the world bank’s rosc account audit india comment absence account standard deal recognition, measurement disclosure pertain financial instruments. the account standard board institute charter accountant

banks, revolutionise distribution channels, cannot overemphasised. recognise benefit modernise technology infrastructure, bank take right initiatives. while so, bank four option choose from: build new system themselves, buy best modules, buy comprehensive solution, outsource. a challenge bank face regard ensure derive maximum advantage investment technology avoid wasteful expenditure might arise account uncoordinated piecemeal adoption technology; adoption inappropriate/ inconsistent technology adoption obsolete technology. a case point implementation core bank solution bank without assess

address mr ajith nivard cabraal, governor central bank sri lanka, 9th south asia management forum, dhaka, 24–25 february 2007. * * * what governance governance? governance may say effective, transparent accountable administration affair institution management, protect interest stakeholder include shareholders, creditors, regulator public. modern corporate governance practice evolve time different code best practice corporate governance develop various organisations. e.g. oecd code corporate governance, basel code corporate governance bank financial institutions, etc. at time, several fundamental corporate governance principle evolve receive worldwide acceptance, guideline principle comprehensively develop corporate governance activists, practitioners, researchers, others. these principle generally relate responsibility board, directors, chairmen, ceos, senior management, board appoint committees, auditors, shareholder regulators. accountability, internal controls, relate party transactions, conflict interest, information disclosure also extensively deal target formulation principles. corporate governance principle origin 19th century although term corporate governance come vogue latter part 1980s. the need focus good practice corporate governance mainly arise response separation ownership control follow formation joint stock companies. the owner shareholder joint stock companies, involve day day operational issues, require assurance control company, director managers, safeguard investment accurately report financial outcome business activities. thus, director original target corporate governance, practice principle design protect interest shareholder misdemeanour directors. however, current think recognize company’s obligation society generally form stakeholders, new think drive study practice good corporate governance level reach today. perhaps also think account hectic pace development take place take place practice well. since latter part 2001, lively often controversial debate corporate governance become even turbulent debate result massive corporate scandal failure rock business world, namely enron worldcom. almost knee-jerk reaction, new laws, e.g. sarbanes – oxley act usa similar law and/or regulation world quickly introduce possible attempt prevent scandal failure future, soothe nervous mind investors, local international. but, “big stick” brandish freely wielded, modern think realization quickly firmly evolve simultaneously that, achieve outcome good corporate behavior need long list rules, regulations, big sticks. in fact, begin learn understand corporate scandal failure bite like flu. regulators, researcher stakeholder regularly “discover” “invent” new vaccine combat menace, virus mutate surface different form different strain. in way, notwithstanding many initiative 1990s early 2000s, several round corporate scandal around globe, enron worldcom parmalat daewoo many others, new vaccine treatment method quickly researched, hastily prescribed, widely administered. after dust settle however, find, pensively reflect, treatment may strong cause many adverse side-effects. some pill may bitter. some tablet may expensive. some disease management technique may even harmful disease! nevertheless, collective endeavour pump patient many drug test bi review 24/2007 1 could possibly administer (may could avoid law suit relate professional negligence so!), plethora new rule regulation churn keep churn regular intervals. but, frenzied activity, vex question keep haunt stakeholder is: will today’s regulation suffice inoculate company crisis future keep healthy? will rule help maintain sustain investors’ trust companies? will law regulation help stimulate institution instead stifle them? will effort actually build trust confidence overall system? of course, readily admit quick response aftermath enron others, damage could much bear. the repercussion loss confidence could serious contemplate. but, time, painful truth also emerged. i.e., laws, rules, regulation codes, ensure good corporate behavior. however powerful strong new vaccine appear be, however effective treatment seem be, however professional keen doctor try be, new disease emerge. some may minor. but, ever often, new strain occur, place system severe threat. arise realization, another fundamental realization also dawned. i.e., good corporate behavior ensure company stakeholder genuinely believe best interest act ethically act accord best governance practices. enforcement important. but admit enforcement keep bad actor theatre. we sometimes observe actor bad, perform time. in way, cannot set law regulation complete every way able deal every risk prevalent market. many instance market participants, especially drive short term self interest, look regulatory loophole lacuna interest without unduly bother underlie prudence actions. therefore, regulator begin acknowledge alone cannot guarantee company continue advance safe sound manner. regulator also, albeit painfully, realize compete party cannot simultaneously fully satisfied. unfortunately however, turbulent, sometimes even chaotic environment search solutions. corporate governance also increasingly acknowledge important instrument address “ownership issues” well. with current practice available worldwide hide identity true owners, almost impossible regulator rely ownership limit deal undue influence, assure seemingly unrelated party actually related! consequently, market increasingly look towards application good corporate governance practice overcome ill-effects may arise ownership concentration generally believe good governance place, concentrate ownership, know unknown, may adversely affect risk management process institution. in case bank especially, regulatory limit ownership bank prescribe number country prevent bank control single owner group connect owners. however, majority country world still regulations. in fact, accord world bank survey 157 country 2003, 112 regulation ownership limits. nevertheless, many countries, indirect regulation limit related-party transaction fit proper test bank director executive officer place promote aspect good corporate governance, i think, regulator genuinely believe practice would increasingly ensure good risk management banks, thereby lead sound system. all all, today, code best practice corporate governance set principle within value governance rule set management institution, final analysis, good corporate governance look key tool use overall risk management institutions, irrespective nature business carry institution. why good governance bank financial system important sector? the bank financial sector easily distinguishable others. a distinguish feature stand out: • unlike normal business entity fund mainly shareholders’ funds, banks’ business involve fund raise mainly deposits. the business raise public deposit place great fiduciary responsibility institution managers, since depositors’ fund need safeguard special way. 2 bi review 24/2007 • bank perform financial intermediary lend invest fund mobilize fund economic activity others. • bank agent payment system facilitate payment domestically internationally, various instrument bank accounts, fund transfers, credit cards, etc. • bank able undertake business operation result public trust faith stability soundness bank particular system general. the history bank failure many country indicate loss public confidence bank could contagious could easily lead systemic bank crisis situations. overall, bank business key monetary condition country. bank deposit lend business determine supply, cost availability money. money create bank system legal tender issue central bank and/or monetary authorities. since sight money create payable bank time legal tender technically, bank system fund adequate meet create money particular point time. bank business thus cast huge responsibility monetary authority facilitate, regulate, protect bank payment system. weak corporate governance (cg) contribute financial instability would increase risk profile company corporate sector expose bank financial institution great risk. in direct sense, weakness cg arrangement bank financial institution reduce capacity identify, monitor manage business risk result poor quality lend excessive risk-taking financial institutions. depend resilience financial institution markets, risk potential spread across wide financial system. needle say inadequate cg also lead poor credit culture, excessive exposure concentration, poor management interest risk/exchange risk inadequacy management connect exposures. some risks, singularly collectively, lead potential insolvency financial instability. in recent times, regulator world introduce prudential norm single borrower exposures, group exposure concentration credit risks. the underlie principle norm indicate degree compulsion observance cg principles. to augment prudential norms, regulator may even consider introduce mandatory disclosure bank financial institutions. where good governance fit scenario? obviously, corporate governance identify acknowledge powerful tool generate trust confidence institution. in context, good corporate governance essentially important banks, institution (a) deal fund raise public; (b) likely encounter great risk include fraud failure; (c) fraud failure occur institutions, may pose issue relate public confidence financial system stability itself. all reason lead bank tend depend upon risk management practice base principle prudence rather comply minimum requirements. it also result realization many stakeholder regulator consciously look towards good corporate governance, one prime instrument overall effort maintain financial system stability. in sri lanka, cbsl already issue voluntary code best practice corporate governance banks. this prepare task force consist person bank financial sector. but, believe time come u move towards stringent application corporate governance code therefore process draft issue new code best practice corporate governance make mandatory banks. what challenge face regulator deal banks? over past decades, activity field bank increase rapidly today large number new area add traditional list service provide banks. an examination list would clearly indicate bank today perform many bi review 24/2007 3 service hitherto provide service providers. we see conventional difference bank financial businesses, i.e., insurance security trading, almost disappeared. in meantime, rapid development debt security market too, pose new challenge traditional intermediation business banks. all blur customary boundary many overlap created. naturally trend lead new challenge regulator bank deal new multi-faceted conglomerates, instead traditional deposit taking/money lend institution once-upon-a-time call “bank”. therefore, today, need surface several regulator compel act group undertake consolidate supervision financial institutions, especially financial conglomerates, become increasingly common. regulator tend enter mous share information current legal provisions, also periodical meetings, sometimes form financial system stability committee inter-regulatory institution committee ass potential systemic risks/crises develop crisis prevention resolution measures. in fact, countries, regulator develop common tool conduct financial “fire drills” prepare possible failure large financial institutions, practice include various simulation technique well. that all. the regulators’ work become even complex due rapid internationalization bank system. internationalization could take place two ways: ownership business operations. “ownership” involve international investor and/or international bank acquire bank countries. bank “business operations” get internationalize use modern it geographical boundary country regulatory boundary long applicable become increasingly difficult identify single particular location operative area respect certain financial transactions. modern it financial liberalization key lead type bank internationalization. at time, provide innovative electronic money scripless settlement system cross-border financial transactions. financial liberalization lead bank internationalization surplus fund flow cross-border finance deficit units, i.e., international intermediation. in background, realize regulation high mobility capital flow create enormous risk internationalize bank international systems, individual fund management system bank sound. this require regulator place even great weight upon efficacy governance system since failure institution could catastrophic well entire global financial systems. in addition, ill effect money laundering, finance illegal activities, finance terrorism bank system risk face bank due grow internationalization. these too, need address stakeholder involve development evolve systems. to deal challenges, regulator close rank internationally well, attempt harmonize prudential requirement monitor risk international financial conglomerates, regard, must somewhat relieve basel capital accord provide clear framework u apply subject. a know, basel code corporate governance bank financial institution cover 8 principles. these are: • principle 1: board member qualify positions, clear understand role corporate governance able exercise sound judgment affair bank. • principle 2: the board director approve oversee bank’s strategic objective corporate value communicate throughout bank organization. • principle 3: the board director set enforce clear line responsibility accountability organization. • principle 4: the board ensure appropriate oversight senior management consistent board policy. • principle 5: the board senior management effectively utilize work conduct internal audit function, external auditors, internal control functions. • principle 6: the board ensure compensation policy practice consistent bank’s corporate culture, long-term objective strategy, control environment. • principle 7: the bank govern transparent manner. 4 bi review 24/2007 • principle 8: the board senior management understand bank’s operational structure, include bank operate jurisdictions, may impede transparency (i.e. “know-your-structure”). it clear today, ever, regulator also key role play achieve good corporate governance. in general, regulations, bank system, intend one way another, enforce prudential requirement key area affair institution mitigate identify risks. regulation ownership, relate party transactions, fitness propriety test director directly base modern corporate governance principles. however, basel committee go describe role supervisor corporate governance add new parameter well. these are: • supervisor provide guidance bank sound corporate governance pro-active practice place. • supervisor consider corporate governance one element depositor protection. • supervisor determine whether bank adopt effectively implement sound corporate governance policy practices. • supervisor ass quality banks’ audit control functions. • supervisor evaluate effect bank’s group structure. • supervisor bring board directors’ management’s attention, problem detect supervisory efforts. accord basel recommendations, corporate governance promote stakeholder well. for instance, • shareholder – active inform exercise shareholder rights; • depositor customer – conduct business bank operate unsound manner; • auditor – well-established qualify audit profession, audit standard communication board directors, senior management supervisors; • bank industry association – initiative relate voluntary industry principle agreement publication sound practices; • professional risk advisory firm consultancy – assist bank implement sound corporate governance practices; • government – laws, regulations, enforcement effective judicial framework; • credit rat agency – review assessment impact corporate governance practice bank’s risk profile; • security regulators, stock exchange self-regulatory organization – disclosure list requirements; • employee – communication concern regard illegal unethical practice corporate governance weaknesses. in broad sense, mandate bank financial institution adhere full disclosure operation would allow markets, investors, depositor others keep close watch financial institutions, also provide opportunity regulator also closely involve supervise institutions. for example, list bank financial institution supervisory arm central banks, also security & exchange commissions. in multi-regulatory multi-supervisory system like still prevalent part world, necessary ensure regulatory supervisory burden share responsible regulate supervise bank financial institutions. this also provide opportunity mitigate concentration regulatory risks. in multi-regulatory regimes, particularly relevant ensure appropriate cg principle lay down, regulator aware principle behind governance rule introduce interest wide financial system stability. bi review 24/2007 5 in promote sound cg, also necessary develop effective legal framework specify right obligation institution, bank finance company other, directors, shareholder stakeholders. the regulators, part, initiate action build capacity cg various levels, include chairmen, board director senior management bank financial institutions. the legal framework also provide disclosure requirements, facilitate enforcement law. further, essential encourage effective financial news media, deal importance cg educate public. they play responsible role disseminate accurate information public initiate meaningful discussion subject. conclusion the development corporate governance take place world increasingly complex. it almost impossible undertake full-time study subject keep pace developments. yet, u interest system stimulate business keep wheel economy move rapid space, would continue strong interest subject. i also hopeful that, bank financial community continue promote foster study practice since provide lubrication smooth function complicate financial system ever-changing corporate regimes. we also know large portion global business bank sector. in addition, business entities, maintain direct relationship bank financial institutions. in context, pre-eminent position applicable bank enjoy cannot over-emphasized under-estimated. therefore, effort enhance governance capability capacity within bank financial institution forefront agendas. the trend world target governance practice bank financial sector cut edge prevail practice worldwide significant step right direction continue future well. let u therefore together collectively dedicate promote apply good corporate governance principle practice respective bank financial sectors. needle say, beneficiary effort economy strive develop quickly possible. 6 bi review 24/2007 t t mboweni: the commodity price boom south african economy address mr t t mboweni,

woman business scarce resource effort deserve support. the economic environment south africa extremely positive recent times, growth average around five per cent past three years. an important contribute factor favourable environment behaviour commodity prices. a commodity producer, please commodity price perform well. however, know past experience, commodity price boom mix blessing. too often history ignore fact commodity price move cycles. there tendency regard price boom permanent, thing end tear cycle ended. the current boom persist long many predicted, lead suggestion commodity super-cycle. at time, commodity become new asset class own. in comment even i highlight recent development commodity price challenge pose economy general monetary policy particular. 2. commodity south african economy a aware, commodity play central role south africa’s economic development. the mine industry, largely support gold, diamonds, coal platinum group metals, century contribute significantly national economy. it provide impetus development physical infrastructure, well establishment country’s secondary industries. south africa lead supplier range mineral mineral products. accord chamber mines, 2005, approximately 55 different mineral produce 1 113 mine quarries, 45 mine produce gold, 29 produce platinum-group minerals, 64 produce coal 202 produce diamonds. mining, therefore, remain key foundation south african economy. in 2005 mine make direct indirect contribution approximately 15 per cent gdp, account around 50 per cent merchandise export (including primary beneficiate mineral exports), 12 per cent fix investment, 30 per cent market value jse limit 20 per cent formal-sector employment. however, important note abundance resource always imply prosperous economy. this particularly true many resource-rich african countries, recently benefit resource endowments. natural resource also prerequisite growth. country japan switzerland natural resource time outperform country wealth resource endowments. in fact, natural resource sometimes regard curse. a far back 1950s, prebisch singer postulate secular decline term trade commodity-producing countries. the essence argument commodity price tendency decline long term. this, recently, largely bear empirical evidence. bi review 73/2007 1 in last 140 year 18 commodity cycles, slump persistent booms. in instance sub-saharan africa, commodity price slump last 30 years. however, since 2001, commodity price boomed, witness impressive economic growth many resource-rich african countries. notwithstanding structural shift commodity-based country services-oriented one, south africa also experience concomitant increase growth period. 3. commodity price movement last five year during 2001, overall commodity index measure international monetary fund begin increase steadily. this increase continue well 2007, particularly case energy metals. not increase persistent, give rise super-cycle hypothesis, surge large previous cycles. increase also differ significantly across commodities. for example price north sea brent crude oil increase around $19 per barrel 2002 around $72 per barrel june 2007, peak almost us$80 per barrel august last year. metal also show strong increase gold platinum price increase approximately 120 per cent period. agricultural prices, contrast, display volatility le growth compare energy metals. between 2001 2006, imf commodity food price index increase 36 per cent. more narrowly, perhaps relevant south africa, cereal price index increase 48 per cent period. in 2006 alone, imf maize wheat price index increase 24 per cent 26 per cent respectively. food price inflation become world-wide concern south africa spared. spot price yellow white maize increase level around r500 per ton 2004 current level around r1 800 per ton drive part international price developments. in october november last year, meat price increase year-on-year rate almost 20 per cent, currently overall food inflation excess 8 per cent per annum. 4. what drive recent price increases? it use case growth cycle unite state determine commodity cycle. more recently, emergence asian economy china particular, dominant influence u economy commodity cycle waned. most commentator attribute recent escalation commodity price increase demand raw material china wake country’s ongoing economic growth industrialisation. two factor frequently mention part explanation china’s impact global commodity prices. firstly, china’s large population 1,3 billion associate large pool unskilled labour contribute increase competitiveness lead china lead manufacture production centre world. this turn keep demand commodity input manufacture high. secondly, china’s industrialisation come time ongoing globalisation, contribute overall demand commodity globally. china’s contribution global growth consumption base metal recent year considerable. accord imf world economic outlook, 2002-2005, china’s contribution world consumption growth aluminium, copper steel around 50 per cent. furthermore, china contribute excess 80 per cent increase world demand nickel tin. more significantly, period, china account consumption growth lead zinc, 30 per cent world consumption growth oil. due rapid growth rise share world economy, china expect retain critical role drive commodity price movements. the recent increase food price result number factor include weak u dollar, impact high energy fertiliser prices, crop-specific supply shortfall droughts, low inventory levels. some analyst suggest high global real income also contribute upward pressure food prices. an increasingly important driver agricultural price come strong demand bio-fuels, see diversion agricultural output energy production. although number country make significant stride bio-fuels production, unite state brazil together account 70 per cent worldwide production ethanol. 2 bi review 73/2007 5. the commodity price boom market in recent years, investor interest commodity increase line rise commodity price increase global liquidity. trade commodity indices, total approximately us$100 billion increase factor 20 past decade. this still relatively small compare asset class proliferation diversification investor base include hedge fund asset manager see commodity mean diversify portfolio risk take advantage high yield achieved. significantly, investor increasingly view commodity long-term investment. the financialisation commodity also boost development financial engineering, strong growth underlie contract investment strategies. expectation continue sustain growth asia, particularly india china, serve fuel increase demand commodity asset classes. a deep diversify market bring benefit term market efficiency. for example fact easy hedge future production reduce risk new productive investment may otherwise take time come stream. a relate issue concern role speculator regard responsible price volatility market. recent evidence, however, suggest may necessarily case. a recent study conduct chicago future trade commission show speculative trader lead rather respond market developments. this suggest speculator tend rather stabilise market. development financialisation commodity market may, however, raise several financial stability question central bank financial sector regulators. in particular, certain whether regulator enough information exposure financial institution price export commodity firms’ foreign exchange exposure could compound commodity exposures. moreover, rise commodity price volatility could make domestic financial asset volatile. an additional challenge central bank stem credit exposure primary production sector bank system pension fund significantly increase exposure commodity assets. furthermore, central bank always alert sudden decline commodity price may bring deflationary pressure financial instability domestic economy. 6. economic policy challenge despite positive impact high commodity price economy, also create various problem challenge economic management. for commodity-exporting countries, commodity price boom bring concern possibility dutch disease, arise boom primary sector cause real exchange rate appreciate, turn put pressure manufacture tradable sector economy. the concern even great cycle turn loss market manufacture sector easily reversible. from fiscal policy perspective, challenge arise relate management windfall revenues. to extent tax revenue boost commodity boom, may need smooth expenditure treat revenue increase permanent. a number primary-commodity exporters, example chile norway, create national wealth fund ensure expenditure maintain commodity cycle decline tax revenue fall. monetary policy would concern possible impact commodity price increase inflation. ironically, strong non-oil commodity price increase translate generalise inflation. in fact commodity boom coincide long period low global inflation. part reason may lie china globalisation. high rate productivity growth china allow production wide range good low price despite increase cost inputs. in highly competitive globalise world market credible monetary policies, product price increase remain low price even fall instances. oil food prices, however, appear pose threat global inflation outlook commodities. nevertheless, contrary initial fears, impact rise oil price le impact inflation output previous episode oil price increases. this may general decline oil intensity many country credible monetary policy frameworks. however, oil food price drive force recent inflation development south africa pose major upside risk inflation abroad. bi review 73/2007 3 monetary response terms-of-trade shock oil price increase straightforward depend part magnitude duration shocks. in essence, issue boil distinguish permanent transitory change prices, first- second-round effect likely influence future inflation outcomes. in general, central bank likely change monetary policy response commodity price fluctuations. monetary policy address risk emanate possible

difference speech dr nout wellink, president netherlands bank chairman basel committee bank supervision, roosevelt academy, middelburg, 1 june 2007. * * * today special. you represent first graduation year roosevelt academy, undoubtedly await bright future wherein chance success abound. clearly accomplishment also signal big achievement academy faculty members. today, i wish talk another success story, namely microcredit. the un designate 2005 international year microcredit. the aim “building inclusive financial sector strengthen powerful, often untapped, entrepreneurial spirit exist community around world.” the year microcredit prove highly successful. it raise awareness around globe importance microfinance fight poverty empower poor enhance high income jobs. in words, microfinance promote economic social inclusion. permit address issue microfinance great depth. “microfinance” generally stand financial service poor. microfinance important well three billion people access basic financial service credit, save account insurance. microfinance offer basic financial services, prime importance people. these financial service provide so-called "microfinance institutions" (mfis) "microlenders", simply generic term estimate 10,000 diverse entity commercial banks, ngos, credit unions, finance company etc. while i microcredit mind refer microfinance general, please keep mind microfinance service much broad also include insurance, deposit take sometimes even pensions. however, important element microfinance today still micro credit. let therefore begin explain microcredit is, work whether help poor people improve live standards. thereafter i discus market microcredit. in particular, i focus initiative take netherlands. with pride i say netherlands amongst frontrunners come develop support new initiative field microfinance. the fact her royal highness princess maximum member advisor group unite nation international year microcredit 2005 undoubtedly contribute grow involvement dutch microfinance. and, continue work member un advisory group inclusive financial sectors. finally, way conclusion i identify challenge future. microcredit – it? microcredit extension small loan (micro loans) unemployed, poor entrepreneur others live poverty consider bankable. these individual typically lack collateral, steady employment verifiable credit history. therefore cannot meet even minimal qualification gain access traditional credit. microcredit financial innovation originate develop country successfully enable extremely impoverish people (mostly women) engage self-employment project allow generate income begin build wealth ultimately exit poverty. thank success micro credit, many people traditional bank industry begin realize microcredit borrower see pre-bankable. microcredit gain credibility mainstream finance industry. many traditional large finance organization consider microcredit project new source future growth. how microcredit work? a know, microfinance invent nobel prize laureate muhammad yunus, last year receive four freedom award roosevelt foundation. in 1970’s professor yunus work chitttagong university bangladesh. at time, start experiment provide small loan people village surround bi review 72/2007 1 university. in 1976 start famous grameen bank help government. the goal simple: provide small loan poor. regular bank would provide loan consider risky – poor people typically lack collateral – costly. the small scale loan high monitor cost individual loan typically increase operational costs. an interest feature grameen bank’s initial lend methodology loan provide group rather individuals. let briefly illustrate first scheme work practice. two member five-person group receive loan first. if instalment pay time, initial loan follow four six week late loan two members. after another four six weeks, remain member, know group chairperson, receive loan – course provide go well. in begin group typically see source solidarity. for example, one member could repay loan, group chairman could help out. in way credit record default borrower would remain clean, thereby also group whole. over time, formal sanction bank become common. if one group member fail repay, group member would cut future loans. the incentive help time need, also check others repayment record, become strong joint liability system. in practice group lend methodology function well, repayment rate generally high. group lend beneficial poor people gain access credit, also advantage microfinance institution provide loans. part responsibility microfinance institution, monitor loan enforce repayments, take care group’s check balances. in way operational cost microfinance reduce become possible give poor people loan would otherwise available least would available low interest rates. the group lend methodology thus increase social capital efficiency. effect poverty economic development with innovative concept group lend possible give poor people access credit. an obvious next question is: credit them? can people actually improve live standard help micro credit? there basically two way answer question. the first way look data available scientific study carefully ass results. this central banker typically approach economic questions. the second way pack bags, hop airplane, see self microcredit affect life people develop countries. let’s start second approach, common central bankers, undoubtedly le illuminating. my personal experience microfinance ghana positive. and hold many observer witness activity microfinance institution ground. but microcredit really effective mean alleviate poverty? be high expectation justify establish clear causality microfinance high socio-economic welfare? to answer question, go beyond personal experience also look data result available scientific studies. however, surprisingly little scientific work effectiveness microfinance programs. accord expert may explain fact many donor finance microfinance institution focus reach many poor people possible. evaluate programme often see waste time money – let say practical point view perception understandable. but, broad policy point view, important know concept work best concept le effective. careful experimentation sound control group may provide insights. another explanation limit degree scientific evaluation lack data. often simply enough data available study effectiveness microfinance. moreover, available data may limit use because, example, account definition differ institution microfinance industry. i therefore welcome recent initiatives, example world bank, improve quality reliable data increase current knowledge. with shortcoming mind, available study provide rather positive picture microfinance confirm personal observations. it turn microcredit help people increase income entrepreneurial activities. the effect often large woman men seem diminish size loan increases. this latter result suggest small loan actually make big difference! and woman remain important target group. 2 bi review 72/2007 the market microcredit initiative netherlands the prospect microcredit industry general strong. the market grow rapidly supply hardly keep demand. it estimate 4 percent global demand microfinance service met. note potential global microfinance market worth roughly $300 billion, although estimate vary widely. also, grow development microfinance sector, source fund mfis diversified. official donor long primary source, ten microfinance fund private sector investor also offer capital mfis rapidly commercialise microfinance. these investor typically private-sector fund arm donor socially motivated, privately-managed investment fund finance public private capital. although type investor generally take commercial approach rigor investment analysis monitoring, always fully commercial sense try maximise profit. the dutch involvement microfinance leave chance. on contrary, already 1997 first effort make coordinate microfinance activity several co-financing agency (cordaid, hivos, interchurch organisation development co-operation novib) main funder ministry foreign affairs. with grow involvement private commercial organisation microfinance need include large diverse group actor initiative. so, january 2003 thirteen organisation agree formalise effort coordinate work together. they jointly establish netherlands platform microfinance. dutch organisation support microfinance sector develop country investment subsidy join. since establishment platform grow comprise fifteen organisations. to give idea platform does: 2005 platform invest eur 360 million form loans, equity investments, guarantees, seed capital subsidies; 50% eur 225 million 2004! these investment reach 550 organisation 78 country offer financial service poor people, range community-based organisations, co-operatives, non-governmental organisations, bank financial institutions. a large share money invest latin america, follow asia, central eastern europe. surprisingly, africa low share (around 12%). the west still seem lack commitment truly help continent forward. the distribution four region large remain steady last three years. this reflect fact general microfinance market matured, especially latin america, compare development sector african continent. but, although market microfinance grow organisation support development, remain important challenge future. challenge future – way conclusion if truly wish succeed provide microfinance service poor large scale, contribution desperately needed. this issue financing. regulator governments, particular, need develop legal regulatory framework microfinance, consumer protection, financial infrastructure. also prudential supervisor – prudential supervisor i find important – contribute growth microfinance define clear criterion microfinance institutions. this pertain particular institution wish take deposit public expand service cross sectorally. and, last least, perhaps successful graduate roosevelt academy also make contribution success microfinance, future investors, entrepreneurs, simply tell others environment potential microfinance. the latter actually prove effective, undoubtedly bright future next generation influential professional society. bi review 72/2007 3 anselmo l s teng:

rapid economic growth record achievement note financial sector. this favourable result attribute auspex central government fraternity provinces, city regions. in first quarter 2007, achieve real gdp

performance reflect result fast growth local economy sustain development neighbour economies, also result unrelenting effort bank sector devote enhance risk management financial innovation. financial innovation perpetual endeavour financial industry cover broad wide-ranging scope. i consider embrace new financial idea well improve exist ones; general, cover follow 4 aspects: 1. innovation 3 main financial structures: financial market, financial institution financial products; bi review 72/2007 1 2. innovation 3 main financial channels: public financial infrastructures, internal operational facility external service measures; 3. innovation 3 main user financial system: government, enterprise residents; 4. innovation 3 main financial regimes: financial rule regulations, financial supervision cross-border financial cooperation. if definition financial innovation established, realization vary accordance time, place people involved. it would unrealistic macao realize overall financial innovation. macao’s development confine many objective factor limit capacity, absence comprehensive financial market lopsided economic structure. a such, financial innovation effort restrain inherent factors. nevertheless, along, actively promote financial innovation line need economic development simultaneously maintain sustainable development financial industry stable sound manner. be operator, local financial sector remarkable financial innovation. in past years, witness emergence various type financial products, range telephone banking, mobile banking, online banking, investment

innovation region closely connect economic financial development mainland. the pan-pearl delta region, 9 province 2 special administrative region vast area, competitive edge solid economic strength. their governments, business sector resident comparatively good knowledge finance. against backdrop, great future financial innovation. although i mention early macao limit experience respect, i would like take occasion share follow observations: 1. appropriate law regulation need foster regulatory environment conducive financial innovation. it worthwhile attempt new idea long would contravene requirement exist law regulations. however, must full understand relate risks. and, must appropriate risk control system measure mitigate eliminate risks. apart comply necessary regulatory procedure, new idea must facilitate market development without impair right consumers. to end, qdii scheme stock investment serve classic example. the introduction moderation qdii scheme well gradual open

trade transaction place settle renminbi. this form financial innovation materialize cross-border cooperation involve trade commodity also cooperation government concerned. now, i would like share another live experience. a know, since return motherland, macao sar government try turn macao service platform mainland portuguese-speaking country capitalize historical relationship macao build latter. financial cooperation portuguese-speaking country msar flourish mere acquaintance. in september 2006, bank china (macao branch), bpi portugal angolan subsidiary, bfa, sign tri-partite

appear simple cooperation arrangement. however, close look show special features. traditionally, similar arrangement involve two parties. now, one involve one party specific reason. the arrangement conclude business macao angola macao portugal. it specially arrange transaction angola mainland. from example, great potential financial innovation area cross-border cooperation. besides, believe much achieve pan-pearl delta region brother province regions, macao mainland, well mainland portuguese-speaking country macao intermediary the summary basic viewpoint theme forum. it provide merely food

jean-pierre roth: “a franc remain franc” – 100 year national bank policy support monetary stability address mr jean-pierre roth, chairman govern board swiss national bank chairman board director bank international settlements, official ceremony 100th anniversary swiss national bank, zurich, 22 june 2007. * * * honour president swiss confederation honour prime minister principality liechtenstein honour member federal parliament honour representative cantonal government honour governor fellow central bank honour guest almost day 100 year ago, swiss national bank open door head office berne zurich branch office basel, geneva st gallen. this mark end around 16 year parliamentary work follow acceptance, 1891, constitutional article lead establishment central note-issuing institution whole switzerland. this prolong process definitely explain fact countrymen, end 19th century, see urgent need establishment central bank. in fact, political debate prior 1907 mainly focus question relate organisation bank distribution profits; regulatory role new institution assume hardly touch upon. the new national bank expect gradually take activity former note-issuing institution bring welcome order payment system. at time, value swiss franc define gold silver, precious metal content coin fix accordingly banknote could exchange gold. nowadays, snb’s responsibility matter monetary stability uncontested. in fact, explicitly mandate law preserve price stability take economic development account. moreover, economic theory stress special responsibility central bank area. the goals, method instrument monetary policy thus undergo profound changes. nevertheless, principle guide activity past century remarkably enduring, exemplify history national bank. pursuit stability from outset, national bank recognise role national note-issuing institution would extend far beyond harmonisation payment systems. the first step difficult. during first world war, snb actively participate finance military expenditure loans. this undisciplined lend policy push inflation, thereby contribute social unrest 1918. this spark broad debate snb’s responsibility massive price rise. these events, along subsequent tragedy german hyperinflation, leave strong mark national bank. it must time snb fully realise complexity task. in particular, recognise important preserve country’s good monetary health – long law make price stability priority goal within snb’s policy. since then, even turbulent phase 20th century, determination ensure monetary stability emerge guide principle national bank’s activity. in quest stability, snb strive apply rule gold standard consistently, accept federal council’s decision devalue swiss franc 1936 reluctantly, trial impose upon outside. also, switzerland find isolate second world war, snb try avoid repeat mistake make first world war aggravate already difficult situation monetary instability. preserve domestic stability maintain country’s ability meet international payment thus accord priority. after war, new order establish bretton wood conference intend ensure international monetary stability. however, goal achieved. in switzerland, disequilibrium balance bi review 71/2007 1 payment become even exaggerated, fight inflation call joint effort federal council national bank. in 1973, national bank decide stop intervene foreign exchange market float swiss franc. this measure also design safeguard monetary stability, jeopardise massive inflow speculative funds. maintain internal balance highly unstable international environment main focus monetary policy decision year followed. in switzerland, price stability ensure since 1994, ten year late also make statutory goal policy. central bank autonomy this constant pursuit monetary stability would possible national bank able act independently – essential advantage – since day founded. the principle central bank autonomy widely recognise nowadays. price stability good ensure institution responsible conduct monetary policy clear mandate act independently third-party instructions. this realisation lead many central bank grant independence last 20 years. in switzerland, debate status future national bank take place end 19th century. in 1897, project establishment state bank locate berne place direct control federal department finance adopt parliament, proponent independent note-issuing bank domicile zurich launch referendum, law reject popular vote. a compromise, legal status new central bank situate somewhere public private sector institution give two head offices, one berne one zurich. from beginning, thus occupy special place switzerland’s political landscape. this special status hardly change years. in 1930s, devaluation abandonment gold standard often result tight government control central banks, national bank act remain unchanged. likewise, end second world war, many central bank nationalised, snb remain stock company open private shareholders, maintain status day. since 1973, follow abolition fix exchange rate introduction autonomous monetary policy, circumstance principle independence implement change progressively. a grow need transparency vis-à-vis public authority emerged. this develop strategy active communication, relationship federal authority gradually institutionalised. nowadays, transparency accountability

independence merely theoretical concept, must live constantly. very early on, national bank realise could defend autonomy strengthen confidence swiss franc adopt rule conduct. from start, strive

willingness adapt new development time again, example, switzerland reintegrate international system payment post-war period, fight speculative capital inflow 1960s, manage volatility swiss franc 1970s curb inflation late 1980s. apparent phase determination ensure monetary stability, commitment apply rule necessity take often hostile environment account. the direction always clear, many obstacle

swiss monetary policy view european central bank speech mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, occasion 100th anniversary swiss national bank, zurich, 22 june 2007. * * * madame la présidente de la confédération suisse, monsieur le président du gouvernement du liechtenstein, ministers, excellencies, dear president bank council swiss national bank, dear jean-pierre roth, dear chairman govern board swiss national bank, dear fellow governors, lady gentlemen, it immense pleasure today distinguish audience celebrate 100th anniversary foundation swiss national bank (snb). the snb especially congratulate because, spite turbulence characterise period since 1907 – two world wars, great depression, great inflation – succeed delivering, average, remarkably low inflation rate. i regard historical international perspective swiss price stability especially appropriate. a historical international perspective: low-inflation country it note that, notwithstanding great inflation episode, temporary inflationary outburst correspond two world wars, unite state correctly characterised, see long-run perspective, low-inflation country. this claim made, particular, bradford delong analysis u inflationary experience since time civil war.1historical experience suggest switzerland deserve characterisation significantly great extent. first, since 1880 swiss annual inflation been, average, 2.2%, compare 2.6% us. second, international comparison 13 oecd country since 1880, exclude computation year correspond first second world war immediate aftermath (in order avoid distortion result extraordinary turbulence associate two world wars), switzerland come top again, annual average inflation rate 1.5%. finally, focus period follow creation swiss national bank, excluding, again, year two world war immediate aftermath, switzerland, average annual inflation rate 2.1% is, together germany, best performer. switzerland’s consistent “credible currency, low-inflation” strategy clearly emerge episode reasonably characterise swiss national bank’s “finest hour”: great inflation 1970s. a point edward nelson2, “[i]n switzerland, […] debate nature inflation take place early 1970s, resolve quite rapidly favor monetary view, lead eschew non-monetary approach inflation control”. in subscribe ultimately monetary nature inflation, swiss national bank accept lesson milton friedman remarkably expose monetary history unite states3, single piece research – – contribute change policy making. and 1 see delong (2000). 2 see nelson (2007). 3 see friedman schwartz (1963). bi review 71/2007 1 indeed, emphasise robert lucas remark deliver otmar issing’s festschrift one year ago4, “[t]he first central bank deal effectively 1970s inflation bundesbank swiss national bank, mid-1970s deliberate reduction money growth rates. in october 1979 u federal reserve follow suit […].” monetary policy monetary aggregate a stress lucas, recall swiss national bank’s – bundesbank’s, well number european central banks’, include banque de france’s –acceptance, back 1970s, ultimately monetary nature inflation, use monetary mean bring control, especially important today, relevance monetary analysis monetary policy sometimes questioned. a charles goodhart sarcastically put it5 “[m]onetarism, guises, become somewhat unfashionable; new keynesian three-equation synthesis […] ride high. […] deviate this, member in crowd.” the reason role monetary aggregate monetary policy analysis today question well known. on conceptual front, ascendancy neo-wicksellian theory6 assign monetary aggregate purely residual role. at practical level, breakdown, several countries, empirical relationship money growth inflation, lead former governor bank canada, gerald bouey, famously quip “ we didn’t abandon monetary aggregates, abandon us”. i three comment this. first, empirical evidence7 show – since first half nineteenth century, number country – fluctuation trend money growth almost always lead fluctuation trend inflation, upswings downswing trend money growth followed, year later, upswings downswing trend inflation. the crucial point stress resilience lead trend money growth trend inflation time, across radically different monetary regimes, clearly suggest lead structural feature economy – is, embed structure system invariant occasional change monetary regimes. this empirical find represent bedrock fact model – include build new-keynesian synthesis principle – confront seek reproduce. since, last two centuries, fluctuation trend money growth almost always follow fluctuation trend inflation direction, upswing trend money growth point existence upward medium long term risk inflation profile. in light evidence come last two century data, totally ignore trend movement money growth would therefore entail – view – excessive unreasonable risks. the practice snb – ecb – closely monitor monetary trend order identify long-term risk price stability therefore validate monetary history last 200 years. second, recently stressed, particular, philippe hildebrand central bank conference ecb8, prolong period low stable inflation – like oecd country experience several year – give rise distortion empirical analyses, make extremely difficult correctly ass informational content specific indicator future inflation. to put differently, equilibrium central bank successful keep inflation low within narrow range, empirical relationship inflation indicator tend disappear. this precisely experience great inflation – regard ultimate off-equilibrium event – important. that persistent prolong deviation equilibrium revealed, fundamental sense, authentic nature reality, today, stable, low-inflation world, become difficult extract data. and so, way experience 4 see lucas (2006). 5 see goodhart (2006). 6 exemplify work michael woodford. 7 see benati (2007). 8 see hildebrand (2006). 2 bi review 71/2007 weimar republic hyperinflation key “founding memory” bundesbank, dramatic experience revolutionary “assignats” banque de france,9 experience great inflation regard today’s central bank cornerstone institutional architecture. indeed, point vice chairman federal reserve,10 “[g]reater support independent central bank […] one result lesson great inflation 1970s.” third, important note link money growth inflation blur systematic fluctuation velocity money. recent work carry swiss national bank11 show that, control systematic shift equilibrium component money velocity cause fisherian movement opportunity cost money, long-run relationship money growth subsequent inflation still data, euro area, also unite states, stability relationship strongly question past. this find suggest monetary indicator hastily discard link inflation appear weakened. rather, suggest monetary data subject thorough broad-based analysis, order filter noise fully understand movement trend velocity distort low-frequency signal long-term risk price stability. the new swiss monetary policy concept: ecb perspective from 1974 end century, swiss national bank consistently pursue strategy target monetary aggregates, announce target first m1, then, 1980, monetary base. (only brief period 1978-1979 snb abandon monetary target favour exchange rate target.) owe increase instability monetary base second half 1990s, however, snb decided, end 1999, announce new monetary policy framework. the new framework base three key elements: • an explicit definition price stability “[…] express term headline cpi. [the snb] define price stability manner european central bank, [as] cpi inflation rate le 2 per cent per year.”12 • an inflation forecast main communication tool order explain public rationale behind monetary policy decisions. • from operational point view, range three-month libor rate way actually implement policy decision practice. i find time time statement suggest that, new monetary policy strategy, snb essentially renounce monetarist past. i believe position incorrect, follow i make two main points. first, i stress significant element continuity pre-2000 monetary policy strategy. second, i argue that, one look carefully details, monetary policy strategy swiss national bank is, many respects, quite close european central bank. let elaborate point turn. a stress snb staff members13, snb “[…] retain important ingredient monetary target new monetary policy concept. at various occasions, snb stress continue monitor two set indicator provide lead information future price development […]. the first set indicator useful forecast short-run price developments, i.e. horizon one half two years. it include various indicator cyclical state economy, notably output gap supply demand condition labour market, well real exchange rate swiss franc. the second set 9 for analysis revolutionary experience ‘assignats’, see sargent velde (1995, section iv, ‘rise fall assignat’). 10 see kohn (2005). 11 see reynard (2006). 12 see jordan, peyrignet rich (2000). 13 see jordan, peyrignet rich (2000). bi review 71/2007 3 indicator comprise monetary aggregates, provide useful lead information long-run price developments.” the element continuity pre-2000 strategy emerge quite clearly, particular form important role assign deep analysis monetary aggregates. the justification closely monitor monetary aggregates, components, counterparts, give european central bank, namely information content comprehend regard inflation long run, document switzerland euro area. precisely long-run link inflation, previously mention lead trend money growth trend inflation, strong upward trend money growth point existence upward risk profile trend inflation. when ecb start raise rate december 2005, example, monetary analysis, close monitor trend number money supply indicators, play crucial role, highlight risk inflation profile not, time, immediately apparent economic analysis. a “financial times”14 recently point out, decision raise rates, time “controversial”, been, 18 month later, “vindicated” subsequent events. the snb’s differentiation two group indicator variable – one hand, short medium-run indicators, range statistic including, prominently, inflation itself; hand, monetary indicators, mostly relevant long horizon – clearly reminiscent ecb’s “two-pillar” strategy. and research undertake snb15 indeed show dichotomy provide good characterisation short-term medium long-run inflation dynamic switzerland euro area. a important element common snb ecb neither central bank adjust policy mechanically react deviation inflation forecast respective definition price stability. rather, central bank focus low-frequency – is, trend – movement variable interest, will see shock buffet economy occasionally medium-run perspective overall macroeconomic circumstance require it. there are, course, also difference monetary policy strategy ecb snb. for example, i already mentioned, snb monetary information take account construction inflation forecast, ecb result monetary analysis use govern council cross-check – basis expand range monetary tool – signal come economic analysis. in sense, snb delegate “cross-checking” activity projection process, whereas ecb assign responsibility govern council, projection process run course independently. at point, cross-check output come model formal frameworks, often within variety non-nested alternatives. we adopt something similar friend alan greenspan would call bayesian approach policy alan blind would describe rough approximation optimal information processing: “use wide variety models, don’t ever trust one much.”16i view difference minor. our two central bank conduct similar exercise robust policy-making within share framework common principles: clear definition price stability, medium-term policy orientation, important role assign monetary indicator assessment longer-term risk price stability. conclusion permettez-moi en conclusion, cher jean-pierre, cher président, de souligner trois points. d’abord, il est particulièrement émouvant pour l’ancien gouverneur de la banque de france que je suis, d’être à zurich. nous avions célébré le 200ième anniversaire de la banque de france, il 7 ans, en rendant un vibrant hommage à un citoyen suisse. la banque de france été créée par 14 see “under fire, target”, ralph atkins lionel barber, “financial times”, 18 may 2007, page 9. 15 see assenmacher-wesche gerlach (2006a, 2006b). 16 see blind (1998, page 12). 4 bi review 71/2007 napoléon en 1800 sur une proposition du financier jean-frédéric perregaux, qui en été ensuite le responsable. monsieur perregaux était l’un de ce financier suisses, à la fois très imaginatifs, très sage et très prudents, dont la réputation est légendaire à travers le siècles. anschließend möchte ich hervorheben, wie vorbildlich die beziehungen sind, die alle zentralbanken d welt mit d schweiz sowie d schweizerischen nationalbank unterhalten. die offenheit d snb und ihre aktive beteiligung geldpolitischen fragestellungen und d geldpolitischen forschung auf europäischer und international ebene werden sehr geschätzt. jean-pierre roth, dem wir unsere regelmäßigen zusammenkünfte basel zu verdanken haben, leistet al präsident de verwaltungsrats d bank für internationalen zahlungsausgleich hervorragende arbeit. ihm möchte ich heute meine besondere anerkennung aussprechen. finally, let particularly emphasise price stability necessary condition sustainable growth sustainable job creation. i make point recently several time since creation euro 1st january 1999, first eight years, 12 million job create euro area. i underline could compare le 3 million eight year euro. i also stress current level unemployment, 7.1%, low 25 years. can i also stress switzerland sound wise monetary policy swiss central bank level price stability attain throughout last hundred year one major cause full employment success country. i thank attention. reference assenmacher-wesche, katrin, gerlach, stefan (2006a), “interpreting euro area inflation high low frequencies”, bi work paper no 195, february 2006 assenmacher-wesche, katrin, gerlach, stefan (2006b), “money growth, output gap inflation low high frequency: spectral estimate switzerland”, swiss national bank work paper 2006/5 benati, luca (2007), “long-run evidence money growth inflation”, european central bank, mimeo blinder, alan (1998), “central bank theory practice”, cambridge, mass. the mit press delong, bradford j.

system remark mr tiff macklem, deputy governor bank canada, winnipeg cfa society, winnipeg, manitoba, 21 june 2007. * * * good afternoon. it's pleasure winnipeg, honour join celebrate cfa institute's sixtieth anniversary. today long day year. but i want feel long, i'll get right point. i'd like discus two aspect global integration – affect economy, underscore need sound monetary framework, home internationally. now, manitoba – right middle vast country – might seem odd place talk globalization. but province, like rest canada, much affect global economic forces. some business – particularly manufacture sector – face fierce competition new supplier emerge asia. other business benefit strong foreign demand high price commodities. most manitoba's export go unite states, might tempt think really matter north american demand. but price many manitoba's export – commodity manufacture good – set world markets, thus influence demand for, production of, good asian emerging-market economies. so, manitoba, canada whole, much part integrate world economy. i'll start highlight two key development global economy describe they're affect manitoba canada. then i'll discus monetary policy help canada weather, indeed profit from, change global economy. i'll wrap return international stage suggest that, increasingly integrate world economy, great stake sound international monetary system. development global economy a trade barrier come down, cost transportation communication diminished, international trade grow live standard improved. since 1970, trade share gdp rise 25 per cent almost 45 per cent industrialize countries. over time period, trade emerging-market economy increase le 15 per cent gdp roughly 60 per cent. much recent growth trade come large emerging-market economies, china india, integrate world economy. with integration come significant increase global demand commodities, well rapid growth production manufacture good asia. that bring first global development i'd like mention – mark rise price commodity relative manufacture goods. in past five years, energy price rise 150 per cent, non-energy commodity price increase 80 per cent. over time period, price nickel – manitoba's big commodity export – rise 500 per cent, price copper increase 300 per cent. at time, price many manufacture consumer goods, clothing, computers, entertainment equipment, household appliance decrease many countries. in canada, price durable semi-durable manufacture goods, exclude automobiles, decline 1 2 per cent per year, average, past five year (although recently, price semi-durable good strengthened). give endowment natural resources, canada benefit greatly strong commodity prices. but, clearly, new competition china emerge asian economy pose tough challenge canadian manufacturers. global integration also affect international save investment flows. indeed, past dozen years, sometimes call "financial openness" increase significantly. since 1995, stock cross-border investment advance country grow 40 per bi review 71/2007 1 cent gdp 120 per cent gdp, emerge market see similar increase, albeit low base. this lead second development i want highlight. in recent years, desire global save appear increase relative desire global investment, make credit abundant relatively cheap. federal reserve chairman ben bernanke call global "saving glut." the international monetary fund emphasize weakness global investment relative global growth. but whether high save low investment, net effect large pool internationally mobile capital search seemingly scarce investment opportunities, put downward pressure long-term interest rates. a investor search high returns, risk spread narrowed, interest alternative investment innovative investment vehicle expanded. while several reason abundance global credit, global integration almost certainly important part story. save rate asia relatively high exceed region's investment needs. in addition, sharp rise price oil recent years, number major oil-exporting country see large increase save outstrip growth investment demand. with integration economy world markets, investor seek international diversification, new pool capital inject global financial system. how canada faring? how development affect canadian economy? i'll discus reverse order. the implication abundant global credit readily apparent. long-term interest rate canada low. even back-up yield recent weeks, yield 30-year government canada bond remain well 5 per cent. the canadian stock market buoyant, risk spread corporate debt near historical lows. household credit money growth strong, cross-border investment flow accelerated. the rise price commodity relative manufacture good reinforce many effects. since canada net exporter commodity net importer manufacture goods, rise commodity price make canada wealthy nation. the increase value canada's natural resource endowment show high domestic stock market price increase cross-border investment flows. it also major factor support robust consumption investment growth canada. and course show high canadian dollar. in past five years, canadian dollar gain 45 per cent u.s. dollar. this appreciation since 2002 reflect combination factors, important significant increase commodity prices. the implication rise relative price commodity economic adjustment, i mean reallocation labour capital weak sector strong sectors. the manufacture sector, face high cost energy inputs, new source competition asia, strong canadian dollar, go difficult adjustment. our survey suggest manufacturer respond challenge make change way business. part adjustment involve reduce employment. in past three years, employment manufacture decline 250,000 jobs. at time, primary service sector expand capacity employment response strong demand. over past three years, employment sector increase 900,000 jobs, offset reduction manufacture employment. of course, adjustment affect part country way. growth output, employment, income fast western canada. nevertheless, growth canada broad based. strength domestic demand support solid growth output employment right across country. manitoba middle canada way one. it well-diversified economy closely resemble structure canadian economy. and past three years, gdp manitoba grow average 2.8 per cent, close national average. 2 bi review 71/2007 economic adjustment always difficult, necessary put capital labour work needed. this, turn, help support rise live standard canadians. the main point canadian economy adjust – continue adjust – take advantage opportunity integrate global economy. now let turn role play monetary policy. the role monetary policy the bank canada act direct bank "promote economic financial welfare canada." what we've learn experience best contribution monetary policy make canada's economic financial welfare maintain low, stable, predictable inflation. since 1991, canada's monetary policy framework consist two main element – inflation target flexible exchange rate. this framework allow canada pursue independent monetary policy – policy suit circumstances. the two main element work together reinforce other. the result low stable inflation, le volatility output employment. let elaborate elements. first, inflation target. since 1995, target inflation 2 per cent midpoint 1 3 per cent inflation-control range. to keep inflation 2 per cent, bank try keep balance overall demand supply good service canadian economy. when overall demand supply balance, economy operate full potential, inflation stable. inflation control contribute good economic performance several ways, let highlight two particularly relevant current context. first, inflation low stable, relative price signal clear readily apparent, help business household make sound economic decisions. second, meet inflation target help anchor inflation expectation target which, turn, help keep inflation low economy stable. in 1970s, last time canada experience commodity boom scale recent experience, monetary policy fail anchor inflation expectations. so, sharply high oil price push inflation up, worker firm extrapolate high inflation forward, price wage broadly begin rise quickly. the result high variable inflation, painful economic adjustment. the element monetary policy framework flexible exchange rate. the flexible exchange rate help economy absorb shocks. just manitoba floodway absorb deluge spring flood, float dollar help economy absorb shock – especially external shock affect economy differently major trade partners. the flexible exchange rate also support economic adjustment much easy change relative price canadian good service come movement exchange rate require domestic price wage adjust. now, i say inflation target flexible exchange rate work together promote economic well-being. what mean concrete term relative price change without spill generalize inflation, economy operate close potential. this mean labour capital allocate efficiently, resource move contract sector put work expand sectors. and that's we've see canada. with unemployment 33-year low, clear canada go difficult process adjustment considerable success. our job bank canada continue aim 2 per cent inflation price change, clearly relative price changes, longer-run inflation expectation remain anchor 2 per cent target. to summarize, monetary policy framework serve u well maintain domestic environment growth stability. together domestic policies, help canada adjust significant change global economy. but sound domestic policy sufficient eliminate spillover effect decision event side world. and, global integration create new opportunities, also pose certain risks. in particular, country fail pursue sound policies, could see abrupt change global financial conditions, harmful spillover effect canada elsewhere. it possibility point need global table country come together take bi review 71/2007 3 account economic financial interdependence. a stable global economy everyone's interest. the international dimension this international monetary fund (imf) fit in. it institution best place fulfill role. with 185 member countries, imf truly span globe. and large, well-trained professional staff, imf "human capital" analyze increasingly complex linkage among economies. the imf begin operation 60 year ago – fact, predecessor cfa institute come being. the imf's mandate promote international economic growth financial stability. this mandate remain relevant today. but great deal change since imf first open doors. the imf set oversee global monetary system era fix exchange rates. today, flexible exchange rate norm; private capital flow dwarf imf resources; financial market much sophisticate vastly interconnected; major new player integrate global economy. to effective world, imf must change way pursue mandate. recognize challenge, imf's manage director, rodrigo de rato, launch strategic review fund's role 2004. the review cover number elements. the critical decide exactly imf fulfill mandate. i focus remain comment issue. to effective much large integrate global economy, imf need become proactive institution, focus limit negative spillover prevent financial crises. and mean imf need strengthen main crisis-prevention tool – surveillance member country global economy. we need imf surveillance help member country set sound policies, provide member assurance everyone play rule game. we need imf evaluate coherence policy framework across countries, ass spillover effect one country's policy choice countries, speak country thwart adjustment economic fundamental detriment countries. and need imf effective global forum member come together address international economic financial issues. the groundwork improve surveillance laid. a announce mr. de rato three day ago montréal, fund member complete revision guide framework surveillance. this first significant revision surveillance framework 30 years, major accomplishment. the next step implement framework. this require establish periodically update clear priority responsibility surveillance. implement revise framework improve quality, candour, even-handedness imf surveillance. under revise guide framework, surveillance focus four pillar macroeconomic policy – exchange rate, monetary, fiscal, financial policy – affect external stability. in implement improve surveillance, important good integrate financial sector analysis assessment country reviews, take broader, multi-country perspective. it also important imf surveillance – see – even-handed. this mean member – fix manage exchange rate – come equally fund surveillance. improve fund surveillance apply best practice universally across membership would benefit members. conclusion i promise outset take advantage long day year. so, allow conclude three key points. first, adjust change world economy difficult, canada well profit new opportunity respond new global realities. our monetary policy framework help canadian economy absorb external shock adjust change circumstances. second, sound domestic policy central maximize benefit globalization, minimize risks. but global market grow broaden, country become 4 bi review 71/2007 interconnected, increase stake sound international monetary system, institution support it. third, finally, imf best place institution. but realize potential, need modernize way pursue mandate. a process renewal well way, important imf member seize opportunity build imf 21st century. bi review 71/2007 5 david dodge: important issue relate development international capital market remark mr david dodge, governor bank canada, government borrower forum, montréal, quebec, 15 may 2007. * * * thank you, pleasure welcome today discus important issue relate common interest development capital market throughout world. we interest see continue development international capital markets, part advancement market-based, liberalize trade financial regime. let's remember open, market-based economic system increasingly vital, world change drive development new technology mode competition; adjustment occur time. in world, price signal market help u understand adjustment need made. a liberalized, market-based regime really best find promote growth prosperity, high standard living, development domestic economy flexible enough cope shocks. there are, course, many policy need economy become flexible market-based. but today, i want particularly focus importance local-currency bond money markets. first, however, let briefly outline necessary policies. fundamentally, commitment maintain low, stable, predictable inflation crucial. in countries, commitment best support flexible exchange rate regime, facilitate adjustment inevitable shock relative prices, global trade, capital flow occur. one important policy government must fiscally responsible. this mean book must perfectly balance every year. but mean government must maintain, commit maintaining, manageable debt-to-gdp ratio, avoid run debt hobble future governments, prevent necessary adjustments. and finally, openness global trade key importance economy's growth prosperity. a great deal attention rightly pay important policies, form essential build block economy. but today, i want focus issue sound local-currency bond money markets. first, i'll talk real advantage right home come local-currency bond money markets. i'll also refer canada's history develop markets, element remain work progress. i hope experience might use authority many emerge market economies, develop local-currency markets. and effort bear fruit – outstanding stock emerge economies' local bond market exceed $4 trillion u – four-fold increase value roughly past decade. i'll also consider domestic market fit into, part stabilizing, global financial structure. now, personal observation base 40 year experience public finance, see two perspectives: central banker, that, federal finance department official. over years, i've come appreciate sound local-currency government bond market help three distinct policy fronts. first discipline impose term macroeconomic policies. second, support economic financial efficiency. and third, help development stable financial system. let deal point turn. in term macroeconomic policy, government must build credibility citizen first all. citizen need comfort government bond hold keep value; government default obligations, resort large tax increase inflation ease real burden repayment. this initial hurdle build credibility difficult get over, many emerge market attest today. but hurdle cleared, well-functioning, local-currency government bond market bring incentive authority keep place sound policy i mention introduction. those policy include monetary policy aim maintain low, stable, predictable inflation, lead environment low interest rate – nominal real – low debt service cost future. they also include bi review 69/2007 1 prudent fiscal policies, reinforce public confidence government and, turn, domestic markets. of course, none suggest government borrow must denominate local currency. there time government borrow foreign currency, perhaps project support future flow foreign currency can, turn, help repay borrowing. the real risk come government find repeatedly borrow foreign currencies, finance current domestic spending. let mention canada's history develop local-currency bond money markets, parallel situation many emerge market economy find themselves. in 1950s, canada relatively small, open economy rely heavily foreign trade, dramatically influence fluctuation commodity prices, long history foreign capital inflow finance major projects. the bank canada's primary emphasis time development government treasury bill market, assist effective implementation transmission monetary policy. in addition, finance department, central bank fiscal agent, want promote development well-functioning government bond market. this would help provide government low-cost stable financing. moreover, canada also move float exchange rate, even important debt issue domestic currency. but authority also saw financial system efficiency benefit could flow development well-functioning government bond market. in particular, would support development of, access to, market-based credit firms. the broad goal develop foundation efficient domestic fixed-income market private issuers. of course, market continually evolving, frequent consultation market participants. these consultation lead development well-functioning liquid market government debt right across yield curve. this market provide price benchmark fixed-income instrument derivatives, thus facilitate market access firm seek debt financing. so learn years? well, experience show order maintain efficient, well-functioning local-currency debt market, helpful focus key aspect liquidity, transparency, regularity, integrity structure government bond money markets. a such, efficient government debt market contribute overall capital market efficiency provide key benchmark hedge tools. now, term financial system stability, development domestic bond money market lead strong sound financial institutions. strong institution complete market facilitate good allocation domestic savings. this increase domestic investment, thus, encourage strong economic growth. create local-currency bond money market insulate economy global economic shock two ways. first, provide stable secure source liquidity. and second, perhaps important, allow good match currency obligation currency receipts. in addition contribute stable domestic financial system, development domestic-currency market important promote global financial stability. economy sound financial system help prevent shock spread around world. the asian financial crisis 1997-98 really help illustrate crisis spread among economy weak financial systems, including, cases, serious mismatch foreign currency asset liabilities. this policy-makers around world put lot emphasis improve domestic bank financial systems. to develop sound financial system require several policy steps. the bi committee global financial system outline five key measure need develop deep liquid bond markets. allow list them. first, economy must competitive market structure; second, must liquid, benchmark bond issues; third, market must efficient, low transaction costs; fourth, market safe, sound robust; finally, important wide variety market participants. i see program issue talk detail late afternoon. 2 bi review 69/2007 lady gentlemen, i speak local-currency bond money market help economy, give authority incentive follow good macroeconomic policies, support financial economic efficiency. and, i've talk market help development sound domestic financial system. this, turn, promote financial stability, within country broadly, global financial system. at start conference like this, i think important use time remind need strong, local-currency bond money markets. speak generally, step canada take past develop local-currency bond money market may applicable today's world, various emerge market economy try find path. but certain original principle guide u create market – liquidity, transparency, regularity, integrity – valid today 50 year ago. bi review 69/2007 3 timothy f geithner: reflection asian financial crisis remark mr timothy f geithner, president chief executive officer federal reserve bank new york, trend asian financial sector conference, federal reserve bank san francisco, san francisco, 20 june 2007. * * * it pleasure san francisco feed join look back asian financial crises. many people room play critical role drama time. we always completely agree, usually find way work together common strategy. the crisis hit remarkable speed force, substantial effect world economy whole. the collapse confidence lead substantial sustain outflow capital, force large exchange rate devaluations, sharp fall asset price leave entire bank system virtually insolvent. gdp fell 10 15 percent. the crisis force substantial change imf’s instrument crisis resolution major international effort strengthen financial systems. even decade, crisis subject debate controversy. for many, represent failure financial globalization, dramatic demonstration peril openness capital flows. a popular perception economy strong record growth financial management force position vulnerability externally impose program capital-account liberalization push turmoil unstable, even predatory international financial system. adherent view tend view policy response crisis harsh inept both. time take edge criticisms, still affect political debate region today. they reflect anxiety balance risk benefit economic financial integration still play important role shape economic policy, even substantial progress achieve since crises. i want outline principal lesson period, term reduce vulnerability financial crisis term strategy crisis resolution. i offer knowledge hard anyone finance minister central bank governor region time understand like. a one involve shape international response, i say lot fully appreciate dynamic crisis then, justify humility today think lesson future. with qualifications, think four important issues: • role balance sheet problem create vulnerability crisis, • challenge design appropriate exchange rate regime monetary policy framework emerge market economies, • condition deal progressively great openness capital flows, • role policy reform financial assistance crisis resolution. currency mismatch balance sheet problem in general, crisis consequence fundamental economic problems, often manifest buildup substantial balance sheet problems, excessive short-term borrow foreign currency sovereign, bank system, both. in asia, accumulation short-term debt concentrate bank system. bank borrow dollar yen large scale lend fund corporation earn revenue domestic currency. this create mismatch currency denomisnation banks’ liability assets. and mismatch create acute vulnerability exchange rate risk. the rapid increase foreign currency exposure encourage fix exchange rate regimes, since create illusion protection exchange rate risk. it encourage tax incentive favor short-term foreign currency borrow offshore bank centers. it feed selective liberalization capital control foreign borrowing, limitation equity inflow leave place. it exacerbate classic moral hazard – result past government bi review 69/2007 1 intervention limit corporate bank failures. and make bad poor disclosure, mask scale increase external liability deterioration level official reserves. the scale buildup foreign currency debt fundamental dynamic crises. once confidence weakened, fix exchange rate commitment become unsustainable, economy experience sharp reversal capital flow resident nonresident seek limit exposure domestic institution assets. this broad flight domestic asset create condition similar classic bank run. the exchange rate decline magnify concern potential loss corporate sector bank system, lead shift asset country, exacerbate exchange rate decline. these balance sheet vulnerability lead vicious cycle exchange rate financial weakness reinforce other. a economy slip toward edge cliff, policymakers leave alarmingly option try contain crisis mitigate damage inflict real economy. give real interest rate already negative, relax monetary policy risk accentuate exchange rate decline, would, turn, exacerbate problem bank system. but demand already free fall, policymakers equally reluctant tighten policy risk damage growth. fiscal position asia far weak initially appear enormous contingent liability government face result collapse bank systems. this limit room countercyclical fiscal policy, although government move eventually put place modest fiscal stimulus. this diagnosis financial vulnerability lead substantial improvement quality national balance sheet region. more later. exchange rate regime peril middle a second, closely relate lesson, relate exchange rate regime. in crisis countries, exchange rate regime choice fix adjustable peg. this soft currency board – possibility adjustment build arrangement, present commitment fix nominal exchange rate indefinite period time. although regime limit exchange rate flexibility regard mean achieve economic stability, fact turn source instability. nominal exchange rate dollar hold fix time, real effective exchange rate appreciate significantly. because weakness financial system, investment boom previous decade translate increase productivity. a investor grow concern potential weakness, pressure exchange rate intensify become unsustainable. exchange rate intervention prove ineffective. once confidence shattered, market respond brutal speed force. monetary authority without record institutional independence without sufficiently clear mandate price stability experience credibility need restore confidence quickly. the crisis help bring fundamental reassessment merit fix adjustable exchange rate regimes, regime try exist somewhere middle opposite extreme irrevocably fix purely floating. the new consensus, see policy choice across emerge markets, soft middle fundamentally untenable economy open cross-border capital flows. with limit exception case full monetary union currency board optimal, fix exchange rate provide nominal anchor disinflation strategy, general view flexible exchange rate regime make sense emerge market economies. exchange rate flexibility offer advantage allow monetary policy direct sustain price stability, turn offer good prospect sustain growth. change fundamental factor productivity growth inevitable shock demand supply require change relative prices, domestically internationally. a flexible exchange rate make easy relative price move rapidly effectively appropriate direction generally eas cost adjustment. 2 bi review 69/2007 regional economic integration increase rapidly asia recent years, economy still seem long way point economic political condition would make compel case kind regional monetary integration. (in europe, course, political case monetary integration largely precede economic argument.) for asian economies, emerge economy today, principal challenge establish condition enable prosper world exchange rate adjust freely change fundamentals. capital-account liberalization a third important conclusion crisis relate strategy capital-account liberalization. although conventional wisdom time, i think evidence support view policy mistake contribute crisis lay decision become open capital flows, government choose become open. the supervisory regulatory regime financial system provide strong enough framework incentive risk management control financial intermediaries. but consequential mistake crisis economy different way choose liberalize capital control selectively. each place incentive distortion lead excessive reliance short-term borrow bank system. these weakness leave financial system economy whole le capacity manage great pressure risk come openness capital flows. the policy consensus emerge experience cautious view benefit financial integration, great awareness damage cause create incentive distort composition flow great appreciation importance place strong set institutions, financial system particular. it also foster great skepticism within government ability sustain adjust set limit control capital flows, economy pass certain point relative openness. money tend move around control progressive ease, become difficult time counteract force acceptable cost objectives. for basic reason, many emerge market government early proponent selective control move eliminate them. face challenge manage policy increasingly integrate world economy, dominant instinct official often try shield economy volatility. but crisis 1990s help demonstrate approach futile counterproductive. a economy become open capital flows, policy design insulate economy external shocks, whether fix exchange rate regime selective capital control restriction international transactions, rarely offer durable stability, bring additional risks. these risk come form additional distortion might undermine future growth magnify vulnerability future financial volatility. the promise approach invest complement institution policy enable economy live comfortably openness. focus measure enable economy flexible adapt quickly change ultimately effective policy strategy. it politically difficult, economically effective solution seem offer protection competition volatility. crisis resolution a fourth lesson, series lessons, come experience crisis resolution. the strategy adopt stabilize market foster recovery vary significantly across crisis economies. each involve somewhat different mix policy reform temporary financial assistance, tailor different condition prevailed. where success, common feature larry summer call powell doctrine apply international finance – overwhelm use force, clear strategy resolution. the “force” sense apply scale finance make available relative need quality policy measures. very substantial resource deploy support recovery efforts, large share resource make available upfront, order try mitigate liquidity problem stem loss confidence. in contrast typical imf program, government permit use bi review 69/2007 3 portion imf-supplied resource take pressure exchange rate, foreign investor seek reduce exposure crisis country initial stage crises. but provision large external financial resource not, itself, sufficient achieve stability. the critical feature every program set policy measure design address cause crisis, stabilize confidence put place condition recovery. in cases, initial policy response look tentative inadequate. in others, reform program appear broad support within government. broad political uncertainty associate pending election change leadership also undermine confidence commitment credible recovery plan. where confidence recovery plan weak, financial resource little impact market sentiment confidence faltered. even though resource look large relative past financial interventions, easily overwhelm market unimpressed policy response. ernesto zedillo explain policy challenge exceptionally well write since market tend overreact onset crisis, policy need overreact too. a classic problem financial crisis distinguish problem illiquidity insolvency. this diagnosis critical design effective response, hard do. we – case i mean imf, major creditor government region – treat case close illiquidity extreme continuum, rather insolvency extreme. in asian crisis countries, unlike russia argentina, plausible case argue sovereign government accumulate debt unable repay. a force restructure external debt country force suspension payment obligation would make crisis asia, broadly, substantially worse. these condition insolvency, purely temporary liquidity problem could address quick infusion unconditional finance without change policies. the crisis economy try strategy week case month go imf assistance. those strategy fail simply government run reserves, fail embrace broad set policy change powerful enough restore confidence future stability growth. it worth emphasize strategy ultimately adopt case quite unorthodox certainly uniform. besides novel approach adopt term scale structure finance degree international cooperation support programs, policy package also notable degree emphasis place on, example, financial-sector reform improvement disclosure. in case, reform propose result careful analysis cause individual crisis pragmatic assessment need correct condition lead problem restore confidence. and cases, strategy continually modify adjust condition change principal responsible develop good feel work not. conclusion recovery asian crisis country take time, strong rapid typical emerge market financial crises. barely 18 month crisis, example, korean gdp return pre-crisis levels, true asian crisis country 2003. growth relatively strong stable since, though pace somewhat unsustainable rate decade prior crises. the country directly affect crisis decade ago fundamentally stronger. the balance sheet weakness transform strength. financial-sector reform undertake generally impressive scale. strong legal institutional framework help create environment enterprise thriving. macroeconomic policy reasonably prudent, debt-to-gdp ratio declining. exchange rate regime become flexible. these change make economy far resilient decade ago. they much le likely face type crisis, acute, self-reinforcing panic produce balance sheet problem era. 4 bi review 69/2007 be done? of course, challenge much challenge build strong defense crisis, rather longer-term challenge build great capacity adapt change increasingly integrate rapidly evolve global economy. thank you. bi review 69/2007 5 rakesh mohan: risk management open market economy speech dr rakesh mohan, deputy governor reserve bank india, inaugural programme centre advance financial learning, mumbai, 4 june 2007. assistance k. damodaran himadri bhattacharya prepare speech gratefully acknowledged. * * * peter l. bernstein celebrate book against god writes, “the revolutionary idea define boundary modern time past mastery risk: notion future whim god men woman passive nature. until human be discover way across boundary, future mirror past murky domain oracle soothsayer hold monopoly knowledge anticipate events” (bernstein, 1996). whereas risk management characterize many activity different spheres, standard technological risk management embed almost industrial good machinery, worry climate change global warming, world finance risk management core activities. with generalize open trade capital movement across world past decade half, risk management become pervasive across whole financial sector. in close economy administer prices, fix predictable exchange rate interest rates, micro perception risk relatively benign. in conditions, effect, sovereign undertake risk management economy. a consequence rigidity embed systems, economic adjustment take place day-to-day gradual basis risk effectively accumulate discontinuous macroeconomic adjustment force system. such discontinuous adjustment involve non-marginal adjustment exchange rate, interest rates, administer price basic goods, fiscal expenditures, like. the impact individual market participant alike usually relatively traumatic, consequent economic financial crisis common. moreover, system likely suffer misallocation resources, bout price instability consequential low uncertain economic growth. the notion individual economic agent ill-equipped expose exchange rate, interest rate price risks, sovereign alone bear risk long regard tenable. it recognize system allow daily market adjustment price operate smoothly wide dispersion risk among economic agent conducive maintenance economic financial stability. however, issue economic risk disperse among sovereign, financial intermediaries, large corporations, small businesses, farmer household category economic agent still live one. it generally acknowledge regard correspondence incidence risk different agents' capacity bear it. lacklustre macroeconomic performance command economy 1970s follow decade result shift think risk, lead realization far efficient allow individual economic agent face, transfer manage risk market mechanism. the collapse bretton wood system 1971 usher era `generalized floating' exchange rate major currencies. the gradual deregulation, relaxation/abolition capital control globalization follow collapse soviet system provide backdrop also incentive risk management concept practice emerge evolve. the distinguish feature new paradigm mean risk eliminate way insurance-like product know mankind long time. the key price risk market risk products. development deep liquid market risk product – cash well derivative – boost phenomenal progress quantitative finance make possible risk management discipline profession come age. however, way look risk management mean role sovereign regulator financial markets. profound change also take place economic financial landscape india last two decade so, mark wide-ranging reform real financial sectors. adoption unify market-determined exchange rate rupee early 1993, follow current account convertibility 1994, enactment new foreign exchange law 1999, significant bi review 69/2007 1 though gradual capital account liberalization last decade lead manifold increase volume current capital account transaction india rest world. at time, deregulation interest rates, great use indirect instrument monetary policy, reduction statutory preemption resource bank pave way emergence liquid market short- long-term interest rate india. the upshot development resource allocation & use become efficient lead high growth impulses, economic agent choice make competition face, risk contend well daily basis. in words, increase opportunity economic agent accompany new type risk manage well. the broad trend mark present foreseeable future clear. economic financial engagement rest world expand several dimensions. view perspective, economic agent india able walk step counterpart competitor elsewhere. one essential requirement regard risk management system procedure well market risk management product india world class. a introduce new risk management systems, upgrade exist one develop new market risk management products, important u keep mind objective condition exist india. we need continually keep view differential risk-bearing capacity among different economic agent country. even among different financial intermediaries, let alone household farmers, coexistence small widely disperse entities, primary agriculture credit society (pacss), rural urban cooperative banks, public sector banks, new private sector banks, foreign banks, different degree sophistication relate risk management. hence, approach introduction modern risk management instrument system country has, per force, cognizant requirement capacity. risk management financial intermediary real sector entity the broad principle govern risk management entity real financial sectors. however, risk management bank financial intermediary acquire add importance three distinguish characteristics: (i) much leveraged; (ii) hold public money; (iii) payment system operate banks. in general, bank expose much credit interest rate risk, real sector entities, particularly engage international trade commodity manufacturing, process trade expose exchange rate commodity price risks. but commodity price risk borrower expose get translate credit risk lenders. risk management bank financial institution critically important “risk engines”; take risks, transform embed product services. there powerful motif bank implement risk-based practices; provide balance view risk return management point view, develop competitive advantage comply regulatory requirements. a case globally, bank india special role play promote good risk management standard practices. be chief repository credit risk, quality loan asset depend critically effective risk management policies, process procedure borrower are. among borrow client themselves, would differentiate risk-bearing expertise hence bank expect provide professional advice client risk management. thus, bank good business reason acquire specialization professional expertise risk management. this would, however, possible bank good manager risks. there another relate issue, albeit slightly deep one. in contrast capital market, bank privy much wide rich information respect clients. while comparative advantage bank intermediate financial resource hinge able enjoy economy scale scope acquire process information first place, relevant issue context whether information put optimal use manage risks, level individual bank also aggregate level. although early day ass effectiveness institutional mechanism provide credit information bureau pool 2 bi review 69/2007 critical borrower information common use within certain important safeguards, importance intensive extensive use information hardly need overemphasized. further, economy grow new type activity enterprise appear scene, would imperative bank able ass risk associate activity enterprises. a case elsewhere, also critically depend collection analysis relevant information. business approach risk management risk management integral part overall business plan management something fringe “add on”. when rbi introduce asset liability management (alm) framework 1999, view bank initially exercise find maturity mismatch re-pricing mismatches. it bank begin compile alm statement realize benefit pursue pro-active asset liability management themselves. in context transition basel ii framework india elsewhere, focus significantly risk management, perception among bank merely add compliance costs: hence, tend view compliance issue. basel ii attempt promote advance risk management systems, align regulatory capital close economic capital thus promote great efficiency use capital. it evident experience last years, witness gyration exchange rate interest rate bank good risk management policy system resilient shock volatilities, thereby create value various stakeholders. basel ii offer opportunity bank become efficient, fact accord importance regulatory requirement. whether risk management centrestage sideline business operation bank reveal price various type risks. currently, interest rate charge bank india various type loan advance vary within unusually wide range, say, 6 per cent 16 per cent, even high cases. visit banker tell range much wide observe markets. if true, case variance risk much high among indian borrower relative countries? or banks' risk appraisal technique faulty end magnify true variance risk? or case price credit scientifically link risk, lead anomalies, cross subsidization credit market? it could also proportionate cost credit appraisal vary inversely size loan, bank substitute high credit price cost credit appraisal. in context, introduction credit information bureaus, refer early may expect make material difference credit appraisal practices. mis-pricing credit risk issue, apart introduce systemic vulnerability, welfare implication small borrowers. bank access relevant credit information borrowers/ potential borrower well position use advantage discriminate various grade risk. moreover, bank well equip today re-orient rat process ass line activity counterparty, addition conventional assessment counterparty. it need emphasize context basel ii amount capital make financial institution absolutely secure. the key issue proper price risks. if purely compliance attitude take respect risk management capital adequacy, danger may lead “seat belt law” banking. a experience show many country mandatory use seat belts, become apparent soon driver prepare take risks, believe safer. proper management risk key. risk management integrate activity risk take – one need structure one’s position accord risk understand her. risk understand well avoided. stress test the corollary increase risk relate expectation great fluctuation prices, exchange rates, interest rates, need develop regular system stress testing. in fact, antidote excessive complacency result great risk-related capital adequacy use consciousness regular stress testing. globally, stress test become integral part banks’ risk management system use evaluate potential vulnerability certain unlikely plausible event movement financial variables. in background, need bank india adopt “stress tests” risk bi review 69/2007 3 management tool emphasise annual policy statement announce governor april 2006. the draft guideline issue regard give final shape basis feedback receive market participants. an efficient stress test framework necessary incorporate forward look element banks’ business strategies. bank would well approach stress test merely regulatory requirement integral part risk management process basel ii implementation. the stress test result need suitably integrate risk management processes, business strategy capital planning. just stress test important enterprise level, need upgrade stress test procedure systemic level well. in aftermath asian financial crisis, context increase discussion global financial architecture, world bank imf introduce new procedure “financial system assessment programmes” (fsaps). india one first country volunteer programme 1999. we engage update exercise, assessment programme get internalize within system. such programme also help coordinate approach think government financial sector regulators. operational risk management operational risk assume normal course business along major risk viz. credit risk market risk, normally assume independently risk-return basis. operational risk management particularly relevant banks, although able either transfer hedge portion major risk viz. credit market risk exposures, operational risk cannot hedge transferred. further, bank increasingly undertake transaction processing, asset management services, cash management services, sale sophisticate financial product generate fair amount revenue. bank also begin use model manage credit market risk expose model risks. bank increasingly use computer it large segment operations, include certain critical operations, expose significant degree operational risk. further, bank expose reputational risk considerable extent yet formally take board address risk element many banks. since operational risk change complexion due factors, bank need take comprehensive view regard wholesome picture exposure operational risk. traditionally, aspect operational risk seek minimize internal inspection audit. however, need recast modernize function transform mechanism design operate whole suite operational risk events. the issue operational risk assume high importance worldwide recent year increase prevalence outsourcing, particularly overseas. with india major recipient outsourcing, issue assume even great importance us. bank financial intermediary understand operational risk management outsource operation responsibility. this issue also give rise good deal discussion among financial regulators: extent examine risk management procedure outsource entity ass risk management procedure regulate entity relate service providers? risk management use financial derivative the implication huge expansion use financial derivative take place past five year attract increase discussion among financial sector regulators. how ass impact financial stability systemic risk? the succinct lucid discussion general issue i come across brief speech give 2 week back u counterpart, donald kohn federal reserve bank. a put eloquently, “….. (t)he securitization mortgage asset transform regulate depository institution holder interest rate risk credit risk originator distributor risk” (kohn, 2007) what situation india respect financial derivatives? 4 bi review 69/2007 use financial derivative india a liquid market forward foreign exchange contract exist india several decade now. this product still main instrument hedge foreign exchange risk india, although foreign currency option also get increasingly popular. over last 10 year so, several type derivative begin trade india. a aware, effort introduction credit derivative india. feasibility probe foreign exchange future begun. effort also appropriate design interest rate futures. in recent years, regulatory ecosystem financial derivative seek make effective straightforward. insertion new chapter iiid rbi act, 1934 way amendment 2006 milestone regard, since provide legal clarity regard otc derivative also define regulatory domain scope. account treatment financial derivative bank also streamline broadly tune international standards. what issue need concern use financial derivative increase india? we need understand that, reflect donald kohn's remark i quoted, witness significant change function financial sector intermediary time, use financial derivative gather force. we need prepare change regulatory point view financial intermediary internal risk operations. a case develop markets, growth securitization expansion credit derivatives, bank storehouse credit risk significantly abandon space, implication could financial stability. with distribution risk need address issue risk rest. we also need ass capability market participant ultimately bear risks. will regulator need regulate them? will financial regulator even need know risk distributed? one view long participant market large institutional investors, high net worth individuals, need protection. let risk distribute among wish take risk, let distribute accord capacity determine market itself. hence, need safety net like one implicitly embed lender last resort role central banks. what important market availability adequate market liquidity time operate efficiently, enable market participant take liquidate position necessary. the job regulator would ensure adequate depth markets, clear settlement system efficient safe, dominant market player move markets, player large sophisticated. in time market stress, issue would availability adequate liquidity. give extraordinary growth credit financial derivative still relatively new phenomenon, happen context accommodative monetary policy g3 country recent years, early ass market work time stress overall regulatory approach be. one positive side assessment that, unlike 1980s 1990s, financial crisis frequent develop develop country alike, past decade remarkably free crises, worldwide. high oil prices, large business failures, large stock market fluctuation witness period result financial crises, disruptive effect financial intermediaries. this attribute wide dispersion risk some, whereas others point overall benign macroeconomic healthy global growth condition prevail period. what take international development implication india? i clear answer. we need embrace financial development way continue ensure financial stability, enable domestic market participants, financial non-financial, increasingly deal kind risk emerge great market liberalization home abroad. a monetary authority financial sector regulator, need enhance risk management capacity, internal purposes, also evaluator risk management capacity regulate entities. we continuously endeavour enhance risk management skill capability market participant improve micro-infrastructure market financial stability maintained. meanwhile, need keep mind vary nature economy i allude earlier. bi review 69/2007 5 the key approach development financial derivative india proactive stance adoption robust risk management system within relevant financial intermediary and, point view, particularly banks. we ensure introduction new risk instrument actually increase risk management capability system whole, way round inadequate preparation. reflection risk management rbi the reserve bank india, like central bank also financial institution expose variety risks. over last several years, structural transformation risk exposure rbi pre-dominantly rupee-denominated asset figure balance sheet, overwhelm proportion asset denominate major foreign currencies. this transformation mean volatility asset valuation rupee term also current earn rupee terms. it need emphasize bank corporate country choose eliminate foreign currency risk, central bank like rbi, liability foreign exchange, cannot hedge exchange rate risk beyond modest extent. the approach follow rbi regard long time diversify portfolio reserves, term currency instrument strong level capitalization. the rbi also transparent disclose risk management policy annual report also half-yearly report reserve management since january 2005. in addition issue relate market risk management asset and, hence, integrity balance sheet, essential financial system whole, deal increasingly issue operational risk i outline earlier. a institution responsible payment settlement system give increase attention it systems, back up, alternative sites, like. limit risk management adoption risk management policy practice economic entity sense assume risk choice chance value enhancing. however, hedge market instrument result redistribution risks. ideally, redistribution do basis scientific appraisal optimal level combination risk entity may result overall reduction risk macro level. but economy whole would still expose risks. also, proper function hedge product essential expectation risk variable heterogeneous. if price movement unidirectional long time, protection seller demand large premium protection buyers. apart above, subtle issue concern risk management. it well-known market flagrantly violate postulate assumption traditional mathematical finance. the volatility financial price tendency volatility occur sometimes episode generally unrelated clearly exogenous news fundamental subject research long time behavioural finance. the behavioral dimension risk management hedge attract much attention recent year among academic researchers. among things, hedge decision entity influence two important factors: (a) stance competitor regard; (b) anomaly human behaviour. the latter-mentioned aspect significant: often entity always intellectual emotional impulse take risk deal impinge performance late. many feel way buy luxury car buy insurance car. when educate risk management possibilities, become aware rich potential finance improve human welfare, find emotionally easy always take advantage potential. experience trader know well difficult time quit loss-making position. the field risk management need design method minimize human weakness risk management. finally, adoption risk management use risk mitigation product make financial market safe place before? it tough call take. in recent interview, professor robert merton, along myron scholes fischer black invent famous option price formula early 1970s, reportedly said, “the real story happen ltcm 1998 6 bi review 69/2007 happen amaranth late – rather happen….institutions adjust learn deal crisis crisis more” (tett, 2007). reference bernstein, peter (1996): against gods: the remarkable story risk, hoboken, nj: john wiley. kohn, donald (2007):

bank, occasion 13th conférence de montréal, montreal, 18 june 2007. * * * lady gentlemen, thank invite 13th conference montreal host international economic forum americas. i delight speak today distinguish audience. i greatly appreciate objective organise wide-ranging open discussion major international economic issues. the theme year’s conference – succeed uncertainty: risk evaluation strategic decision – timely challenge one. we european central bank often navigate uncertainty find monetary policy strategy great help set course. one theme discuss conference programme globalisation, rightly give huge importance. i would like investigate role central bank globalise economy. first, i outline feature debate. second, i reflect integration euro area within globalise economy. third, i reflect implication globalisation central banks. 1. globalisation underlie trend globalisation encompass several phenomenon trend lead grow interdependence economy throughout world. it display effect strong increase cross-border transaction good services, capital, labour natural resources. i would add that, time, witness substantial increase cross-border exchange idea concept various institutions, organisation non-trading companies. the concept globalisation vital importance last 20 year – even last ten year – thank combination factors, include diffusion ever sophisticate affordable information communication technologies. the cost ship good fallen. economy continue open many trade financial barrier lifted. national barrier circulation goods, service production factor diminish everywhere. foreign direct investment (fdi) flow also surged, lead internationalisation production process new way business company establish affiliate abroad gain access foreign market reduce input costs. globalisation allow many emerge country enter compete world markets. in order measure phenomenon global scale, note labour force available participate globalise market probably double 1.5 billion 3 billion opening-up china, india, many formerly centrally plan economy several emerge countries. although labour mobility still limit worldwide, increase flexibility capital flow imply firm much easy access global labour supply before. a result, many industry set supply chain global scale. let provide figure document magnitude scope globalisation. global trade openness – measure world export import good service share world gdp – practically double last 20 years, 33.9% world gdp 1986 60% world gdp 2006. an increasingly decisive factor increase trade intermediate good service result rise internationalisation production processes. financial system also deeply affected. a investors’ incentive hold foreign asset portfolio possibility diversify spread financial risk globally grown, affect facet financial systems, markets, infrastructure institutions. let briefly illustrate impressive developments. the share gross international asset hold world gdp – provide measure financial openness – show eightfold increase last 25 year stand 130% world gdp. a far global capital flow concerned, noteworthy composition change significantly bi review 68/2007 1 recent years. while fdi international equity flow dominant late 1990s, international transaction mainly liquid asset rise recent years, make increase global capital movements. international risk-sharing transfer net save across country important feature process. emerge market economy gain large share global gdp. aggregate data show post net private capital flow usd 650 billion 2006 compare usd 458 billion 2005. net direct investment remain globally unchanged period, net inflow usd 267 billion 2006. portfolio investments, hand, include public sector, record high outflow 2006 usd 379 billion, compare usd 258 billion 2005, portfolio investment emerge market economy decrease slightly. on whole, emerge market economy recently provide rest world net resource correspond current account surpluses. the main driver limit domestic absorptive capacity underdevelop domestic financial systems. globalisation foster economic prosperity raise live standard various channels. there strong international competition great transfer technology knowledge. this promote productivity gain global economic growth. high efficiency help low cost firm price tradables. the availability new product variety increasing. resource allocate profitable activity across world, new possibility diversify share risk globally. also, scrutiny international investor serf discipline device, enhance quality domestic economic policy thus contribute improve economic fundamentals. however, globalisation also present challenge pose risks. the ever close global integration surge capital mobility render international financial system expose change investor sentiment. furthermore, international trade financial link might intensify transmission shock one country another amplify cross-border spillover. we forget that, year ago, number financial crisis pose major threat international financial system, include asian crisis start 1997 russian crisis 1998. each crisis different international community manage resolve successfully. each crisis illustrate need adequate investment institution human capital strengthen economic governance. i come back impact major financial crisis central bank third reflection. past crisis illustrate vulnerability global economic financial system remind u importance always alert never complacent. 2. the integration euro area within globalise economy my second reflection economic financial link euro area rest world. i argue integration within europe go hand-in-hand integration europe within global economy. in trade terms, example, euro area open vis-à-vis rest world; open unite state japan. extra-euro area export good service account around 20% euro area gdp, roughly share extra-euro area imports. this substantially high unite states, export good service represent 10% gdp import 16%, well japan, total export amount 15% gdp import 13.4%. moreover, particularly noteworthy euro area increase trade rest world even great increase exchange within euro area. what even remarkable, perhaps, euro area financially open unite state japan. let present four observations. the first observation external asset liability euro area, percentage gdp, large account around 124% 137%, respectively. by comparison, unite states, correspond figure substantially lower: 90% gdp asset 110% liabilities. in japan, foreign financial asset likewise significantly low euro area (94% gdp 2005), difference even great liabilities, represent 60% gdp, i.e. le half correspond figure euro area. this highlight euro area outward-looking. my second observation euro probably contribute financial open euro area. on asset side, stock euro area asset hold abroad increase le 87% gdp 1999 to, mentioned, 124% 2005. on liability side, increase also substantial, around 92% 137%. the rise actually much le pronounce 2 bi review 68/2007 unite states: u asset grow 80% gdp 1999 90% today, u liability increase 91% 110% gdp. in words, euro area witness substantial increase since start economic monetary union. my third observation euro area attractive place fdi. a breakdown reveal inward fdi amount 27% euro area gdp, 22.5% unite states. the euro area seem received, proportionally gdp, similar amount fdi china – 27.3% economy – accord imf statistics. in net terms, stock direct investment abroad slightly high fdi within euro area (30.4% 27.3%, respectively). my fourth observation concern bilateral fdi linkage euro area. base available data, worth note stock euro area fdi abroad mostly hold mature economies: nearly 21% unite states, 24% unite kingdom, 9% switzerland, 2.5% 3% sweden, canada japan. likewise, liability side, unite kingdom unite state account large share asset side (nearly 40% 23.5%, respectively). i also stress amount euro area fdi

the implication globalisation central bank my third reflection implication globalisation central bank two principal functions, i.e. set monetary policy help secure financial stability. globalisation monetary policy. the issue impact observe month historic episode accelerate globalisation inflation important much debated. economic theory numerous channel globalisation influence level prices, influence one-directional. i already mention basic phenomenon increase pool labour available world economy widespread opening-up emerge economy former centrally plan economies. the phenomenon exert pressure, particular, slight rise cost labour, especially unskilled labour. in general manner, tend modify significantly previous balance capital labour global level. globalisation also exert pressure conducive price stability strengthen global competition, reduce ability firm fix price exert pressure unit production cost industrialise countries. a third influence, keep previous two points, globalisation also exert positive effect productivity global productive sector facilitating, accelerating, phenomenon restructure optimisation division labour wide cross-border context. but would naive think effect globalisation inflation go one direction only. indeed, sudden emergence fast-growing economy global economy exert upward pressure price mine product fossil fuels. this phenomenon particularly visible since 2003. the phenomenon rise price observable certain area agricultural production. the attainment considerably high live standard new numerous middle class translate major change eat habit and, result, meat, cereal fresh produce sector world economy. bi review 68/2007 3 since theoretical influence globalisation say price numerous work different directions, might perhaps natural suppose globalisation, continuous phenomenon medium-term effects, translate substantial change relative price – price manufacture fall oil, gas certain commodity rise – without general level price significantly affected. empirical research allow conjecture either irrefutably confirm disprove recent period. all all, available data indeed confirm price manufacture import euro area end-2006 still 2001 level. although import price raw material rise strongly since 2003, say that, period, acceleration import price overall, product take together, moderate grow proportion euro area import come country low production cost (countries eastern europe asia, particularly china). it remain phenomenon globalisation acceleration since mid-1990s coincide decline global inflation volatility. concomitantly consequence stabilisation inflation low level, also see low volatility macroeconomic variables. but would wrong conclude correlation globalisation low inflation demonstrate causal relationship. indeed several factor – independent globalisation – identify help explain good results. i see least four. in first place, rapid progress science technology, particular information communication technology – lead significant productivity gain coincide globalisation and, moreover, one underlie causes. in second place, structural reform introduce industrialise world begin 1980s gradually increase throughout economies. these structural reforms, like spread technological progress, help increase growth potential economy thus facilitate price stability. in third place, great budgetary discipline recently characterise economy follow previous period poor fiscal management. and finally, monetary policy pursue central bank enhance credibility. i would particularly like stress last point. whatever influence exert context globalisation, basic principle allow anchor monetary policy remains: long run, inflation monetary phenomenon. a consequence, globalisation affect central role override responsibility central bank preserve price stability. in short term, central bank must continue anchor inflation expectation level consistent central bank’s definition price stability. let illustrate mean example. let’s take significant increase energy price last years. i assume central bank credibly commit maintain stable price fully unequivocally trust public policy-makers. the corporate sector, us energy input production processes, observe significant sharp rise price oil. since credible commitment price stability medium term inflation expectation well anchor low levels, entrepreneur easily understand relative price energy rising, aggregate price level may increase much. therefore, incentive fully pas increase input price consumer reduce because, did, competitiveness could significantly eroded, especially increasingly competitive global environment. hence, example, credibility central bank clearly reduce second-round inflationary effect minimise macroeconomic fluctuation output inflation. now let turn role central bank mitigate risk financial stability stem globalisation. widespread interlink financial system create global financial system become real, significant entity global level. this affect financial stability assessment perform central bank two ways. • the first way call grow global focus financial stability analysis. for instance, euro area, complete comprehensive view key source risk vulnerability face financial system cannot form without take due account wide global imbalance concern excess global liquidity. 4 bi review 68/2007 • the second way call enhance cross-border cooperation exchange information among central bank (and authority contribute financial stability). this produce comprehensive picture risk vulnerability identify appropriate effective mitigate policy actions. in european union goal pursue mainly activity economic financial committee financial stability table set-up, comprise representative ministry finance, central bank supervisory committee banking, security insurance, well escb/eurosystem. at level g-10, goal pursue financial stability forum sectoral committees. the globalisation financial system also affect role central bank design financial regulation supervision. this role play central bank either direct supervisory responsibility act advisory capacity governments. in general, financial globalisation call intensification effort among regulator cross-border basis produce consistent regulatory supervisory standards. the aim promote level playing-field reduce regulatory arbitrage. this clearly illustrate experience european union establishment single financial market main strategic objective presuppose removal potential regulatory supervisory barriers. the eu experience also show usefulness proceed step process convergence focus first regulatory requirement subsequently supervisory standard practices. in context, i would like offer three considerations: • first, area clearly identify previously important regulator major financial system deepen strengthen dialogue global level. therefore, initiative european commission extend traditional regulatory dialogue unite state major countries, include china japan, support particular. • second, see increase number new area need consistent approach global level become apparent. financial institution high leverage good example here. on basis mandate give informally g8, financial stability forum play continue play crucial role develop recommendation global level target regulators, counterparties leverage fund investor funds. the institution encourage develop, voluntarily responsibility, principle best practice (“benchmarks”), term transparency towards counterparties investors, term optimal management risks. credit derivative market could also mention another area require consistent approach global level. • third, general terms, still great deal progress make harmonise effective supervisory practice international level. this particularly paradoxical regard banks, since basel committee old advance term ensure uniform principle concept prudential supervision define global level. however, give diversity practices, significant harmonisation effort still necessary currently make basel committee’s accord implementation group (aig), mandate work practical implementation issue achieve convergence bank supervision practice international level. 4. conclusion i would like conclude draw particular attention follow five points: first, let u never forget scientific technological progress much root globalisation. there would low-cost, instantaneous transmission information, concept service global level without new information communication technologies. there would extremely rapid expansion international trade good without technological progress sea air transport. second, science technology root current globalisation, could trend lasts, also strengthens. there indication scientific technological progress tend slow down. in fact, opposite case. bi review 68/2007 5 third, rapid growth see global level, highly significant transformation cause effect growth level economies, rapid change respective economic weight various continent structure global economy combine consequence make prediction base past regularity le reliable. consequently, uncertainty tend increase economic financial risk weak weak probability, strong destabilise potential, appear inevitable, fact, “normal” counterpart unprecedented period economic prosperity. now time complacent. fourth, ever period accelerate globalisation, central bank credibility essential anchor solidly inflation expectation form solid base monetary financial stability brilliant, mobile international economy uncertainty risk cannot ignored. fifth finally, crucial deepen strengthen global governance exploit full possibility offer formal informal institution exist consolidate global financial stability, unify principle concept prudential supervision regulation, also achieve real unification, result global level practical implementation regulation supervision. lady gentlemen, thank

integration among different segment financial sector. the traditional boundary bank non-bank financial institution erode witness growth universal bank and/or merger among different segment sectors. this trend benefit associate risk well. supervisor face dual challenge. on one hand, supervisor promote financial diversification consolidation achieve market development innovation. on hand, supervisor position recognize new dimension type risk encourage appropriate risk mitigation. these consideration trigger world wide debate effectively supervise different segment financial sector conglomerate universal structure. so far debate concentrate around conventional bank widely grip world islamic finance (if). strong inter-dependencies among different segment if emerge largely islamic financial institution (ifis), principle, feature inherent characteristic compulsion, conventional banking, conform universal bank evolve inter-linkages among different market segments. ii. factor drive cross-sector linkage interdependency first foremost, ifis’ depositors/borrowers desire conduct financial transaction shariah compliant. it assume person prefer bank islamic bank also seek use faith-based financial service takaful islamic mutual funds. this faith-driven feature force incentivizes ifis offer, along side bank-based service (i.e. deposit loans), wide range financial services. a result, islamic bank end undertake non-core bank activity fund management, capital market operations, securitization, leasing, house finance. this enhance degree integration various segment if. for example: islamic bank likely strongly integrate shariah capital market since credit portfolio side, islamic bank investment avenue available conventional counterparts. the outcome islamic bank either end take large exposure capital market directly acquire subsidiary primarily engage businesses. second differentiate aspect nature contractual arrangement drive deposit mobilize conventional bank compare islamic banks. conventional bank deposit interest base contract guarantee interest return whereas islamic bank raise deposit profit loss share basis either mudaraba musharaka structure. mudaraba/musharaka contract transform islamic banks’ deposit essentially fund management product (although currently regulator recognize equivalent conventional deposit contracts) impact correspond asset portfolio. there need therefore islamic bank acquire asset pls basis well eventually move beyond fix return products, like murabaha ijara. this push islamic bank towards universal bank since order manage portfolio profitability; need invest across sector business base shariah principles, like equity sukuks capital market trade contract like commodity murabaha, musharaka, ijara takaful. thirdly, development islamic bank depend concurrent development islamic capital market. for instance, development islamic debt market key provision adequate liquidity support provide additional investment avenues. likewise, takaful development critical provide insurance coverage islamic bank products, like auto consumer financing, strengthen secondary capital islamic bond market major buyer islamic instruments. it confluence factor induce regulator encourage ifs promote rapid deep financial inter-linkages integration. bi review 68/2007 1 iii. supervisory challenge pose cross-sector development it consideration augment strategic alliance linkage various type among ifis, within country cross borders. a such, ifis evolve either part global financial concern domestic bank acquire establish subsidiary and/or two arms, i.e. islamic conventional bank coexist. moreover, conventional part financial institution move towards cross-sector integration, islamic counterpart (either specialize window independent entities) also follow eventually. while well establish significant benefit enhance integration inter-linkages conglomeration if, economy scale, operational synergy effective use scarce human resource, definitely certain risks.1 in area, i would like offer basic observations. firstly, inevitable enhance exposure islamic bank capital market expose volatility associate businesses. likewise, conglomeration, whether universal bank parent subsidiary model,2 expose variety issue contagion risk, regulatory arbitrage, high group exposures, conflict interest etc. these risk apply equally islamic conventional mode finance. however, islamic bank thus far erect firewalls, like conventional banks, separate legally, financially managerially investment commercial bank activities. obviously risk pose challenge supervisor necessitate appropriate change make supervisory regime. secondly, shariah compliance issue necessitate take align view across if business user islamic product may oblivious ideological difference well vary perception interpretation shariah advisor board and/or regulators. since institution supervise one regulatory authority may offer product institution supervise different regulatory body, could introduce complication challenge ensure uniform shariah compliance across financial institution products. thirdly, traditionally different segment regulate specialize supervisory authorities. these authority adopt risk management principle supervisory stance strictly line risk profile supervise sector isolation. with sector integration, supervisor coordinate closely policy formulation regulation well on-site supervision. they coordinate creation necessary firewalls, remove moral hazard govern degree cross segment exposure. this may even call institutional restructure merge various supervisory body single entity close coordination supervisor creation third coordinate body. iv. sector inter-linkages pakistan’s islamic finance system in pakistan, besides offer trade loans, like murabaha, islamic bank offer equity quasi equity products, musharaka diminish musharaka, investment bank activity loan syndication, structure finance, etc. the six full fledge islamic bank network 108 branch another 58 stand alone islamic branch 13 conventional bank register phenomenal growth april 2007, islamic bank sector constitute 3.3% total bank assets.3 in view equity base nature islamic bank lack shariah compliant financial instruments, central bank allow islamic bank relatively high exposure (35% direct 10% future equity) capital market compare conventional bank (20% direct 10% future). in addition, state bank pakistan (sbp) relax statutory reserve requirement (slr) islamic bank 8% versus industry norm 18%. 1 financial sector regulation: issue gaps, imf 2004. 2 universal banks: first structure universal bank, financial operation conduct within single corporate entity. the second model parent-subsidiary operate subsidiary model, operation conduct regulate subsidiary another financial institution, usually (but necessarily) bank. finally, hold company model activity conduct legally distinct entities, separate management capital own single financial sometimes (unregulated) non-financial institution. 3 see annex a detail product wise share bank. 2 bi review 68/2007 furthermore, islamic bank allow nurture parent-subsidiary/affiliate model whereby islamic bank large set asset management companies, brokerage firm and, now, takaful businesses. thus far supervision ifis bifurcated, islamic bank regulate sbp non-bank ifis, namely, modarabas, islamic mutual funds, takaful company security operation regulatory oversight security exchange commission pakistan (secp). sector specific supervisory approach also characterize vary regulatory requirement vis-à-vis operational matters, governance framework shariah compliance across range ifis. the difference extend minimum capital requirement range rs6 billion islamic bank (by year 2009), rs500 million family takaful operator (by year 2011), rs300 million general takaful operator (by year 2011) rs30 million islamic fund manager rs2.5 million modaraba management companies. the low capital base financial institutions, engage business takaful fund management, pose significant risk solvency financial conglomerate characterize islamic financial markets. in term financial reporting, takaful company require circulate quarterly account among shareholder whereas islamic financial institution require term legal regulatory framework. the segregate supervisory approach result carve legal framework specific sector conventional bank ifis4 eventually need address idiosyncratic nature if industry, product market players. moreover, regard if, regulator follow different approach towards shariah compliance institution regulate them. sbp require islamic bank appoint shariah advisor accord prescribe fit proper criterion shariah board constitute level sbp deal issue relate shariah interpretation compliance among islamic banks. secp’s approach vary across different segment if. a religious board, constitute government, responsible approve prospectus modaraba contain type business conducted, management, etc. while religious board significant role, requirement modarabas management company appoint shariah adviser individual fund level. islamic mutual fund takaful operators, hand, require appoint shariah council/boards explicit fit proper criterion lay secp regard. secp also authorize appoint central shariah board takaful rules, 2005, establish yet. the great challenge result different shariah compliance practice follow islamic banks, modarabas, takaful companies, etc. reputational risk face ifis misperceptions mind public shariah compliance. this issue, therefore, need address coordination amongst supervisors. another issue arise overlap supervisory jurisdiction. the bank company ordinance allow bank act modaraba management company floatation modarabas. in term modaraba company ordinance, modarabas form conduct type business, permit shariah, trading, manufacturing, airline, financing, leasing, services, etc. regulate secp. due overlap regulatory jurisdictions, bank float modarabas separate subsidiaries,5 result high administrative, set regulatory costs. for sometime (from 1991-1997), modarabas regulatory control sbp, power relate licensing, wind up, etc. retain secp; consequently regulatory authority revert secp. again, highlight need cross sector regulation ifis. eventually need develop mechanism oversight financial sector integrate manner. besides coordination cooperation among regulators, need consolidate supervision framework financial institutions, guideline consolidate public financial statement application regulatory prudential limit group wide basis coordination examine intra group linkage industrial commercial entities. while conventional islamic financial industry would adopt similar approach integrate supervision, recognize 4 fund management, use here, refer management islamic mutual fund modarabas. 5 a number bank form subsidiary float modarabas like nbp, hbl, abl, habib metropolitan bank, etc. no islamic bank yet float modaraba. bi review 68/2007 3 latter relatively nascent industry hence target modify match grind realities. v. conclusion ifsb’s ten year roadmap highlight cross sector nature ifis resultant need supervision evolve accordingly. it recognition factor ifsb seek broaden membership security insurance supervisory authority full member ifsb. ifsb’s effort develop islamic regulation well accounting, audit governance standard facilitate adoption unify principle development, operation regulation islamic financial services. 4 bi review 68/2007 philipp hildebrand: current state financial system switzerland introductory remark mr philipp hildebrand, vice-chairman govern board swiss national bank, half-yearly medium news conference, berne, 14 june 2007. * * * i would like use today’s publication financial stability report opportunity share think current situation financial system. i start important message – swiss bank sector financial system general good shape moment. base analysis, outlook future also essentially positive. a state report, favourable situation swiss bank sector come real surprise. development economy financial market recent year positive, switzerland abroad. although economic growth strong, practically impact inflation date. the credit stand borrower remain high. in addition, despite repeated, significant short-term price correction – case last week – stock market rise sharply overall environment low volatility. how positive development explained? and risk involve – particular stability swiss financial sector? the good performance solely attributable favourable economic situation. structural aspect also play role. with i mean first foremost increase level efficiency achieve financial system past years. this rise efficiency ascribe innovativeness financial markets. new financial instruments, credit derivatives, enable bank separate credit risk transfer either completely partially. this facilitate good distribution credit risk financial system mean risk bear want able bear it. the improve efficiency result reduction finance cost company households. low finance cost help economy stock market achieve great growth. the increase efficiency also appear improve ability global financial market absorb shocks. the downgrade general motors’ credit rat 2005, instance, major loss suffer hedge fund amaranth last year last impact stock credit markets. all all, global financial market currently good able absorb shocks, least small medium-sized ones. accordingly, serious turbulence financial system seem le likely today. from financial stability perspective, positive development indeed. however, great stability financial markets, great risk appetite market participant tend be. this turn increase likelihood crisis and, event one occurring, extent damage. the great concentration interconnectedness global financial system may also increase magnitude potential crisis. the great risk tolerance market player ultimately logical consequence exceptionally long stable period calm financial markets. market participant reason late keep risk-taking check. basically, anyone hold back felt miss opportunity generate high returns. even short-term correction financial market february year may previous year result change attitude regard. on contrary, low impact make correction ability market absorb may serve confirmation operate high-risk strategy continue, indication risk-averse take great risks. the risk appetite also fairly high swiss bank sector present. in financial stability report, indicate instance domestically orient bank – raiffeisen, cantonal regional bank – currently incur relatively high interest rate risk. at time, big bank also exhibit increase risk tolerance recent years. although credit suisse group’s overall risk decline past year, follow sale winterthur, big bank significantly increase risk-taking bank business; particularly exposure trade foreign lend business. a result, trade book virtually double since 2003 bi review 67/2007 1 clearly excess chf 1,000 billion. this account roughly two-thirds asset manage entire hedge fund industry. the fact market participant take risk stable environment problem. what important correctly ass ability bear risk able handle poor conditions. drive 120 km/h along empty motorway good weather condition generally dangerous experience driver. it different story, however, visibility poor traffic heavy. if speed adjust accordingly, chance accident increase. drive fast become dangerous speed long line driver’s capability external conditions. use analogy, current situation global financial market swiss bank sector compare? a already mentioned, overall impression moment drive quite fast. unlike motorway, however, three reason difficult judge speed high market participant would able slow time condition deteriorate. firstly, clear fast car going, rather, much risk enter into. this apply le regulate player financial system, hedge funds, also certain extent banks. for instance, rat agency moody’s come conclusion report1 publish last year bank generally disclose risk sufficiently. in financial stability report, also point would beneficial swiss bank provide data regard. by provide comprehensive data, bank would help investor authority good ass risk bank take. bank should, example, publish result stress tests. similar crash tests, stress test examine severely bank would affect major crisis. secondly, difficult ass traffic would react poor weather conditions. even though brake distance relatively short dry surface, mean guarantee car react way wet even icy road. a number instrument currently use financial system yet prove worth extreme stress situations. it therefore clear whether risk new complex product adequately assessed. these product typically assess central market, use complex models. in words, analysis mark-to-market one, mark-to-model one. the reliability mark-to-model approach, however, rely heavily assumption availability reliable data. data tail event (events occur rarely, major repercussions) would particularly beneficial calibration models. there is, however, definition hardly data events. this beg question whether danger associate tail event correctly assess use available models, whether model risk pose problem. thirdly, unclear whether finance industry’s capital buff – form equity capital – adequate weather particularly bad storms. like airbags car, equity capital rarely call action. yet, serious accident, generously bag fill air. in current economic environment, many market participant highly leveraged, words, low ratio debt equity capital. low level equity capital compare thin airbag – protect moderate shocks. it would take loss 2–3% balance sheet total, instance, swiss big bank use equity capital. of course, loss magnitude highly unlikely. after all, swiss big bank well-diversified, sophisticate risk management model place high risk-weighted capital ratios. this notwithstanding, loss cannot rule out. in fact, represent classic tail event: loss kind highly unlikely, yet would dire consequences, particularly stability entire swiss bank sector. in view aforementioned uncertainty connection risk assessment, would justify aim create somewhat “well-padded” cushion security, even equity capital – like airbags – come price? finally, i would like point central bank know good bank market form major crisis could hit financial markets. in principle, believe likelihood severe disruption financial system actually decline result innovation financial markets. at time, repercussion crisis – one occur 1 risk disclosure bank security firms, moody’s investor services, may 2006. 2 bi review 67/2007 – could particularly severe give current situation. with mind, i feel important market participant – include swiss bank – increasingly take tail event consideration assessments. stress test especially suitable regard. in financial stability report, also underline importance stress testing. this call intensification cooperation authority big bank enhance transparency comparability evaluate resilience swiss big banks. within context cooperation, also ensure cost/benefit ratio exercise remain adequate. bi review 67/2007 3 miguel fernández ordóñez: overview spanish economy 2006 address mr miguel fernández ordóñez, governor bank spain, govern council bank spain occasion presentation annual report 2006, madrid, 14 june 2007. * * * lady gentlemen, in 2006 behaviour world economy european economy particular provide highly favourable set continuation spanish economy’s 13-year-long expansion. the world economy grow 5.4% last year, even high rate previous two years, dynamic three-year period growth 30 years. the strong increase oil price first half year le expansionary stance macroeconomic policy check dynamism, moreover compatible containment inflation rate worldwide favourable financial market performance. the geographical distribution growth balance favourable spanish economy. the notable recovery euro area, along economic firm japan, offset slowdown unite states. the contribution emerge economy global expansion, china india fore growth around 10%, remain key factor. latin america also grow satisfactorily inflation fell all-time lows, backdrop generally prudent macroeconomic policy contribute reduction region’s financial vulnerability. however, meagre progress structural reform unorthodox direction take countries’ economic policy may curtail future growth possibilities. in short run world economy expect continue post high growth, unless u slowdown become acute rest world unable continue grow steam. further ahead, continuity high rate expansion world economy uncertain. the increase efficiency productivity gain bring globalisation, great trade integration far-reaching reallocation resource factors, might begin weaken. in setting, emergence protectionist tendency – manifest difficulty move doha round forward – add risk continue high growth. inflation remain contain worldwide. the grow integration emerge economy global economy, provide abundant low-cost labour, couple heighten competition world market technological innovation allow price increase moderate significantly. the anchor inflation expectations, credibility acquire central bank effort preserve price stability contributed, headway programme structural reform increase flexibility economy likewise ease inflationary pressures. all development help contain upward pressure stem impulse domestic demand make task monetary policy easier. in 2006, strength economic growth progressively alert emergence inflationary pressures, monetary policy stance become le expansionary virtually economies, develop emerge alike, inflation rate hold low level overall, without substantial passthrough high energy price core inflation discernible. yet reduction spare capacity labour market tighten heighten inflationary pressure many economies, oil price rise cannot rule out. moreover, business cycle matures, task monetary policymakers may become difficult, especially certain central bank like federal reserve square inflationary risk stem economic slowdown. the euro area a already stated, euro area economy finally manage emerge phase low growth experience recent years. gdp area grow rate 2.9% 2006, almost double previous year high rate since 2000. for year whole, inflation, measure rate increase hicp, stand 2005 2.2%, much influence course year oil price movements. core inflation move mildly upwards year, perhaps reflect bi review 67/2007 1 minor indirect effect rise energy price background strengthen activity employment. nonetheless, notable wage moderation far, perhaps response great labour market flexibility grow competitive pressure worldwide. but remain see wage react face buoyant domestic demand. throughout 2006 stance demand-side policy consistent pick-up private agents’ spending. however, monetary policy realm, strength recovery warrant gradual adjustment monetary condition european central bank. follow rise official interest rate december 2005, ecb continue 2006 progressively withdraw stimulus provide recent year light observe risk price stability medium term. turn budgetary policies, improvement business cycle contribute decisively tax revenue grow substantially forecast 2006 euro area budget deficit decline almost 1 pp. give persistence high deficit many countries, paramount importance harness opportunity provide current boom complete ongoing restructure public finance push measure boost productivity employment generation. precisely latter area, year 2006 saw progress – albeit uneven across country economic policy area – application structural reform agenda. undoubtedly, favourable performance 2006 term employment growth activity largely result course business cycle. but seem likely also incipient positive effect stem structural reform already implemented, may responsible high rate job creation phase recovery rise productivity. that would show effort heighten incentive labour market participation, market liberalisation create environment conducive innovation development human capital ultimately bear fruit, highlight need sufficient political resolve persevere course action embark upon. at end first half 2007, outlook euro area bright recent years. for one thing, domestic demand expect retain current momentum. investment particular continue benefit persistence propitious financial conditions, strength corporate earn soundness companies’ financial position, household expenditure continue expand thank favourable employment developments. for another, export expect continue fare favourably despite likely ease world growth. this central scenario face downside risk bigger-than-expected slowdown world economy. but, contrast, good performance european labour market might raise forecast growth rates. the inflation outlook 2007 2008 suggest rate change hicp hold around 2%, line definition price stability. however, cannot rule strength activity lead high wage demand great price-setting autonomy part companies. add upside risk inflation possibility fresh oil price increases. in expect set robust economic activity, wage moderation remain essential ingredient contain inflationary expectations, would help prolong upturn. in open month 2007, ecb continue closely monitor risk and, general, economic development area, ensure inflation expectation remain line definition medium-term price stability. the spanish economy a indicated, spanish economy continue long upturn last year, move mildly accelerate path throughout year. it post year-on-year rate 4% 2006 q4, 4.1% q1 year. the buoyancy activity prove great forecast early 2006. the recovery euro area boost exports, follow sluggishness previous years, especially 2005, supplement main factor underpin expansion economy. there re-balancing 2006 relative contribution domestic expenditure net export gdp growth, follow three year progressive divergence two components. overall, contribution net external demand improved, despite net borrow nation increase more, 7.8% gdp. within domestic demand, consumption slow slightly 2006 construction begin show sign decelerate q4, trend run early 2007. however, investment capital good undergo significant increase hold year date. 2 bi review 67/2007 behind development spanish economy, along improve external environment, continue influence favourable factor underpin dynamism throughout cyclical upturn. first, impulse stem spanish economy’s integration euro area. that act powerful spur demand, result effect confidence expectation and, naturally, expansionary financial condition continue prevail 2006, despite change stance single monetary policy date back close month previous year. further, factor provide growth supply side, include particularly grow demographic boost spanish economy past decade, contributing, among many aspects, generate substantial expansion spanish economy’s growth capacity. finally, importance reform initiative recent decade cannot ignored, promote market flexibility dynamism among agent institutions. and pivotal recent macroeconomic financial policies, guarantee stability. all factor act simultaneously, mutually reinforce one another way difficult assign specific weight them. let refer first demographic impulse, particular attention devote annual report present today. migrant flows, draw substantial constant expansion demand, turn key factor supply dynamics. this rise immigrant population increase economy’s productive capacity mean incorporation abundant labour resources, time contribute sustain domestic spend growth. the report highlight fact contribution immigration income generation great arise mere increase population, also help raise per caput income. the report also indicate effect expenditure side seem help galvanise investment that, labour market, introduce element wage flexibility boost mobility. furthermore, dynamic effect immigration bolster impact grow participation woman labour market. with regard demand-side impulses, stress economic buoyancy continue underpin monetary financial condition which, despite gradual normalisation course last year 2007 date, remain loose spanish economy. although cost bank credit household firm fixed-income security issue rise single monetary policy adopt neutral stance, cost reach level which, historical perspective, classify moderate. in event, somewhat le generous finance condition prevail recent period exceptionally low interest rate good suit circumstance spanish economy. consequently, provide relief follow lengthy phase high demand pressure, help make growth pattern healthier. the strength demand meet favourable element supply-side response. all productive branch contribute positively expansion output, though mention make continue momentum construction notable dynamism manufacture branches, closely link recovery european economies. it worth note spanish economy’s continue high employment-generating capacity, 2006 early 2007, since feature play key role continuity long expansionary cycle. the strong growth employment 2006, rate 3% year average, contribute decisively sustain domestic spending. and also enable grow incorporation population (particularly female population) labour market compatible cut unemployment rate, stand 8.5% average 2006, low level since late 1970s practically par euro area average rate. the behaviour employment denote change depth spanish labour market, mark fall structural unemployment rate, may interpret increase scope available generate employment without wage pressure arising. the counterpart employment-intensive growth pattern modest increase actual productivity. it difficult offer accurate diagnosis reason this, give difficulty measure estimate productivity presence significant structural changes, composition effect arise concentration growth sector relatively le dynamic productivity-wise. but possibly reflect shortcoming quality factor production characteristic business sector. bi review 67/2007 3 that said, responsiveness supply prove sufficient counter pressure expenditure price formation. on one hand, compensation per employee quicken somewhat 2006, less extent wage settlements, result change composition factor boost labour market flexibility i refer earlier. on other, climate buoyant sales, widen business margin continued, albeit less rate previous years. all factors, combine rise oil price first half year, mean inflation rise 2006 inflation differential euro area stand 1.4 pp. inflation begin perform favourably close month 2006, trend run 2007, relate differential cut 0.5 pp. foreseeably, inflation dynamic remain place several months. but forget improvement temporary component, link path oil prices, core inflation remain 2.5%, despite continue restraint import prices. price cost increase 2006 outpace competitors, prolong deteriorate trend index measure relative price costs. insofar difference warrant quality improvements, trend index reflect loss competitiveness, whose adverse consequence growth become patent domestic demand move back onto normal footing. the outlook spanish economy point continuation main feature recently observed, namely: restructure spending, thank gradual ease domestic demand, particularly consumption residential investment, improvement contribution net external demand. the confirmation trend would allow projection forward economic dynamism somewhat moderate rates, line growth potential. for occur, however, progress slow spend household corporate debt, improve economy’s supply-side conditions, needed. we must forget long expansionary phase spanish economy accompany buildup certain imbalance pose considerable risk sustainability. thus, sufficiently corrected, avoid complacency. admittedly, recent month see slow growth household debt gradual slowdown house prices, inflation differential euro area narrowed. but important process continue head risk banco de españa warn about. economic policymakers major responsibility take advantage current economic prosperity adopt, preventive basis, measure require harness exist opportunity mitigate risk may arise. the change single monetary policy stance date back late 2005 contribute gradually normalise financial condition household firm take spend decisions, although monetary condition still accommodative spanish economy. turn fiscal policy, buoyant revenue, continue systematically grow budget, provide improvement program objectives. achieve fiscal surplus expansionary phases, establish new budgetary stability laws, prof suitable ease demand pressures, also retain sufficient room manoeuvre face potential deviation scenario economic dynamism and, naturally, restructure public finance order absorb future consequence population ageing. this is, unquestionably, main challenge public finance medium term. the agreement reach last year toledo pact also address goal ensure sustainability pension system, although measure adopt still limit scope. it recalled, however, high growth public revenue difficult-to-estimate temporary component link part strength real estate sector. accordingly, budgetary consolidation may require additional effort control primary spending. the collaboration regional local government vital connection, responsible major spend component public investment, health education. this consolidation strategy should, moreover, compatible improvement quality public finances, since essential raise incentive help overcome shortfall education, innovation productivity. but part monetary union, valuable economic policy instrument is, experience indicates, deepen reform order increase responsiveness supply adaptability business productive sector major change economy undergoing, globalisation population growth. 4 bi review 67/2007 specifically, dynamism flexibility inject labour market aforementioned phenomenon immigration grow female participation need accompany development appropriate institutional framework, without forgo unquestionable achievement good industrial relations. despite progress achieve labour market reform recent years, need remain good tailor collective bargain arrangement different industry- firm-level requirement reduce cost associate permanent contracts. these measure complement

some liberalise measure detail national reform programme that, irrespective need design new measures, would advisable apply programme resolutely. also, advantage take transposition service directive define straightforward competitive regulatory framework activities. education, innovation, market liberalisation and, broadly, reform gear increase productivity utmost importance look ahead long term. in recent year welfare spanish citizen increase thank good use labour factor. this worth celebrate since long time spanish economy’s main problem fact persistently high unemployment rate. but draw close success area (the long-term unemployment rate around 2%), difficult obtain additional welfare gain result increase employment rate. before late, realise productivity main source welfare long run, policy promote therefore decisive shape future spanish economy. the financial system the behaviour spanish household corporation 2006 pose fresh challenge financial system. give public private investment continue increase, net borrow economy rise 6.5% 7.8% gdp. but more, household corporate purchase financial asset inside outside spain increased, result gross finance require set agent climb 35.6% 44.7% gdp. indeed, although household consumption post somewhat low growth rate 2005, disposable income moderate even more, household save proportion household disposable income continue falling. give investment house continue increase high rate, household net borrow rise 1.5% gdp. nonetheless, change interest rate property price level begin temper demand housing, volume transaction ease slowdown prices. yet significant underpinnings dynamism house demand medium long run remain result socio-demographic factor – thrust immigration, grow incorporation woman labour market reduction average family size – continue translate substantial increase number households. these socio-demographic factors, present final stage previous upturn market, allow activity stabilise, occasion, high level case then. in new set le relax financial conditions, spanish household begin resort le credit mean finance expenditure. but slowdown still modest, affect house purchase loan suffice curb rise trend sector’s debt/income ratio. the associate interest burden also increased, boost rise interest rates. thus, although headway spanish household adapt spend save pattern progressive withdrawal monetary stimulus, still limited. in corporate realm, however, presence factor mean increase interest rate scarcely affect corporate investment debt. a early stated, investment capital good bi review 67/2007 5 become dynamic expenditure component 2006, owe principally two factors: pressure exert demand degree capacity utilisation, draw close historical high; sound result post company along favourable outlook. the buoyancy investment duly reflect sector’s debt ratios. these increase again, fuel bank lend growth rate around 30%. significantly, however, sizeable portion fund raise earmark finance spanish institutions’ participation various merger acquisitions. these m&a operation show renew vigour 2006 spain also worldwide. a case households, simultaneous increase liability relate borrow cost translate increase interest burden bear corporations. foreseeably, ongoing moderate rise interest rate ultimately emit timely signal company adjust investment business expansion project real future earn possibilities. in way financial risk might jeopardise continuity investment lessened. the financial institution country benefit exceptionally benign environment, macroeconomic financial market terms. specifically, balance sheet income statement spanish credit institution notably sound, return equity great previous year also far relate risk-free assets. their roe stand around level 20%, 3 bp 2005, spread 16% long-term government bond yields. these trend similar observe major international institutions, show sound level return equity along wide spread government bond yields. yet situation lead complacency. on contrary, precisely favourable circumstance financial institutions, reflect level profitability solvency, allow u discus freely risk uncertainty must face come years. financial innovation activity new market agent view positive developments. the emergence recent year new products, credit derivative cdos (collateralised debt obligations), deep market traditional products, asset-backed securities, provide financial market agent new range profit risk possibilities, allow dynamic intensive risk management, make great diffusion good diversification risk. similarly, emergence new operators, investor prepare assume new risk particularly long terms, recent year enable shock absorb market low level stress and, subsequently, low volatility. finally, regulate non-regulated financial institution alike, increasingly good risk management systems, combine supervisory regulatory model base coercive restriction provide incentive proper risk management, contribute clearly market stability. unsurprisingly, result factors, international financial system demonstrate notable stability substantial capacity absorb adverse impact level-headedly, ensure episode overreaction short-lived. however, structural improvement mask fragility inherent new complex environment. the improvement base proper risk management diversification genuine ones. but entail considerable management complexity grow involvement agent subject prudential supervisory arrangement yet try test experience manage risk assume adverse economic environments. moreover, information risk abundant, systematised, fragmentary limit depth. it therefore likely risk financial crisis future less, also possible that, crisis emerge, great intensity past. the improvement arise new product financial agent enable institution spread risk dilute impact upward revision risk premium might balance sheets. but considerable uncertainty final destination financial risk, since neither create destroyed, transform diluted. the desirable outcome would risk end new institution withstand negative return short term without close position cut back risk exposures. if ultimately pension fund go retain risk, concern voice mismatch increasingly sophisticate financial market defuse risk optimal fashion consumer whose financial knowledge evolve step market sophistication, remain root elementary financial culture. 6 bi review 67/2007 spanish credit institutions, traditional business model base long-term relationship retail customers, shelter complexity international bank active financial market deep interaction markets. but globalise world complex interrelations, long think solely national terms. and especially financial system finance ordinary activity spanish customer also fund raise european market. the grow integration single financial market see many facets. first, market segments, particular importance spanish institutions, already enjoy full integration, talk spanish environment connection meaningless. the integration interbank markets, public debt market market subordinate debt preference share issue is, quite simply, complete. in market segment high-volume business financing, equities, degree integration recent period substantial. and markets, retail banking, less degree integration compatible grow cross-border competition m&as branch subsidiaries. in addition practical importance potential impact european regulation emanate brussels spanish institutions. such regulation include notably ifrss (international financial report standards), new capital requirement directive (the basel ii directive) market financial instrument directive (mifid). on basis elements, conclusion prudential supervisor spanish credit institution cannot disregard grow practical importance european environment, preclude think strictly spanish terms. this regard diagnosis institutions, risk face medium long run, instrument mitigate risks. traditionally, spanish supervisory model able combine demand stance respect institutions’ risk incentive best-practices management. this position spanish institution among efficient profitable world, spanish economy benefit highly competitive financial system. in come year challenge successfully transmit value european context, also assimilate best international – specifically european – supervisory practices. we must allow institution harness benefit single financial market offer them. accordingly, oversee institutions, limit inevitable cost supervision entails, apply prudential policy encourage appropriate risk management, temper use restrictive coercive measure relation banks’ activities, use effective instrument obtain prudential information. the second consideration european market need european supervisor redouble effort regard mutual collaboration. indeed, must move collaboration cooperation, joint action mutual trust, wish capable properly supervise european financial market increasingly blur national boundaries. it also acknowledge build-up time new european financial regulations, even though beneficial european financial intermediary institutions, pose organisational challenge institutions. it thus surprise call brussels contain rate new regulation promulgated. all european regulator supervisors, include european commission, agree need thoroughgoing implementation approve regulations. but also agree advisability avoid new regulation come years. the banco de españa sought, far possible, limit attendant costs, whether unify account criterion report market, prudential purpose calculate tax bases, convergence criterion demand supervisors, so-called national discretion clause basel ii, circulars, i.e. specific regulation provide institution necessary legal certainty. but new financial regulation cannot dispense indefinitely, since quite possible dynamic european market integration entail need new regulation specific fields. indeed, new reform may even prove appropriate spanish institutions. for example, fragmentation deposit guarantee arrangement europe, term financing, structure organisation, might warrant new directive, turn would level play field, give great rigour spanish system. i would wish conclude consideration grow importance european component financial system without refer particular euro area financial market. indeed, financial integration even great european country make euro area: bank system draw common pool funds, bank loans, medium-term finance bi review 67/2007 7 (whether subordinate not), securitisations mortgage cover bonds. the existence integrate market euro area allow certain financial system area finance economy’s upturn fund financial system operate le pronounce cycles. this favourable development allow financial institution surplus fund earn efficient high returns, thereby sustain profitability business, provide demander fund stable finance profitable lend business. evidently, outcome euro area economy efficient use financial resources, rout towards productive activities. let analyse great detail situation spanish deposit institutions. a early stated, bank activity grow notably 2006 regard lend corporation households. this sizeable increase activity one reason behind highly favourable earn performance spanish institutions. however, activity slow future, income statement margin might suffer. in case, business, industry competitive spanish bank is, would paramount importance flexible cost structure capable adapt new scenarios. indeed, property market move onto moderate path, institution confront volume challenge, also one type business. specifically, progressively limit importance account property sector lend portfolio recent years, move towards activities. in design strategy hop easy, short-termist decisions, highly negative potential medium term, adopted. entity succumb temptation offset slowdown demand decline credit quality standards. recently, concern detect connection u mortgage market, especially relation subprime lend least creditworthy segment population. such lend unite state usually borrower poor credit history little documentation income make difficult properly ass creditworthiness. in spain, identify subprime operation individual point past fail meet credit obligations, amount extend individual would stand around 1.27% overall mortgage fund lent, compare level u subprime market around 14% mortgage loans. that say, business segment type, would small. bad debt ratio spanish mortgage market stand 0.4%, compare 4% unite states. the information available spain therefore preclude talk market type. regard bad debts, aggregate ratio sector 2006 decline trend and, event, hold minimum levels, whether analyse historical perspective comparison institution euro area countries. in words, indicator credit risk bear institution currently show sign difficulty feed industry, despite high growth doubtful asset course 2006. this high growth, however, must analyse bear mind least two considerations. first, increase doubtful asset due part strong growth activity record recent years. in expansionary set logical that, volume credit increases, volume doubtful asset afterwards increase delay even default probability hold constant. second, forget change account rule introduce banco de españa adapt international financial report standard mean doubtful asset must recognise early high proportion. that said, acknowledge low default level spanish bank system, seem clear room reduction ratio. look ahead, background slow credit growth, ratio conceivably tend rise, converge level may consider normal setting, similar prevail among european partners. moreover, past experience find various study show risk tend emerge delay relation time assumed. in event, rise doubtful asset ratio view cause alarm; rather understand another various indicator need ass institutions’ financial capacity. although deposit trend favourably 2006 previous years, institution resort security issues, subordinate finance asset securitisations meet grow demand household firm funds. go international market search fund may make spanish institution sensitive external difficulty exert additional pressure operate margins, although true resort mainly euro area markets. indeed, fact spain join area stability mean institution able finance expansionary process like one experienced. 8 bi review 67/2007 one positive aspect institution raise finance especially resort medium-term resources, stable might obtain interbank market. insofar secondary market sufficiently liquid, subordinate debt preference share issue contribute great market discipline. moreover, asset securitisations allow portion risk transfer towards investors, thereby contribute good risk management. despite challenge ahead spanish institutions, resilience heighten 2006. profit – first line defence potential problem – increase notably also sound. this reflect main income statement margin which, combine moderate growth operate expenses, contribute favourable dynamic earn last year. the return equity increase again, maintaining, early indicated, wide spread long-term government bond yields. the solvency spanish institution hold stable 2006, attendant ratio comfortably regulatory requirements. this come about, moreover, set sharp growth activity exert upward pressure capital requirements. earn 2006 solvency level thus attest sound position spanish institutions. and corroborate available market indicators, stress test conduct imf financial sector

axel a weber, president deutsche bundesbank, annual dinner german-british chamber industry & commerce, london, 14 june 2007. * * * 1 introduction dear lord mayor, my lord, minister, dear sir nigel, dear mr wood, dear mr hoppe, lady gentlemen. first all, i want thank invite annual dinner. be london always pleasure me, least i spend time visit fellow queen mary college, university london – albeit nearly 20 year ago. for me, come london therefore mean come back city i know well i happy memories. over next minutes, i shall say word germany’s economic situation european monetary policy. 2 germany’s economic situation prospect at outset, let briefly recall germany’s economy perform past quarters. in nutshell: course last year, germany increasingly begin act economic engine euro area. in 2006, german real gdp grow 3.0% calendar-adjusted terms, high rate since 2000. this development stand stark contrast 2002-2004, german economy put dismal performance overall. and, even 2005, german real gdp grow 0.9%, impressive either. but simply look annual growth rate 2005 would mean overlook positive tendency course year, quarterly gdp rate accelerating. regard current stage germany’s upswing, one thing particular worth mentioning. in comparison begin current upswing, economic expansion progress long drive mainly external demand form strong exports. in fact, business investment become main factor fuel economic growth present. strong corporate investment, addition still buoyant export demand, drive germany’s economic expansion past quarters. what observe far might call “classical pattern” german “business cycle chain”, consist three elements. - first, initial demand stimulus form strong exports. - second, result stimulus, stepping-up corporate investment. - third: increase (albeit rather slight now) private consumption. all all, germany’s economic development past six quarter exceed analysts’ forecast – include own, already high many market participants. against favourable backdrop, arise question actually main reason german economy rebound strongly, especially give weak performance begin decade. one crucial element success story wage moderation. wage moderation see result learn process set motion two factor – competitiveness problem major industrial sectors, stubbornly high rate unemployment. this process accompany enterprises’ restructure efforts, lead fall level corporate debt mark decline corporate sector’s net interest burden. bi review 66/2007 1 both factor play major part regain german industry’s price competitiveness, explain resurgence germany’s economy large extent. look future, today’s upward dynamic last nature? will germany’s economy maintain strong momentum quarter come? my answer probably “yes”. i think several reason rather optimistic. we currently experience economic upturn favourable outlook. my positive assessment base mainly three likely facts. first: the global economy remain strong growth path. accord imf estimates, 2007, global economic activity expect expand long-term average fifth year succession. german enterprise well place participate fully positive development global economy. in many countries, large demand high-quality capital goods, market segment german enterprise traditionally strongly represented. see light, export likely continue generate major stimulus upswing germany. second: with regard domestic economy, too, prospect continuation upswing promising. what particularly important business investment likely remain major factor underpin economic activity. the current high level utilisation industrial plant capacity considerable need replacement investment suggest investment still clearly up. in addition, external finance condition remain favourable. moreover, firms’ underlie sentiment also optimistic, mean recent hard data, also soft indicator “psychological factor” signal strong future capital formation. third: the mark ongoing improvement labour market situation support strengthen private consumption. this mean potential self-sustaining upswing germany. overall, german economic growth gain momentum also become broad-based recent quarters. hence, condition place upturn last considerable period time. against backdrop surprisingly, germany long see “the sick man europe” case begin decade. the uk, too, stick rather unpleasant label, even though roughly 30 year ago. during past ten years, however, uk experience sustain economic growth inflation remain largely control. mervyn king, governor bank england, frequently refer development “nice decade”, pun “nice” stand “non-inflationary consistently expansionary”. give germany’s disappoint economic performance average since mid-1990s, certainly cannot describe economic development time similar manner. while inflation contained, economic growth germany past ten year cannot portray constantly expansionary. on contrary: average, growth uk past 10 year nearly 2.8% per annum, whereas german economy grown, average, mere 1% year year. however, compare economy germany uk, two things, besides difference growth performance, particularly striking. first, past ten years, share germany’s total industry economic value add remain quite stable roughly one-quarter. in uk, contrast, total industry’s share decline one-quarter 1997 roughly 17 per cent last year, add value, especially service sector, show mark increase. deindustrialisation development reflect secular trend among develop countries. within process, development uk far much pronounce germany. second, past ten years, domestic demand uk far important driver economic growth, external demand form net export play dampen role. in germany, picture somewhat mixed. however, external demand contributed, average, much economic growth 2001 2005 domestic demand, begin set pace course last year. 2 bi review 66/2007 evidently, regard major structural feature well growth drivers, substantial difference uk germany. however, current economic performance country clearly show enhance growth job creation necessarily result one particular economic pattern. in fact, empirical evidence would seem suggest british german development yield favourable results. regardless difference mentioned, one feature common economy enjoy stability-oriented monetary policy past decade. the fact “old lady threadneedle street” – bank england – grant independence ten year ago certainly among prominent factor explain uk’s economic performance past decade. let continue brief look european monetary policy. 3 european monetary policy last week, ecb’s govern council decide raise key ecb interest rate 25 basis point 4%. this decision take view prevail upside risk price stability medium term. in brief, underlie reason decision following: incoming information repeatedly indicate euro area continue expand pace significantly fast generally expect one year ago. look medium-term future, economic outlook remain favourable, too. against backdrop supportive external internal economic conditions, recent eurosystem staff macroeconomic projection foresee average annual real gdp growth euro area range 2.3% 2.9% year, 1.8% 2.8% 2008. the risk surround favourable outlook growth broadly balance short term. over medium long term, though, balance risk remain slightly tilt downside, owe mainly external factor possibility increase oil prices, fear rise protectionist pressure, concern possible disorderly development wake global imbalances. regard price developments, inflation (as measure hicp) 1.9% may. accord eurosystem staff projections, average hicp inflation expect around 2%, precisely 1.8% 2.2%, year 1.4% 2.6% next year. the risk outlook price stability predominantly upside, mainly due increase capacity utilisation euro area gradually improve labour markets. this implies, instance, price power market segment low competition may increase wage development might strong expected. with respect oil prices, too, still possibility increases. in addition, vigorous expansion money credit aggregate environment already ample liquidity clearly amplify exist upside risk price stability. against backdrop positive economic environment euro area, monetary policy stance still accommodative side far restrictive. give inflation project remain stability threshold, remain commit counter risk price stability medium term order solidly anchor inflation expectation level consistent definition price stability. when govern council begin increase key interest rate december 2005, widespread criticism. the main argument put forward critic time govern council take due account economic environment, rate hike therefore come early. since then, however, critic admit decision, although heavily criticise time, warranted. this important implications: view, start increase key interest rate december 2005, would “fallen behind curve”. in case, monetary policy run risk lose control inflation expectations, firmly anchor level consistent price stability monetary policy credibly commit price stability target. bi review 66/2007 3 our experience since december 2005 underscore monetary policy conduct forward-looking manner and, turn, must wait risk price stability materialise. metaphorically speaking, stability-oriented monetary policy cannot conduct look rear view mirror. look side window, rely primarily current observation growth inflation, sufficient either, since today’s inflation cannot influence current monetary policy decisions, owe long variable lag monetary policy transmission. thus, viable option monetary policy act forward-looking manner order ensure price stability medium term. let sum up: monetary policy euro area necessary maintain price stability thus contribute support sustainable economic growth job creation euro area. germany’s economy back track outlook germany euro area medium-term future remain favourable. dinner speaker exhaust topic, audience. therefore: thank attention. 4 bi review 66/2007 rakesh mohan: capital account liberalisation conduct monetary policy – indian experience paper dr rakesh mohan, deputy governor reserve bank india, present international monetary seminar globalisation, inflation financial markets, organise bank france, paris, 14 june 2007. assistance sanjay hansda, indranil bhattacharyya, partha ray m.d. patra prepare paper gratefully acknowledged. * * * i. overall approach the distinguish feature overall reform process initiate early 1990s accomplishment high economic growth environment macro economic financial stability. in fact, achieve acceleration growth maintain price financial stability. during period, apart reforms, achieve current account convertibility, also open capital account substantial extent. with grow openness, insulate exogenous shocks. these shocks, global well domestic, include series financial crisis asia, brazil, russia mexico, 1990s event 9/11 terrorist attack us, border tensions, sanction impose aftermath nuclear tests, political uncertainties, change government, current oil shock. nonetheless, stability could maintain financial markets. indeed, inflation contain since late-1990s average around five per cent, distinctly low around seven eight per cent per annum previous four decades. simultaneously, health financial sector record significant improvement. the story indian reform well-documented (e.g., ahluwalia, 2002); nevertheless, le appreciate india achieve acceleration growth maintain price financial stability. with increase deregulation financial market increase integration global economy, 1990s turbulent global financial markets: 63 country suffer systemic bank crisis decade, much high 45 1980s. among country experience crises, direct cost reconstruct financial system typically high: example, recapitalisation bank cost 55 per cent gdp argentina, 42 per cent thailand, 35 per cent korea 10 per cent turkey. there high indirect cost lose opportunity slow economic growth addition (mckinsey & co., 2005). it therefore particularly noteworthy india could pursue process financial deregulation open economy without suffer financial crisis turbulent period world financial markets. the cost recapitalisation public sector bank le 1 per cent gdp therefore low comparison. whereas legitimately gratify record, need focus new issue need address next phase financial development, particularly context full capital account convertibility increase integration financial markets. that current annual gdp growth around 8.5 9 per cent achieve india level gross domestic investment range 30 33 per cent past 4 year suggest economy function quite efficiently. thus policy gradual sequence reform cannot say cost growth efficiency. we need ensure maintain level efficiency attempt improve further. a indian economy continue growth path attempt accelerate it, new demand place financial system. in examine conduct monetary policy india presence continue gradual capital account liberalisation, key lesson process view context overall reform process. a economy undergo transition close open economy, first current account capital account, interest financial stability serve simultaneous action number different fronts. the framework monetary policy undergo change previous direct method control monetary aggregate indirect method impart signal market. for change effective monetary policy transmission process strengthen development financial markets, build market micro-infrastructure. on external front, transition fix peg exchange rate market determine one need careful assessment efficiency foreign exchange market, capability market player evaluation effect exchange rate bi review 66/2007 1 volatility. the operation financial market degree vulnerability economy become expose great open influence significantly fiscal conditions. hence efficacy monetary policy, efficiency financial markets, external vulnerability closely link practice prudent fiscal policy. finally, efficient monetary policy transmission, depth, liquidity efficiency financial markets, financial intermediary strengthened. it view inter-linkages i choose provide brief overview development area evolve past decade half india. ii. process set monetary policy objective general objective traditionally, central bank pursue twin objective price stability growth employment. in pursue basic objectives, central bank also need keep view consideration orderly financial market financial stability. needle say, objective monetary policy interrelate trade-off well. the preamble reserve bank india act, 1934 set bank’s objective "to regulate issue bank note keep reserve view secure monetary stability india generally operate currency credit system country advantage". although explicit mandate price stability, current trend many countries, objective monetary policy india evolve maintain price stability ensure adequate flow credit productive sector economy. in essence, monetary policy aim maintain judicious balance price stability economic growth. the relative emphasis price stability economic growth govern prevail circumstance particular time spell time time policy announcement reserve bank. consideration financial stability assume great importance recent year view increase openness indian economy, financial integration possibility cross border contagion. a observe severe cost financial instability elsewhere, financial stability ascend hierarchy monetary policy objective since second half 1990s. strong synergy complementarity observe price stability financial stability india. accordingly, believe regulation, supervision development financial system remain within legitimate ambit monetary policy broadly interpreted. framework till 1997-98, monetary policy india use conduct broad money (m3) intermediate target. the aim regulate money supply consistent expect growth economy project level inflation. the target monetary expansion use set basis estimate two crucial parameters. in practice, monetary target framework use flexible manner feedback development real sector. in wake financial sector reform open economy 1990s, appropriateness monetary target framework question change inter-relationship money, output prices. accordingly, reserve bank switch 1998-99 multiple indicator approach. with approach, interest rate rate return different market (money, capital government security markets), along data currency, credit extend bank financial institutions, fiscal position, trade flows, capital flows, inflation rate, exchange rate, refinance transaction foreign exchange available high-frequency basis, examine along output frame monetary policy. the specific feature indian economy, include socio-economic characteristic predicate invest monetary authority multiple objective time come. while could desirable interest clarity transparency stack objective hierarchy, jury still merit public announcement policy weight assign objective. flexibility set monetary policy override consideration transparency public indication weight pattern associate objective solidify bind rule. moreover, continuous monitor underlie macro economic financial condition monetary policy purpose necessitate continuous re-balancing weight assign various objectives. in pragmatic sense, therefore, suffice monetary authority indicate main objective ordinal ranking, best, reflect read underlie developments. 2 bi review 66/2007 a single objective monetary policy, usually advocated, particularly inflation target framework, luxury india cannot afford, least medium term. the cause monetary policy lost, however; analytically, show even one multiple objective nominal among others may real, serve quintessential nominal anchor enable monetary policy work. this view support pragmatic influential strand literature question recent proliferation inflation target monetary policy framework (friedman, 2000; mccallum, 1981). a regard inflation targeting, monetary policy regime fulfil single mandate advocacy, jury still out. even though increase number central bank adopt inflation target since early 1990s, number central banks, notably federal reserve, retain multiple objectives. i monetary scholar, i feel that, give current domestic international complexities, need continue flexible framework monetary policy. the least need current circumstance le simplistic approach. “in india, favour adoption inflation targeting, keep attainment low inflation central objective monetary policy, along high sustain growth important develop economy. apart legitimate concern regard growth key objective, factor suggest inflation target may appropriate india. first, unlike many develop country record moderate inflation, double digit inflation exception, largely socially unacceptable. second, adoption inflation target require existence efficient monetary transmission mechanism operation efficient financial market absence interest rate distortions. in india, although money market, government debt forex market indeed develop recent years, still way go, whereas corporate debt market still develop. though interest rate deregulation largely accomplished, administer interest rate still persist. third, inflationary pressure still often emanate significant supply shock relate effect monsoon agriculture, monetary policy action may little role. finally, economy large india, various regional differences, continue existence market imperfection factor product market regions, choice universally acceptable measure inflation also difficult” (mohan, 2006b). it important recognise reality multiple objective monetary policy india. nonetheless, need appreciate relative past, need communicate good objective price stability firmly possible, albeit without necessarily precise numerical objective. indeed, monetary policy invest multiple objective choose quantify one – inflation rate? indeed, set precise numerical objective inflation run risk loss central bank credibility context dominance supply side shock emanate source monsoon failure administer price various agricultural commodity petroleum products. whereas share agriculture gdp decline le 20 per cent, sector continue extremely important since majority population remain dependent agriculture. therefore, set precise numerical target inflation fraught risk loss reputation across large constituency. nevertheless, indian economy become increasingly open full capital account convertibility, objective progressively bring inflation near international level maintain price stability assume great importance. the experience successfully bring inflation persistent high level since late 1990s around 5 per cent recent year already bring inflation expectation significantly. a place great emphasis low inflation price stability, also need improve communication respect understand inflation. at present, headline inflation india indicate weekly release all india wholesale price index (wpi). most country use consumer price index (cpi) instead. the cpi difficult use india existence 4 index cpi, reflect consumption basket different set consumer urban rural areas. an appropriate inflation indicator (i) reflect price change constituent item accurately (ii) provide understand headline inflation. whereas feasible construct economy wide consumer price index line harmonize consumer price index (hicp) adopt uk euro area, clear useful would indicator general price level, give widely differ consumption basket rich poor, rural urban area even region india. in fact, measure producer price wholesale price index (wpi) akin, likely representative familiar across country, since bi review 66/2007 3 price likely uniform across country. accordingly, commodity/services base price index see useful indicator/information variable define inflation objective. moreover, wpi available weekly basis, two week lag, whereas cpi index available monthly basis, 2 month lag. monetary policy explicitly associate manage inflation expectation rather current inflation. accordingly, guide criterion inclusion variable inflation indicator panel information content future inflation. an important sub-set would real sector indicator future inflation variability output around trend/potential, capacity utilisation, inventory, corporate performance, industrial/ investment expectation indicator aggregate demand. we initiate great quantitative technical work area last couple year good inform monetary policy make forward look approach. the reserve bank also initiate inflation expectation survey direct indicator change inflation expectation public. these quarterly survey still pilot test stage result yet public domain. but initial result look promising. the complex mandate central bank, necessity communication (mohan, 2005). the reserve bank india clearly complex objectives. apart pursue monetary policy, financial stability one override concern rbi. within objective monetary policy, control inflation provide adequate credit productive sector economy foster growth equally important. this apart, reserve bank act bank regulator, public debt manager, government debt market regulator currency issuer. face multiple task complex mandate, utmost necessity clear communication part reserve bank. a significant step towards transparency monetary policy implementation formation various technical advisory committee (tacs) reserve bank representative market participants, regulator experts. in line international best practice view strengthen consultative process monetary policy, reserve bank, july 2005, set technical advisory committee monetary policy (tacmp) external expert area monetary economics, central banking, financial market public finance. the committee meet least quarter, review macroeconomic monetary development advise reserve bank stance monetary policy. the committee contribute enrich input process monetary policy set india. whether institutional change necessary, however, remain open question. iii. development monetary policy instrument transmission process consistent structural change monetary policy framework, improvement channel transmission emerge early concurrent objective order enhance policy effectiveness. monetary policy clearly cannot work without adequate monetary transmission appropriate monetary transmission cannot take place without efficient price discovery interest rate exchange rate overall function financial market integration. therefore, correspond development money market, government security market foreign exchange market become necessary. accordingly, 1990s, rbi simultaneously undertake development domestic financial market spectrum, sequence process deregulation interest rates, withdrawal statutory pre-emptions, qualitative improvement monetary-fiscal coordination progressive liberalisation exchange payment regime, include institution market orient exchange rate policy. the development financial market india encompass introduction new market segments, new instrument sharp focus regulatory oversight. we make carefully calibrate transition administer interest rate regime one market determine interest rate period time, minimise disruption preserve financial stability. this approach also provide market participant adequate time adjust new regime. the grow market orientation monetary policy tilt choice instrument decisively direct indirect market-based monetary policy measures. until early 1990s, statutory pre-emption form cash reserve ratio (crr) statutory liquidity ratio (slr) requirement lock away nearly 65 per cent bank deposits, severely erode profitability financial system effectiveness monetary policy. the slr bring 38.5 per cent net 4 bi review 66/2007 demand time liability (ndtl) early 1992 25 per cent october-1997. the crr reduce progressively 15 per cent 1991 4.5 per cent 2003, increase step 6.5 per cent current monetary tighten phase. monetary maneuverability strengthen removal erstwhile floor 3 per cent ceiling 20 per cent crr statutory amendment. the statutory minimum slr 25 per cent also remove provide great flexibility rbi’s monetary policy operations. the key policy development enable independent monetary policy environment discontinuation automatic monetisation government's fiscal deficit since april 1997 agreement government reserve bank india september 1994, mark unique milestone monetary-fiscal coordination. another important institutional change free rbi’s balance sheet burden exchange guarantee accumulate pre-reform era. subsequently, enactment fiscal responsibility budget management act, 2003 strengthen institutional mechanism further: april 2006 onwards, reserve bank long permit subscribe government security primary market. this step complete transition fully market base system government securities. look ahead, consequent recommendation twelfth finance commission, central government cease raise resource behalf state governments, access market directly. thus, state governments' capability raise resource market determine base financial health. for ensure smooth transition, institutional process revamp towards great integration monetary operations. give pivotal role money market transmission, effort initiate late 1980s intensify full spectrum. follow withdrawal ceiling inter-bank money market rate 1989, several financial innovation term money market instrument certificate deposits, commercial paper money market mutual fund introduce phases. barrier entry gradually ease increase number player relax issuance subscription norm respect money market instruments, thus foster good price discovery. in order improve monetary transmission also prudential considerations, step initiate 1999 turn call money market pure inter-bank market and, simultaneously, develop repo market outside official window provide stable collateralised fund alternative, particularly non-banks phase call segment, banks. the collateralised borrow lend obligation (cblo), repo instrument develop clear corporation india limit (ccil) members, ccil act central counter-party borrower lenders, permit money market instrument 2002. with development market repo cblo segments, call money market transform pure inter-bank market, include primary dealers, august 2005. a recent noteworthy development substantial migration money market activity uncollateralised call money segment collateralised market repo cblo markets. thus, uncollateralised overnight transaction limit bank primary dealer interest financial stability. technological upgradation accompany development money market. effort currently underway introduce screen-based negotiate quote-driven deal call/notice term money markets. information overnight rate volume would disseminate rbi order enable market participant ass liquidity condition efficient transparent manner. the government security market move auction-based system 1992 obtain good price discovery impart great transparency operations. this major institutional change, which, along free money foreign exchange market phase automatic monetisation fiscal deficits, create conducive environment progressive deregulation follow. the set well capitalise primary dealer (pds) deal government security follow 1995, back introduction delivery versus payment (dvp) government securities, adoption new technique floatation, introduction new instruments, particularly treasury bill vary maturity repos central government date security treasury bill maturity april 1997. since april 1992, entire central government borrow programme date security conduct auctions. in 2005, reserve bank put place anonymous order match system improve price discovery, settlement procedure mitigate risks. to activate trade improve depth security market, introduction “when issued” market also announce recently. all measure bring significant change new treasury culture developing, contribute formation term structure interest rates. the bi review 66/2007 5 demand government security drive consideration effective management liquidity rather statutory liquidity requirements. the indian foreign exchange market widen deepen transition market-determined exchange rate system march 1993 subsequent liberalisation restriction various external transaction lead current account convertibility article viii article agreement international monetary fund 1994. since mid-1990s, bank authorise entity accord significant freedom operate market. bank allow freedom fix trade limit borrow invest fund overseas market specify limits. they allow use derivative product hedge risk asset-liability management purposes. similarly, corporates give flexibility book forward cover base past turnover allow use variety instrument like interest rate currency swaps, caps/collars forward rate agreements. the swap market hedge longer-term exposure develop substantially recent years. a number step also take liberalise capital account cover foreign direct investment, portfolio investment, outward investment include direct investment well depository receipt convertible bonds, open indian corporate office abroad like. in recent years, reserve bank delegate exchange control procedure bank authorise dealer extent hardly need approach reserve bank approval. these reform reflect vibrancy activity various segment foreign exchange market daily turnover u $ 28 billion (as end april 2007). a key area emphasis development financial market india provision appropriate technological infrastructure trading, clearing, payment settlement. since late 1990s, establishment modern, robust payment settlement system consistent international best practice emerge important objective rbi. a three-pronged strategy consolidation, development integration pursue regard. consolidation revolve around strengthen exist payment system provide late level technology. the developmental dimension include real time gross settlement, centralise fund management, security settlement structure electronic financial messaging. other key element technological content market development electronic clear (introduced 1994), electronic find transfer (1996), quick fund transfer centralise settlement mumbai (2003), negotiate deal system (nds), screen base order match system (2002) electronic report trade online dissemination system submission bid primary issuance government security clear corporation india ltd. (ccil), promote banks, financial institution primary dealer clear settlement trade foreign exchange, government security debt instruments, commence operation april 2001. the ccil act central counterparty (ccp) transaction guarantee settlement trade execute rule regulation eliminate counterparty risk adherence international best practices. oversight payment settlement system vest national payment council, board payment settlement system establish within rbi. a may see brief description various measure take develop market institutional framework efficient monetary policy transmission, development market arduous time consume activity require conscious policy make implementation. market develop function overnight: created, nurture monitor continuous basis start function autonomously. efficient transmission monetary impulse clearly need integration markets. issue interest rate deregulation essential smoothen transmission channel monetary policy enhance signal effect policy changes. whereas considerable progress make direction, full deregulation constrain need various policy intervention context still develop economy. the government nationalise bank system 1969 order ensure spread bank throughout country. whereas new private sector bank introduce since mid 1990s, public sector bank still account 70 per cent bank assets. these bank need continue perform various public policy activities, particularly area agriculture, small medium enterprises, cause overall financial inclusion. this also include certain degree credit allocation interest rate directions. hence, monetary transmission get mute margin. 6 bi review 66/2007 the government also fix certain administer interest rate number small save scheme provident funds, along provide certain tax incentives, absence well develop social security systems. a bank compete fund small save schemes, rate offer long-term deposit mobilise bank sometimes set level high would obtain competitive market conditions. in fact, observe factor contribute downward stickiness lend rates, implication effectiveness monetary policy. this reality appreciate live give absence social security coverage adequate safety net country. these small save scheme administer government wide reach post offices, commercial banks, provide small saver access tax save instrument see safe stable. whereas impact term blunt monetary transmission mechanisms, perhaps see contribute overall financial stability. benchmarking administer interest rate market determine rate propose time time. whereas rationalisation scheme indeed done, progress depend emergence good social security pension systems, perhaps easy access marketable sovereign instruments. while government security market fairly well develop now, corporate debt market remain develop facilitate monetary signal across various market segments. we understand, however, difficult develop corporate bond market countries. almost half world's corporate bond market us, another 15 per cent japan. among countries, uk long stand bond market, european bond market begin really develop european monetary integration introduction euro. among develop countries, perhaps south korea reasonably well develop bond market. in absence well develop corporate debt market, demand debt instrument largely concentrate government security attendant implication yield curve and, turn, monetary transmission. the secondary market corporate debt suffer lack market make result poor liquidity. corporates continue prefer private placement public issue raise resource view ease procedure low costs. there need development mortgage-backed securities, credit default swaps, bond insurance institution credit enhancement, abridgment disclosure requirement list companies, credit information bureaus, rat requirement unlisted companies, real time report primary secondary trading, eventual retail access bond market non-profit institution small corporates. a concert effort make set institutional technological structure would enable corporate debt market operate. furthermore, on-going reform area social security couple emergence pension provident fund expect increase demand long-term debt instruments. in process, investor base government security would broadened, extend monetary transmission across new player participants. for monetary policy effective, monetary transmission process improve continuous basis price discovery better. in endeavour, need keep develop various financial markets, increase connection credit markets, remove distortion market reverse current tendency move back administer interest rates. iv. development financial market there great deal progress develop money market, government security market forex market. with great capital account openness, need develop enable market participant absorb great volatility shocks. each market need deeper. in context progress towards capital account convertibility, market participant go face increase risk multiple accounts: volatility capital flows, volatility asset prices, increase contagion state ability legacy institution manage risks. money market the money market remain fragment different segment give rise different overnight rates. the call money market, remain uncollateralised market become pure inter-bank market amongst bank primary dealer withdrawal non-banks. alongside, primarily bi review 66/2007 7 non-bank participant short end, market repo outside repo market liquidity adjustment facility. this collateralised segment money market. the collateralised borrow lend obligation (cblo) market, operate ccil amongst member yet another collateralised money market instrument. with decision move gradually towards pure inter-bank call/term money market, need remove operational/regulatory constraint repo market. one perceive hurdle development repo market inability rollover contracts. to enable continuous access fund repo market, rollover repos allow migration dvp iii. the issue remain development need term eligible collaterals, membership, etc integrate different segment money market money market whole enable cope good market fluctuation run-up full capital account convertibility. an important gap develop money market term money market still emerge hence, evolution yield curve remain inadequate. we need explore do build market open capital account. interest rate derivative the need well develop interest rate derivative market cannot overemphasise provide effective hedge tool interest rate risk present balance sheet facilitate trade base two-way view interest rates, possible underlie cash market absence short selling. deregulation interest rates, help make financial market operation efficient cost effective, bring fore wide array risk face market participants. to manage control risks, several instrument forward rate agreement (fra) interest rate swap (irs) introduce july 1999, could provide effective hedge interest rate risks. further, june 2003, reserve bank india issue guideline banks/primary dealers/fis transact exchange trade interest rate futures, introduce exchanges. there also sharp increase volume transaction otc products. though significant increase number amount contracts, participation market continue remain limit mainly select foreign private sector bank pds. in fact, pd expect market maker segment. since difficulty experience operation exchange trade interest rate future market, process review structure become active market interest rate discovery hedging. despite grow volume otc derivative market, case globally, apprehension regard appropriate legal back instruments. this issue address appropriate amendment reserve bank india act. otc derivative clearly legally valid, even trade recognise stock exchange. exchange trade derivative role play debt market – nature standardise products. otc derivatives, hand customise requirement trade entities. thus, otc exchange trade derivative essential market development. a central counter party base clear arrangement otc derivative would reduce counterparty risk extend benefit netting. accordingly, order strengthen otc derivative market mitigate risk involved, clear arrangement otc interest rate derivative also need considered. this measure would strengthen otc interest rate derivative market, provide great transparency need adequate report requirements. while everywhere world, trade otc segment, reason cannot innovate electronic based, order match trade wide reach also thereby enhance liquidity market. work afoot provide exchange trade system corporate bonds. a make arrangement operation good market interest rate discovery, trade hedge instruments, i would like stress need importance sound adequate risk management practice market participant derivative market. international experience teach u need great care handle instruments. i would expect market player put place appropriate risk management policy procedure products, would also give equal importance skill development human resource handle instrument appreciate underlie risks. a interest rate derivative grow, 8 bi review 66/2007 area require attention relate account disclosures. the relevant standard need comprehensive benchmarked international standards. government security market follow enactment fiscal responsibility budget management act, 2003, april 2006 onwards, reserve bank long permit subscribe government security primary market. in order ensure smooth transition new regime, restructure current institutional process already initiate (mohan, 2006a). these step help achieve desire integration conduct monetary operations. in new milieu, reserve bank may need carry great open market operation (omo) secondary market. such operation could qualitatively different laf ms operations, guide consideration liquidity management primarily short end. the issue determine factor secondary market operations. generally, control short-term interest rate let market determine rest yield curve, central bank attempt transmit monetary policy impulse across yield curve. the sovereign yield curve turn influence lend deposit rate economy. once bank lend get affected, interest rate impact real variable consumption investment, turn impact output inflation levels. however, government security market yet emerge fully deep liquid market across different maturities. give state, interest monetary transmission, case secondary market operation across yield maturity spectrum government security market so, context rbi’s withdrawal primary market. effort make improve retail hold government security since government security market still lack depth dominate bank financial institution often exhibit uni-directional perception liquidity. to attract retail participation government security market, one foremost task ahead create environment provide safe secure investment avenue small investor adequate return liquidity. in context, rbi emphasise provision demat hold facility non-institutional retail/small investor risk mitigation scrip loss settlement deal secondary market. non-competitive bid also introduce since january 2002 direct access primary issue non-sophisticated investors. a part constant endeavour improve facility trade settlement government security market, reserve bank formally launched, august 1, 2005, electronic order match trade module government security negotiate deal system (nds-om short). the nds-om additional facility available participant participant continue option use current report trade platform nds. while nds-om account significant share total trade volume government securities, countrywide, anonymous, screen based, order drive system trade government security introduce stock exchange (nse, bse otcei) january 2003 continue suffer poor trade volumes, need look revival. corporate debt market in order activate corporate debt market, government appoint expert committee (chairman: r.h. patil) provide direction do (government india, 2005). a key point i would like emphasise learn experience develop government security market, need proceed measure manner well think appropriate sequence develop corporate debt market. financial market development involve action number front key objective, obviously, enable efficient allocation resource productive us efficient intermediation saver investors. in words, bank development, equity market development, debt market development go hand hand. and within debt market, efficient government security market essential price discovery provide reliable benchmark price corporate bond credit risk free yield curve. the key problem corporate bond market function, need large number issuers, large number investor issue large size. it may note problem mention respect corporate bond address context development g-securities market. that go show problem insurmountable take bi review 66/2007 9 time resolve. but begin work progress. it true government security market take long time develop, despite much simpler. the corporate debt market much complex, would require extra effort move ahead. in short, long way go make determine effort. v. exchange rate policy our exchange rate policy recent year guide broad principle careful monitor management exchange rate flexibility, without fix target pre-announced target band, couple ability intervene necessary, allow underlie demand supply condition determine exchange rate movement period orderly way. subject predominant objective, exchange rate policy guide need reduce excess volatility, prevent emergence destabilise speculative activities, help maintain adequate level reserves, develop orderly foreign exchange market. the indian market, like develop country markets, yet deep broad, sometimes characterise uneven flow demand supply different periods. in situation, reserve bank india prepare make sale purchase foreign currency order even lumpy demand supply relatively thin forex market smoothen jerky movements. however, intervention govern predetermine target band around exchange rate. a foreign exchange exposure indian economy expands, role uneven demand see reduce. with approach, achieve flexibility along stability external sector. increase earn export service remittance couple enhance foreign investment inflow provide strength external sector. reflect strong growth prospect indian economy, country receive large investment inflows, direct portfolio, since 1993-94 compare negligible level till early 1990s. total foreign investment flow (direct portfolio) increase us$ 111 million 1990-91 us$ 24,748 million 2006-07. over period, current account deficit remain modest – average one per cent gdp since 1991-92 fact record small surplus 2001-04. with capital flow remain excess current finance requirements, overall balance payment record persistent surplus lead increase reserves, reach us$ 1,99,179 million end-march 2007. the emergence foreign exchange surplus lend continue large accretion reserve since mid 1990s novel experience india experience chronic balance payment problem almost four decades. these surplus begin arise open current account, reduction trade protection, partial open capital account early mid 1990s. india’s integration world economy also get stronger, implication conduct exchange rate policy future. trade good (i.e., export plus imports) proportion gdp increase 14.6 per cent 1990-91 32.5 per cent 2005-06; gross current account receipt payment percentage gdp increase 19.4 per cent 50.2 per cent period, reflect buoyant growth indian trade services. the trade deficit also high 6.4 per cent gdp. correspondingly, capital account, gross flow (total inflow plus outflows) double proportion gdp: 12.1 per cent 1990-91 32.4 per cent (us$ 260 billion) 2005-06. thus, indian economy today substantially expose international economy arguably open even unite state term metrics. issue dutch disease in recent years, growth current payment accompany healthy growth current receipt – good services, thus provide confidence sustainability current trade pattern financial stability. current receipt pay 90 per cent current payments. within current receipts, merchandise export rapidly exceed term growth rate software earnings, currently 2.9 per cent gdp. besides, private transfer receipts, comprise mainly remittance indian work abroad, seem acquire permanent character rise steadily constitute around 3 per cent gdp recent years, impervious exchange rate movements. these factor strengthen capability indian economy 10 bi review 66/2007 sustain high current account deficit (cads) past. net capital flow thus regularly exceed cad requirement fair measure, enable large accretion reserves. the large inflow remittance major sustain spurt software export couple capital inflow potential possible overvaluation currency resultant erosion long-term competitiveness traditional good sector – popularly know dutch disease. give fact people good sector, human aspect exchange rate management lose sight of. therefore, dutch disease syndrome far manage way reserve build-up sterilisation, former prevent excessive nominal appreciation latter prevent high inflation. however, issue remain long extent exchange rate management strategy would work give fact face large continue capital flow apart strengthen current receipt account remittance software exports. this issue assume increase importance last year increase capital flow arise high sustain growth performance economy significant enhancement international confidence indian economy. liquidity management volatility capital flow hence liquidity mark period 2001-07 pose considerable problem liquidity exchange rate management. sharp shift capital flow explain partly frictional arise seasonal transient factors, partly cyclical associate pick growth momentum induce demand bank credit, partly lead growth expectation. moreover, absorption external save also dependent stage business cycle country may go through. further, stage business cycle time capital flow may coincide. the early year decade characterise low industrial growth hence absorptive capacity country constrained. a enter expansionary phase, current account widen potential great absorption manifest itself. the volatile capital flow warrant appropriate monetary operation obviate wide fluctuation market rate ensure reasonable stability consistent monetary policy stance. in fact, indian experience illustrate tight link external sector management domestic monetary management. what may small movement capital flow rest world translate large domestic liquidity movement distort market exchange interest rate develop country. just foreign exchange reserve act shock absorber, external front, look parallel liquidity shock absorber domestic monetary management. in context, new instrument, name market stabilisation scheme (mss) evolve useful instrument monetary policy sustain open market operations. the ms make operational april 2004. under scheme, mean exclusively liquidity management, reserve bank empower issue government treasury bill medium duration date security purpose liquidity absorption. the scheme work impound proceed auction treasury bill government security separate identifiable ms cash account maintain operate rbi. the amount credit ms cash account appropriate purpose redemption / buy back treasury bill / date security issue mss. ms security indistinguishable normal treasury bill government date security hand lender. the payment interest discount ms security make ms account, show union budget relate document transparently distinct component separate sub-heads. the introduction ms succeeded, principle, restore laf intend function daily liquidity management. since introduction april 2004, ms serve useful instrument medium term monetary liquidity management. it unwind time low capital flow great liquidity need build excess capital flow could lead excess domestic liquidity. in principle, ms design sterilise excess capital flow deem durable semi-durable. in practice difficult discern ex-ante: hence range ms instrument term duration effectively modulate sterilisation ex-post basis. our strategy introduce new ms instrument manage excess capital flow reduce volatility exchange rate reflect overall issue global capital flow many develop country facing, particularly asia. net private flow (equity + debt) increase average us$ 180 billion five year period 1998 2002, us$ 650 billion 2006, amount 5 per cent gdp (world bank, 2007). absorption volume flow would imply correspond current account deficit 5 per cent gdp. what bi review 66/2007 11 approach exchange rate determination circumstances? to extent current account balance good guide evaluation appropriate level exchange rate? to extent capital account influence exchange rate? what implication large current account deficit real economy? be sustainable and, not, implication financial stability develop countries? in india's case, mentioned, almost always modest current account deficit though, remittance service exports, trade deficit widen significantly recent years. these issue deal negotiate full capital account convertibility, i believe wide question engage country asia. go forward, continuous need adapt strategy liquidity management well exchange rate management effective monetary management short-term interest rate smoothening. the key question continue face instrument mode management liquidity interest growth financial stability much capital flow affect exchange rate. these issue become even relevant free regime capital flows. global development expect increase role determine conduct monetary exchange rate policy countries. in environment global convergence, retain independence monetary policy may become increasingly difficult, call hard choice term goal instruments. vi. fiscal situation fiscal responsibility budget management act some progress public finance exhibit mix trend reform period. after witness correction till 1996-97, public finance undergo deterioration, reflect variety factor decline tax revenue (as per cent gdp) consonance cyclical downturn economic activity, well effect 5th pay commission award. indeed, combine fiscal deficit centre state high 2001-02 1990-91. since 2002-03 onwards, public finance witness significant improvement, reflect policy effort fiscal consolidation well upturn economic activity (table 1). a noteworthy development federal level transformation state level sale tax value add tax (vat), introduce large measure rationality uniformity state tax system. the state sale tax system also suffer great complexity term multiplicity rate special provisions. a vital feature tax reform consultative process among state mediate central government, result consensus massive reform. table 1: combine deficit indicators: centre state (as per cent gdp) year fiscal deficit revenue deficit primary deficit 2001-02 10.0 7.0 3.7 2002-03 9.6 6.6 3.1 2003-04 8.5 5.8 2.1 2004-05 7.5 3.7 1.4 2005-06 7.4 3.1 1.6 2006-07 6.4 2.2 0.8 source: reserve bank india 12 bi review 66/2007 issue notwithstanding recent correction, combine public debt remain high (almost 79 per cent gdp end march 2006). the late significant measure take introduction fiscal responsibility budget management act (frbm) 2004, enjoin government eliminate revenue deficit reduce fiscal deficit 3 per cent gdp 2009. similar act pass state government (25states far). so fiscal responsibility become part legislative commitments. together, they, however, amount total deficit six per cent gdp, consider high global standards. after award 5th pay commission 1997, public finance come strain hence public save become negative. now growth process clearly recover seem sustainable path annual gdp growth excess 8.5 per cent. the 8.5 per cent plus growth would place demand high government wage 6th pay commission come, complicate fiscal consolidation process. achieve frbm target zero revenue deficit 2008-09 require continue focus contain expenditures, increase tax revenue reduction tax exemptions. revenue augmentation would critically depend upon improvement tax/gdp ratio non-tax revenue set decline come years. in context, reversal decline trend tax-gdp ratio welcome. this increase trend need maintain widen tax base curtailment tax exemptions. it context erosion tax base account various exemption pose cause concern. with attainment sustainable high growth path excess 8.5 per cent annual real gdp growth, prospect continue fiscal consolidation improved. tax revenue become buoyant continue healthy growth corporate profit personal incomes. furthermore, introduction value add tax (vat) system state level provide grind optimism. what need guard usual demand exemption contribute erosion tax base. an important point note relation indian fiscal situation that, despite long term persistence high fiscal deficit standards, india subject bank financial market turbulence. our fiscal parameter different country experience turbulence, turkey argentina. in fact, inadequate fiscal performance india investment grade rat early year. the main reason india able maintain financial stability presence fiscal stress almost sovereign debt domestic, except bilateral multilateral external borrowing, small proportionately. india eschew sovereign borrow external markets, thereby insulate external volatility exchange rate interest rates. the move increase market borrow also useful provide market signal cost borrowing. finally, coordination monetary policy, domestic debt management, financial sector policy reserve bank government also help regard. vii. strengthen financial sector/banks the financial system india, measured, gradual, cautious, steady process, undergo substantial transformation. it transform reasonably sophisticated, diverse resilient system well-sequenced coordinate policy measure aim make indian financial sector competitive, efficient, stable. the overall capital adequacy ratio bank sector whole increase 10.4 per cent end-march 1997 12.3 per cent end-march 2007.1 the asset quality bank sector record significant improvement: ratio net non-performing asset net advance decline 8.1 per cent end-march 1997 2.0 per cent end-march 2007 despite tighten npa classification norms. the profitability bank define return asset increase 0.7 per cent 1996-97 0.9 per cent 2006-07. intermediation cost bank decline 2.9 per cent 1995-96 1 data 2006-07 unaudited provisional. bi review 66/2007 13 around 2 per cent 2006-07. the financial system robust resilient, enable accelerate economic growth environment stability. consistent policy approach benchmark bank system best international standard emphasis gradual harmonisation, phase manner, foreign bank operate india indian commercial bank foreign operation require start implement basel ii effect march 31, 2008, commercial bank require implement basel ii march 31, 2009.2 recognise difference degree sophistication development bank system, decide bank initially adopt standardise approach credit risk basic indicator approach operational risk. after adequate skill developed, bank also supervisors, bank may allow migrate internal rat base (irb) approach. although implementation basel ii require capital bank india, cushion available system – present, capital risk asset ratio (crar) 12 per cent – provide comfort. in order provide bank great flexibility avenue meet capital requirements, reserve bank issue policy guideline enable issuance several instrument bank viz., innovative perpetual debt instruments, perpetual non-cumulative preference shares, redeemable cumulative preference share hybrid debt instruments. the reserve bank found board financial supervision (bfs) 1994 upgrade practice financial supervision banks. in course time, development financial institutions, specialise term-lending institutions, non-banking financial company (nbfcs), urban co-operative bank primary dealer (pds) bring supervision bfs. a set prudential norm commercial bank sector institute early 1994 regard capital adequacy, income recognition asset classification, provisioning, exposure norm recently, respect investment portfolio. with aim regulatory convergence entity involve similar activities, prudential regulation supervision norm also introduce phase dfis, nbfcs, co-operative bank pds. in tandem gradual open economy, regulatory supervisory framework spruce comprise three-pronged strategy regular on-site inspections, technology-driven off-site surveillance extensive use external auditors. a result improvement regulatory supervisory framework, degree compliance basel core principle gradually improved. the supervisory framework upgrade institution framework risk-based supervision (rbs) intensify monitor vulnerabilities. a scheme prompt corrective action (pca) effect december 2002 undertake mandatory discretionary intervention trouble bank base well-defined financial/prudential parameters. in view grow emergence financial conglomerate possibility systemic risk arise therefrom, system consolidate account instituted. a half-yearly review base financial soundness indicator undertake ass health individual institution macro-prudential indicator associate financial system soundness. the find arise thereof disseminate public various reports. the bankruptcy procedure contain level npa strengthen years. debt recovery tribunal (drts) establish consequent pass recovery debt due bank financial institution act, 1993. with view put place mechanism timely transparent restructure corporate debt viable entity face problems, scheme corporate debt restructure (cdr) start 2001 outside purview bifr (i.e., board industrial financial reconstruction), drt legal proceedings. similar guideline debt restructure viable potentially viable sme unit issue september 2005. to provide significant impetus bank ensure sustain recovery, securitisation reconstruction financial asset enforcement security interest (sarfaesi) act pass 2002 subsequently amend ensure creditor rights. with view increase option available bank deal npas, guideline also issue sale/ purchase npa july 2005. subsequently, asset reconstruction company registered. thus, bankruptcy procedure recovery bad debt streamline year even though sick industrial company act (sica) continue vogue. 2 they have, however, option implement basel ii effect march 31, 2008 well. 14 bi review 66/2007 a challenge policy context full capital account openness preserve financial stability system great deregulation do capital outflow debt inflows. this require market development, enhancement regulatory capacity areas, well human resource development financial intermediary non-financial entities. in consonance objective enhance efficiency productivity bank great competition – new private sector bank entry expansion several foreign bank – consistent decline share public sector bank total asset commercial banks. notwithstanding transformation, public sector bank still account nearly 70 per cent asset income. public sector bank also respond new challenge competition, reflect increase share overall profit bank sector. this suggest that, operational flexibility, public sector bank compete relatively effectively private sector foreign banks. public sector bank management probably attune market consequence activity (mohan, 2006a). but also face difficult challenge human resource development. they invest heavily skill enhancement levels: top level new strategic goal setting; middle level implement goals; cut edge low level deliver new service modes. wide disparity exist within bank sector far technological capability concerned: percentage “computer literate” employee percentage total staff 2000 around 20 per cent public sector bank compare 100 per cent new private around 90 per cent foreign bank (reserve bank india, 2002). data report rbi suggest nearly 71 per cent branch public sector bank fully computerised. however, computerisation need go beyond mere “arithmeticals”, borrow term report committee bank sector reform (government india, 1998), instead, need leverage optimally achieve maintain high service efficiency standards. give average age 45 year plus employee public sector banks, also face new recruitment challenge face adverse compensation structure comparison free private sector. the issue mix ownership institutional structure government control interest salient feature bank governance india. such aspect corporate governance public sector bank important, public sector bank dominate bank industry, also because, likely would continue remain bank business. to extent public ownership public sector banks, multiple objective government owner complex principal-agent relationship need take board. over reform period, public sector bank begin get list stock exchange, which, wake, lead great market discipline concomitantly, improvement governance aspect well. the broadbased diversify ownership public sector bank bring qualitative difference functioning, since induction private shareholding well attendant issue shareholder’s value, reflect market capitalisation, board representation interest minority shareholders. give increase technical complexity business activity include bank rapid pace change financial market practices, public sector bank would need devise imaginative way respond evolve challenge within context mix ownership. another aspect great capital market openness concern presence foreign bank india. the government reserve bank outline roadmap foreign investment bank india february 2005, provide guideline extent presence 2009. this roadmap consistent overall guideline issue simultaneously ownership governance private sector bank india. the presence foreign bank country useful bring great competition certain segment market. they significant participant investment bank development forex market. with change take place unite state countries, traditional barrier banking, insurance security company removed, size large financial conglomerate become extremely large. between 1995 2004, size large bank world grow three-fold asset size, u $ 0.5 trillion u $ 1.5 trillion, one half time size indian gdp. this happen great degree merger activity: example, j.p. morgan chase result merger among 550 bank financial institutions. the ten big commercial bank u control almost half country's bank assets, 29 per cent 10 year ago (economist, 2006). hence, full capital account convertibility great presence foreign bank time, number issue arise. first, large global bank emerge result real economy scale scope, small national bank compete country like india, need generate large international presence? second, bi review 66/2007 15 considerable discussion today overlap potential conflict home country regulator foreign bank host country regulators: address resolve year come? third, give operation one country india typically small relative global operation large banks, attention top management devote particular country typically low. consequently, market regulatory transgression commit one country bank, may significant impact bank financial market country, likely negligible impact bank's global operations. it see recent year even relatively strong regulatory action take regulator global bank negligible market reputational impact term stock price similar metrics. thus, loss regulatory effectiveness result presence financial conglomerates. hence, inevitable tension benefit global conglomerate bring regulatory market structure competition issue may arise. along emergence international financial conglomerate also witness similar growth indian conglomerates. a countries, banking, insurance security company come jurisdiction respective regulators. a begin make organise cooperation regulator regulation conglomerates, agreement would lead regulator case. in unite states, financial hold company core conglomerate, company subsidiary. there is, yet, commonality financial structure

debate, almost universally underline uk society’s continue commitment price stability. the “open letter” mechanism important political economy monetary policy uk. a one member/one vote committee the open letter instance mpc act collective, represent governor. much time, obviously reach monthly decision bank rate, one person/one vote mode. although well established, committee truly adhere one person/one vote, time pursue mandate dedication integrity, need nurture skilful maintenance. after all, four mpc’s nine member also executive duty report governor day. and four other, “external” member expect renew career outside central bank year service mpc, might think interest maintain appropriate profile. but – maybe alone amongst central banks, i’m sure – one doubt mpc decide bank rate free vote. that owe great deal culture committee itself; culture engender first chairman successor governor, also rest membership. this buttress way bank’s court nonexecutive director approach statutory responsibility review mpc’s processes, involve annual bilateral meet mpc member. and, externally, similarly underpin treasury select committee hold u individually accountable monthly votes, publish part minute meetings. this establish powerful incentive member reach consider view. there free-riding mpc; policy debate full free. that lie heart mpc’s operation, performance communications. indeed, might wonder whether tone public scrutiny could set incentive cast minority vote aim demonstrate independence think action.23 that, course, would perverse. each member want individual decision matter – current bank rate, expect path policy monetary condition embody money market yield curve. one vote minority one disagree immediate decision strategy might convey. occasionally, so, reason disclose minutes, effective way influence monetary conditions. the make-up mpc’s majority minority shift around time. there “blocs” committee. and distinction “internals” “externals” respect. indeed, apart define characteristic internals full-time executive responsibility bank, main distinction date internal member tend serve longer; average around five three quarter years, compare three year

calculate include bi review 66/2007 5 that seem consonant political economy consideration behind design committee. the internal member provide bedrock accumulate policy expertise commitment. the externals, come outside bank turn frequently, keep debate process fresh. three issue around communication monetary strategy against background, mpc’s constitution, particular one person/one vote decision-making structure, affect approach issue conference agenda? communication decisions: individualistic be? the mpc employ four main communication mechanisms: announcement monthly decision bank rate; minute meetings, include detail individual votes; quarterly inflation report, contain projection output inflation; public testimony, parliament via speeches, interview etc. this differ various respect practice other, consensual central banks.25 for example, routinely include explanatory statement notice monthly decision, prefer bank rate change judge reason “no change” decision cannot wait minute publish fortnight later. and include explanatory statement, keep short simple possible. that obviously different ecb and, degree, fomc. these choice reflect different circumstance structures; mpc’s case, “one person/one vote” governance. i assure member committee, include chairman, know decide decided. ours system lend table draft statement around view coalesce. rather, statement craft reflect view majority emerge particular meeting, easy task speed. we are, fact, conscious distinction collective individual statements. we try clear communication collective, behalf majority committee whole, make individual member speak themselves. the inflation report projections, example, represent “best collective view” centre gravity committee, admittedly well define term. individual views, depart best collective view, occasionally published. at inflation report press conference, governor, charlie bean i speak committee, ourselves. by contrast, speak individual give testimony parliament set view speeches. that understand is, course, terribly important give effectiveness regime depend committee decision “policy reaction function” emerge individual deliberations. conscious need maintain delicate balance centripetal centrifugal forces, past current member – include – oppose incorporate individually label paragraph minutes. to would put beyond doubt month u stands, would also affect dynamic interaction amongst committee members. my reluctance go route stem concern would slip towards degree individualism member long listen other. it would possible member polish statement meeting, would able tweak text, ever slightly course, light market reaction decision on. so highly polish statement would bring meeting, perhaps even degree competition depth analysis beauty prose. but point committee listen other, make minds.26 that include try persuade one’s unexpired part term exist committee members, include term howard davy david walton. 25 for example, weber, a., 2007, “monetary policy strategy communication”, speech deutsche bundesbank/federal reserve bank cleveland conference “monetary policy strategy: old issue new challenges”, frankfurt, may 2007. 26 see section “does discussion help?” lombardelli, proudman talbot, op. cit., page 199. 6 bi review 66/2007 colleagues. over years,27 i definitely see occasion individual member alter position course meeting. in summary, political economy case one person/one vote entail equivalent postal voting, i believe would impair quality discussion so, probably, decisions. communication committee’s reaction function: whether publish expect path bank rate central banker know expectation matter. so know deliver goal require able set overnight money market rate one policy meet next. it matter agent – businesses, households, financial market – expect policy rate set future. more that, matter agent broad understand monetary authority react unforeseen development economy; “reaction function”. that so, central bank start publish expect future path rates, range future path. this could advantages. for example, absent clear agreement statement strategy pursue committee, difference amongst member monthly decision occasionally stem judgment precise time bank rate change would affect perception committee’s future course monetary conditions. but book, two reason publish plan policy path – relate political economy context mpc operates. first, one person/one vote system, i much doubt sufficiently stable majority could rely upon exist vote, majority, entire future path rate (and stick condition changed). and i convince communication would aid publish path make segment support majority comprise different group members. in circumstances, would hard make sense individual statement relate supposedly collective expect path. second, statement would conditional whole host judgment go economy economy works. i doubt that, uk, communication public parliament would judge success announce path, explain depart condition assumption a, b …. x z invalidate passage time. get across conditionality might hard, also important: could disquiet public felt misled. there premium, polity, keep debate focus outlook inflation. a i say select committee,28 i would say “never”. i think must learn experience elsewhere. but mean sit hands. the real need convey reaction function, publish path bank rate would obviously accomplish. we need communicate likely react different type shock drive economy away steady state path. a complete specification feasible. we 100% correct model economy. and policy cannot sensibly describe simple mechanical rule but, rather, determine judgment policy makers, composition one person/one vote committee evolve time. but particular time, possible shock – source risk inflation outlook – seem important others. a governor announced,29 mpc therefore plan explain collective assessment risks. 27 before i member mpc, i secretariat, i attend nearly every mpc

develop past decade.31much uncontroversial. one issue has, though, come fore recently: money. money good example political economy context affect outward form policy regimes. in euro area, vital ecb could inherit credibility bundesbank, understandable special place money buba’s communication strategy adopt ecb. i first hand evidence i member monetary policy sub-committee emi mid-late 1990s (and uk decide join emu). a colleague one national central bank say one deliberations, “of course guy good argument monetary strategy, back bundesbank. their policy record outstanding quarter century. yours good since 1992, around five years, isn’t long enough”. in uk, almost way round give series fail attempt base monetary policy money target 1980s. not term substance also term build maintain support regime, uk much good serve objective express term target inflation. it easy explain. but leaf open question role money play analysis. some commentator want money important transmission mechanism because, all, inflation monetary phenomenon; others feel place one side grind essentially endogenous and, all, dual quantity money – interest rate – model (more less). this area where, give individualistic governance structure, view committee cannot expect monolithic. my view useful recover concept shift supply broad money.32 but shift much common proverbial helicopter drop; household firm force hold extra money, respond term condition deposit offer banks. the consequence macroeconomic outlook therefore depend nature underlie shock. for example, shock – say monetary regime – cause perception macroeconomic risk decline, could plausibly shift supply demand credit. other thing equal, bank balance sheet – broad money – would expand, might hard judge extent inflationary impulse come “shock” supply broad money stem relaxation credit constraint high asset prices. also, although “counterparts” approach monetary aggregate would incline one think shock supply credit would flow broad money, change “technology” bank financial intermediation might condition make connection tenuous. after all, intermediation credit occur via capital market across bank balance sheets. that could matter, example, increase supply credit happen occur much time increase incentive mean bank securitise – ie sell – loan originate. in limit case, big positive shock supply credit could coincide shrink bank balance sheet negative broad money growth. that is, course, see recently.33 but think experiment underline two things. first, need attend carefully underlie drivers. a part effort, bank recently

however, success city currently one factor trends, whole story. for start lot london finance. there successful industry and, hand, london home wealthy borough also poor deprive area country. a result

issue monetary authorities. one imagine direct increase supply – helicopter drop extra notes. in world people would really find extra cash pocket would expect go spend it. with money chase goods, would see direct impact, first money spending, inflation. in modern world near equivalent helicopter drop monetary finance government deficits. but monetary finance problem face moment, indeed allow within eu maastricht treaty. so need concern today creation extra money bank system way happen grant credit will borrower borrow spend assets, investment consumption. the supply change need spot change banks’ willingness lend. and don’t look far find some. take, example, growth consumer credit uk (chart 15). we see rapid growth late 90 early year century follow sharp decline bank begin see default rising. another recent example sub prime market us. chart 16 show arrears rate successive cohort loans, mark clearly reduction credit quality 2006 market overshot. in case figure market explanation confirm movement reflect least part change supply curve credit. the borrower will bank also push supply reduce cost condition (culminating say ninja mortgage – income, job assets). so i doubt see supply change credit. next need distinguish sustainable change cyclical. sustain change either economy financial sector technology may justify increase supply. for example, see long period low stable inflation unemployment expect continue. that reduce risk lender borrower may increase demand supply credit value asset last basis. the development information technology allow bank collect analyse information borrower allow target credit good justify change supply. finally development derivative market allow risk loan split separate component distribute people best place bear them. again low supply curve credit. all factor play consumer credit sub prime market but, despite new sophistication credit score derivative markets, also show classic sign credit cycle. bank compete business low cost condition lend economy expanded, default few, profit appear high. they overdo it, default start rise, loss take toughen term again. the speed severity cycle implication financial

know full impact past increase rate yet come through. yet cannot sure much restraint current rate point cycle. it surprise therefore different view mpc view change response information. my stance recent month reflect judgement balance risk take account probability likely impacts. the risk face are: first may increase interest rate fast push far, unnecessary loss growth, second may raise rate slowly cost high inflation potentially high interest rate sharp slowdown end. i vote increase early month partly i convince current rate would sufficient bring credit growth nominal demand back long

able host important international gather again. 10 year 1997 asian financial crisis, year’s roundtable give u good opportunity stock-take, see identify area must continue move forward region. avoid complacency benign economic environment the macro picture amongst asian country vastly improved. the asian economy large show strong growth, drive large part increase trade investment within asia well

last year, asean-5 countries, example, attract us$50 billion foreign direct investment, significantly great us$28 billion see 1997. institutional investor allocate fund asia, search high yield benefit

company robust standard corporate governance good place keep loyalty investors. corporate governance development region we therefore keep momentum progress. since crisis, asian roundtable country indeed make substantial progress important area corporate governance reform. i run two key area progress briefly. growth strengthen standard-setting body institution matter. several country asia establish national committee corporate governance since crisis . the private sector also strengthen act. we see number institute director set many countries, include china, hong kong, indonesia, south korea, malaysia, thailand philippines. minority shareholder watchdog group also place country malaysia, south korea taiwan. and institute directors, particular, bi review 73/2007 1 play key role develop train programme director management. in country – example, malaysia thailand, train programme become mandatory prerequisite director list companies. so see strengthen public private body aim common objective scale standard corporate governance. corporate governance regulation best practice we see considerable reform regulation code corporate governance, well actual practice corporate governance asian roundtable economies. for instance, pakistan, chinese taipei thailand adopt new code 2002, new update code adopt bangladesh, hong kong, indonesia korea since 2003. this yield visible benefits. there great clarity many asian economy regard fiduciary duty director list companies. there also progress make term independent director introduce board list company asian region . account rule also beef across region. some asian roundtable country make significant move towards convergence international standard best practice accounting. china, india, indonesia philippines, example revise account standard bring line international standards. corporate governance singapore corporate governance singapore similarly undergo evolution. i shall leave speaker singapore institute director singapore exchange share fully. i talk briefly instead overall approach corporate governance. regulatory framework – balance mandatory rule best practice first, let touch regulatory framework corporate governance. in recent years, move away merit-based approach towards disclosure-based approach. the objective equip market participant good information, let take responsibility make decision judge quality corporate governance companies. but disclosure-based approach work well back robust enforcement regime. this key maintain confidence market participant disclosure-based regime. in recent years, regulatory authority act decisively face breach market participants, case accs, citiraya china aviation oil. equally important disclosure-based regime raise bar corporate governance standard themselves. singapore’s approach flexible one, recognise need cater range company different size resources. it comprise balance mandatory rules, capture legislation list rules, best practice recommendation form code corporate governance. list company require either adopt best practice recommendation disclose instance do provide explanation – word company must “comply explain”. we keep legislation best practice code date regular refinement, stay relevant change environment. we also keep close watch development internationally, see might relevant singapore environment. for example, uk enact new company act 2006 duty director codified. recently, discussion institute certify public accountant singapore, icpas, singapore institute directors, sid, regard directors’ responsibility internal control account policy estimate relevant companies’ financial statements, responsibility director reflect auditors’ reports. this recent issue illustrate importance clarity directors’ duty

but worth remind corporate governance merely compliance rules. corporate governance wide sense business affair company direct manage order enhance corporate performance long-term shareholder value. good corporate governance ultimately performance accountability shareholders. this relate effective function board – draw different skill-sets amongst directors, set strategies, interact senior management build knowledge make decision interest shareholders. well-functioning board aim sustain performance truth work-in-progress singapore elsewhere asia – probably distance cover regard compliance rules. many company good mix experience skill amongst directors. while big company may necessary resource seek outside help, large number company require help along journey. we therefore focus energy formulate sound rule best practice codes, encourage help company address practical issue make board effective high-performing. corporate governance study commission ma sgx this one reason

governance study professor mak. it note almost corporate scandal involve form financial impropriety, audit committee often see part governance failure. some guidance roles, function skill require audit committee would useful. we need encourage well-qualified director take critical responsibility member audit committee. such practical guidance note could useful help director audit committee understand role relative senior management. it could also provide good focus add value enable important interaction strategy financial account controls. i note uk issue similar guidance audit committee – otherwise know smith guidance – assist companies. conclusion let conclude. the asian financial crisis serve highlight importance corporate governance. it key component contribute strength market performance companies. while corporate governance practice across asia improve significantly, cannot low guard. when time good, press ahead gain momentum effort improve corporate governance. but good corporate governance, know, go beyond box-ticking. it must focus spirit substance behind corporate governance rule guidelines. it important convince company inherent benefit good corporate

the world change dramatically course decades. information technology bring u many new opportunities, particular mobility people, good ideas. i’ll discus technological progress, mean macro economy general, monetary policy particular. globalisation drive technological change there least four manifestation technological change dramatically reshape world past decades: • what see major city people world. what lie behind cheap fast air traffic. competition drive force. so technology, make air transportation efficient, management skill allow split market high yield business-class ticket low cost

in pre-container era, ship cost use 10 20% retail value.1 apart low transportation costs, additional factor need explain surge asian product western markets. in particular catch-up asian economy create new trade opportunities. • what see offshoring labour-intensive production low-wage countries. what lie behind new technology allow production process unbundled. production site locate far target markets, manufacture service industry. the share offshored input gdp reach to12%, canada netherlands.2 • what see low-skilled labour west feel cold wind competition cheap labour asia central eastern europe . at time, wage high-skilled labour increase. what lie behind skill-biased technology. automation low demand low-skilled workers, since computer offer substitute. but computer also amplify natural advantage high-skilled labour, complement labour. a talented professional serve much large customer base due new ict opportunities. financial engineer management skill also tend favour high-skilled labour. these examples, illustrate would global economy without new technology. technology always drive force change. this case invention print press 15th century boost diffusion ideas; still case today’s world, idea spread much fast twenty year ago thank internet. 1 j. bradford delong (2006) the box change world, project syndicate. 2 imf (spring 2007) world economic outlook. bi review 72/2007 1 macro-economic consequence technological change bring world prosperity. in recent years, output growth level see since early 70s. not western economy grow fast. china india integrate world economy full speed. china’s average productivity growth last ten year close 10%. average productivity growth emerge develop country also increased, 5% last year.3 despite recent pick-up, productivity growth latin america lag emerge markets. although technology source welfare, also negative side-effects. for instance, unprecedented speed idea pass people key achievement ict revolution. but also allow bad idea travel fast, religious fundamentalism. i feel sympathy fear rapid technological change. but whether like not, can’t stop technological progress. like toothpaste, it’s tube, hard get back again. the challenge make sure new technology bring change better. there winner loser technological change, least relative terms. the develop world large benefit recent developments. however, area lose out. on lose end area lack connection container-handling network internet. this apply area lack crucial infrastructure, reliable electricity roads, rule law. in western world, job security diminished, blue-collar workers. these days, service ict high-tech sector offshored low-income countries. but number offshored job still modest compare total number job lose created. in netherlands, roughly 9.000 job offshored year, whereas annual number job destruction creation 800.000.4 since ict revolution skill-biased, favour high-over low-skilled labour. fortunately, high income inequality high- low-skilled worker necessarily imply low-skilled worker bad off. the imf show recent trend increase size pie. cheap input lift output overall labour compensation 6% real term advance economy last 25 years.5 and consumer benefit low prices. to keep labour market effect check, employability key policy issue. flexible employee adapt new circumstance technology bring about. government offer help hand improve education, provide social security system encourage people move one job another. in countries, social security scheme may generous deter effort seek new employment. but slogan “the lower, better” go much far. in latin america, instance, social security scheme alleviate income inequality. if benefit economic growth widely shared, support economic reform expect broad otherwise. monetary policy the challenge monetary policy adapt new environment. fortunately, central bank much room manoeuvre arthur burn appoint feed chairman president richard nixon back 1970 words: [quote] “i respect independence; however, i hope independently conclude view one followed” [unquote]. also downward pressure inflation cheap import low-income country make central bankers’ life western world bite easy past. price clothe big ticket item car personal computer declined. computer become lot cheap one take account quality improvements. the overall downward pressure inflation allow low monetary policy interest rates, least short term. in long term, real equilibrium interest rate might rise. this would case world would move permanently high trend rate productivity growth. the jury still 3 productivity measure real gdp divide work age population. source: imf (spring 2007) world economic outlook. 4 number average 2001-2005. source: dutch ministry economic affair (2005) visie op verplaatsing. 5 imf (spring 2007) world economic outlook. 2 bi review 72/2007 whether true. other thing equal, high real equilibrium interest rate imply monetary policy interest rate also move high level, consistent new equilibrium. so, major issue determine trend rate productivity growth. from monetary policy point view question rephrase as: what level growth economy operate without generate high inflation? it always difficult determine speed limit economy, time change even challenging. one development make particularly hard. that move industrial post-industrial society. in 1950s, 30% u labour force employ manufacturing. now number 10%. we move service orient society. in service industry, capacity utilisation cannot measure count idle capacity factories. besides, productivity growth estimate imprecise way. usually, total factor productivity use key measure. it determine residual: productivity growth increase value add cannot explain volume input used. this measure rough. all all, potential output growth rate difficult determine industrial economy. uncertainty potential output translate uncertainty output gap potential actual output. it always tricky base monetary policy output gaps. research orphanides suggest great inflation large extent due mismeasurement potential output output gap.6 it appear virtually impossible determine output gap real time. they measure reliable way ex post, benefit hindsight. “life understand backwards, must live forewards” danish philosopher kierkegaard said. this certainly true monetary policy, medium term objectives. how cope this? i’ve learn couple thing since i think world flat. one objective monetary policy modest. fine-tune economic growth always ambitious goal world long variable lag monetary transmission. a clear focus low stable inflation safeguard central bank temptation activism. give current uncertainties, monetary authority must particularly cautious interpret output gap. they remain firm reaction actual inflation relatively reliable indicator inflation risks, excessive wage growth. a side remark, i add that, theory, capital account liberalisation trade openness warrant sharp focus monetary policy price stability rather output stabilisation.7 international capital mobility, well broad access financial markets, create new opportunity household smooth consumption years. free international trade allow specialisation domestic production. a result, might possible disentangle consumption production high extent past. in words, household cushion change production without intervention central bank. i would like conclude warning. a focus price stability complicate sounds. low stable consumer price inflation reason complacency. in spite consumer price stability, asset price inflation may signal underlie imbalances, overoptimistic risk assessment financial market participant keep long-term interest rate unwarranted low levels. monetary policymakers must

bank argentina, session i financial intermediaton institution markets? sixth annual conference 2007 “financial system macroeconomic resilience”, brunnen, 18 june 2007. * * * 1. introduction the significance financial system development long-term economic growth deeply emphasize literature past fifteen years. this find strong theoretical empirical evidence, base ability financial intermediary to: (i) select productive projects, (ii) monitor control debtor project lifespan, (iii) diversify risk (iv) minimize cost mobilize savings. bank credit less extent corporate bond exceed equity finance world. however, past 35 year bank lose share capture family financial wealth favor equity bond markets. the trend strong industrial countries, also see many emerge markets. regardless, firm still finance investment retain earn (a recent paper central bank argentina show self-financing still prefer approach firm worldwide). this fact – also know peck order firm choose fund first, debt, equity last – reflect existence asymmetric information problem intermediation costs, make fund economical third-party funds. this paper aim analyze financial innovation bring complementarity institution market implication monetary policy. rather advantage associate type channel, stress total financial depth really matters, especially emerge markets. recent financial development relationship macroeconomic stability also briefly explored. 2. bank capital markets? financial instruments, market institution appear purpose mitigate informational asymmetry transaction costs, include cost acquire information, enforce contract exchange good financial claims. in doing, financial infrastructure contribute diversification risk, capital allocation, monitor borrowers, smooth run payment system. recent study highlight skill market broaden access finance by, provide fund economic agent beyond bank system, mobilize large scale capital flows, become significant factor economic growth. in manner, recent year dominant position debate shift “pro-bank” “promarket”. this vision gain even strength due setback suffer japanese bank ninety spectacular performance world capital market second half decade. while bank extract information firm efficiently, firm join public debt market reduce information asymmetry permanently, diminish intervention cost sidestep comparative advantage bank regard extraction information. that part capital market corporation tend remain rather resort bank system. the supporter market-based financial system also assert market reduce inherent inefficiency associate banks, promote high economic growth. their position base fact large bank might block innovation take advantage information access protect incumbent firm close relationship possible competition. large bank regulatory restriction activity might also collude firm creditor block efficient corporate governance. from see far, literature could resolve two system good prepare stimulate long term growth. in order settle debate, ross levine gather information bi review 72/2007 1 48 country 1980-1995 period carry several regression order explain average per caput growth rate term different measurement relative importance market compare banks, control usual variable kind tests. a measurement relative importance markets, us variable like ratio market capitalization private sector credit ratio trade turnover loans. in case result significant, indicate financial system structure seem irrelevant towards growth. actually, addition market capitalization bank loan positive highly significant. levine’s conclusion, call “financial service view”, matter total financial depth, irrespective division bank markets, seem provide settlement discussion. 3. towards complete financial markets: importance complementarity then argument favor system ultimately aim contribution economic growth. in sense, empirical evidence reveal capital market bank system promote long term economic growth, positive impact growth rate economy, capital accumulation productivity improvements. from empirical evidence evident bank supply service differ capital market provide. a result, important necessary economy. in fact, firm country develop bank system capital market grow fast prosperous either one two kind intermediary undeveloped operate correctly. bank general holder non-tradable claim like venture capitalists, provide advisory service market cannot. however, opportunity cost capital latter lower. therefore, intermediary dominate different niche: large establish corporation resort directly market order obtain funds, good rat unwilling pay intermediation costs; hand, company lack strong reputation likely require advisory skill bank (or venture capitalist) probably even get cheap fund them, cost provide information technology operations, understand financier incentive make information public. the process choose appropriate creditor also change noticeably business cycle. when risk-free rate and/or bank profit decline, corporation requisite condition resort debt market find finance, rather go financial system. in fact, fall tax-free rate reduce cost incur debt debt market, make attractive. conversely, fall bank profit lead friction among depositor increase opportunity cost bank capital, reflect increase cost bank finance. in fact, capital market usually act back-up tool keep finance go recession periods, bank credit (procyclical) become scarce. bank usually provide save credit instrument early stage development, capital market instrument emerge financial depth increases, new corporate investor requirement arise degree sophistication investor financial agent grows. capital market facilitate bank business increase available option risk management (e.g. allow hedge risk effectively) while, time, bank activity provide deep capital markets. in allen gale word relationship “symbiotic”. a consequence, ability replace complement provide economy powerful tool deal real external shock contribute achieve financial stability. in sense, instead pose alternative bank capital markets, appear reasonable highlight convenience achieve complementarity form intermediation, concentrate market segment fittest. in emerge country case, particular, long term growth may relevant search way increase financial depth, rather cater possible choice bank capital markets. 2 bi review 72/2007 4. implication monetary policy differ degree capital market participation relative bank system financial intermediation economy alter significance monetary policy transmission channels. specifically, heavy weight capital market increase relevance asset price channel compare credit channel. in context, central banker worthwhile reflect: what central bank variation asset price order develop monetary policy implement it? the first aspect whether monetary authority bear mind asset price directly (per se), indirectly due potential impact good inflation financial stability, ignore them. until now, stylize fact show sharp increase asset price combine rapid sustain growth credit precede financial crisis, subsequent disruptive impact real output, ignore seem sound strategy. however, financial innovation ignore define monetary policy design, imply extremely complex analytical practical issues: a) central bank capacity identify bubbles; b) whether capable identify event temporary permanent; c) uncertainty regard impact asset price aggregate demand inflation; d) efficacy relevance impact monetary policy asset markets; c) asymmetry central bank response (predicament halt fall discourage rises). there thus agreement recommendable monetary authority explicit target asset inflation react systematically towards it. however, cater development large oscillation market associate crises. in words, emphasis risk management stress test needed. my view need bear mind volatility asset price design policies, informal indirect way include reaction function systematic manner. in context relevant question appear: if weight asset price channel raised, relevance monetary authority’s reaction function increase?; if capital market become important intermediate savings, degree supervision agent market adequate financial stability purpose? be degree regulation comparable bank system? in recent year innovation technology, creation new financial instrument subsequent appearance new markets, well abundant liquidity world economy, erode bank system’s role financial intermediary, favor financial markets. bank continue serve financial intermediaries, transfer capital manage risk debtor depositors, share financial market grow ever smaller. regulatory restrictions, growth commercial securities, development market derivative high-yield bonds, expansion asset securitization main factor behind displacement bank system. likewise, improvement information technology make easy agent ass quality security offer capital markets, favor direct corporate finance public. in sense, information technology erode comparative advantage bank reduce transaction cost allow non-bank financial intermediary ass credit risk efficiently statistical methods. while bank decline parallel rise financial markets, become steadily complete. the great “completeness” markets, regard expansion set different kind available instrument reduction transaction costs, bring number benefit cannot disregarded. in first place, enable economic agent insure broad range risks, significant reduce volatility. moreover, make easy investor fine tune portfolios, moderate risk premium require reduce cost capital agents. finally, enable transformation risk negotiable instruments, allow atomization. in fact, financial innovation blur border typical commercial banking, investment banking, insurance asset management. the whole system become interdependent, old actor whose role erode new upcoming star find new niches. thus, commercial bank make loan repackage sell hedge funds, mutual fund insurance company (frequently bypass investment banks), hedge fund also lot bi review 72/2007 3 trade improve revenue investment banks. many company bypass commercial bank completely rely fund initial stage venture capitalists, eventually resource investment bank float company stock market. all framework ever common observe financial institution diversify risk transform massive financial supermarket provide service usually associate commercial banks, investment bank asset management. this state affair certainly mean huge challenge central banker financial regulators. for u development might mean sudden vanish good part know transmission mechanism monetary policy affect real side economy inflation, especially lags. the global financial imbalances, lack response long term rate tightening, tame response price dollar devaluation euro, event hard reconcile traditional knowledge. for regulators, actual diversification risks, resilience system large shock question utmost interest that, however, proper answer moment. in first case hard know own term risk nowadays, case tell sure shock see far really large enough. the collapse ltcm 1998, dotcom bust 2000, amaranth crash large shock indeed, fact wonder today whether large enough is, itself, reason satisfaction, complacency. 5. impact intermediation emerge economy in context, emerge economy exhibit good macroeconomic management, significantly contribute improve financial position, reflect narrow spreads. however, reason today’s narrow spread emerge market are, opinion, beyond market change result structure product credit default swap emerge countries’ mostly sound fundamentals. in view, many reason lie gradual adjustment global imbalances. an expectation u dollar depreciate lead investor seek asset currencies. this reflect clear trend towards develop local asset (mainly asia also latin america) and, consequently, narrow spread stock market hit record high – short, result high fund opportunity emerge world. such process – take place gradually couple transition towards diversify asset portfolio central bank – offer great opportunity also pose significant challenge countries, financial development incipient. although exhibit advances, latin american country appear lag behind term financial depth, compare develop country also compare emerge economy like eastern asia. latin american country exhibit less relative degree bank penetration. this situation reflect supply issue problem inherent demand side. these demand difficulty relate large degree informality corporate operations, cultural issue mean time economic agent exclude market free will. bank loan private sector latin america typically 30% fraction gdp, 175% uk, 167 spain, fluctuate closely 100% france, japan, italy, canada, australia germany. in emerge asia, contract enforcement probably good latin america, thailand´s ratio 88% korea´s 100. the development capital market appear even incipient. these market relatively illiquid, fragment incomplete, instrument enable diversify (or transfer) risk scarce, and, particular, capital market concentrate government securities. indicator 2004 show turnover trade domestic capital market 6.1% gdp latin america, account 92.2% g-7 market 104.5% east asia. on hand, year equity finance 0.5% gdp region, compare 1.5% g-7 country 5.9% asia. between year 1990 2004 latin america suffer decline number list corporation contrast growth trend observe g-7 country east asia. 4 bi review 72/2007 the domestic corporate bond market exhibit similar situation, amount bond issue 2004 equivalent 10.7% gdp latin american countries, compare average 47.7% g-7 country 36.3% emerge asian countries. capitalization fraction gdp low 30% latin america, typically range 80 140% gdp develop countries. in emerge asia, thailand´s market capitalization 68% gdp, 60% india 73% korea. in addition, transaction carry secondary market government bond scarce compare carry develop markets. although sovereign bond asset liquidity, level comparable mature markets. these characteristic reflect high cost issue trade economy develop economies, fee back shortage product domestic markets, great integration capital market lead domestic agent place fund international markets. 6. how financial depth increase emerge economies? emerge economies, top deal potential adjustment global economic condition confront uncertainty micro macro level financial market developed. in term build regulatory supervisory framework, key develop common risk-focused approach robust stress test sound market infrastructure, allow intermediary properly identify, transfer, transform redistribute risk, enable adjust financial real shock. the main challenge deepen financial system focus generate long-term domestic currency market, fundamental requirement reduce macroeconomic volatility typical region. this development could important buff cover new risk emerge financial innovation. for purpose, key consist strengthen pillar might call new economic paradigm, several anti-cyclical components: • fiscal solvency (primary surplus improve liability management). • monetary prudence consistency (inflation low control levels). • accumulation international reserve (insurance external shocks). • more flexible foreign exchange regime • reduction net foreign debt • trade dynamism (diversifying destination products). • diminish currency mismatches. any policy design must flexibility necessary capable respond appearance new risks, bear mind propagation might rest economic sectors. specifically, one major task country foster bank penetration deepen credit domestic currency. in general, country exhibit low level financial service usage compare regions. for purpose transparency information dissemination relevant. it necessary design regulatory framework one hand enable finance grant non-traditional sectors, disregard risk financial institution incur. in sense, supervision play fundamental role, possibility allow requirement prudential nature impose financial institution uniform, instead consider particular characteristic institution. because show advance technology enable inclusion new product low cost mechanism must generate order stimulate incorporation technological progress. for example, debtor’s risk assessment mathematical method (credit scoring) allow efficient credit allocation. bi review 72/2007 5 on hand, communication policy coordination foster different agency role direct indirect regulation financial markets. this coordination necessary development certain financial instrument improve risk allocation. central bank also specific interest improvement domestic bond markets, particular public sector debt. one reason complete market reflect relationship borrow cost terms. make explicit yield curve reveal information expectation economic agent have, essential business decisions. recent experience show development bond market must base place fund domestic currency, relevant transmission monetary policy also mechanism reduce external vulnerability. associate this, recent de-dollarization process also highlighted. in past financial dollarization enable generation long term currency context much distrust domestic currency result long period high inflation. although allow great financial development (as long term instrument reappear generate liquidity) prove vulnerable reversal capital flows, particular accompany exchange rate rigidity. although balance sheet financial intermediary exhibit mismatch asset liability denominations, another concrete mismatch: revenue debtor dollar always denominate currency. this example show shortcut deepen financial markets. the de-dollarization act direction, prudential regulation bear mind possible mismatch exceed denomination financial instrument (for instance: limit loan foreign currency export activity generate foreign currency revenues). carry policy mention mean blindly follow certain recipe must apply always circumstances. this acknowledge different way put practice adequate policy achieve stable deep financial market. moreover, necessary identify adequate economic policy country specific circumstances, correct time also crucial implement measures. the pace policy implement cannot independent structural characteristics, economic social environment particular country. therefore, pace select allow maximize chance process undertake successful. in summary, several case choice adequate policy attain predictable economic environment call adequate combination credibility flexibility. reference allen, franklin gale, douglas (2004) “financial intermediary markets”, econometrica, vol. 72, n° 4,

netherlands bank chairman basel committee bank supervision, “risk capital 2007” conference, paris, 27 june 2007. * * * introduction i please join today speak basel ii financial institution resiliency. i would first like commend conference organiser put together comprehensive programme event week. i grateful opportunity discus basel ii framework design help make bank resilient face turbulent water constantly shift currents. resilience come latin word “rebound”, imply change status quo change constant business banking. bank sometimes need adjust unexpected unwanted shocks, though change also arise positive way, innovation. today i focus change financial landscape work basel committee and, notably, basel ii framework help firm financial system become resilient changes. from perspective, financial resiliency three distinct elements. first, include existence promotion sound economic financial policies. the second element resilient financial market infrastructure underpin system, include sound payment systems, robust exchanges, prudent account standard sensible governance standards. third, essential robust resilient core firm centre financial system operate safe sound risk management practices. a sound global capital adequacy framework critical ensure robustness resilience firms. it third dimension basel ii play important role i focus remarks. basel ii – general we witness rapidly change financial environment, case represent sea change traditional practices. we see significant advance technology financial product innovation reshape role play bank credit process. an example shift business models. core institution move away traditional buy-and-hold strategy originate-to-distribute market-based model. change create new challenge – well new opportunity – banker well supervisors. innovation lead new technique tool manage credit portfolio accompany increase complexity. a regulatory framework base simple risk weight scheme become le le effective assess appropriate level regulatory capital new, complex risk exposures. basel ii – pillar 1 the basel committee’s response capitalise improvement banks’ risk management system good address complexity innovation see today. this reflect first pillar framework relate minimum capital requirements. in order meet challenges, committee leverage core build block banks’ risk management systems, namely probability default, loss give default exposure default. these concept integral risk management system develop large banks. by utilise concepts, basel ii provide meaningful signal risk take capital. this, turn, reinforce sound risk measurement technique framework sufficiently flexible accommodate new technique products. there many aspect basel ii draw modern risk management technique industry best practice. bank indicate basel ii produce improvement risk management process spur innovative work several important areas. let give concrete example illustrate this. bi review 72/2007 1 first, basel ii, see substantial advance operational risk measurement management, particularly respect complex risk transfer arrangements. since basel ii discussion begin late 1990s, tremendous increase research operational risk, include form take, way arises, measurement method technique mitigate risk. a result, industry witness surge innovation development areas. second, respect stress conditions, basel ii seek advance comprehensive stress test framework risk management practice generally. strong risk management critical component bank’s ability withstand shocks. the basel ii framework require stress scenario capture effect downturn market credit risks, well liquidity. such improve firm-wide approach risk assessment essential ensure bank sufficient capital buff carry difficult periods. third, basel ii good ass risk inherent arrangement use evolve technologies, securitisation credit derivatives, use buy sell credit risk. this clearly evident originate-to-distribute model. basel ii provide framework allow supervisor focus discussion bank robustness risk measurement management complex financial instrument typically use model. basel ii also establish benchmark recognise risk transfer mitigation securitisation credit derivative structures. it set boundary point firm transfer risk actually retain risk. these enable supervisor ass degree risk transfer mitigation normal stress market conditions. and finally, basel ii require firm strengthen framework assess appropriate capital trade book. this take increase importance give rapid growth trade book asset relative bank book. for example – basel committee – consultation industry – continue work develop framework good capture default risk associate credit exposure trade book. in addition, basel ii permit firm use model measure counterparty credit risk exposures. this risk arises, example, otc derivatives, become increasingly complex difficult measure. this approach closely align industry best practice well underlie economic risk activities. basel ii also pave way improvement other, le visible ways. one example basel ii’s great focus firms’ risk management infrastructure. for instance, framework require fundamental improvement data support pd, lgd, ead estimate underpin economic regulatory capital assessment economic cycle. this spur improvement area data collection management information systems. these advances, along incentive improve risk management practices, support innovation improvement risk management economic capital modelling. pillar 2 let turn second pillar – supervisory review process. pillar 2 really start you, banks. first foremost, responsibility lie bank management develop internal capital assessment process set capital target commensurate bank’s risk profile control environment. a sound risk management process basis effective assessment adequacy bank’s capital. and bank management bear primary responsibility ensure bank maintain adequate capital support risk beyond minimum requirements. excessive participation supervisor bank's capital adequacy assessment process firms' over-reliance supervisory review assessment counter basel ii’s objective raise risk moral hazard. the good bank measure manage risks, comfortable supervisor market become respect pillar 1 processes, well amount overall capital pillar 2 indicate appropriate. this compliance exercise! senior management board director need lead process ensure institution establish robust internal system capture material risk institution rigorous manner. management make certain economic substance risk exposure fully recognise incorporate bank’s systems. this extremely important, particularly instance securitisation complex risk transfer arrangement risk retain firm difficult measure. these estimate risk must translate robust capital assessment validate bank supervisors. 2 bi review 72/2007 when supervisor ass economic capital, leverage banks’ systems. supervisor need understand global perspective within bank operate. local approach may warranted, need ensure local deviation proportionate cost outweigh prudential benefits. to achieve full benefit pillar 2, supervisor need avoid fall trap establish check-list approach supervision. it anyone’s interest engage tick-the-box compliance exercise. let stress - basel ii go beyond merely meet letter rules. the framework risk-focused approach capital risk management. i understand bank supervisor realise full potential basel ii, work must do home-host issues. with respect pillar 1, resolve number concern come quite long way. the vigour energy need apply home-host issue relate pillar 2. i confident development home-host principles, increase use supervisory college dialogue industry make progress outstanding issues. many pillar 2 issues, diversification, particularly challenge supervisor need work industry resolve them. i expect time banker supervisor engage dialogue around pillar 2 ultimately turn one important benefit come implementation basel ii. for instance, i already hear number bank fruitful discussion credit risk mitigation reflect risk model robustness risk measure complex structure products. i also hear discussion diversification treat risk management system dialogue surround credit risk stress test become focused. pillar 3 since release basel ii framework, focus first two pillar forget third – certainly least – three pillars. market discipline make possible effective disclosure requirement critical complement two pillar basel ii. indeed, light recent rapid financial innovation, state art disclosure need keep up. basel ii seek raise bar quality disclosures, especially relate complex credit risk intermediation activities, cover area counterparty risk, securitisation credit risk mitigants. it provide clear industry benchmark require qualitative disclosure allow bank put quantitative disclosure context help explain approach risk management. to help advance use market discipline, pillar 3 disclosure are, many instances, require utilise advance pillar 1 approach, internal ratings-based approach recognition securitisation. this help industry move forward collectively. further, pillar 3 disclosure enhance discipline around risk measure since bank must show actual outcome versus estimates. an example require disclosure actual loss compare estimate loss precede period irb portfolio, combine qualitative information explain outcomes. however, challenge remain. there need discussion broad group institution discus view regard pillar 3. in particular, bank express concern potential misinterpretation purportedly complex disclosure investor market general. another concern relate potential inconsistency difference across bank unclear signal may send user disclosures. clearly, broad dialogue topic involve supervisors, banker market participant necessary prevent unintended consequences. a strong understand market pillar 1 2 make pillar 3 understandable market discipline reliable tool supervisor market. before i conclude i would like say word cost associate basel ii’s implementation compliance, particularly cost relate information technology human resources. clearly, shift capital regulation fundamental basel ii entail significant transition cost bank supervisors. however, even absence basel ii, well manage financial institution would continue update improve it system risk management practice simply keep pace evolve marketplace. basel ii push firm bi review 72/2007 3 may go own. in addition, basel ii confer benefits, include great operational efficiencies, good capital allocation great shareholder value use improve risk model report capabilities. one might reasonably expect improvement lead consistent profit reduce volatility credit loss result consistent risk spreading, effective deployment capital, ability make good business decisions. conclusion i would like close reiterate importance basel ii support financial resiliency, especially age rapid change innovation. basel ii encourage good measurement management risk exposure treatment complex financial instruments. it seek advance practice stress test well risk management techniques. under pillar 2, bank take lead develop internal risk management process support robust estimate regulatory economic capital. through enhance transparency market discipline, pillar 3 become important increase intermediation risk capital markets. both bank supervisor need take long-term perspective consider benefit basel ii. regulatory capital, risk management risk-based supervision align consistent manner accommodate financial innovation. this capital framework long-term investment do properly lay foundation evolution. it strong coordination among supervisor – industry – realise full potential basel ii framework. thank you. 4 bi review 72/2007 jean-pierre roth: snb commemorative publication “the swiss national bank 1907-2007” remark mr

materialisation risk exposure vulnerability i consider possible factor could trigger materialisation certain risk exposure identify vulnerabilities. an important issue highlight fsr relate exist ample financial market liquidity prevail low risk premia. one possibility abrupt sharp increase risk aversion loss confidence could lead substantial reduction financial market liquidity which, stressed, currently abundant. such decline could expose several underlie vulnerability trigger adverse scenario could involve: • fund liquidity challenge highly leverage financial institutions; • unwind carry trade possible unwind global imbalances; • increase credit spread across credit quality spectrum; • increase asset price volatility financial market generally; • reduce bank profitability result low trade revenues. a second adverse scenario could trigger turn credit cycle large credit event. this could lead unravel vulnerability corporate household sector credit market could involve: • default low credit-quality, high-leveraged household firms; • significant challenge structure credit crt markets; • loss potential failure high leverage financial institutions; • counterparty risk banks. in context, “triangle vulnerability”, identify december 2006 fsr, connect state credit cycle, credit derivative highly leverage institutions, could grow relevance recent period. a shock involve element triangle could implication two. for example, sharp turn credit cycle could mean credit risk protection-sellers, hedge funds, would make payment bank protection-buyers, hedge fund might capable paying. although many hedge fund attempt extend investor lock-up periods, position typically marked-to-market, imply fund remain vulnerable loss suffer could significantly impact willingness bank continue grant credit. at time, turn credit cycle could represent challenge test function credit derivative markets. similarly, widespread problem emerge hedge fund active credit risk transfer markets, could spark downturn credit cycle itself, could impair “originate distribute” business model upon large bank become reliant. 6. overall assessment financial stability outlook let conclude overall assessment financial stability outlook. compare current assessment present december 2006 fsr, main scenario euro area financial stability remain broadly favourable: bi review 69/2007 5 • the current macroeconomic environment benign global euro area economic activity expect remain robust; • in february march 2007, resilience financial system test third significant burst market volatility two years, comfortably weathered; • euro area credit quality, overall, remain high underpin favourable economic outlook; • pocket vulnerability euro area household corporate sector likely increased, but, average, financial position remain sound; • the profitability euro area financial institution improve solvency comfortable relative regulatory requirements. however, pre-existing source risk vulnerability remain grown: • the recent market jitter confirm concern regard previously identify risk vulnerability reveal relevance new risk exposures; • vulnerability could quickly unearth market liquidity abruptly sharply decline, possibly trigger wane risk appetite cause change risk perceptions; • re-leveraging corporate sector process credit risk transfer bank system financial institution market participant associate great emphasis “originate distribute” business model banks, could constitute vulnerability le benign market environment. • in addition, global imbalance remain medium-term, low-probability potentially high impact risk financial stability. therefore, despite strong performance financial sector benign macroeconomic outlook, room complacency, give potential risk identify vulnerabilities. this conclusion also reflect fact materialisation risk trigger could expose vulnerability predict degree certainty. the main message financial institution prepare

economist call "real" factor – productivity workforce, quantity quality capital stock, availability land natural resources, state technical knowledge, creativity skill entrepreneur managers. but extensive practical experience well much formal research highlight crucial support role financial factor play economy. an entrepreneur great new idea build good mousetrap typically must tap financial capital, perhaps bank venture capitalist, transform idea profitable commercial enterprise. to expand modernize plant increase staffs, firm must turn financial market financial institution secure essential input. family rely financial market obtain mortgage help finance children's educations. in short, healthy financial condition help modern economy realize full potential. for reason, one critical priority develop economy establish modern, well-functioning financial system. in unite states, deep liquid financial system promote growth effectively allocate capital increase economic resilience increase ability share diversify risk domestically globally. just healthy financial system promote growth, adverse financial condition may prevent economy reach potential. a weak bank system grapple nonperforming loan insufficient capital firm whose creditworthiness erode high leverage decline asset value example financial condition could undermine growth. japan face kind challenge financial problem bank corporation contribute substantially sub-par growth so-called "lost decade." a topic conference remind us, financial condition may affect shorter-term economic condition well longer-term health economy. notably, evidence support view change financial credit condition important propagation business cycle, mechanism dub "financial accelerator." moreover, fairly large literature argue change financial condition may amplify effect monetary policy economy, so-called credit channel monetary-policy transmission. in fact, i discuss, two idea essentially related. a someone (in former life) research topics, i think might useful provide somewhat personal overview financial accelerator credit channel idea common underlie logic. along way i offer think future research might productive. market friction real effect financial credit condition economist always fully appreciate importance healthy financial system economic growth role financial condition short-term economic dynamics. a matter intellectual history, reason difficult understand. during first decade world war ii, economic theorist emphasize development general equilibrium model economy complete markets; is, analyses, economist generally abstract market "frictions" imperfect information transaction costs. but without frictions, financial market little reason exist. for example, complete market (and ignore taxes), know whether corporation finance debt equity irrelevant (the modigliani-miller theorem). the blossom work asymmetric information principal-agent theory, lead nobel laureate joseph stiglitz george akerlof contribution many researchers, give economist tool think central role financial market real economy. for example, classic 1976 paper michael jensen william meckling show that, world imperfect information principal-agent problems, capital structure firm could use tool shareholder good align incentive manager shareholders' interests. thus bi review 68/2007 1 bear powerful fruitful rejoinder modigliani-miller neutrality result and, broadly, perspective capital structure endure influence. my first job academic stanford university, i arrive assistant professor graduate school business 1979. at time, stanford hotbed work asymmetric information, incentives, principal-agent problem; even though field macroeconomics, i heavily influence intellectual environment. i become particularly interest perspective financial market could help explain financial crisis – is, extreme disruption normal function financial market – seem often significant impact real economy. put issue context u.s. economic history, i lay out, 1983 article, two channel financial problem 1930s may worsen great depression (bernanke, 1983). the first channel work bank system. a emphasize information-theoretic approach finance, central function bank screen monitor borrowers, thereby overcome information incentive problems. by develop expertise gather relevant information, well maintain ongoing relationship customers, bank similar intermediary develop "informational capital." the widespread bank panic 1930s cause many bank shut doors; face risk run depositors, even remain open force constrain lend keep balance sheet liquid possible. bank thus prevent make use informational capital normal lend activities. the result reduction availability bank credit inhibit consumer spend capital investment, worsen contraction. the second channel financial crisis affect real economy 1930s operate creditworthiness borrowers. in general, availability collateral facilitate credit extension. the ability financially healthy borrower post collateral reduce lender's risk align borrower's incentive lender. however, 1930s, decline output fall price (which increase real debt burdens) lead widespread financial distress among borrowers, lessen capacity pledge collateral otherwise retain significant equity interest propose investments. borrowers' cash flow liquidity also impaired, likewise increase risk lenders. overall, decline financial health potential borrower depression decade impede efficient allocation credit. incidentally, information-based explanation sharp deflation price 1930s may real effect closely relate to, provide formal rationale for, idea "debt-deflation", advance irving fisher early 1930s (fisher, 1933). the external finance premium financial accelerator both real monetary shock produce great depression, 1983 paper i argue bank financial market propagate type impulses, without distinguish sharply two. my subsequent research many others look separately role financial condition amplify monetary nonmonetary influences. on nonmonetary side, mark gertler i show how, principle, effect real shock (such shock productivity) financial condition could lead persistent fluctuation economy, even initiate shock little intrinsic persistence (bernanke gertler, 1989). a key concept analysis external finance premium, define difference cost borrower raise fund externally opportunity cost internal funds. external finance (raising fund lenders) virtually always expensive internal finance (using internally generate cash flows), cost outside lender bear evaluate borrowers' prospect monitor actions. thus, external finance premium generally positive. moreover, theory predict external finance premium borrower must pay depend inversely strength borrower's financial position, measure term factor net worth, liquidity, current future expect cash flows. fundamentally, financially strong borrower "skin game," speak, consequently great incentive make well-informed investment choice take action need ensure good financial outcomes. because good incentive flow borrower's significant stake enterprise associate reduction need intensive evaluation 2 bi review 68/2007 monitor lender, borrower good financial condition generally pay low premium external finance.1 the inverse relationship external finance premium financial condition borrower create channel otherwise short-lived economic shock may long-lasting effects. in hypothetical case gertler i analyzed, increase productivity improve cash flow balance sheet position firm lead turn low external finance premium subsequent periods, extend expansion firm induce continue invest even initial productivity shock dissipated. this "financial accelerator" effect apply principle shock affect borrower balance sheet cash flows. the concept useful help explain persistence amplitude cyclical fluctuation modern economy. although financial accelerator seem intuitive – certainly financial credit condition tend procyclical – nail mechanism empirically prove entirely straightforward. for example, empirical study business investment structures, equipment, inventory often find firm's cash flow significantly determine level investment link cash flow investment tend strong firm (such relatively small firms) limit access capital markets.2 in "frictionless" capital market borrower face external finance premium, firm's cash position would irrelevant decision invest efficient capital market would supply necessary fund investment project expect yield positive net return. thus, find positive association cash flow investment tend support financial accelerator theory. these find also raise issue questions, however. i mention two. first, number researcher point out, apparent empirical link cash flow investment may arise cash flow proxy difficult-to-measure factor like prospective return investment, would relevant investment decision even without capital-market frictions. this identification problem difficult one. however, work attempt correct possible misspecification still find role cash flow (see, example, gilchrist himmelberg, 1999). second, small firm significant external finance premiums, imply research, macroeconomic significance financial accelerator may questioned. one response point, pursue several researchers, dispute claim small firm play significant role business-cycle fluctuations. for example, small firm apparently account significant portion cyclical change employment inventory stocks. another response argue even large firm relatively good access capital market may face nontrivial external finance premiums. for instance, use sample include large public companies, researcher board estimate external finance premium economically significant magnitudes, show premium rise sharply 2001 recession, predict financial accelerator theory (levin, natalucci, zakrajsek, 2004; levin natalucci, 2005). financial accelerator effect need confine firm capital spend may operate household spend decision well.3 household borrowers, like firms, presumably face external finance premium, low strong financial position. for households, home equity often significant part net worth. certainly, household low mortgage loan-to-value ratio borrow relatively favorable term home-equity line credit, equity home effectively serve collateral. if financial accelerator hypothesis correct, change home value may affect household borrow spend somewhat suggest conventional wealth effect change homeowners' net worth also affect external finance premium thus cost credit. if true, hypothesis various interest implications. for example, unlike standard view base wealth effect, approach would suggest distribution house wealth across population matter effect aggregate consumption give decline house price greater, great fraction 1 over past two decades, extensive theoretical literature exploit idea borrowers' financial position affect external finance premium thus overall cost credit. see, example, bernanke gertler (1989), kiyotaki moore (1997), bernanke, gertler, gilchrist (1999), carlstrom fuerst (2001), aoki, proudman vlieghe (2004), iacoviello (2005). 2 calomiris, himmelberg wachtel,(1995), carpenter, fazzari petersen (1998), gilchrist himmelberg (1999). 3 see aoki, proudman vlieghe (2002, 2004), iacoviello (2005), almeida, campello liu (2006). bi review 68/2007 3 consumer begin relatively low home equity. another possible implication structure mortgage contract may matter consumption behavior. in country like unite kingdom, example, mortgage adjustable rates, change short-term interest rate (whether induce monetary policy factor) almost immediate effect household cash flows. if household cash flow affect access credit, consumer spend may react relatively quickly. in economy mortgage carry fix rates, unite states, channel effect may muted. i think know point whether, case households, effect quantitatively significant aggregate. certainly, issue seem worthy study. monetary policy credit channel the idea i discuss today also useful understand nature monetary policy transmission process. some evidence suggest influence monetary policy real variable great explain traditional "cost-of-capital" channel, hold monetary policy affect borrowing, investment, spend decision solely effect level market interest rates. this find lead researcher look supplementary channel monetary policy may affect economy. one supplementary channel, so-called credit channel, hold monetary policy additional effect interest-rate decision affect cost availability credit would imply associate movement risk-free interest rates, treasury rates. the credit channel, turn, traditionally break two component channel policy influence: balance-sheet channel bank-lending channel (bernanke gertler, 1995). the balance-sheet channel monetary policy closely relate idea financial accelerator i already discussed. that theory build premise change interest rate engineer central bank affect value asset cash flow potential borrower thus creditworthiness, turn affect external finance premium borrower face. for example, accord view, tighten monetary policy reduce net worth liquidity borrower would increase effective cost credit change risk-free rate thus would intensify effect policy action. in interest time i confine remainder remark bank-lending channel. the theory bank-lending channel hold monetary policy work part affect supply loan offer depository institutions. this concept cousin idea i propose paper great depression, failure bank 1930s destroy "information capital" thus reduce effective supply credit borrowers. alan blind i adapt general idea show how, affect banks' loanable funds, monetary policy could influence supply intermediate credit (bernanke blinder, 1988). historically, monetary policy appear affect supply bank loan (at give level interest rates). in 1960s 1970s, reserve requirement high comprehensive today, federal reserve open market operation drain reserve bank system tend force contraction deposits. regulation q, cap interest rate payable deposits, prevent bank offset decline deposit offer high interest rates. moreover, bank limit alternative deposit fund source. thus, monetary tighten typically result shrink banks' balance sheet diversion fund away bank system, phenomenon know disintermediation. the extension credit bank-dependent borrowers, include many firm well households, consequently reduced, implication spend economic activity. of course, much change u.s. bank financial market since 1960s 1970s. reserve requirement low apply small share deposit past. regulation q gone. and capital market become deep, liquid, easily accessible, either directly indirectly, almost depository institutions. although traditional bank-lending channel may still operative economy remain relatively bank-dependent, recent research find european country (ehrmann others, 2003), unite state today seem unlikely quantitatively important. this say, however, financial intermediation long matter monetary policy transmission economic shocks. for example, although bank intermediary long depend exclusively insure deposit funding, nondeposit source fund likely relatively expensive deposits, reflect credit risk associate uninsured lend 4 bi review 68/2007 (stein, 1998). moreover, cost availability nondeposit fund give bank depend perceive creditworthiness institution. thus, concern holder uninsured bank liability bank credit quality generate external finance premium bank similar face borrowers. the external finance premium pay bank presumably reflect turn cost availability fund bank-dependent borrowers. importantly, way cast bank-lending channel unify financial accelerator credit channel concepts, central mechanism see external finance premium relationship borrowers' balance sheets. the difference financial accelerator focus ultimate borrower – firm household – whereas financial intermediary relevant borrower theory credit channel. by way, existence loan sale originate-to-distribute model bank lend fundamentally change picture. loan sale similar activity are, essence, another form nondeposit financing, effective cost form fund bank generally depend perceive financial strength resource (which may affect recourse reinsurance arrangement loan purchasers, example). recently, researcher pursue number approach search evidence distinct bank channel. for example, researcher focus small banks, may few fund alternative deposit whose customer base may consist disproportionately bank-dependent borrower (kashyap stein, 2000). of course, days, even small bank ready access source fund retail deposits. thus, even small banks, source bank-lending channel remain existence finance premium marginal source (uninsured) nondeposit funding, rather absolute constraint quantity available funding. moreover, bank channel affect economic activity, borrower accustom rely bank must unable turn lenders, least without cost. for business borrowers, particularly small business borrower rely bank relationships, scenario plausible.4 but financial innovation deregulation imply borrower market mortgage consumer credit numerous nonbank finance alternatives, blunt direct impact change bank lending. i return nonbank lend implication moment. if relationship borrow key, – point paper conference black, hancock, passmore – bank many borrower might defensively invest deposit capacity, say, increase number branches. by actively seek finance high share loan insure deposits, bank could shield borrower effect increase nondeposit finance premium, whether result monetary policy factor. consistent idea, author find bank make large share loan small business also tend high ratio deposit loans. the recognition that, fundamentally, bank-lending channel base change quality bank balance sheet naturally turn attention bank capital determinant (van den heuvel, 2002). raise new capital open market difficult costly many banks, imply that, short run, capital determine earn change asset values. change value capital, particularly bank's capital much high level demand regulator market, potentially affect bank's cost funds. in conformity hypothesis, various study find evidence loan provide bank capital-constrained seem sensitive change market interest rate loan provide highly capitalize banks.5 moreover, change financial condition bank may play role cyclical developments. i already mention case japan's "lost decade." close home, believe u.s. economy's recovery 1990-91 recession delay "financial headwinds," arise regional shortage bank capital (bernanke lown, 1991). one might view idea bank somehow "special" ability gather information screen monitor borrower rather dated. bank continue play central role credit markets; particular, burgeon market loan sales, bank originate considerably loan keep books. nevertheless, nonbank lender become increasingly important many credit markets, relatively borrower restrict bank source 4 in recent years, community bank appear become increasingly important lend small business (avery samolyk, 2004). 5 kishan opiela, (2000), kishan opiela, (2006), gambacorta (2005). bi review 68/2007 5 credit. of course, nonbank lender access insure deposits. however, fund loan borrow capital market sell loan securitizers. doe rise nonbank lender make bank-lending channel irrelevant? i sure does. like banks, nonbank lender raise fund order lend, cost raise fund depend financial condition – net worth, leverage, liquidity, example. thus, nonbank lender also face external finance premium presumably influence economic development monetary policy. the level premium pay turn affect rate offer borrowers. thus, idea underlie bank-lending channel might reasonably extend private provider credit. further investigation possibility would quite worthwhile. conclusion i take whirlwind tour several decade research variation financial condition borrowers, whether arise change monetary policy forces, affect short-term economic dynamics. the critical idea cost fund borrower depend inversely creditworthiness, measure indicator net worth liquidity. endogenous change creditworthiness may increase persistence amplitude business cycle (the financial accelerator) strengthen influence monetary policy (the credit channel). a i note today, call bank-lending channel – idea bank play special role transmission monetary policy – integrate broad logical framework, focus link bank's financial condition cost capital. nonbank lender may well subject forces. let conclude offer best wish stimulate enjoyable last day conference. policymakers scholar benefit efforts. reference

inflation targeting, describe next. section 3 analyze document result improve monetary policy emerge economy chile last two decades. brief conclusion close presentation. 1. macroeconomic adjustment emerge economy macroeconomic management emerge market improve substantially last decade. in particular, favorable world economic condition result important term trade gain associate time fiscal prudence, complement monetary exchange-rate policy aim achieve maintain price stability. four area macroeconomic adjustment: fiscal, monetary exchange rate policies, financial system the main change take place four key areas: (i) adoption sustainable responsible fiscal policies, reflect decline fiscal deficit emerge economy (figure 1); (ii) adoption float regime hard pegs, move away intermediate exchange-rate (er) regimes; (iii) shift monetary policy (mp) anchor er monetary aggregate inflation-targeting (it) anchor, particularly latin america; (iv) change accompany strengthen regulation supervision financial systems, support strong financial development. shift toward flexible er regime the world shift toward flexible er regime pronounced. the evidence show significant shift away intermediate regimes. in 1990, nearly 70% country pursue variant intermediate er regimes, share drop 41% end 1990s, 30% 2004 (figure 2)1. exit intermediate regime frequently towards float rather hard pegs. the share floater increase 15% 1990 45% 2004 while, extreme, share hard peg rise 15% 26% time span. the latter increase hard peg reflects, extent, establishment european monetary union 1999. the share country crawl peg – popular regime among higher-inflation economy – drop 14% 1 a new imf database de facto er regime adopt imf member country allow classify country three broad er regimes: hard peg (formal dollarization, currency union, currency boards), intermediate regime (conventional fix pegs, crawl pegs, crawl bands, tightly manage floats), float er regime (managed float predetermine er path independently float rates). 2 bi review 68/2007 1990 6% 2001. in contrast, country crawl band tightly manage float rise 10% begin 1990s 31% year 2001. crawl band offer – least short-term – flexibility cop volatile capital flow avoid extreme er misalignments, rigid er regimes. tightly manage floats, hand, keep anchor role exchange rate without commit explicit target parity. the transition er regime come shift mp regime base er monetary-growth anchor it framework, particularly emerge economies. the number country it rise 8 1999 21 2004 (tables 1-2), many consider adopt it near future. this transition mp regime pronounce latin america. while 1994 twelve country region place er anchor, four others monetary growth anchor, 2004 three country remain er anchor. the transition policy framework 1994-2004 lead significant rise number latin american country float regime (from three twelve countries) inflation target framework (from one five countries). 2. chile’s transition current monetary policy framework the macroeconomic institutional policy framework chile transform radically last 25 years, one make stabilization exceptional result one facilitate achieve price stability. chile’s current macroeconomic framework base four pillars: (i) autonomous central bank explicit mandate safeguard stability price payments; (ii) low public-debt gdp ratio fiscal policy rule anchor structural fiscal surplus; (iii) robust financial system, dynamic, competitive, well capitalize bank industry, appropriately regulate supervised; (iv) full-fledged inflation target monetary framework, complement float er regime. substantial progress make cbc autonomy since 1980s, autonomy weak, even low level average emerge economy. the grant legal independence 1989 constitutional law, lead much improve position international rank central bank autonomy. particularly economic independence central bank – freedom take policy decision independently political interference – place chile well average level independence emerge develop economy 2003. chile show responsible fiscal policy, contribute significantly successful monetary policy. during 1990s, fiscal balance average surplus 1.5% gdp. the above-mentioned structural fiscal surplus rule stabilize government spend time, link explicitly permanent government revenue. therefore fiscal dominance monetary policy rule chile, result central bank autonomy chile’s sound fiscal policy. public debt show substantial decline since 1990s, result prudent fiscal policy. the share consolidate gross public debt reduce 76% gdp 1990 20% gdp 2006, whereas consolidate net public debt position turn 34% gdp 1990 -6% 2006 (figure 3). the successful performance fiscal position enhance fiscal balance rule apply since 2001 (figure 4). chile’s good growth performance, complement market-based incentive structure, appropriate regulation sound supervision financial system, result safe sound financial system deep capital markets. a result major bank crisis come deep 1982-1983 recession, 1986 bank law enhance regulation supervision financial system. since then, financial system develop around well-managed capitalize bank sector healthy competitive. this feature also rule financial dominance monetary policy chile. the cbc share normative attribution specialize public institution, focus formulation financial regulation applicable monetary markets. chile’s financial system strength acclaim international credit rat agencies. moody’s financial strength rank place chile’s financial strength close top industrial country (figure 5). bi review 68/2007 3 monetary policy framework: central bank charter objective although road cbc autonomy begin mid-1970s, 1989 constitutional law cbc specify bank’s objective grant cbc necessary instrument comply legal mandate. since 1989, cbc autonomous, technical institution, govern constitution, full legal capacity, control equity, indefinite duration. the constitutional law establish two objective cbc. the first objective preserve stability chile’s currency. this mean avoid loss purchase power due inflation. the latter objective achieve ensure inflation remain low stable. the second objective cbc ensure normal function domestic external payments, safeguard financial sector’s primary function credit save intermediation, provision payment services, proper risk allocation financial markets. cbc’s constitutional law prohibit cbc credit government. in order contribute policy coordination information sharing, minimize potential conflict fiscal monetary authority consequence cbc autonomy, constitutional law mandate participation finance minister monetary policy meetings, without vote right temporary right suspend board decision. furthermore, law state cbc policy decision must take account government’s general economic policy orientation. overview evolution mp framework the chilean experience it split two periods. the first one – 1991 1999 – fall short many aspect full-fledged inflation target framework. this first phase feature one anchor (an er band, addition inflation target) low level mp transparency communication. the second phase – 2000 present – feature single inflation target active communication strategy mp. in context report annual monetary program congress, cbc announcement annual inflation target arise natural response legal mandate price-level stability. in 1991, first official target – 15%-20% annual target range – publicly announce september 1990 dec. 1990–dec. 1991 rate annual cpi inflation. from 1990 1996, target set annually target range september subsequent calendar year, 1997 1999 target point (figure 6). between 1991 2001, annual target low 1.5 percentage point per year average. inflation performance improve considerably period, achieve reduction 20%-30% annually low single-digit rates. however, independence effectiveness mp hind conflict exchange-rate-band, annual inflation targets, capital controls. transition full-fledged it framework implement inflation converge 3%, monetary policy strengthen attainment inflation targets, er band replace float er regime, capital control fully abolished. from 2000 2006, target define annual cpi inflation range 2% 4%, monetary policy horizon define 12 24 months. since 2007, mp objective keep annual cpi inflation rate time around 3%, within symmetric tolerance range one percentage point, focus policy horizon around two years. this target redefinition strengthen 3% level nominal anchor economy, recognize inflation temporarily deviate 3+/-1% range accommodate transitory shocks. in parallel, horizon monetary policy extend around two years. the latter change largely explicit acknowledgment monetary policy conduct precede years. transparency communication in last decade, central bank around world significantly improve communication public markets. this provide institutional legitimacy substantive accountability. more transparency good communication also improve mp effectiveness, contribute good understand mp private sector. mp affect spend decisions, output, price effect market expectation future course monetary policy, rather direct effect change short-term mpr. 4 bi review 68/2007 since 2000 cbc make large effort deliver good information market explain it regime operates. a series communication device developed, include disclosure relevant data minimum time lag make information available cbc website, significant number technical publications, include monetary policy report (with four-monthly frequency, since may 2000); financial stability report (semi-annual, since 2004); monetary policy framework document (updated january 2007, previous may 2000), projection model book (since 2003). the cbc publish monthly mp meet date six month advance (since 2000), summary mp minute board members’ vote decision (since 2000), background information mp minute (since july 2005). the time lag release minute low first 90 45 days, five day next monthly mp meeting. 3. monetary policy result emerge economy chile convergence inflation developed-country level there several empirical study explore emerge economy general, chile particular, benefit implementation it regime. the evidence show it helpful bring inflation low single-digit level emerge economies. it show adoption it play lead role emerge economies’ successful convergence inflation level observe develop economy (mishkin schmidt-hebbel, 2007). small deviation inflation target chile it show also it country successful attain inflation target non-it country (mishkin schmidt-hebbel, 2007). the introduction it also help chile attain level inflation close target levels. albagli schmidt-hebbel (2004) provide international comparison inflation performance deviation target 21 it countries. they consider average relative deviation inflation target since begin it country. the result show chile second accurate it country hit inflation target (figure 7). since adoption full-fledged it chile 2000, average annual inflation 2.9%, remain around 75% time within target range. only 10% time inflation rate rise upper target bound, 15% time inflation fell low bind (figure 8). inflation target credibility adoption it also contribute buildup credibility monetary policy it countries. several author show it regime help anchor inflation expectation level close inflation target inflation expectation stable u.s. (ramos et al., 2007; gürkaynak et al., 2007). in chile, distance inflation expectation inflation target close target converge toward stationary 3% level central bank show strong commitment attain target (céspedes soto, 2005). during past five years, inflation expectation remain close mid-point inflation target range, reflect high credibility it regime (figure 9). inflation target stability emerge economy experience reduction volatility inflation output (figure 10). however, volatility reduction pronounce it country non-it countries. volatility growth inflation fall significantly chile, even comparison it countries. two factor explain volatility reduction it countries: small shock hit economy improvement monetary policy efficiency (mishkin schmidt-hebbel, 2007). figure 11 depict estimate average efficiency frontier mp emerge economy adoption it (orange schedule) observe pair output inflation volatility (red point). bi review 68/2007 5 the figure also depict estimate average efficiency frontier mp emerge economy it adoption, period stationary inflation target (blue line) observe pair output inflation volatility (green dot). on one hand, shift efficiency frontier toward origin reflect small shock face emerge economy since stationary it place. on hand, observe combination output inflation volatility move close efficiency frontier, reveal correspond improvement monetary policy efficiency. in case, small shock explain 58% current performance, improvement monetary policy explain 42% decline volatilities. chile also record massive improvement monetary policy management. not chile face small shocks, reflect inward shift mp efficiency frontier, also mp efficiency improve significantly, reflect close position observe volatility efficiency frontier (see figure 12). contribution central bank policy macroeconomic stability emerge economy improve mp practices. however, contribution monetary policy macroeconomic performance still low. the annual report competitiveness prepare institute management development (imd) show position emerge economy country rank contribution central bank policy development change significantly since 1998. however, chile record major improvement past decade. in 1998, cbc rank 25 among 60 countries, reach first place world rank 2004, hold place subsequent year (figures 13-14). 4. conclusion macroeconomic condition improve significantly emerge economy since early 1990s. emerge economy show major progress fiscal responsibility sustainability; adoption framework central bank autonomy, monetary regime base it, large exchange-rate flexibility; achievement financial system strength. adoption flexible exchange rate it regime contribute low output inflation volatility, strong credibility central bank policies. macroeconomic stability often accomplish gradually. chile adopt it regime two distinct phase implement solid macroeconomic framework base central bank autonomy clear focus price stability. this support solvent, responsible, predictable fiscal policy solid well-regulated financial system. chile’s good record attain inflation level close target strengthen private sector confidence cbc raise mp effectiveness credibility. low inflation credible monetary policy represent essential macroeconomic achievement. by improve policy framework, support strong transparency, accountability, communication, cbc lay major foundation chile’s macroeconomic stability. yet conquest predictability inflation guaranteed. the cbc remain vigilant, improve policy framework need continue deliver high level macroeconomic stability. reference albagli, e. k. schmidt-hebbel (2004), “by how much why inflation targeters miss their targets?”, mimeo, central bank chile. céspedes, l. c. soto (2005),

introductory remark mr jean-pierre roth, chairman govern board swiss national bank chairman board director bank international settlements, half-yearly medium news conference, berne, 14 june 2007. * * * the swiss national bank raise target range three-month libor immediate effect 0.25 percentage point 2.00–3.00%. with move, national bank ensure inflation prospect remain favourable. the snb intend hold rate middle target range time being. switzerland's economy excellent shape. indeed, economy develop even good expect back march. for 2007, national bank expect real gdp grow rate close 2.5%. the healthy economy neighbour country exchange rate development contribute factors. together renew rise oil prices, lead slight deterioration inflation prospect – even today's increase interest rate. assume three-month libor remain unchanged 2.50%, national bank expect average annual inflation rate 0.8% 2007, 1.5% 2008, 1.7% 2009. consequently, forecast inflation continue rise. however, present considerable uncertainty regard assessment inflation outlook. on one hand, structural change economy still dampen effect prices. on hand, give high level capacity utilisation movement exchange rate, danger high production cost increasingly pass prices. should economic momentum remain unchanged movement swiss franc result relaxation monetary conditions, increase interest rate likely month ahead. economic outlook the international environment strong impact economic development switzerland. accord imf forecasts, global economy poise grow sustain rate approximately 5% 2007. while economic activity unite state satisfactory, little le dynamic expected. by contrast, economic situation europe clearly healthy expected. this encourage development favourable impact economy. economic activity switzerland continue dynamic first month year. in first quarter, gross domestic product (gdp) 3.2% saar, exceed long-term average growth rate significant amount. the strong economic performance assist recovery labour market. employment industry well construction service areas. a result, unemployment figure drop unemployment rate fell level 3%. demand indicator still trend upwards, result renew drop unemployment month ahead. moreover, labour demand continue meet significant influx labour abroad. the open labour market within context bilateral agreement eu create additional growth potential. the competitive position economy high, recent depreciation swiss franc foreign exchange market give additional boost. while export continue increase rapid pace, growth rate may slow somewhat compare 2006. the healthy state economy improvement labour market favourable impact consumer sentiment. since begin year, household spend increase steady pace. a continuance trend possible, since current near full employment likely lead increase real wages. during next quarters, company continue step equipment investment since rate technical capacity utilisation – particular manufacture sector – high. construction investment stabilise high level. bi review 67/2007 1 these development demand component lead u revise gdp growth forecast upwards 2007. for current year, expect growth close 2.5%. development monetary financial condition in swiss capital market, observe steady increase long-term interest rate past three months. the yield 10-year swiss confederation bond reach 3% may. real interest rate long maturity therefore register increase. this new development now, long-term interest rate clearly react progressive increase libor. this reinforce effort tighten monetary conditions, since economic activity react noticeably long-term interest rate short-term ones. by contrast, foreign exchange markets, movement swiss franc result relaxation monetary conditions. a begin 2006, swiss franc start lose grind steadily vis-à-vis euro. however, firm slightly dollar period. since march assessment, actual depreciation swiss franc, i.e. weight term export , amount 1.7%. the correspond relaxation monetary condition weaken effect policy lift interest rate increase inflationary pressure two channels. one one hand, bring increase import prices, could effect consumer prices. even though impact channel may diminish past year due increase competition, guarantee – current backdrop near full employment – reactivated. on hand, strengthen competitive position economy, thereby give export economic activity boost. a consequence, weak franc could heighten inflationary pressure economy already run full steam. on credit market, growth mortgage lend slowly receding, current rate increase 5%. the “other loans” category continue expand rapidly, match observation past comparable phase economic cycle. this category grow rate 8–10%, begin 2000s, level fact considerably exceed level currently experiencing. m1 m2 shrank, nothing ordinary phase rise interest rates. when happens, save sight deposit shift time deposits. m1 m2 affect substitution. m3, affected, grow rate 2% 3%, appropriate expand economy. inflationary risk in current environment, price stability subject three type risk: the first risk connect development price oil. the barrel price brent crude rise 40%, usd 51.0 january usd 71.7 may. this lead high inflation course year. unlike oil price hike 2004 2006, recent rally take place capacity utilisation higher. if current surge oil price continue, could affect price easily previously. the second risk due fact demand grow rapid pace relation development production capacity. we estimate gdp growth rate sustain without push inflation – potential gdp growth – 1.5% 2%. this low growth rate observe since 2006. measure output gap tricky, however, certain favourable factors, influx skilled labour, deregulation certain domestic market increase global competition might push potential gdp growth. have say this, however, overlook factor opposite effect. for instance, equipment investment receded, dampen effect potential growth. moreover, even capacity utilisation whole excessive, bottleneck might occur certain sector economy. and, all, experience show output gap often underestimate phase growth. consequently, risk underestimate output gap may great overestimate it. the third risk associate future development swiss franc. a exchange rate determine market, subject fluctuations. movement export-weighted swiss franc index alter degree restrictiveness monetary policy. normally, period rise 2 bi review 67/2007 interest rates, index tend increase, thereby amplify effect monetary policy mitigate price increase import product slow expansion economic activity. this reaction pattern observe past two years, could put pressure interest rates. monetary policy decision before comment decision today, i would like point change shape current environment. in december 2005, present cycle interest rate hike began, concern normalisation interest rate level – time libor 0.75% – allow economy reduce level unused resources. our concern ensure monetary condition healthy state economy jeopardise price stability medium term. we still observe competitive pressure market high, labour market flexible movement monetary aggregate moderate. however, analysis current situation demonstrate inflation outlook deteriorate different respect since last assessment: high oil price impact consumer price index; economic performance, good expected, result improve utilisation rate increase pressure price and, finally, renew weaken swiss franc neutralise intend tighten monetary conditions. today's decision raise target range three-month libor 25 basis point take account deterioration outlook price stability. inflation forecast graph i turn last part remarks. what inflation forecast? the dash red curve represent new forecast cover period second quarter 2007 first quarter 2010. it show inflation outlook today's increase libor assumption level 2.50% keep constant forecast period. for purpose comparison, dash-dotted green curve show inflation forecast march monetary assessment base libor 2.25%. the combine effect high oil prices, economic development good expect weak franc lead deterioration inflation forecast come months. today's interest rate rise stabilise rate inflation slightly high level mid-2008 onwards establish last march. inflation subsequently continue rise approach 2% mark towards end forecast period. * * * in lift three-month libor 25 basis point today, deterioration inflation prospect past month offset. any forecast decision obviously fraught uncertainty risk. should economic momentum remain unchanged movement swiss franc result relaxation monetary conditions, increase interest rate likely month ahead. bi review 67/2007 3 4 bi review 67/2007 thomas jordan: currency reserve adjustments, sic payment system financial market development introductory remark mr thomas jordan, member govern board swiss national bank, half-yearly medium news conference, berne, 14 june 2007. * * * in remarks, i would like address three topics. first, i speak adjustment composition currency reserves. then, i would like comment swiss interbank clear (sic) payment system twenty year existence. at end, i say word development financial markets. 1. adjustment composition currency reserve the swiss national bank adjust composition currency reserves. before end september 2009 sell 250 tonne gold increase foreign exchange reserve correspond amount. the overall level currency reserve remain unchanged. the gold sale fall within bind set second gold agreement 8 march 2004, central bank eurosystem, plus sverige riksbank swiss national bank, agree limit gold sale period five years, begin 28 september 2004. the gold agreement specify annual sale signatory may exceed 500 tonne total sale volume period shall amount 2,500 tonnes. for gold sale planning, snb allocate quota claim central bank party agreement 2004. the snb choose approach gold sale avoid market unrest, regular sale transactions. the swiss national bank hold currency reserve form foreign currency gold, thereby ensure room manoeuvre monetary policy times. a result sharp rise price gold, proportion currency reserve hold gold increase quarter since mid 2005, 33% current level 42%. the purpose snb's gold sale rebalance composition currency reserve respect monetary policy requirements. moreover, reduce gold reserve increase foreign exchange reserves, overall risk snb asset decline. once sale completed, swiss national bank's gold hold amount 1,040 tonnes. 2. swiss interbank clear (sic) celebrate 20th anniversary over next days, swiss interbank clear system sic celebrate 20th anniversary. in 1987, introduction sic payment system represent revolution swiss payment transactions. sic one first payment system world type know real time gross settlement (rtgs). before introduction sic, payment switzerland first offset system eight clear houses. the net position settle banks’ sight deposit snb. this system extremely cumbersome, costly fraught large credit systemic risks. in sic contrast, payment settle individually directly via sight deposit snb. thus, payment final irrevocable – like cash payments. sic extremely efficient drastically reduce credit systemic risks. it one secure cost-effective system world. nowadays, sic form backbone switzerland’s payment system. not interbank payment transactions, also payment transaction postfinance bank well cashless retail payment transaction essentially carry via sic. in addition, international foreign currency settlement system, continuous link settlement (cls), link sic. sic, together trade platform swx/eurex security settlement system secom sis, form swiss value chain, switzerland’s integrate financial market infrastructure. the sic payment system utmost importance financial stability implementation snb’s monetary policy. our bi review 67/2007 1 monetary policy instrument tailor palette integrate sic function within framework swiss value chain. initially, sic turnover term value amount chf 100 billion per work day; currently stand chf 180 billion. the number transactions, however, increase far markedly. one year sic launch, approximately 130,000 transaction process day. now, twenty year later, average 1.3 billion – i.e. ten time – transaction carry per work day. the growth trend sic look set continue upward path. the rise turnover transaction depend largely economic growth, technical innovation payment instrument development swiss financial centre. the snb partially outsource sic operations. sic ag, telekurs group company, responsible technical operation development system. the snb steer liquidity sic system, set condition participation responsible crisis management. cooperation sic ag snb excellent. the snb would like congratulate sic ag telekurs group anniversary thank outstanding quality work. the board director swx group, si group telekurs group recently sign declaration intent regard merger companies, goal found swiss financial centre infrastructure hold company. sic ag, rather telekurs group, would part hold company. the snb affect development different ways. on one hand, direct contractual partner three company involved. on hand, task oversee systemically relevant payment security settlement systems. the swiss value chain, run three companies, vital importance implementation monetary policy. there alternative infrastructure monetary policy operations. therefore, keep close watch development area. 3. development financial market the positive underlie sentiment international financial market remain largely unchanged first half 2007, despite turbulence stock markets, rather strong times, difficulty u sub-prime mortgage market. on 27 february, correction chinese stock market, major fall share price record worldwide. the price decline temporarily give rise fear current bull market, last many year now, could come end. after days, however, market return normal. a week later, share index already compensate loss (figure 1). a correction occur past days. however, despite turbulence, rise implicit volatility – measure expect uncertainty – relatively insignificant short-lived historical terms. implicit volatility still low level (figure 2). in addition, interest premium credit risk company emerge economy remain low, although yield long-term government bond increase markedly since begin march. a case financial market turbulence may 2006, late correction stock market negotiate without major difficulties. the positive underlie sentiment market appetite high-risk investment remain part unabated. not least, probably attributable extensive investment requirement worldwide associate high level liquidity part investors. this large requirement high-risk investment originate dynamic growth rate prevail time now, high save ratio worldwide, globalisation liberalisation financial market well increasingly professionalise asset management private, government institutional investors. the durability valuation high-risk investment extremely difficult assess, since valuation depend subjective expectation future earnings, discount rate volatilities. the late turbulence salutary reminder risks, however. in past, risk premium level low ever record before, rapidly rise price many high-risk investment category hectic activity area company acquisition sign development sustainable long run. therefore, market participant allow distract short-lived nature financial market setback far simply extrapolate favourable market trend past year future. 2 bi review 67/2007 the steady rise price high-risk investments, low risk premium low volatility might possibly even influence external value swiss franc. let comment statement little detail. in international currency portfolios, swiss franc always safe currency. in past, reflect fact swiss franc rise investment situation uncertain. thus, swiss franc take kind insurance function many investor hold swiss franc investment protect political economic crises. just swiss franc particularly attractive safe stormy conditions, little interest swiss franc weather calm. due low level risk awareness risk aversion present, demand generate hedge thus swiss franc weak. however, past, phase calm weather foreign exchange market repeatedly intersperse stormy periods. therefore, financial market participant market player exchange rate exposure remain aware exchange rate risk incurring. bi review 67/2007 3 4 bi review 67/2007 krzysztof rybiński: the role euro future poland speech mr krzysztof rybiński, deputy president national bank poland, international conference “the role euro future poland”, warsaw, 15 june 2007. * * * only month ago eurozone enlarge second time. slovenia become first twelve new member state eu thirteenth country adopt common european currency. now two countries, i.e. malta cyprus, knock euro’s door, others line “monetary club membership”. this seem good occasion return the, lively, discussion advantage disadvantage join monetary union. indeed, still reason come back periodically euro cost & benefit debate, since data, world change rapidly even economic theory subject evolution. let illustrate one example. it long widely accept view asymmetric shock big threat currency unions. nowadays respect economist think may case. and thus, willem buiter erik nielsen recent paper (2007): “mundell his head: asymmetric shock good you, thank economic monetary union europe”, argue home bias recede eurozone, increase number household company hold euro-wide portfolio. in finance good return particular asset negatively correlated, help diversify risk achieve good risk-return tradeoff. therefore, asymmetric shock hit monetary union, result negatively correlate return euro-zone asset portfolio, portfolio holder good comparison scenario symmetric negative shock. of course train think may seem narrow, since boil merely capital income analysis lose sight effect asymmetric shocks, labor market situation. nevertheless, example provide clear evidence cost benefit analysis may change every often tandem new idea smart people come with. however, i proceed, i would like make two important points. first, i would like note view present represent official position national bank poland. second, economic background allow speak term standard economic variables: output, consumption, price etc. on hand, i feel competent speak highly immeasurable value like national pride. notwithstanding fact people might derive utility pure fact wallet banknote polish king instead european bridges, i idea measure utility compare utility derive standard argument preference function like consumption. for reason i speak term standard macroeconomic variables, bear mind certainly whole story. if economist speak advantage disadvantage join common currency area, ultimately end compare cost benefit accession. this also way i would like proceed. however, bear mind many issue already describe several voluminous report (nbp 2004 poland, csajbok, csemerly 2002 hungary, hm treasury 2003 uk), i try focus issue le familiar general public potential risk factors. the nature issue mainly concentrate cost side analysis. thus, might seem lecture, i mainly care cost cost outweigh benefits. let me, beginning, stress mean case. a state president national bank poland, mr sławomir skrzypek, in-depth assessment cost benefit euro adoption poland need periodically repeat order make sure take account important factor fast change global economy. the national bank poland will play key role stimulate public debate cost benefit euro adoption. today’s conference good moment contribute debate, i would like thank organizer offer opportunity. let begin benefit side. economist typically concentrate follow source economic benefit relate monetary union. these are: • low transaction costs, • low interest rates, • financial integration, bi review 67/2007 1 • trade creation. elimination transaction cost incur company household relation zloty/euro exchange rate among obvious benefit single currency. these cost include, inter alia, bid-ask spreads, fee accompany exchange rate operation cost hedge exchange rate risk. any company could possibly calculate much would save transaction cost exchange rates. this also relatively unsophisticated whole economy, estimate approximately 0.2% gdp poland (nbp 2004). not much, worth saving. low interest rate induce investment, thus strengthen productive capacity economy make high output consumption possible. we expect case poland interest rate adjustment eurozone accession reduce long-term rate one percentage point. any estimation exact impact investment, output consumption subject several assumptions. nevertheless nbp’s analysis show interest rate reduction main source benefit join euro (borowski 2003). research show elimination exchange rate fluctuation coordination monetary policy within euro zone main drive force behind financial integration europe (fratzscher 2001; galati tsatsaronis 2001; european commission 2002; ecb 2006). integration, turn, promote competition financial markets, lead improve efficiency financial intermediary reduction cost services. a single currency provide domestic company access liquid deep financial markets, drive cost capital, also allow good risk diversification. therefore, apart stimulate economic growth, development financial market also reduce output fluctuations. since empirical research indicate country relatively le develop financial market benefit financial integration (giannetti et al. 2002), believe poland among large beneficiary process (nbp 2004). the benefit know least relate trade creation. in groundbreaking study rise (2000) estimate join currency union may boost cross-country trade 200%. most economist agree direction mechanism behind – single currency eliminate uncertainty relate exchange rate movement thus diminish risk relate foreign trade. however, estimate scale seem much exaggerated. one problematic issue relate fact eurozone, example currency union develop countries. so rise study base data currency union involve poor and/ small countries. a note micco, stein ordonez (2003), “one need eurosceptic wonder whether find directly applicable europe’s single currency”. follow-up study (e.g. rise wincoop (2001), kenen (2002), persson (2001)) attempt correct rose’s estimate arrived, rather inconclusively, anything 50% 150% growth bilateral trade. recently, first study base euro area data emerged. these show trade creation effect euro substantial, although (until now) order magnitude small original rose’s estimate (e.g. micco, stein ordonez (2003)). our knowledge trade creation effect euro still far complete probably wait another 10+ year enough data draw firm conclusion magnitude eurozone. now let move cost side. a already note contrast benefits, cost contingent character. they tail-events – rather unlikely possibly high impact occur. let focus two issues: • asymmetric shocks, • arise micro- macroeconomic imbalances. shock definition something cannot foresee. asymmetric shock shock affect select member(s) monetary union. such event consider big threat union (mundell 1961), join common currency area substantially reduce set policy tool could use mitigate impact shock. let u assume negative demand shock affect polish economy (e.g. consumer decide buy le polish good services). in short medium run, bring reduction output high unemployment. a long poland currency, use monetary fiscal policy stimulate demand reduce impact shock output employment. moreover, exchange rate might adjust (depreciate) thus make export price-competitive. once eurozone, two 2 bi review 67/2007 channel closed. first, independent domestic monetary policy could low interest rates, one expect ecb react local shock. second, join monetary union, polish currency replace euro, zloty/euro exchange rate adjustment long available. accordingly, policy tool leave euro area accession fiscal policy. for reason crucial importance run balance budget medium run, case negative shocks, room increase deficit, thus buff shock. additionally, also economic force bring economy back equilibrium. the prominent wage adjustment – negative shock, fall wage help reduce cost production – consequence – prices. this increase demand help economy return equilibrium. a crucial prerequisite channel operate smoothly flexible labor market – wage adjust immediately, increase unemployment economic slowdown avoided. we know, however, downward wage flexibility rarely see real life. regard asymmetric shocks, one thing seem certain. we able foresee serious asymmetric shock go affect polish economy join euro not. we speak term probability and, give data, seem probability huge shock occurrence seem limited. the polish economy strongly integrate eurozone, majority export go common currency area. moreover, study (e.g. fidrmuc, korhonen 2003, eickmeier, breitung 2005) show relatively high correlation business cycle poland eurozone. this substantially reduces, though eliminate, risk asymmetric shocks. look ahead, one see potential risk factors. one production clustering. if recently observe trend country specialization (e.g. slovakia specialize produce cars, india business process outsourcing) hold on, may increase risk asymmetric shock future (de grauwe 2003). another example possibly distant future asymmetric “shock” global warming. a recent report cite financial time (ft, 6 january 2007) show northern member eurozone likely profit southern member suffer climate change. nevertheless, whatever likelihood shocks, remain crucial importance maintain balance fiscal perspective flexible labor market absorb shocks, arise. now let move possibility rise micro- macroeconomic imbalances. they take form lend booms, current account deficit increase inflation pressure. such set symptom monetary union member country reveal case one common cause – low level real interest rates. economist long time argue economy appropriate, long-run level real interest rate call natural rate interest (wicksell 1898). keep interest rate (unfortunately unobserved) level guarantee economy remain equilibrium – output exceed production capacity inflation remain stable (woodford 2003). this implicitly explicitly inflation target central bank try achieve. one problem join common currency area might real interest rate area low natural rate new member. recent research show might case poland, natural rate remain past euro area level (brzoza-brzezina 2006). for poland, enter eurozone mean low nominal interest rate (the spread long-term rate still exceed 100 basis points) high inflation (due appreciation real exchange rate relate catch process, long available nominal exchange rate channel). together mean drop real interest rates, could induce people enterprise substantially increase borrowing, spend loan consumption investment goods. what could consequence this? first, borrow accelerate massively, bank may start extend loan without properly check customers’ creditworthiness – could result bad debt problems. it well know phenomenon (e.g. demirgüç-kunt, detragiache 1998, gourinchas et al. 2001) lend boom often follow bank sector crises. fortunately, recent research potential lend boom poland euro area accession forecast rather moderate increase lend (schadler et al. 2005, brzoza-brzezina 2005), show expect credit growth rather equilibrium phenomenon – structural adjustment negative consequence (kiss al. 2006). nevertheless, even serious lend boom euro area accession seem unlikely, policymakers remain vigilant prudent bank sector supervision right answer protect oneself risk developments. bi review 67/2007 3 second, high domestic demand fuel inflation pressure increase imports, thus lead high current account deficit. a latter, seem outside monetary union deep current account deficit worry investor can, extreme situations, lead currency crises, country already join common currency development matter much. an example three baltic state (estonia, latvia lithuania), whose currency board arrangement close equivalent monetary union, show enormous current account deficit (9-16% gdp 2006) apparent negative consequence economy, yet. the case is, however, different inflation pressure. in theory, margin local demand-driven price increase small member state monetary union narrow. this guarantee call law one price – expectation product price various country monetary union. in practice, however, several obstacle law hold perfectly – good cannot traded, good perfect substitutes, transportation cost tax differential – local demand pressure play role drive price monetary union member states. a consequence, product manufacture country become expensive country loose competitiveness (e.g. estrada, lopez-salido 2001). it relatively difficult foresee polish economy react demand pressure euro area. however, case asymmetric shocks, labor market flexibility probably best answer describe phenomena. it allow smooth relatively painless adjustment economy loos competitiveness. sum up, i discuss select aspect cost-benefit analysis poland’s adoption euro, special focus issue le familiar general public. a i argued, cost materialize asymmetric shock hit enlarge eurozone. we know likelihood shock though, impossible calculate expect value cost relate events. we know, however, probability asymmetric shock decline rise similarity progress real convergence eu economies. let also stress magnitude cost depend crucially domestic policy – prudent bank sector supervision, labor market reform sound fiscal policy name few. adoption proper policy reduce future potential cost relate euro-zone membership and, time, enhance future benefits. in view, give evidence reform halt many country enter eurozone, measure take euro area accession. thank attention. references: 1. borowski j.

lady gentlemen, allow welcome behalf national bank serbia occasion conference medium small size enterprise credit serbia. i would like discus two relate subject – stability prices, i.e. inflation, role nb provide credit finance small medium size enterprises. stability price business environment represent one key condition success economy whole particularly success small medium-sized enterprises. in contrast large enterprise “connections”, access insider information aware economic political power, medium small size enterprise usually treat ornament, social economic category – serf purpose. a stability prices, currently level people remember ever see because, back than, either yet bear really much interest matter all. inflation today, 44 year day, match level record 1963. in may year, year-on-year, rate headline inflation equal 4.4% core inflation reach 3.o%. at time, economy grow rate around 7% (first quarter 2007 period year earlier) display great abundance variety cheap credit see serbia long time, exchange rate dinar float freely three month without intervention nbs, foreign exchange reserve grow excess us$ 12.2 billion. stability seem bring number unexpected effect “operating normal business environment”, almost whole economy kind grow unaccustomed course last 44 years, fact that: • market imply competition, glorify success put persistent pressure increase productivity. one long get phrase like: “here i am, smart lad, successful, good look ….look me… exchange rate….it unrealistic, interest rate sky high, put administrative barrier and…..what happens…. product flop market.” of course, much easy build castle air think would successful somebody else, likely state, provide “right” condition us, face harshness reality! • what matter market determine environment offer high quality good services. you also need good banker, aware risk hedge them. to keep make progress profession, also need kind visionary! reality often harsh life seem much easy pretty engulf haze inflation instability which, tell truth, majority u get use last several decades. such environment create state, exclusively so, i amaze see citizen businessmen still appeal state expect resolve problems, general operate conditions, provide incentives, subsidies, price regressing, new loans, etc. well. bear mind country undergo transition, satisfy current rate inflation serbia. i wish point nb first “battle” inflation, shall win rest them. however, “war” begun, side are, speak figuratively, currently mobilize forces. the key question side shall budget take battle – declarative terms, term numbers! defence put nb maintain stability price manage hold wave consumption growth late last early year pending parliamentary elections. let remind fact set bi review 66/2007 1 inflation target could predict new elections, always imply increase expenditures. now, election over, serbia nb deserve reform-oriented restrictive budget chance take deep breath term monetary policy, think next do. the difference successful man failure fact one know one know do, fact one work one keep talking. there hardly another issue serbia today people agree fact public sector wage grow way much way fast cut back low level. let point anybody think cut make expense national bank serbia, is, inflation, much wrong. such calculation totally misplaced. the nb shall prevent outcome and, let remind already show successful respect! each day lose term decrease wage bill public sector public enterprise – i repeat, wage bill individual wage – lose day. i guarantee go see return monetary fairy tale last last four decade and, even serbia get budget deserves, go increase inflation. you may ask, so? and i say, follow way. a far case, nb force increase level restrictiveness monetary policy (which mean high repo rate, high reserve requirement, etc.) compensate insufficiently tight fiscal policy. the nb clear task – “to achieve maintain price stability”. that task compliance law, shall certainly best achieve it. a far back 2001, nb give strong support provision credit small medium size enterprise serbia act agent extension credit line european agency

kroszner: encourage responsible mortgage lend – prospective rulemaking initiative remark mr randall s kroszner, member board governor u federal reserve system, public hear home ownership equity protection act (hoepa), federal reserve board, washington dc, 14 june 2007. * * * i please today chair federal reserve board's public hear home ownership equity protection act (hoepa). the hear focus specifically board might use rulemaking authority hoepa address concern abusive mortgage lend practices. in course hearing, hear key player home mortgage market: lenders, brokers, secondary market participants, consumer advocacy community development organizations, academic researchers, state regulators. although play different roles, share common goal: encourage responsible mortgage lend benefit individual consumer american economy whole. the congress enact hoepa 1994 response concern abusive lend home equity market, federal reserve board give broad authority implement provision adopt regulation board find necessary proper effectuate purposes. in addition, board responsibility prohibit act practice find unfair deceptive, otherwise design evade hoepa. the board understand rulemaking responsibility hoepa alone face important task prevent unfair deceptive practices. other regulator share responsibility ensure responsible mortgage lend enforcement powers. the state extensive regulatory authority – responsibility – anti-predatory lend statutes, various relevant legal authorities, especially mortgage industry license act – give considerable control activity mortgage broke lenders. many states, include notably represent afternoon's panel, active rein bad actor mortgage markets. the ftc also share enforcement responsibility hoepa federal laws. finally, federal financial regulatory agency duty enforce federal consumer protection laws, include hoepa, respect depository institution respective supervisory ambits. in light sheer magnitude task, please regulator contribute goal ensure healthy, competitive, responsible mortgage market. we commit work closely federal state regulator ensure law protect consumer enforced. hoepa also direct board hold hear one hold today, ass effectiveness regulation law protect consumers. hear provide u valuable information. in recent prior hearings, hold last summer four city around country, goal include assess effectiveness 2001 amendment hoepa rule curb abusive lend practice preserve access credit. we also want gather information effectiveness mortgage disclosure require regulation z, pursuant truth lend act, inform review disclosures, underway now. rise foreclosure subprime market past year lead board consider whether use rulemaking authority address concerns. in so, however, must walk fine line. we must determine help weed abuse also preserve incentive responsible lenders. a robust responsible subprime mortgage market benefit consumer allow borrower blemish limit credit history become homeowners, access equity homes, flexibility refinance loan needed. in task several tool disposal. these include require disclosure lenders, rule prohibit abusive practices, principles-based guidance supervisory oversight, le formal effort work industry participant promote best practices, consumer education materials. the federal reserve currently conduct thorough review policy respect tools. last year, together federal bank regulators, issue guidance concern so-called nontraditional mortgages. we also issue propose supervisory guidance concern underwrite standard disclosure subprime mortgages. the agency finish review comment receive expect issue final version soon. and federal reserve bi review 66/2007 1 produce range consumer education materials, include information help potential borrower understand adjustable-rate alternative mortgages, actively promote financial education partner outside organizations. the two tool focus today, however, lender disclosure consumer rule prohibit restrict lend practices. disclosure provide information critical effective function markets. a core principle economics market competitive, therefore efficient, accurate information available participants. information help consumer improve ability compare mortgage product choose help meet personal goals. we keenly aware, however, substantial volume disclosure document mortgage lend already entails, sensitive risk much information may practically little value many consumer information all. accordingly, intend consider mortgage disclosure comprehensively, eye improve usefulness consumers, remain mindful total burden industry. perhaps importantly, engage extensive consumer test mortgage disclosures, ensure disclosure provide information consumer readily use. our goal good disclosures, necessarily disclosures. we also recognize disclosure may always sufficient combat abusive practices. because bad lend practice may require additional measures, federal reserve seriously consider might use rulemaking authority address abusive practice without restrict consumers' access beneficial finance option responsible subprime credit. in addition improve disclosures, regulation restrict prohibit practice "unfair deceptive" may also necessary. we hear concern consumer steer mortgage cannot afford repeat refinance involve close cost strip away borrower's home equity. today, gather information might craft rule stop abusive practices. we also seek information state official regard experience draft law rule combat predatory lend efficiently effectively. during today's hearing, seek information panelist certain specific questions. i would like close briefly touch those. there four term practice frequently cite troublesome mortgage market, especially subprime home equity markets. they are: • prepayment penalties, • failure require escrow tax insurance, • state income low-documentation lending, • failure give adequate consideration borrower's ability repay loan. at least practice beneficial least consumers. for example, inform borrower might choose loan prepayment penalty exchange low interest rate low close costs. on hand, prepayment penalty also abusive, borrower unaware adjustable rate mortgage loan substantial prepayment penalty extend beyond first adjustment loan's interest rate, make costly impossible borrower refinance loan avoid high interest rate payment. we hope gather information help u determine whether rule prevent abusive use loan term practice preserve use instance provide benefit consumers. give adequate consideration borrower's ability repay loan obviously benefit borrower lenders. recently, board federal financial regulatory agency issue guidance reinforce collective belief principle prudent underwrite require consideration borrower's repayment ability. for example, agency provide lender qualify borrower nontraditional mortgage product interest-only loan payment option adjustable-rate mortgage product base fully-indexed rate fully amortize payment. some urge board adopt broad principle rule, others urge board preserve lender flexibility exercise judgment determine likelihood give borrower repay loan. while seem self-evident adequate consideration repayment ability necessary, experience craft guidance teach u principle far easy articulate general term detailed, prescriptive rule state underwrite practice constitute "adequate" consideration. this especially true context mortgage credit 2 bi review 66/2007 underwriting, depend great number pertinent, consumer-specific considerations. today, help, intend explore detail type practice beneficial might problematic. we seek inform suggestion respect four practice i identified, well others commenters may identify, several regards. first, ask whether practice prohibited, restricted, subject increase disclosure requirements, so, why. second, ask whether new regulatory treatment practice limit certain type loan certain type borrowers, so, type why. finally, ask whether state law provision relate practice might serve model board adopt federal level, so, kind record state law curb abuse without restrict access responsible mortgage credit. your participation today, wealth pertinent information contribute panelist others, much appreciated. bi review 66/2007 3 timothy f geithner: asia, world economy international financial system remark mr timothy f geithner, president chief executive officer federal reserve bank new york, economic society singapore 2007 annual dinner, singapore, 13 june 2007. * * * good evening. i please able join tonight. the past decade one remarkable achievement asia. this testament resilience dynamism region, yet memory financial crisis remain vivid still exert powerful influence policy today. tonight, i want reflect policymakers learn crises, review extent progress since examine challenge ahead. the asian financial crisis late 1990s exceptional many respects. describe time first crisis 21st century, commonly regard without precedent fundamentally different previous emerge market financial crises. here country remarkable record rapid economic growth several decades, substantial rate investment, low inflation relatively strong fiscal positions. most conventional indicator economic performance financial strength suggest acute underlie vulnerability. yet crisis erupt remarkable speed force. the sudden collapse confidence lead sharp reversal capital flow region. on eve crises, net capital inflow asian crisis country equal almost 6 percent gdp. over next two years, flow capital fully reversed. income output contract abruptly: bad affect countries, gdp shrink 10 percentage point peak trough one case, contraction close 15 percent. by standards, financial crisis unusually severe. the crisis mark sudden dramatic break past, bring new sense vulnerability economy perceive strong successful. yet though characteristic asian crisis distinguish episode financial turmoil, share several important feature common crisis country modern, market-oriented financial systems. they largely unanticipated. a rise borrow create vulnerability shift asset prices. uncertainty scale nature underlie vulnerability magnify problem. contagion spread rapidly. market overshot. the fundamental economic financial weakness source vulnerability consequence interaction weak domestic financial systems, selective liberalization control capital flow fix exchange rate regimes. bank system combine relatively weak supervision broad government guarantees, explicit, commonly implicit, reflect tradition public sector intervention protect trouble company bank failure. tax regulatory incentive promote short-term borrow foreign currency bank system. capital inflows, largely bank system, help finance boom investment real estate. distortion financial system lead misallocation resource high rate private investment generate substantial improvement productivity. exchange rate regime domestic currency fix dollar generate false expectation stability, result increase unhedged borrow generate large exposure change exchange rate interest rates. by 1997, short-term external debt private sector rise substantially, relative gdp reserves, create condition similar classic bank run, crisis hit. the initial spark loss confidence still fully clear, often case financial crises. and although particular dynamic differ across country region, basic pattern common, rapid sustain effort domestic foreign investor reduce exposure losses. the initial effect behavior make exchange rate commitment untenable, commitment break currency fell, panic become self-reinforcing. uncertainty lack information feed run. market participant unable judge whether deteriorate development reflect temporary liquidity problem deep solvency issues. they bi review 65/2007 1 react assume worst. these shift market sentiment risk become self-validating, liquidity problem transform solvency problem broad risk default. the capacity policymakers restore stability constrain depth balance sheet problems. in cases, scale external borrow le acute, policymakers room act. but cases, policy option limited. initially, government reluctant let exchange rate move far, fear would force bank company borrow dollar yen default scale could damage growth. at time, authority reluctant tighten monetary policy way help stabilize exchange rate concern would hurt growth perhaps exacerbate flight domestic assets. this dilemma make initial policy response crisis country look halt tentative. and, uncertainty strength continuity political leadership hamper government effort recover credibility. in country hit hard crisis, loom issue succession election compound problem confidence. the crisis prompt search reassessment conventional economic wisdom new appreciation challenge come financial integration. the classic measure macroeconomic stability policy prudence, fiscal position measure inflation rates, could mask substantial structural weaknesses, structural weakness could ultimately undermine achievement otherwise reasonably conservative macroeconomic policy management. partial capital account

leader expand educational opportunities, also long grapple challenges, trouble high-school dropout rates, particularly minority immigrant youths, frustratingly slow uneven progress raise test score measure educational achievement. if make progress meet challenges, must will actively debate cause continually experiment innovate find solutions. the benefit education education impart significant benefit society individual pursue it. economist long recognize skill workforce important source economic growth. moreover, increase time return education skill likely single great cause long-term rise economic inequality, policy lead broad investment education train help reduce inequality expand economic opportunity (bernanke, 2007). but benefit education economic. a substantial body evidence demonstrate more-highly-educated individual happy average, make good personal financial decisions, suffer few spell unemployment, enjoy good health. benefit society whole, educate individual likely participate civic affairs, volunteer time charities, subscribe personal value – tolerance appreciation cultural difference bi review 106/2007 1 – increasingly crucial healthy function diverse society (glaeser, ponzetto, shleifer, 2006; dee, 2004). from macroeconomic standpoint, education important directly link productivity, which, turn, critical determinant overall standard living. the bureau labor statistic estimate that, 1987 2006, ongoing improvement education experience u.s. workforce contribute 0.4 percentage point per year increase nonfarm business labor productivity (u.s. department labor, 2007), significant amount. these estimate however conservative hold fix source productivity growth, accumulation various form capital advance technology; workers’ skill certainly contribute indirectly productivity growth affect factor well. for example, state technology affect creativity knowledge scientist engineer engage formal research development well effort skilled worker shop floor find efficient way accomplish give task. manager develop new business plan find new way use evolve technology also think add “intangible,” knowledge-based, capital firm, estimate comparable importance physical capital factory equipment (corrado, hulten, sichel, 2006). for individuals, economic return education substantial well. in 2006, median weekly earn college graduate 75 percent high earn high-school graduates. in turn, worker high-school degree earn 42 percent without diploma.1 these differential large growing; indeed, roughly double past twenty-five year so. the source widen wage gap more-educated less-educated nothing complicate supply demand. the demand more-educated worker increase rapidly, partly much widespread use computer sophisticate information communication technology workplace increase reward technical skills. the supply highly educate worker also risen. at start 1980s, 22 percent young adult age 25 29 hold college degree more; last year, fraction move 28.5 percent.2 nevertheless, supply educate worker keep pace demand, thus generate increase salary premium education. because wage top educational ladder increase fastest, increase investment education benefit individual society also might narrow income gaps. education challenge face america today the educational challenge society face consider context three broad trends: retirement baby-boom generation, inexorable advance technological frontier, ongoing globalization economic activity. a baby boomers, range age late 40 early 60s, leave workforce, place take small cohort worker bear mid-to-late 1960s early 1970s. a result, u.s. workforce – matter simple arithmetic – increase slowly likely become le experience average (jorgenson others, 2007; aaronson sullivan, 2002). in broad sense, ratio work people retiree decline, mean still work will, effect, support relatively non-working people. this year, five working-age people (20- 1 the data weekly earn full-time wage salary worker age twenty-five old derive current population survey, publish u.s. bureau labor statistics. 2 the data derive current population survey, publish u.s. bureau labor statistics. 2 bi review 106/2007 64) every person age 65 older; 2030, ratio 3-to-1 (bernanke, 2006). the slow expansion labor force, else equal, imply slow growth potential output. more school workforce could help cushion impact demographic transition economic growth boost productivity growth. continue advance technology also put premium education. which job affect technology difficult predict, although research suggest sector use information technology (it) relatively le intensively, health-care service sectors, likely step use software it service (mann, 2003). regardless, better-educated worker likely good prepare adapt new technology develop (doms, dunne, troske, 1997). ongoing globalization economic activity also lead continue change structure u.s. economy – include composition output good services, thus structure labor force. the world economy benefit expansion trade rise productivity country abroad make great stride expand infrastructure educational attainment workforces. that good them, us. importantly, ability reap benefit globalization depend flexibility labor force adapt change job opportunities, part invest education train necessary meet new demand (bernanke, 2004). educational attainment achievement: stand? the unite state long tradition recognize significant social economic benefit provide high-quality education many citizen possible. the unite state lead world, first, expand access high-school education and, then, post-world war ii era, access college (goldin, 2001; goldin katz, 1999). by 1966, half workforce age 25 old complete high school 10 percent complete college. by 2006, 90 percent adult labor force high-school education 20 percent hold least bachelor’s degree. however, progress past forty year occur 1970s early 1980s. since then, example, high-school graduation rate 25-to-29-year-olds increased, college completion rate rise modestly (u.s. department education, 2007b). one trend particularly disappointing: both high-school college completion rate minority continue lag.3 over past ten years, high-school completion rate white age 25 29 hover 93 percent, rate black age stay near 87 percent; rate hispanics, though trend period, 63 percent last year. the gap college completion wider. in recent years, one-third white age 25 29 least bachelor’s degree, compare le one-fifth same-aged black around 10 percent hispanics. assess stand term educational achievement (how much student learn) fraught considerably great difficulty assess attainment (how far student progress schooling). and, result various metric highlight discourage encourage elements. the department education’s national assessment educational progress show average read level high-school senior stagnate recent years; however, fourth grader continue improve reading, fourth eighth grader improve math (u.s. department education, national center education statistics, 2007b). at time, initial result 3 the data derive current population survey, march annual social economic supplement, 1971-2006, publish u.s. department commerce. bi review 106/2007 3 adoption state accountability standard suggest positive effect students’ test-score gain (jacob, 2005; hanushek raymond, 2004). international comparison student achievement even difficult present mix picture.4 compare student around world, u.s. student still perform relatively well read and, low grades, math science. old u.s. students, however, show le ability apply math science skill peer industrialize countries. lifelong learn help u meet economic challenge in past, u.s. education system respond need change economy, i believe address challenge retirement baby-boom generation, advance technology, globalization, education system make important contribution adjustment process. that means, course, grapple difficult issue – boost educational attainment, particularly minority immigrant youths; make consistent noticeable progress raise academic achievement; ensure old worker meaningful opportunity refresh skills. what do educational system continue play significant role support economic change? in broad terms, must begin recognize learn lifelong process opportunity improve education every point along way. many opportunity lie outside traditional route kindergarten-through-twelfth-grade education follow four year college. i’d like comment briefly economist find benefit educational investment different point life cycle. early childhood education build foundation lifelong learn early age crucial (heckman, stixrud, urzua, 2006). research suggest home environment especially important child start behind find catch increasingly difficult (heckman masterov, 2007). thus, payoff high-quality pre-school home visitation program likely high, especially child bear poor otherwise disadvantage families. recent research – sponsor federal reserve bank minneapolis collaboration university minnesota – document high return early childhood program term subsequent educational attainment low rate social problems, crime, teenage pregnancy, welfare dependency (burr grunewald, 2006).5 but early childhood education beginning. positive result program head start dissipate without high-quality school elementary secondary level (garces, thomas, currie, 2002). elementary secondary school decide teach student kindergarten high school evaluate schools’

by reading, research k-12 education has, date, yield easy answer question raise academic achievement ensure student finish high school well prepare move advance study. a wide range approach explored: small class size, school choice, charter school programs, accountability standards, flexibility teacher certification rules, good teacher pay, merit-based pay, year-round school – list long probably get longer. the size diversity country, together fact state local policymakers retain significant discretion structure educational systems, provide u natural laboratory assess effectiveness alternative educational strategies. i view debate work doesn’t crucial part discover cost-effective way improve educational system. the business community obvious interest well school prepare student future workforce actively participate debate. but stake. student elementary secondary level prepare work life. such skill acquire trait critical creative thinking, social ability, persistence, satisfaction accomplishment make good employee good citizen well. exposure art culture experience serve community help support development broader, harder-to-measure skills, alongside readily measurable cognitive accomplishment reading, math, science. second, teacher quality critical. study show student performance depend put high-quality teacher classroom retain long possible (aaronson, barrow, sander, 2007; rivkin, hanushek, kain, 2005; rockoff, 2004). indeed, many initiative focus link students, especially disadvantage students, high-quality school staff high-quality teachers. high-quality teacher instill young student desire stay school seek education late life, evidence suggest quality teach might big impact lower-ability student (murnane steele, 2007; clotfelter others, 2006; hanushek, kain, rivkin, 2004). unfortunately, disadvantage communities, one trouble high dropout rates, difficulty attract keep qualify teachers. we must instill desire among student stay school seek education train work lives. our elementary secondary school must provide student strong foundation life learning. although wide range remedial education program exist, research suggest costly le effective solid, sustain course study high school. in particular, government train program disadvantage youth rather disappoint reputation, particularly le intensive well tie labor market need (martin grubb, 2001; heckman, lalonde, smith, 1999). a number possibility improve education disadvantage student seem worth exploring. for example, several experiment suggest small school small class may help disadvantage student (although benefit program general student population remain controversial). supplemental education, include after-school mentor program big brother big sisters, show boost school attendance (grossman tierney, 1998). increase school time – either long school hour summer school – also find support (jacob lefgren, 2004). high education in many ways, high education represent strong part u.s. educational system, demonstrate fact student part world come bi review 106/2007 5 study. our institution high learn extraordinarily varied, range large public research university small liberal art college community college vocational schools. the main business institution high education is, course, undergraduate teaching. but unlike countries, separate research undergraduate education; advanced, graduate-level research program house university strong undergraduate programs. thus, college university important source research development (national science foundation, 2007; litan, mitchell, reedy, forthcoming). more half basic research – foundation breakthrough create new industry – conduct universities. additionally, high education embrace broad mission translate research new product enterprises; college university account 15 percent apply research development (national science foundation, 2007). the innovation begin campus diffuse business patents, start-up companies, consult arrangement faculty industry. one great challenge high education lie make sure high-school graduate prepare access it. with college enrollment rate level recent years, much debate surround move student high education keep school graduate. researcher demonstrate strong relationship family income college attendance. since 1990, nearly 80 percent high-school completers high-income family (the top 20 percent income) enrol college next fall. the proportion low-income family enroll college follow fall move gradually, remain much low – 50 percent.6 this discrepancy hold even student classify high achievers: a longitudinal study eighth grader 1988 find 29 percent score top fourth group math – family low social economic status – complete bachelor’s degree 2000, three-fourths family high social economic status finish undergraduate degree (fox, connelly, snyder, 2005).7 surely, high tuition must one barrier attend complete college (card, 2001; kane, 1994), barrier (dynarski, 2005). low-income students, particular, likely come school family environment poor job prepare successful transition college (carneiro heckman, 2003). this suggest supplemental program help under-prepared college student could improve eventual college completion rates; unfortunately, research benefit program mixed, reinforce need improve educational achievement regular high school class (bettinger long, 2005; angrist, lang, oreopoulos, 2006). community college make significant contribution expand educational opportunities. offer low cost more-flexible schedules, enroll almost one-half u.s. undergraduates. attendance one institution associate high wages, even degree completed. evidence suggest year credit community college worth almost much, term increase earn potential, year four-year college. the average student entered, complete, community college earn 9 percent 13 percent average student 6 these data derive annual october supplement current population survey. they summarize u.s. department education’s condition education 2007 available http://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/2007/section3/indicator 25.asp#info. 7 socioeconomic status measure composite score parental education occupation family income. the study also find proportion low-scoring math student high socioeconomic family complete least bachelor’s degree 30 percent versus 3 percent low socioeconomic families. for middle quintiles score family characteristics, proportion 21 percent. 6 bi review 106/2007 end education high school. those complete two-year associate degree earn even large premium, 15 percent 27 percent (kane rouse, 1999). and earn graduate start two-year school transfer four-year program ultimately match begin post-high-school education four-year institution (gill leigh, 2003). community college play constructive role 18-to-22-year-olds also old adults, provide flexible program obtain new skills, specialize train contract individual businesses, remedial education, adult enrichment. adult education today increasingly recognize education need not, indeed not, stop age 22. economist long argue on-the-job train learning-by-doing significant component acquisition human capital. research show knowledge experience gain time informal formal learn job appear pay worker accrue particularly rapidly early career (altonji williams, 2005; topel, 1991). an extensive survey firm-sponsored train number year ago find 84 percent employee receive kind formal train work current employer, 96 percent receive type informal train (bureau labor statistics, 1996). with advance technology need attract retain skilled workers, i certain business-sponsored train remain important component management toolkit. upgrade skill continue education train outside job also important, particularly environment worker face displacement international competition technological advance. recognize possibility, many worker continue acquire formal education late life traditional. for example, almost one-fifth student post-secondary institution type least 35 year old (national center education statistics, 2007a). and, old worker look retool skills, classroom instruction show effective. for example, classroom train displace worker estimate boost future wage much student usual school age, although overall return investment displace worker low few remain work year new entrant labor force (jacobsen, lalonde, sullivan, 2005). similarly, study number welfare-to-work program report long-term gain participate intensive basic education vocational train (dyke others, 2006; hotz, imbens, klerman, 2006). such result suggest well-designed program assist worker lose job contribute cushion effect globalization technological change. conclusion let close reiterate education – lifelong education everyone, toddler worker well advance career – indeed excellent investment individual society whole. education fundamentally support advance productivity, upon ability generate continue improvement standard live depends. if successfully navigate challenge retirement baby-boom generation, advance technology, increase globalization, must work diligently maintain quality educational system strong strive improve not. in particular, must find way move students, especially minority student disadvantage backgrounds, educational opportunity high school. to that, must continually experiment, innovate, evaluate make rational decision work doesn’t education. because quality workforce vital success businesses, business executive must participate fully process, along stakeholder – students, parents, bi review 106/2007 7 teachers, policymakers. i’m encourage devote much energy think topic three-day conference. reference aaronson, daniel, lisa barrow,

asset back particular security market value security itself. in circumstances, uncertainty lead contagion dislocation money market generally, even market nothing u.s. subprime mortgages. market liquidity, recently think abundant, become scarce. some investor find asset assume liquid were, fact, frozen. even market overnight loan affected. investor suddenly become extremely risk averse, lead surge demand least risky assets, government bond treasury bills. the re-pricing credit risk ongoing process, event summer represent bump road. unfortunately, bump mean may take achieve appropriate price risk. this take time unravel complex opaque instrument get underlie assets, find value 2 bi review 106/2007 asset themselves. over time, market force expect work out. but market need information order operate efficiently. so, interest market participant make sure party access necessary information. this first lesson learn – importance transparency financial markets. two week ago london, i speak event summer help make clear case transparency. investor demand great transparency lacking. vendor financial instrument need structure way market player clearly see buying. more fundamentally, investor must take responsibility diligent research, good understand nature investments. put another way, investor must homework instead simply rely word credit-rating agencies. it seem many desire outcome accomplish natural market force respond events. for example, investor demand much high rate return opaque products, strong incentive vendor provide product transparent. similarly, credit-rating agency likely find advantage explain clearly rationale for, limitation of, rat highly structure products. they make clear rat use degree certainty rat conventional, single-name issuers, security involve trade degree market liquidity. there undoubtedly call tight government regulation credit-rating agencies. but i would caution knee-jerk regulatory response. give event summer, seem likely credit-rating agency work hard ensure user understand nature rat soon few client will pay services. there one lesson i want mention point. we need think get right incentive place loan originators, credit quality maintain credit appropriately priced. a i mention earlier, creation loan immediate securitization reduce incentive originator maintain credit standards. this indicate classic principal-agent problem: since originator immune default risk loan securitized sold, often lack proper incentive adequately ass creditworthiness borrower. we need think hard get incentive right. it may natural market force go long way towards rebalancing incentives, may also active role policy-makers regard. another issue relate securitization concern capitalization banks. if bank move securitized loan balance sheets, still provide liquidity guarantee securities, much capital require set aside? the authority basel committee may need revisit issue light recent experiences. this summer's turbulence effect many segment money markets, include market overnight funds. the overnight market well way back normal operation canada, i'll talk minute i discus role central bank. however, problem area money market yet resolved. in term market asset-backed commercial paper (abcp), two-thirds canada's roughly $120 billion abcp market compose conduit sponsor major domestic banks. these bank agree provide global-style liquidity support conduits, investor every reason confident bank capacity continue support conduit necessary. although spread bank-sponsored abcp treasury bill narrow bite recent days, somewhat surprise narrow quickly, give strong balance sheet canadian banks. the remainder canada's abcp third-party, non-bank-sponsored, roughly three-quarters highly structured. because liquidity paper guarantee event "general market disruption," liquidity provider – bi review 106/2007 3 international bank – decline step paper come due. thus fundamental work-out, restructuring, third-party abcp required. discussion montréal investor liquidity provider achieve restructure progressing. i would encourage party involve support process – investor international banks. i remain hopeful that, time, process lead useful results. the role central bank now let talk action bank canada past seven weeks. essentially, action help u fulfill two fundamental role central bank – provide liquidity payment system, formulate monetary policy. in term first role, absolutely normal proper central bank provide liquidity payment system, especially financial institution face market become illiquid. this precisely situation find summer. with money market seize up, many institution find difficult obtain necessary liquidity. so bank canada, like central banks, make clear institution could access regular liquidity facility required. the bank canada's stand liquidity facility access daily, rate 25 basis point target overnight rate, direct clearers involve canada's wholesale payment system. to access liquidity, institution pledge range easily price security collateral. the event august place strong upward pressure overnight interest rate, move target. and carry open-market buyback operation inject liquidity, goal bring actual overnight rate close target. we also temporarily expand list security market participant could use collateral buyback operations. in addition, provide liquidity increase supply settlement balance normally see increase demand cash balances. all told, action effective help improve function overnight money market. so restore original list security eligible use buyback operations, gradually reduce level settlement balances. and true many term money market spread remain abnormally wide, market functioning. there increase number transaction area spread begin narrow. in circumstances, appear anything bank canada could usefully improve function market. the event summer also important implication role country's monetary policy authority. before explain implications, i start background. the bank's policy rate target overnight interest rate. this rate crucial transmission monetary policy throughout economy. when adjust target overnight rate, set motion chain consequence influence interest rate financial market and, cost credit, spending, production, employment and, ultimately, rate inflation. by adjust target, aim keep total demand supply economy balance, thus keep inflation low, stable, predictable. during summer, however, saw widen spread short-term market interest rates, rate commercial paper, target overnight rate. should wide spread persist, would represent tighten credit condition economy would occur independent movement target overnight rate. thus, give policy rate would somewhat restrictive previously judged. this lead perhaps important lesson central banker learn events. let emphasize return point i make early process securitization enhance ability financial institution make loans. it 4 bi review 106/2007 seem recent years, central banker may fully appreciate much increase securitization represent ease credit conditions. loan shift balance sheets, allow loan made. if securitization lead creation loan would otherwise made, source demand economy central banker likely fully take account. any give policy rate would thus le restrictive early judged, imply interest rate globally might low would optimal. however, since global domestic inflation largely contain period, exaggerate magnitude effect. a reduction securitization seem likely, expect degree re-intermediation financial institutions. all thing equal, canada, lead high cost credit relative overnight interest rate case prior summer. but much tighten lead long run? and process re-intermediation persist, thus affect conduct monetary policy go forward? these key question bank canada need think about. and may time definitive answers. the potential impact canadian economy finally, immediate question is: what implication turbulence money market canada's economy? a bank note interest rate announcement early month, near-term economic prospect unite state weak early expected, event financial market likely exacerbate adjustment u.s. house sector, make pronounce protracted. this imply weak u.s. demand canadian exports. however, economic growth canada first half year turn strong projected, near-term prospect economic growth outside north america continue favourable. and last fix announcement date, say canadian economy appear operate production potential estimate time july monetary policy report update (mpru). domestic demand remain robust, buoy continue strong labour market, rise wages, higher-than-expected increase house sale prices. but i mentioned, turbulence financial market mean tighten credit condition canadian borrowers. this temper growth domestic demand, although extent effect difficult assess. against background likely weak track export tight credit conditions, along sign strong domestic demand, judge current level target overnight interest rate – 4 1/2 per cent – appropriate. however, significant upside downside risk outlook inflation. on upside, possibility household demand canada could strong anticipated, downside, ongoing adjustment u.s. house sector could severe spill u.s. economy broadly. in recent days, canadian dollar move sharply trade range assume july mpru, need look cause strengthening, persist. and, always, need ass effect movement exchange rate balance aggregate demand supply canadian economy. in addition, i noted, uncertainty extent duration tighten credit condition canada and, hence, temper effect growth domestic demand. gauge effect financial market turbulence credit conditions, implication canadian economy, one bank's press task come months. we provide analysis issue next monetary policy report, publish 18 october. bi review 106/2007 5 conclusion lady gentlemen, let conclude. this pleasant summer many people. turbulence financial market easy deal with, certainly welcome. but learn event retain valuable lessons, global financial market emerge turbulence strong efficient before. ultimately, benefit u all. 6 bi review 106/2007 shamshad

the reserve bank india act, 1934 provide central government shall entrust rbi money, remittance, exchange bank transaction india management public debt, shall also deposit cash balance rbi, free

also manage open market borrow central government states, two exceptions. the market-borrowing programme state government finalise government india plan commission, keep view provision article 293(3) constitution india. the article stipulate state may not, without consent government india, raise borrow loan outstanding, repayable government india. the rbi has, years, closely interact state

hence, upward revision wma limit meet bi review 105/2007 5 structural deficit state inappropriate. the matter remain contentious issue time. the initiation conference state finance secretary 1997 induce transformation approach formulate change wma scheme. distinct past, advisory committee periodically constitute reserve bank review prevail wma arrangement recommend changes, consider

reinforce recent year government india subscribed, 1997, special data dissemination standard (sdds) promulgate international monetary fund. in light development, decide constitute group state finance secretary suggest various measure disclosure, could introduce budgetary exercise state governments. it also decide group could lay model budget states, would enable legislature public enhance understand state finances. the group suggested, inter alia, would also useful state government could publish document akin budget glance union budget furnish estimate level gross fiscal defiit (gfd) primary deficit (pd) state, include ratio state development product (sdp). the document could also incorporate time-series data important fiscal variable state. the level outstanding debt, guarantee

constitute february 2003 undertake study pension liability state government make suitable recommendations. the group observe pension payment state grow historical average growth rate, pension payment alone would pre-empt 20 per cent total revenue receipt state much 30 per cent revenue receipt year 2010-11. thus, purely perspective fiscal sustainability state magnitude problem, structural alteration exist pension scheme, appear necessary. the group recommend introduction contributory pension scheme/s new employee state government lieu exist non-contributory defined-benefit pension scheme. the group also recommend three alternative pension models, act upon state consider appropriate. a per available information, 19 state government notify defined-contribution pension scheme new employees. recognise absence unanimity exact level, composition, methodology compile liability state government india, decide august 2004, constitute work group evolve methodology. the group recommend compilation data budgetary liability consistent respect gross fiscal deficit accordingly, specify constituent items. the group also recommend exclusion implicit/contingent liability definition budgetary liabilities, reckon wide divergence view various item include implicit liabilities. it, however, recommend disclosure information various implicit liability along budgetary liabilities. the group recommend specific format timely release data liability budget document state governments. the group also recommend reserve bank compile publish data liability state annual study state budgets; recommendation already implemented. fiscal responsibility legislation the rbi provide detail comprehensive technical input government india formulate fiscal responsibility budget management law, culminate enactment fiscal responsibility budget management (frbm) act parliament. in view successful outcome, state finance secretary express desire similar advice rbi. accordingly, group constitute october 2003 select state finance secretary representative government india, ministry finance, members, prepare model fiscal responsibility legislation states. the draft report group discuss 14th conference state finance secretaries, hold august, 2004 final report submit reserve bank january 2005. the group decide model legislation would generally follow pattern central frbm act, build upon state fiscal responsibility legislation already enacted. the group also take account international best practice available area well recommendation various committee fiscal transparency issue relate voluntary disclosure information state governments. various dimension fiscal legislative framework, as, choice targets, road map achievement targets, need detail set illustrative rules, independent evaluation criteria, prioritisation capital expenditure, treatment contingent liability include guarantees, computation pension liabilities, etc., deliberate upon arrive consensus. the group felt model bill would provide guidance state enact fiscal responsibility legislation reference certain benchmarks. the objective group design template fiscal responsibility legislation state basis feasibility pragmatic consideration enforceability, take account diverse requirement various states. it consider desirable allow state take view sequence adoption various provision model bill, fix actual targets, time frame implementation thereof allocate bi review 105/2007 7 provision act rules, depend fiscal capability refine provision give model bill within overall framework fiscal prudence sustainability. all state governments, except two, already enact fiscal responsibility legislation. new arrangement borrow state accord tfc, would appropriate state take advantage prevail market rate avoid spread charge centre assistance provide it. the pattern central assistance include loan major element respect general category states, implicitly fund borrow centre hence, term loan extend state reflect centre’s cost borrowings. to extent arrangement prevailed, was, effect, intermediation centre provision loan state part central assistance. the tfc, therefore, recommend central government act intermediary future lend allow state approach market directly. if fiscally weak state unable raise fund market, centre could borrow purpose on-lending states, interest rate remain align marginal cost borrow centre. this approach accept central government, principle, implement phases, consultation reserve bank. the new arrangement ensure disintermediation centre respect states’ borrow deliberate upon, conference state finance secretary monitor group cash debt management government india rbi. in light discussion order operationalise new arrangements, government india constitute technical group, smt. shyamala gopinath, deputy governor, rbi chairperson official government india, select state reserve bank, members. the technical group submit report government india december 2005 make several recommendations. in tune recommendation group, noticeable progress regard draw calendar borrowings, re-issuance security adoption auction method borrow states. in addition, line recommendation work group liquidity state government security (chairman – shri. v.k.sharma), 2005, state development loan (sdls) make eligible repo transaction liquidity adjustment facility rbi decide introduce non-competitive bid facility respect primary auction sdls. a far arrangement share corpus national small save fund (nssf) concerned, accordance decision national development council, obligatory share state reduce 80 per cent effect year 2007-08. loan council the tfc also recommend "…..states, like centre, must decide annual borrow programme within framework respective fiscal responsibility legislations…. the overall limit annual borrow source supervise independent body like loan council representative ministry finance, plan commission, reserve bank india state governments. the council may, begin year, announce annual borrow limit state, take account sustainability considerations….." (para 15.7). it was, however, felt set new institution, like loan council, would entail additional cost term physical human resource would take time. moreover, 8 bi review 105/2007 large majority state currently seize task address structural issue manage government finance which, carry logical conclusion, could usher era debt sustainability medium-term tfc period. the loan council could lose raison d’etre fiscal situation become tractable, seem case australian loan council, provide international best practice respect coordinate borrow federal state governments. against backdrop, technical

market borrow amongst states; take note actual borrow state government year vis-à-vis budget gfd develop appropriate database would facilitate monitor exercise; ass fiscal risk issuance state

external assistance multilateral agency state traditionally rout central government part central assistance, centre bear foreign exchange risk. however, part policy disintermediation centre borrow states, decide central government back-to-back transfer external assistance states. at 16th conference state finance secretaries, state finance secretary suggest rbi could play advisory role assist state hedge exchange rate risk arise policy back-to-back transfer external assistance. in context tfc recommendation follow discussion 19th conference state finance secretaries, hold january 2007, first workshop management foreign exchange risk state financial market organise reserve bank may 2007, benefit state government officials. the state also propose alternative mechanism provide foreign exchange risk set aside fund budgets, reserve bank expect play role manage fund line csf. these proposal discuss 20th conference state finance secretaries, hold august 2007. selective broaden deepen relationship there many area close coordination rbi states. for important area rbi’s responsibilities, stand institutional mechanism state level, regional office rbi concern official state government associated. the important area close coordination relate provision overall physical security bank system, matter relate coin currency response natural calamities. considerable decentralisation power responsibility regional office rbi bring facilitate locally relevant solution problems, arise. the empowerment regional office combine promote state-specific bi review 105/2007 9 initiatives, policy implementation. the regional office play facilitate role bring together contend party tension arise, affect financial system. one example relate resolution stand-off state government microfinance institution term loan grant method recovery due employ microfinance institutions. similarly, considerable latitude provided, suit local conditions, deliberation state level bankers’ committees, many instance state finance minister chief minister preside meetings. in broad area banking, innovative mechanism design resolve issue dual control regard urban cooperative banks. several states, together account seventy percent urban bank activity, sign memorandum understand rbi constitute state task force urban co-operative bank (tafcub) ensure coordinate action revive strengthen sector. this been, accounts, outstanding success. similarly, empower committee constitute state reorganise, strengthen expand regional rural banks. in matter relate revival rural cooperative also, state-specific package considered. special plan coordinate action select states, spread depth bank service poor, mounted, example north-eastern states, uttarakhand bihar. more recently, vigorous programme financial inclusion initiate ensure offer bank service whole population. the rbi play lead role state, state government participate movement, operationalising approach. the state particular interest programme ensure efficient inexpensive disbursal fund several social security relate rural employment programmes. the recent development technology facilitate process. simultaneously, state show enthusiasm extend financial literacy rbi encourage regional office respond, preferably local language, rbi website attempt disseminate information several languages. we recognise avoid overstretch resources, will interact respond positively genuine demand state government legitimate concern rbi. no doubt, state-specific consideration would govern state-specific responses, within overall policy framework rbi. there many areas, perhaps great relevance central government rbi, state seek rbi’s involvement constrain carefully distance ourselves. some time ago, strong appeal several state rbi award rat quality fiscal management states, would carry great weight foster good response political leadership state concerned. the rbi politely decline request since, institution, appear rank state pass judgment fiscal performance. outcome challenge have delineate effort process collaboration state rbi, appropriate briefly enumerate outcome recognise critical challenge lie ahead state finance rbi. first, progressive enactment fiscal responsibility legislation (frls) many 26 state government indeed strengthen fiscal consolidation initiative state level. second, gross fiscal deficit states, increase average 2.8 per cent gdp first half 1990s average 4 per cent gdp first half present decade, place 2.5 per cent gdp 2005-06 expect bring 2.4 per cent budget estimate 2007-08. the revenue deficit, 10 bi review 105/2007 increase average 2.2 per cent gdp first half present decade, remain le 0.1 per cent since 2005-06. in fact, aggregate revenue surplus (of 0.4 per cent gdp) budget 2007-08. all states, except eight, budget revenue surplus 2007-08. third, open market borrow state government conduct entirely auction route 2006-07 2007-08 (so far). the spread almost states, yield central government security comparable maturity 2006-07 2007-08 far, remain well 50 basis point (spread fix case tap issuances), reflect favourable market perception. fourth, far state government guarantee concerned, volume decline path: guarantee place 6.5 per cent gdp end-march 2005 compare 8.0 per cent end-march 2001. many state impose administrative/ legislative ceiling guarantees. eight state set guarantee redemption fund provide possible invocation guarantees. fifth, 18 state set consolidate sink fund provide orderly repayment open market borrowings. of these, 11 state adopt revise csf scheme provide repayment liability (and open market loans). many state propose set revise csf. sixth, cash management state government show mark improvement recent years. the daily average utilisation normal wma, special wma overdraft state government decline 2006-07. during 2006-07, eight state avail wma 12 state previous year. only two state resort overdraft 2006-07 eight state previous year. notwithstanding positive development prospects, would remain area concern. there certain risk process fiscal consolidation expect increase expenditure revision pay scale state government employees, pursuant implementation ensue recommendation sixth pay commission. in connection, state government would need make budget robust enough enable steadfastly adhere provision fiscal responsibility legislations. fiscal empowerment revenue augmentation hold key address fiscal risks. initiative state would need develop calendar open market borrow states, line issue government india. this would enhance transparency, reduce uncertainty market participant thereby help smoothen market-borrowing operations. re-issuance state government security would also help build critical minimum size securities, would, turn, help enhance liquidity. the reserve bank continue receive complaint bank financial institution regard default honour obligation state government guarantee bonds. such issue need address state government would impact credibility market perception financial position. at time, issue relate insistence certain (re-financing) institution provision state government guarantees, irrespective financial viability projects, perhaps account legal requirements, also need address appropriate forum. the state government expenditure education health remain low around 2.5 per cent 0.7 per cent gdp, respectively. these expenditure may need enhance make long-term impact level human development country, within framework fiscal responsibility legislation. at time, issue relate quality timeliness provide social sector service need expeditiously addressed. bi review 105/2007 11 from reserve bank’s standpoint, initiative relate credit culture, financial literacy, financial inclusion priority sector lend would continue remain high policy agenda. conclude remark rbi considerable professional skill state recognise value good will consider state-specific orientation broad analysis. the rbi, like central banks, command considerable credibility good public image public institution consider relatively apolitical view vertical relation centre state horizontal one amongst states. the bi-annual conference state finance secretary sponsor rbi prove excellent forum wide-ranging discussions. the technical committee group formed, membership entirely states, though centre may occasionally associated, rbi provide secretarial technical support. the centre state concern decide appropriate course actions. the fact state adopt recommendation committee groups, demonstrate shift away perceive centralisation past towards participative process. i happy submit states, though vary degree enthusiasm, fully endorse immense contribution process partner rbi state cause good financial sector fiscal empowerment states. let conclude profuse thank madras school economics provoke think aloud subject share think wide audience. the school come existence 1995, soon, could obtain “a” grade national assessment & accreditation council. the ministry environment forest also designate school centre excellence environmental economics. i doubt school would emerge internationally recognise centre excellence economic study attract best student teacher different part country well countries. on part, rbi close touch school view obtain expertise process monetary policy formulation. thank you. 12 bi review 105/2007 donald l kohn: success failure monetary policy since 1950s remark mr donald l kohn, vice chairman board governor u federal reserve system, “monetary policy fifty years”, conference mark 50th anniversary deutsche bundesbank, frankfurt main, 21 september 2007. * * * i appreciate opportunity speak occasion deutsche bundesbank's fiftieth anniversary participate panel "success failure monetary policy since 1950s." i reassure acceptance axel's invitation david laidler's survey paper, find success past two decades.1 a concise summary success evident performance consumer price inflation advance economies. median inflation group (as define international monetary fund) hold near 2 percent decade. indeed, imf's late world economic outlook, four five country group expect post inflation rate 1 percent 3 percent year. that good performance help anchor inflation expectations, which, turn, generate many benefits. anchor inflation expectation damp pass-through supply-related price shocks. they also permit central bank respond forcefully output fluctuations. most significantly, improve inflation performance come with, expense of, output stability. although consensus form much "great moderation" growth real output attribute monetary policy, everyone agree least portion can. david view macroeconomic outcome triumph monetarism, formulaic policy prescription associate doctrine succeed (or, matter, even try sustain basis). rather, underlie tenet monetarism ultimately seep collective central bank unconscious foster good decisionmaking. the belief david identify threefold: that market economy inherently self-righting, open economy perform best flexible exchange rates, central banker focus price stability long-run objective. david suggest monetarism fail proponent get prescriptive advocate rigid rule money growth. among lesson take fail monetarist experiment central bank apply science imperfect understand economy market function imply good dose humility require – i agree. a evidence humility part, let also agree david two important question conduct monetary policy yet resolved. this unfortunate two question longstanding source debate central current policy concerns. first, best way pursue price stability, and, second, asset price take account steer policy? in many countries, though own, answer first question price stability pursue formal apparatus inflation target, typically include establish inflation goal government, set metric evaluate central bank performance, periodically communicate progress public. although correlation convey causation, spread regime coincide sustain low global inflation. in addition, adopter inflation target subsequently abandon it. 1 vincent reinhart, board's staff, contribute preparation remarks. the view express necessarily share colleague board federal open market committee. bi review 105/2007 1 before anyone jump conclusion frankfurt stop road damascus, let saul state case remain open. inflation come worldwide, country without, well with, inflation targets. moreover, i share david's puzzlement explicit inflation goal make substantial difference performance give paucity evidence show choose target directly affect level public's inflation expectations. that said, i relatively persuade inflation target help reduce variance inflation expectations. evidence accumulate suggest stock prices, interest rates, measure inflation expectation seem vary le economy central bank explicit long-run goal inflation. i suspect good anchor expectation success inflation target many country attributable part aspect political economy david identified. a formal inflation target represent national embrace goal, elect authority recognize primacy price stability publicly support – indeed, even require – central bank's pursuit goal. to extent elect authority channel desire electorate, central bank direct adopt inflation target give strong signal goal's importance public large. this affirmation often reinforce grant operational independence central bank achieve goal effectively. an important effect public acceptance price stability erode stand would direct central bank action toward ends. in environment, workers, businesspeople, investor make plan expectation nominal magnitude predictable devote attention productive matters. for european central bank, framework establish treaty. in instances, adoption inflation target involve law mutual understandings, constitutional changes. the early adopter inflation target parliamentary democracies, surprise give system single branch government enact law put effect. with regard inflation goal, parliament erect formal apparatus finance minister serve government's point contact central bank. the system unite state different two independent branch government responsible economic policy making, make agreement single goal problematic. moreover, two branch already speak appropriate aim nation's central bank: the congress, law president signed, give federal reserve dual mandate direct u foster maximum employment stable price time. this instruction accident history, that, past, congress show appetite amend legislation. nor instruction unreasonable, dual mandate come interpret assign u responsibility attain price stability long run, bring maximum employment, mindful resource utilization succession short run make long run. the dual mandate seem proper fitting, give economic cost incur inflation stray long-run goal output deviate economy's potential produce; seem produce result different practice associate central bank flexible inflation targeters. a i say earlier, anchor expectation value, make plan easier, reduce resource spend predict protect unexpected variation nominal magnitudes, grant central bank great scope lean fluctuation output keep inflation contained. the latter particularly attractive give dual mandate, better-anchored inflation expectation could produce win-win outcome improve attainment goals. for reason, consideration communication strategies, federal open market committee discuss whether mechanism could put place could good anchor inflation expectation manner consistent institutional framework dual mandate. 2 bi review 105/2007 the second david's open issue – whether central bank lean possible asset price bubble – key topic discussion eighteen month ago, otmar's festschrift. my answer answer now. a central bank focus outlook macroeconomy generally relegate asset price subordinate role input forecast process. i view simple application humility david i find admirable. although economic theory provide settle answer topic, prediction especially imprecise regard asset pricing, two implication central bankers. first, little confidence attach determination asset bubble exist except extreme circumstances. second, even le confidence attach prediction effect policy asset prices, particular speculative element prices. moreover, monetary policy action address perceive bubble one sector may undesirable effect asset price economy generally. a result, prefer policy framework remain three pronged: first, assign single instrument monetary policy macroeconomic objective; second, rely regulation erect resilient financial structure; and, third, event market judgment prove wrong financial price adjust sharply, apply tool monetary policy macroeconomic task hand. that task always easily capture simple statistical regularities. relationship financial market economic result complex nonlinear, especially market behave normally. when investor ebullient, expectation outsized capital gain fee back economy. on way down, investors' loss confidence, reduction credit availability, tighten term condition credit potential pronounce effect activity inflation. the world is, doubt, different gather eighteen month ago. however, far soon pas judgment go wrong u.s. house market why. i suspect that, study do cool reflection, cause swing house price see le consequence monetary policy result emotion excessive optimism follow fear experience every often marketplace ages. to extent, too, amplitude house cycle heighten newness subprime market, fragmentation regulatory oversight responsibility market, complexity opacity new instrument transform distribute risk. low policy interest rate early decade help fee initial rise house prices. however, bad excess market probably occur short-term rate already well way normal levels, longer-term rate hold variety forces. and similar, sometimes even sharper, trajectory house price witness economy central bank say pay attention asset prices. the action federal open market committee take tuesday interpret application third leg prefer policy triad, take "to forestall adverse effect broad economy might otherwise arise disruption financial market promote moderate growth time." in past, effort cushion restraint induce decline asset price fuel assertion federal reserve policy asymmetrical response boom bust asset prices. such asymmetry say potential fee "moral hazard" investor would spend le effort evaluate underlie value lull protection expect provide monetary policy action. in point fact, federal reserve policy maker asymmetrical intent actions, always focus sharply macroeconomy. asset price matter determination policy matter outlook. i confident federal fund rate would high 2000 level equity price year, would federal fund rate elevate 2006 absence tight credit spreads, low term premiums, bi review 105/2007 3 impetus house wealth. and i doubt policy would ease week house price continue upward march. in instance, however, policy motivate desire achieve particular level asset prices, rather federal reserve's assessment change asset price affect forecast growth inflation. i would also caution symmetrical response macroeconomic outlook need reflect inherent asymmetry business cycles. in typical boom-bust cycle, asset price tend rise relatively gradually protract period fall sharply short stretch time, financial economist refer "rising escalator fall elevator." perhaps asset price important spending, key macroeconomic indicators, unemployment rate, exhibit similar pattern. it surprise macro-focused monetary policy leave asymmetric footprint data. in end, humble advice evaluate policymakers relative task law give them. in judgment, record past twenty-five year steady growth two mild recession gradually decline inflation reasonably low level betray asymmetry policy response metric count – macroeconomic performance. 4 bi review 105/2007 jean claude trichet: fiftieth anniversary deutsche bundesbank short address mr jean claude trichet, president european central bank, gala dinner 50th

at time, i teenager i confess i closely follow first event. since i privilege appreciate immense historical importance treaty rome peace prosperity continent. with regard bundesbank, i think fair say foundation provide europe also rest world good example, indeed role model, central banking. the trademark role model monetary stability, independence credibility. the bundesbank embody inception, and, today, recognise world essential monetary policy deliver price stability and, way, support sustain economic growth job creation. j’ai eu moi-même l’honneur d’être pendant dix an le gouverneur de la banque de france indépendante par la volonté du peuple français, depuis le 1 janvier 1994, avant de passer le témoin au gouverneur noyer. et je ne peux dissimuler la fierté qui été la nôtre quand nous avon pu démontrer à no concitoyens que le mandat premier de la stabilité de prix – que la banque de france avait défini dès janvier 1994 comme étant moins de 2 % - associé à la pleine indépendance, nous permettaient au bout de quatre an de supprimer toute prime de risque entre le franc francais et le deutschemark. c’était, avec le résultats également remarquables de autres banques centrales

notion price stability. ich möchte sie daran erinnern, das preisstabilität und zentralbankunabhängigkeit tatsächlich tag für tag verteidigt werden müssen, da sie immer wieder auf die probe gestellt werden: 1956, noch vor d formellen gründung d bundesbank, forderte bundeskanzler adenauer, man solle die erhöhung d leitzinssätze um ganze 100 basispunkte verschieben. die deutsche zentralbank ließ sich jedoch nicht darauf ein und überzeugte die deutsche bevölkerung von ihrer politik sowie davon, das sie dafür sorgen würde, das d geldwert erhalten bleibt. in den folgenden 50 jahren gab e viele weitere herausforderungen: da ende de bretton-woods-systems, größere ölkrisen, die wiedervereinigung, die grundlagen de europäischen währungssystems sowie die vorbereitungen zur wirtschafts- und währungsunion – um nur einige zu nennen. allen diesen herausforderungen begegnete die bundesbank mit souveränität und festen grundsätzen. al präsident d erstmals unabhängigen banque de france bin ich stolz darauf, das ich gemeinsam mit vertretern d bundesbank d vorbereitung d wirtschafts- und währungsunion – auf d grundlage de vorrangigen auftrags d preisstabilität und d klaren unabhängigkeit d ezb von politischer einflussnahme – mitwirken konnte. die formulierung de vertrags und die zusammenarbeit mit den hauptakteuren auf deutscher seite habe ich al besonders bereichernd empfunden. diese persönlichkeiten haben entscheidend zur gestaltung und zum funktionieren de maastricht-vertrags beigetragen. hier möchte ich auf jeden fall horst köhler, den jetzigen bundespräsidenten, erwähnen, mit dem meine kollegen und ich den vertrag von maastricht verhandelt haben. heute genieße ich da privileg, mit d bundesbank al mitglied de eurosystems zusammenzuarbeiten, da vollem umfang zum erfolg de europäischen währungsteams und zur erfüllung unseres auftrags, die preisstabilität zu gewährleisten, beiträgt. fünfzig jahre mag von einigen al fortgeschrittenes alter empfunden werden, aber für eine erfolgreiche institution wie die bundesbank ist diesis jubiläum kein grund zur wehmut, sondern stellt eine auszeichnung dar. die werte und beiträge, die die bundesbank da eurosystem einbringt, sind jung wie eh und je. herzlichen glückwunsch! ich möchte dir, axel, und deiner institution meinen dank und meine freundschaft aussprechen! 2 bi review 104/2007 tarisa watanagase: thailand’s economic

important opportunity share perspective thai economy move forward, especially global environment great financial volatility uncertainties. i believe media, local international, provide important two-way avenue central bank communicate view rationale underlie policy public large, receive feedbacks, positive well negative. the topic talk today “thailand’s economic outlook challenge volatile financial environment.” i divide address three parts. first, i would like highlight key risk stem recent global development outlook. in connection, i would briefly touch implication u sub-prime market thai economy. second, i like focus recent key economic development thailand outlook 2008. i discus risk challenge face thai economy, especially relate volatile international capital movement impact thai baht short term build resiliency enhance productivity long-term. lady gentlemen, let start global picture. for number year now, witness strong global growth drive mainly growth u economy emerge markets, particularly non-japan asia. during period, also see grow global imbalance rest world finance us’s grow current account deficits. there yet consensus global financial imbalance unwind, everyone expect large dollar correction part unwind process, impact financial market exchange rate worldwide. my view likely see market jitter along unwind process global imbalance. indeed, last couple years, already experience large magnitude capital fluctuation exchange rate volatilities. this year alone, observe two episodes, february august, shift toward great risk aversions, sharp fall stock market across world, new york shanghai, bangkok included. at juncture, seem increase disconnect global growth financial stability. on one hand, global economy continue expect expand robustly, drive mainly strong growth euro area emerge market economies, particularly china india. financial stability has, hand, become vulnerable year ago. recent development u economy sub-prime credit market may indeed early wake-up call policymakers market player worldwide. the u sub-prime relate problem prompt retrenchment risky asset de-leveraging, cause wide credit spread risky asset class high volatility bond equity market bi review 104/2007 1 around world. the unwind carry-trade flight quality international capital also observed. importantly, result disruption already require extraordinary liquidity injection number central bank smooth market fluctuations. beside financial sector, turmoil sub-prime market also pose negative impact real sector, dent u growth prospect go forward. i would like digress briefly tell direct exposure thai financial institution collateralize debt obligation (cdos) relatively minimal, term share total assets. i also like reassure keep vigilance potential indirect repercussion may arise impact u sub-prime market global economy financial markets, adjustment process likely protracted. moreover, wait see u economy respond late rate cut fed. in sum, external risk face thai economy tilt towards financial volatility rather growth point. lady gentlemen, i highlight risk may likely emanate external front. but recent development thai economy stem also internal factors, bring second part talk, recent key development thailand outlook 2008. this year, even though thailand’s growth rate underperform peer region, i still consider gdp growth around 4-5 percent, expect whole 2007, quite satisfactory. notwithstanding baht appreciation, thai export expand well remain main engine growth year. our exporter also successfully penetrate new market compensate fall demand traditional market, namely us. much extent growth underperformance comparison regional peer account slow domestic demand. over year-long political uncertainty lead weak consumer confidence unfavourable investment climate. i hopeful general election date schedule cloud political uncertainty lifted, consumer confidence would rebound. in line consumption recovery, i also expect investment pick play strong role growth driver, promote balance economy. in regard, great clarity large public investment project crucial put public private investment back track. the continue high capacity utilization investment promotion application board investment point strong appetite investment investment climate become favourable. during period uncertainties, monetary policy become accommodative line decline inflation low risk pick go forward. late data august show headline inflation 1.1 percent core inflation 0.7 percent. set light, monetary policy committee cut policy interest rate total 175 basis point since begin year. the aim stimulate domestic demand offset expect slow export growth light slow u economy baht appreciation, though export still remain important driver growth next year. late economic forecast project economic growth lie 4.5-6.0 per cent 2008, core inflation expect stay comfortably around 1.0-2.0 percent. give appreciation trend thai baht thus far, cannot deny certain industries, especially rely high local content materials, affect far rely import-content materials. though deterioration 2 bi review 104/2007 price competitiveness expect times, see real sector adjustment keep pace change financial environment. for wait hear exchange rate trend, i disappoint always. i would like say that, give current inflation target framework, monetary policy take care exchange rate long conflict inflation. and, target level thai baht mind. foreign exchange market intervene much volatility market. the objective smooth country’s adjustment transitional period. look forward, baht movement would depend largely external development i already discussed. moreover, also internal drivers: large surplus current capital accounts. the thai stock market remain one popular destination emerge market foreign investors, give relatively low p/e ratio. during first 7 month year, foreign investor become net buy 4 billion u dollar. such inflow together foreign direct investment also add pressure currency. lady gentlemen, i would like turn third final part talk today, thailand’s approach cop risk challenge pose globalization. indeed, challenge globalization constantly changing. to meet challenge without, critical thai economy build strength within: continuously improve flexibility efficiency firms, resiliency households, competitiveness business environment. but beyond get fundamental right strengthen them, thai economy need strategic policy package build system allow constant self-correction – one also let economy regain strength quickly severe negative shock. that system underpin strong link world economy, encourage innovation efficiency. specifically, i underscore approach require policy marker focus achieve three key objectives, namely manage volatility especially emanate volatile global capital movements; build resiliency real financial sectors; foster long-term productivity improvement. look ahead, press practical challenge face near term three-fold indeed also inter-related. they “hot money” inflow large inflow general, pressure rapid domestic currency appreciation, finally, potential loss monetary autonomy sense independent interest rate policy. be part fast grow asia, thailand neighbor become attractive destination international investor – although powerful underlie reason may ironically medium-term flight u dollar asset since 2002. with large capital inflow come pressure currency appreciate. in experience, currency appreciate fast others. in fact, surrender monetary autonomy maintain restriction cross-border capital flow need feel immediate pressure appreciate. but come along liberalization road face different kind challenge. in case, bank thailand seek balance approach manage capital flow flexible exchange rate. we also undertake concomitant reform area financial system market development. these initiative closely relate progress one require progress others. in build resilient economy, prudent fiscal monetary policy help. a automatic stabilizer, flexible exchange rate also helps. bi review 104/2007 3 lady gentlemen, hot money, indeed large inflow general, fuel asset price encourage excessive risk-taking behavior. central bank may wish counter excess interest financial stability. if central bank choose maintain high interest rate stance, pressure currency appreciate likely mount. since challenge require significant ability domestic economy adjust flexibly, solution package seek must help reduce distortion economies. allow competitive pressure incentive operate undoubtedly best way foster investment physical human capital, well innovation risk-taking, crucial long-term productivity growth. they also crucial flexible resilient economy. but policy regulation still role play. the imperative improve policy regulation design help deal market excesses. build spirit entrepreneurship, real sector must work continuously improve competitiveness strengthen productivity. a sustain rise wage live standard cannot take place without productivity growth. and adaptability shift wind global competition cannot happen without ability adopt best technology ability use technology efficiently. to end, best competition policy thailand policy encourage competition. encourage competition mean open markets. open market give firm mean incentive invest, innovate learn best. a regard financial sector, thailand require strong financial intermediary also market player different view risk appetite ensure market financial system undergo constant self-correction. access deep liquid capital market another crucial element financial development go forward. at juncture, financial market may deep enough soon enough, domestic player ready encumber access world financial markets. indeed, manage risk benefit liberalize inflow past, thai economy may benefit citizen unload domestic systematic risk abroad. to end, bank thailand progressively pursue capital account liberalization outflow side. outflow portfolio investment first permit 2003. since begin year, expand limit thai direct investment portfolio investment abroad. to promote balanced-capital movements, liberalization measures, include relaxation fx hold juristic person individuals, implement last two months, currently monitor impact capital outflows. indeed, appropriate degree financial openness time controversial issue. key right pace sequence capital account liberalization. it also important underline fact big market event pose systemic risk tend reflect collective mistake market participant offside direction. in regard, capital control measure useful tool reduce chance prolong financial misalignment economic fundamentals. lady gentlemen, the thai financial landscape changing. therefore, goal ensure regulatory supervisory response keep pace financial intermediary product offer. in endeavor, bank thailand put emphasis robust stress testing, enhance counterparty risk management, safe efficient market infrastructures. our financial legal infrastructure continue strengthen particularly introduction number legislation amendments. the new deposit insurance act financial institution act pipeline. specifically, 4 bi review 104/2007 latter act stipulate prompt corrective action grant bank thailand power conduct supervision consolidate basis. the current financial sector master plan (fsmp) move second phase, emphasis increase competition consideration potential entry new player enhance financial efficiency resiliency. our accession basel ii accord upgrade risk management bank best standard enhance financial sector stability. lady gentlemen, to end talk today, i would like emphasize policymakers must avoid misplace focus policy short-term issues. they must instead always weigh carefully short-term long-term objective toward achieve strengthen resiliency overall economy. only resiliency, small open economy like thailand able sail wave global financial turbulence year ahead. bi review 104/2007 5 rakesh mohan: recent financial market development implication monetary policy valedictory address dr rakesh mohan, deputy governor reserve bank india, institute international finance’s inaugural asia regional economic forum, mumbai, 20 september 2007. assistance m.d. patra indranil bhattacharya prepare speech gratefully acknowledged. * * * shri bhatt, mr horiguchi, lady gentlemen, i honour invite deliver valedictory address asia regional economic forum. the relationship india institute international finance (iif) go back long way early 1990s. therefore, befit iif choose inaugurate asia regional economic forum mumbai opportunity informal exchange idea view region global economy, emphasis key issue relate india. i observe proceed forum timely focus comprehensive coverage development global regional financial commodity markets, financial system large issue relevant emerge asia. over last two months, good deal collective attention focus turmoil financial market unite state europe sudden plunge credit market confidence trigger emerge risk exposure u sub-prime mortgage crisis. even every pass day unravel little underlie force work – complex nature derivative used; high degree leverage poor, light even absent collateral; underestimation risk pervade financial markets; surprisingly sizeable exposure large financial institution debt instrument derivative question; speed contagion – i believe still travel much understand full import recent event term information analysis. consequently, considerable uncertainty surround debt credit market now. quite justifiably, regulators, monetary authority finance ministry engage contain risk pose developments. in address, i think i would take opportunity stand back actual play event try gain understand nature turbulence, happened, happened, implication central banks. in rest address, i reflect overarch force lead characterize recent spate events, specific response central bank challenge likely face future unfolds. i. what go on? perhaps define feature global economy last three decade term “great moderation” – sustain decline inflation inflation volatility. a comparison period since asian financial crisis i.e., 1998-2007 30 year precede crisis (1970-97) show recent period, inflation (cpi) advance economy average 1.9 per cent, 5.8 per cent early period. over period, inflation develop economy decline 31.0 per cent 7.0 per cent. over time span, inflation volatility measure term coefficient variation fall 0.55 0.20 advance economy 0.54 0.32 develop economies. consequently, average nominal interest rate (libor rate u dollar) also moderate 8.3 per cent previous period 3.8 per cent recent period. this feature also reflect decline real interest rate well, 2.5 per cent 1.9 per cent. the secular low nominal real bi review 104/2007 1 interest rate across world enhance appetite risk even price risk become increasingly difficult. the second important feature recent global development could direct bear current crisis role monetary policy. since technology stock meltdown 2000, significant monetary accommodation major economy – us, euro area japan – estimate one-half two-thirds u currency supply hold outside us. growth monetary aggregate high rate growth would expect hitherto relation real economic growth. yet inflation contain low levels. there evidence abundant excess liquidity financial market also reflect macro imbalance u asia. consequently, sizeable currency misalignment carry trades, compression risk spreads, mispricing widely diffuse risk even real sector implication several emerge economies. the strong macroeconomic performance asia also contribute relentless search yield increase appetite risk. in fact, annual economic symposium “housing, house finance monetary policy” hold federal reserve kansa city jackson hole august 30-september 1, 2007, professor john taylor (of taylor rule fame) argue feed follow excessively loose monetary policy 2002-2006. the combination sustain low inflation accompany accommodative monetary policy worldwide could generate excessive confidence ability central bank monetary policy keep inflation rate interest rate low indefinitely, lead price risk hence excessive risk taking. this result analogous excessive foreign borrow undertake private sector borrower bank east asian country exchange rate see relatively fixed, hence risk perception low. it may ironic perceive success central bank increase credibility monetary policy, give rise enhance expectation regard stability inflation interest rates, could lead mispricing risk hence enhance risk taking. yet another view success failure central banks, repeat assurance stability guidance market future path interest rates, couple availability ample liquidity invitation market underprice risks. this view, consequently, put blame central bank fail give space market ass risk eschew surprise element policy. it possible increase globalisation result containment price tradable good period hence measure inflation, excess liquidity show elevate asset price worldwide, along increase cross border capital flow search yields. easy monetary policy may generate search yield result dilution standard assess credit risk. the desirability use monetary policy tools, judgement regard adequacy tools, meet asset price movement yet another relevant factor regard, far central bank address issue. a withdrawal monetary accommodation commence response perceive visible inflationary pressures, sub-prime crisis reveal vulnerability starkly confidence plunged, market freeze trigger panic among investor lender regard inability value complex risky asset structure derivative products. with deterioration credit confidence, bank force advance loan off-balance sheet "special investment vehicle (sivs)" us capital thereby render borrower credit constrained. thus, argue combination low real nominal interest rate bring low inflation, accompany abundance liquidity induce accommodative monetary policy lie root current crisis. in sense, sub-prime symptom rather cause. arguably, outcome could quite different if, instance, interest rate decline back ebb inflation accommodation monetary policy therefore excess liquidity. 2 bi review 104/2007 whereas view put forward many commentator analysts, also persuasive opposite view, best articulate alan greenspan recent interview occasion release book (financial times, september 17, 2007). he argue great moderation inflation could attribute real economy phenomenon addition monetary policy measures. first, long run productivity growth observe u late 1990s till recently decade clearly important factor dampen inflation. second, globalization addition billion new worker china india dampen wage growth worldwide hence inflation. whereas agree fall long term rate provide initial gain house prices, accept low long term interest rate attribute extend u feed policy low policy interest rates. a evidence, point absence effect long term interest rate short term policy interest rate indeed raised. so jury extent monetary policy effect extend long term interest rate hence elevate house prices. a aside, interest explore whether low interest rate regime fully justified. critic argue feed try harder, raise rate sooner faster. in response, mr. greenspan quote financial time (september 17, 2007) say policy response would acceptable "to political establishment" give low rate inflation "the presumption fully independent full discretion false". one issue confront u turmoil originate credit market spread money market debt market great rapidity. it widely understand credit market characterize information asymmetry. borrower much great information credit quality lender asymmetry traditionally mean creditor endure relationship borrower credit quality monitor continuous basis. bank therefore traditionally invest considerable resource perform function. they incentive since bear credit risk books. however, many countries, originator loan bearer risk, bank become mere originator loan distributor risk, traditional view role bank change considerably recent years. first, availability information technology reduce cost information collection maintenance considerably. thus, widespread belief arise information credit quality small borrower may widely disperse across jurisdiction make impersonal, packaged, processed, sold. second, availability technology, belief information available structure basis, great deal financial innovation could take place essentially enable investor risk taker become progressively remote ultimate borrower actual risk lay. a whole host intermediary form mortgage brokers, mortgage companies, society like able package mortgage asset include non conform loan sell different category investors, include special investment vehicle (sivs), hedge fund like, regulated. the guide principle behind activity feasible credit rat agency enough information continuous basis rate instrument packaged. it certainly argue new development since mortgage back security (mbs) asset back security (abs) u time successful provide liquidity credit market continuous basis without accidents. the difference perhaps mb package government sponsor entity (gses) subject certain relatively well enforce norm presumably reduce potential risk embed instruments. these consideration lead third set issue relate role effective financial regulation supervision. ha recent crisis underscore need strengthen oversight advance financial markets? traditionally, financial surveillance place relatively emphasis bank regulation. bank highly leverage financial entity also effective trustee public money virtue hold deposits. hence, bi review 104/2007 3 effectively regulate supervise order maintain public confidence bank system depositor protect excessive risk-taking banks. on hand, investor hedge fund high net worth individual need protection. they inform investor able exploit information efficiency market and, therefore, able understand risk imply information asymmetry. the current crisis was, however, trigger difficulty encounter investor take large exposure sub-prime relate investment without account potential risk embed instruments. there host ill underlie transactions, come light. we need, however, abstract detail malpractice lead current situation reflect incentive structure lead malpractices. in event, even bank depositor get expose soon information asymmetry become evident credit rat come regard inadequate, market get freeze result illiquidity bank erosion depositor confidence consequential impact financial markets, monetary policy. the link bank non bank financial intermediaries, balance sheet exposure adequately recognise record bank supervisors. in context recent events, important recognise need understand good process transmission risk information various segment financial market order address crisis collateral credit market. how much specialize information rest lender systematized, package transmit market credit ratings. the principle underlie securitisation base lender specialize information unbundled sell market separately tradable sizes. a large part market structure finance product counter. can product standardize trade exchange enable great transparency point view investor? be good way generate objective information market value collaterals, especially situation collateral fully mark market since information may available ongoing basis? be limit mark market certain kind asset whose value available high frequency basis? change house price dependent whole vector factors, range change local zone land laws, demand supply balance local areas, change monetary policy. it difficult devise land price house price system high frequency enough transmit quickly credit rat like. however, improvement could envisage term reform land price systems, improvement function law procedure foreclosure, bankruptcy rehabilitation. efficient function process function legal system essential collateral marketable value observable hence susceptible systemization term information become transparent. when presume value behind collateral either observable realizable, securitization market break down. and seem happen financial market today. the lesson current financial market crisis go ways. on one hand, market innovation indeed help bring financial market close need credit access earlier. despite problem associate sub-prime borrowers, must recognize almost 10 million borrower benefit market enable access house finance, deem possible earlier. with 20 per cent borrower report delinquent, difficulty, still mean 8 million people clearly benefit market. on hand, difficulty encounter draw attention kind issue arise speed innovation incentive structure flaw malpractice occur, intrinsic difficulty arise capture commoditizing information perhaps yet susceptible commoditization. 4 bi review 104/2007 from point view, need recognise positive contribution financial innovation make enhance efficiency financial intermediation. at time, reserve bank considers, dynamic setting, appropriate safeguard ensure stability, take account prevail governance standards, risk management system incentive framework foreign, public, private cooperative bank also relate non-banks. overall, progressive cautious policy contribute efficiency stability financial system enable current growth momentum environment macro stability. ii. response monetary authority a key question emerge current development financial market relate role monetary authority context crisis. this issue concern u central banking. over last decade two, would appear focus central bank narrow relative complex responsibility traditionally shouldered. a great deal write issue, great deal change term practice and, countries, regulatory structure alter move central bank relatively pure monetary authorities. accord view, central bank focus largely keep inflation low stable, also contribute financial stability. to quote harvard economist kenneth rogoff: “indeed many economist believe central banker could perfectly well replace computer program implement simple rule adjust interest rate response output inflation. but [this] view theoretically rigorous, reality not” (businessworld, september 17, 2007) although central banks, u federal reserve, explicit mandate also promote growth, good deal think recent time tend argue inflation control would promote growth central bank would good concentrate objective alone. it instructive examine central bank do current context. the response central bank recent event financial market show concern financial stability assume override importance, irrespective legislative mandate hand central bank part ongoing reforms. this evident fact central bank initially react injection liquidity, include special facility expansion eligible security collateral, rather interest rate cuts. discussion involve central banker various forum indicate willingness consider course action favour protect growth. a know, u federal reserve go week cut interest rate promote growth interest financial stability. and u.k. authority provide liquidity specific institution, give blanket guarantee depositor safety deposits. accordingly, become evident central bank role beyond inflation targeting. evidently, growth financial stability matter central banks. when come crunch, role lender last resort (lolr), discharge responsibility guardian financial stability, need perform function complex. should central bank lender last resort system whole inject systemic liquidity open market operation only, also provide liquidity individual financial institution judge solvent illiquid? how arrive judgment adequate information individual institutions? can detail information without ongoing responsibility regulation supervision? this issue dissimilar, term existence asymmetric information problem adequate transparency information relate value collateral underlie asset back securities. bank financial institution typically highly leverage institutions: thus judgement relate solvency depend valuation asset time difficulty bi review 104/2007 5 arise. in current case, bank invest chain vehicle security whose value doubt. when provide lolr liquidity support, central bank make judgement solvency institution provide liquidity? a great recognition appreciation appropriate role central bank gain ground, possible result rethink function central banks. a case point separation financial regulation supervision monetary policy could result ineffective inadequate surveillance context current crisis. there view problem information asymmetry might get aggravate bank report monetary authority regulatory body charge bank supervision. in review evolution central banks, one strike constant evolutionary change undergo time, difference function across different countries. their function change almost continuously response evolve circumstances. in fact, occurrence financial instability lead formation central banks, notably, found u federal reserve 1907 financial crisis unite states. thus, interest see think evolve result current crisis. ream already write thoughtful financial press much come. we begin forget danger contagion speed take place occur. the current development begin relatively minor segment financial market, viz., sub-prime mortgage segment, spread far wide across continents. similarly, problem arise one financial institution lead suspicion similar problem institution lead condition similar bank runs. the smooth run banks, financial institution financial market depend crucially trust credibility along availability transparent information. hence legitimate role central bank maintain financial stability inevitably lead unconventional action indeed restore financial stability probability opposite take place. what instructive current crisis small problem problem small institution cause financial instability contagion. in context, thing appear change much century. the 1907 financial panic also travel across continent start difficulty relatively small new york financial institution, knickerbocker trust company! systemic risk necessarily originate institution judge big fail. iii. assessment future at current juncture, likely evolution current financial market turmoil implication future evoke mix assessments. on one plane, spread contagion draw considerable concern, first, view level leverage; second, account nature vehicle create leverage. on another plane, view turbulence would restrict credit market impact consumer spend overall economic growth may mute credit worthiness would remain intact if, instance, leverage mortgage back security hold maturity sell distress. first, accord imf’s assessment, systemic consequence turmoil likely manageable fundamental support strong global growth. the repricing credit risk underway healthy correction lead serious market crash. the imf expect reestablishment credit discipline due recent prompt action number central bank help ensure adjustment process occur orderly manner. long term investor tend support view. the ongoing flight quality (us treasuries) global equity fund suggest continue faith strong fundamental global economy. 6 bi review 104/2007 second, recent development carry implication form heighten market discipline strict regulation financial markets. investor rely credit rat collateralised debt obligation (cdos) collateralised loan obligation (clos) likely question value rat markets. moreover, leverage buy-out activity likely wind down. while could cause worry equity valuations, expect concern would eventually recede long corporate profitability remain strong. furthermore, argue carry trade, source financial flows, may moderate may even go abrupt unwind would help maintain global financial stability. in vein, also argue recent development positive impact outlook emes consequence diversification portfolio international investor would incentivise maintenance good macroeconomic policy countries. at current juncture, expect fall u sub prime crisis likely limit asian bank easily accommodate within current rat positions. accord moody’s, exposure asian bank book value exceed 10-35 per cent annual pre-tax pre-provision profits. the mortgage back security cdo tranche hold bank usually senior therefore losses, all, would substantially 100 per cent. the bulk foreign currency investment asian bank (barring japan, china, korea singapore) continue highly rat government corporate bonds. policy maker need work rather grain market continue enable financial innovations. they should, however, vigilant sign disorderly global rebalancing. look ahead, entrench financial stability future would depend upon bolster market confidence. in overall assessment, adverse consequence u sub prime turmoil could weigh heavily future stability financial market potential wide impact global growth particular concern centre prospect emes. if credit condition tighten, emes could become particularly vulnerable reversal capital flow serious implication future prospects. a slow u economy, combination capital reversals, could also adverse consequence growth prolong basis affect export manufacture services, depend extent linkage u economy. on hand, flight capital safety diversification could even enhance capital flow countries. this could complicate conduct monetary policy. we wait watch. in general, recent financial market development indicative evolve uncertainty emes significant challenge conduct monetary policy ensure financial stability economies. a central bankers, enhance vigilance. iv. challenge monetary policy recent financial development draw attention try challenge face central bank conduct monetary policy, particular, limitation impose financial markets. these development highlight dynamic complex link central bank financial markets. while dynamic financial market drive combination global search yields, complacency risks, financial innovation unprecedented liquidity, spread independent, rule-based central bank facilitate risk take perception low probability short term management “intervention risk”. this set background shift balance economic power within global system, particular, favour emerge asia. while take view debate, important recognise change landscape financial market – transformation structure, process product financial markets, consolidation banking, increase electronic data flow dramatic rise volume volatility. the key issue central bank differentiate provide short term bi review 104/2007 7 liquidity operate medium term monetary policy communicate difference credibly. the conduct monetary policy also complicate host factor seem simultaneously work: risk sustain contagion; global capacity constraints; rise food prices; record high international crude oil prices; tension inflation expectations; evolution sovereign pool foreign exchange reserves; extent effectiveness monetary policy; surveillance risk monitor systems; downgrade risks. in evolve scenario, central bank may find necessary blend traditional set monetary policy rethink non-traditional policy option could include coordinate interventions, assurance liquidity, back timely credible action; emergency liquidity plans, business continuity plan disaster management strategies. admittedly, heighten uncertainty continue, even take account recent central bank activity key jurisdictions. it even clear whether relate issue come surface u make meaningful assessment. i expect i can't conclude address without say word domestic situation india. the best way quote governor recent speech mexico city. "available information indicate continuation growth momentum 2007-08 far strong pace impulse growth get broad-based. steady increase rate gross domestic save investment, consumption demand, addition new capacity well intensive efficient utilisation/capitalisation exist capacity expect provide support growth 2007-08. the recent gain bring inflation stabilize inflation expectation support current expansionary phase growth cycle. it is, however, necessary continuously ass risk inflation outlook emanate high volatile international crude prices, continue firmness key food price uncertainty surround evolution demand-supply gap globally, well india. risk global development continue persist, especially form inflationary pressures, re-pricing risk financial market danger downturn asset classes. excessive leverage enhance vulnerability global financial system. large change liquidity condition obscure assessment risks, attendant uncertainty. give flux associate financial market monetary policy set globally, india cannot immune developments. the policy challenge reserve bank, now, manage current transition high growth path contain inflationary pressure focus financial stability. contextually, reserve bank are, therefore, maintain enhance vigilance able respond appropriately prevail heighten uncertainty global financial, well as, monetary conditions". 8 bi review 104/2007 jean-pierre roth: the euro – stabilise factor international currency system summary speech mr jean-pierre roth, chairman govern board swiss national bank chairman board director bank international settlements, fondation jean monnet pour l'europe, lausanne, 21 september 2007. the complete speech find french swiss national bank’s website (www.snb.ch). * * * the euro undoubtedly success story. it contribute stabilise international currency system. in europe, former monetary disorder replace new monetary order. the european payment system become transparent price stability

september 2007. * * * introduction the primary goal south african reserve bank (the bank) achievement maintenance price stability. however, role bank economy go beyond narrow monetary policy focus. low stable inflation provide important framework economic growth, regulation supervision part financial sector, well oversight payment system ensure wheel economy continue turn efficiently. in past year execute mandate increasingly difficult uncertain environment. the south african financial market spar effect recent volatility financial market increasingly vigilant risk pose domestic economic landscape. at time ensure good governance respect internal work bank. it backdrop volatile economic environment i report today. today also release annual economic report cover development domestic international economy past year. in particular, highlight main economic development affect operation policy implementation. the focus address main operational area bank include monetary policy implementation, gold foreign-exchange reserve management, financial stability issues, national payment system, bank regulation supervision, international co-operation internal administration. monetary policy this past year challenge one monetary policy. a i report august last year, middle 2006 pressure inflation emerged, since intensified. by december 2006, year-on-year cpix inflation measure 5,0 per cent compare 3,7 per cent april year. inflation remain within target range april 2007 increase 6,3 per cent 5,5 per cent previous month. since remain outside target range. initially main driver adverse trend food petrol, recently evidence generalise upward trend inflation, include service prices. the monetary policy committee (mpc) respond development raise repurchase rate 50 basis point june 2006, first increase since 2002. this follow successive increase 50 basis point subsequent three meet mpc 2006. by december repurchase rate increase 9,0 per cent per annum. the pressure inflation emanate international domestic sources. at global level, world economy continue strong performance contribute sustain upward pressure oil food price which, turn, direct impact domestic food petrol prices. these item major contributor upward inflation trend 2006. in august last year international oil price peak level us$80 per barrel. price influence strong global demand, supply disruption number country geopolitical uncertainties. food price pressure also global dimension. drought condition number country well increase diversion agricultural products, particularly wheat, maize sugar, bio-fuels production contribute bi review 103/2007 1 trend. south africa immune development which, conjunction impact drought condition number regions, result acceleration food price inflation, particular meat price less extent maize prices. in october november 2006 meat price increase year-on-year rate almost 20 per cent, grain product price increase around 6 per cent. although world inflation remain control, pressure emanate development dictate monetary policy remain restrictive many countries. domestically, mpc contend combine threat high rate growth consumption expenditure credit extension. in second half 2006, domestic household consumption demand growth also continue robust pace around 7 per cent per annum, various consumer confidence index indicate sustain optimism part consumer despite tighten stance monetary policy. towards end year, motor vehicle sales, particularly passenger vehicles, show sign moderation. underpin consumer exuberance strong rate growth credit extension, despite increase securitisation transactions. follow 15-per-cent depreciation effective exchange rate may july 2006, exchange rate rand impact inflation outlook. however, remain fairly tight trade range, despite continue widen deficit current account balance payments, continue adequately finance capital inflows. not determinant inflation rate pose threat outlook. nominal unit labour cost well contained, fiscal policy continue supportive monetary policy although economy grow robust pace, deem grow rate significantly potential. inflation expectation also anchor within inflation target range. in first two month 2007 international oil price decline significantly, price north sea brent crude oil reach low us$51 per barrel january. these development contribute general downward revision oil price inflation forecasts. at time, tentative sign moderation household consumption expenditure, particularly respect passenger vehicle sales. the mpc also mindful fact interest rate adjustment take time impact fully demand. although inflation risk still perceive upside, continue stability exchange rate, sustain fiscal restraint improve inflation expectation result committee keep interest rate hold february april meet mpc. by june 2007 meet mpc, outlook deteriorate further. despite previous adjustment monetary policy stance, available data time suggest real household consumption expenditure credit extension remain strong, grow year-on-year rate around 7 per cent 26 per cent, respectively. international oil price resume upward trend, eventually peak around us$78 per barrel july. the overall impact adverse oil-price trend domestic inflation moderate somewhat relative stability rand exchange rate. however, follow breach upper end inflation target, worry sign deterioration inflation expectations. furthermore, partly response high inflation outcomes, nominal wage settlement begin trend higher, pose risk inflation outlook. in response pressure le favourable outlook, repurchase rate increase june august 2007 meet mpc. at time august meeting, turmoil world financial market begun. at stage unclear mpc whether development would confine financial markets, would impact significantly growth prospect domestically abroad. the committee decide appropriate remain focus inflation target, react financial market development insofar affect inflation outlook. 2 bi review 103/2007 the breach target see setback monetary policy. nevertheless, note main cause inflation exceed upper end inflation target range factor beyond direct influence monetary policy. we mindful, however, impact development inflation expectation need act emerge broad inflation pressures. the recent inflation forecast bank suggest inflation may return within inflation target range second half next year, mpc continue act accordingly ensure outcome achieved. money-market operation to ensure implementation monetary policy line stance determine mpc, bank manage daily liquidity requirement money market range roughly r10 billion r15 billion. the bank also broaden list security qualify eligible collateral refinance operations. with effect 23 may 2007, two category collateral accepted. category 1 security comprise government bonds, land bank bills, strips, sarb debenture treasury bills. the new category 2 security comprise non-bank, non-government security include all bond

2007 australian financial market report invest australia gold book, sydney, 19 september 2007. * * * it’s pleasure take part launch two report highlight strength australian economy financial markets. i would like congratulate invest australia, asx afma put together comprehensive informative documents. they immense benefit market participant foreign firm look enter australian market, also regulators, academic students. i would also like congratulate three organisation generally excellent job supporting, promote help regulate australian financial markets. this important work finance make vital contribution australian economy, directly, also role support sector economy. a note invest australia report, australia extend period strong economic growth, head seventeenth year. even take past decade, real gdp grow cumulative 40 per cent nominal gdp grow 90 per cent. financial market exhibit even fast growth period. the value company list asx grow 275 per cent, value debt security issue australia increase 170 per cent. the growth turnover financial market even dramatic, increase 290 per cent decade. so nominal economy almost double size past ten years, turnover financial market almost quadrupled. the remarkable thing pace growth show sign slowing. the member campbell inquiry, help set australia path financial deregulation market development, would i think please way financial system evolve ensue 25 year so. the previous speaker outline highlight report launch today, i won’t repeat them. rather, i would like take step back impressive figure contain reports, consider two questions: • financial market market turnover consistently grow fast economy whole? • increase financial activity mean real economy? turnover gdp let start first question. financial market play important role mobilise save allocate productive investment opportunities. there therefore strong link financial market economy. the australian economy would able record strong growth strong expansion financial markets. of course, link market economy also run strongly bi review 103/2007 1 direction: without strong economic growth, would see financial market develop have. even acknowledge strong two-way links, however, still leave question financial activity consistently rise fast economic activity. part answer rapid growth financial activity due rise private sector wealth, also rise fast gdp. over past decade, example, household financial wealth rise 170 per cent, compare 90 per cent increase nominal gdp note earlier. a lot increase wealth find way superannuation industry, professionally manage across wide range markets, doubt contribute financial market activity. but even rapid growth wealth still fall short growth financial activity. so i don’t think complete answer. the part answer, i think, innovation. innovation key feature financial market throughout past 25 years. this increase range financial product available saver investors, provide opportunity adjust asset liability fit risk/return preferences. often do break financial product component parts. a good example way derivative product allow various risk inherent financial product separated, investor need take risk comfortable. one look variety financial product expand years, broad range market list afma report, get feel innovative dynamic finance industry been. this innovation encourage market turnover several ways: • first, new product effect. like new products, new financial product typically experience rapid growth early years, user discover advantages. • second, innovation provide saver investor variety, give great scope adjust portfolios. • and lastly, perhaps importantly, innovation reduce costs, barrier save investment, change portfolio structures, diminished. what increase financial activity mean? let move second question. financial market activity is, course, end – least people employ finance sector – important question people want know increase financial activity mean real economy. here, i think, answer positive one. vibrant, competitive innovative financial market work increase availability, reduce cost, finance. there obvious example affect day-to-day lives. take house market. the development wholesale capital market provide fund non-bank lender allow compete deposit-taking institution house lending. this lead substantial reduction interest margin house lending, 2 bi review 103/2007 400 basis point 15 year ago little 100 basis point today. this material benefit australian households. the benefit financial market development restrict households. interest margin cost borrow also come businesses, financial intermediary compete capital market meet businesses’ fund needs. fifteen year ago, average interest margin business loan 570 basis points; today 135 points. in short, trade innovation see financial market eventually flow reduce cost user financial services. this mean amount spend household business financial service grow much le financial activity. for example, even though financial activity rise factor several time gdp past decade, finance insurance sector’s share national income rise slightly, around 5½ per cent around 7 per cent. financial innovation also allow household business reduce risks. firm good able structure finance suit characteristic business manage risk associate revenue flows. foreign exchange commodity derivative good example innovation help many australian company regard. the overall effect make economy resilient stable. the ability australian economy come asian financial crisis largely unscathed owe importantly fact australian firm financial institution able hedge lot risk cause much damage elsewhere asia. the diversity depth australian markets, ensure avenue finance always available, also add resilience economy. i would also give credit financial sector contribute reduction inflation volatility see past 15 years. part trace reduce pass-through inflation change exchange rate, which, turn, partly attributable increase use exchange rate hedge firms. conclusion so let end say clear growth financial market growth economy closely intertwined. financial market need strong economy thrive, economy need strong, vibrant well-regulated market continue expand. i think fair conclude australia date well serve financial markets, i would encourage continue work maintain high standards. bi review 103/2007 3 bi review 102/2007 1 svein gjedrem: uncertainty, economic model monetary policy address mr svein gjedrem, governor norge bank (central bank norway), centre monetary economics/norwegian school management, oslo, 17 september 2007. please note text may differ slightly actual presentation. the address base assessment present norge bank’s press conference follow executive board’s monetary policy meet 15 august, monetary policy report 2/07 previous speeches. * * * i welcome opportunity time discus centre monetary economics certain theme relate newsworthy economic policy issues. i discus follow three themes: • role monetary policy • view economic model basis interest rate set • finally, measure inflation uncertainty link rate inflation give point time let start discuss role monetary policy. the primary objective monetary policy ensure inflation expectation low stable. expectation low stable inflation provide nominal anchor. economic agents’ inflation expectation influence decision make today. our experience – experience country – show without nominal anchor cannot achieve stability employment output. the aim prevent inflation expectation become entrench operational target 2.5 per cent one main reason interest rate low low level 2003 2004, inflation recede approach zero. low interest rate stimulate demand output gradually lead prospect high inflation, respond increase interest rate. consumer price inflation still fairly low, capacity utilisation high level inflation project move gradually 2.5 per cent. high interest rate contribute gradual decline capacity utilisation inflation become high. in spite several year fairly low inflation, inflation expectations, example – necessarily precisely – measure tn gallup’s expectation survey, hold around inflation target. even long period low relatively stable inflation expectations, must alert development may change this. norway’s countries’ economic history show inflation inflation expectation become unhinged. there many self-regulating mechanism economy, inflation regulate itself. through history, monetary policy various way gear towards provide economy nominal anchor. from mid-1800s, many country decide peg value money gold. norway switch silver standard gold standard 1874. the latter system provide economy price fix nominal anchor. inflation determine growth output one hand supply gold other. this system common trade partners. furthermore, participate scandinavian currency union 1875. the gold standard suspend world war i british government largely finance war print money. parity policy interwar year unsuccessful many countries. after world war ii, country make joint effort stabilise price 2 bi review 102/2007 development establish bretton wood system. the u dollar peg gold currency dollar. in way, choose – value gold basis – fix exchange rate indirect inflation country nominal anchor. the bretton wood system collapse 1971. in absence gold anchor, real value banknote coin bank deposit dependent confidence central bank would inject much cash economic system value money declined. the various country choose different solutions. in norway, look country confidence inflation level, tie exchange rate various way countries’ currencies. in ten year 1976 1986, confidence policy severely eroded. in period, total ten devaluation "technical adjustments" entail devaluation, often aim bring cost back control. the objective keep inflation stable set aside. repeat devaluation eventually lead expectation authority would future stand promise fix exchange rate, price cost inflation become high, expect krone would devalue again. the social partner begin take high inflation account wage demand price setting. the last devaluation come 1986. subsequently, interest rate use maintain fix krone exchange rate order bring price cost inflation control. we choose fix exchange rate countries' inflation nominal anchor. economic policy influence experience country deal problem inflation earlier, u germany. the decline inflation norway thus come wake fall inflation abroad. historical data seem suggest turbulent periods, inflation gradually revert low stable level time domestic inflation determine external inflation. however, inflation country national currency something drift wind abroad. it monetary policy choice make norway determine price development here. we abandon fix exchange rate policy december 1992. one important reason inherent weakness fix exchange rate system environment free capital flow deep financial markets. when fix exchange rate policy formally abandoned, risk norwegian economy could lose nominal anchor. however, krone exchange rate show little movement soon find new range. fiscal policy stabilise effect. the exchange rate remain stable autumn 1996. this partly due low wage growth level total demand generate pressure economy. after period, krone begin show wide fluctuations. the experience latter half 1990s demonstrate monetary policy cannot fine-tune exchange rate. development international financial market lead great fluctuations. and fundamentally – exchange rate development long send signal back wage formation fiscal policy labour market pressure mount income policy failed. high petroleum revenues, fiscal slippage expectation increase use petroleum revenue contribute this. the exchange rate therefore long suitable nominal anchor. a result, norge bank gradually place increase emphasis low stable inflation. in 2001, norwegian authority decide monetary policy norway orient towards low stable inflation numerical target inflation, case many country late 1990s. a gold standard fix exchange rate regimes, choice nominal anchor determine rate inflation norway time. bi review 102/2007 3 future study probably find inflation revert inflation target time. this indication monetary policy work natural inflation rate natural, self-regulating mechanism. inflation still influence exogenous conditions. increase globalisation, particularly china’s grow importance world trade, past ten year example result low import inflation measure foreign currency. at time, productivity growth high many countries. these positive supply-side feature period contribute favourable development short-term trade-off economic growth inflation. a result, many country inflation little high outset able bring inflation virtually cost. in respect, probably talk degree endogeneity inflation.1 however, still authority orientation monetary policy choose whether inflation remain low stable permanent basis. over time, interest rate set aim keep inflation close target. in process, interest rate short-term direct indirect effect number economic variables. in short medium term, weigh aim stability output employment one hand stability inflation hand. this mean one instrument two separate objectives, weigh two objective other. it might tempt give weight objective beyond effect might inflation. this would entail take risk make compromise regard inflation target. there particular two objective single out: • sustain employment high level, • stabilise property price credit. high demand labour encourage people, would otherwise remain stick welfare system, enter labour market. a period high demand labour may thus increase effective labour force permanent basis. conversely, period low demand labour increase flow benefit scheme lead permanent reduction labour force. if central bank attempt use labour market mechanisms, would contribute amplify demand labour upturn low interest rates, counter fall demand downturn keep interest rate low. such policy reminiscent low interest rate policy 1970s 1980s fairly rapidly factor economic agents’ inflation expectations. over time, monetary policy lead high inflation, high employment. unemployment decline markedly low. at time, wage earners’ share corporate earn declined. historically, clearly negative relationship unemployment wage shares. development recent year pave way strong growth employment, also today cyclical upturn mature phase. development past year must see background effect number positive supply-side condition norwegian economy. high export price low import price lead low rate increase consumer price increase household real wage income, also high corporate earn solid growth employment. 1 see, inter alia, rogoff, k. (2003), “globalization global disinflation,” federal reserve bank kansa city economic review, fourth quarter, 45-78. 4 bi review 102/2007 at time, productivity growth unusually high. the effect complex. in early phase recovery, delay pick-up employment growth, also contribute low inflation. increase productivity mean demand remain high without rise inflation. the interest rate set low level bring inflation back target. at time, also enable enterprise make use high growth potential. eventually also result high demand labour. improve efficiency another factor explain high level profitability norwegian business sector. at time, ample supply foreign labour, probably dampen impact wage growth. in addition, increase globalisation general may broaden scope norwegian enterprise relocate production country labour cost become high. such development probably place restraint wage demand among worker sector enterprise opportunities. be possible sustain combination low employment low wage shares? first, partly depend whether positive supply-side condition sustained. there probably symmetry here. should term trade deteriorate, productivity growth slacken foreign worker return home country, wage share increase, profit fall unemployment increase. second, even without reversal profit may fall unemployment rise. the implication depend far businesses, search qualify labour, stretch bid wages. this also depend employee react adaptability well development benefit scheme social schemes. long period rapidly rise property price debt source future instability real economy. should monetary policy give weight development property credit market beyond impact inflation? low interest rate fuel rise property price debt accumulation. large volume lend use finance consumption investment, among thing housing. at time, many positive supply-side condition – strong growth real income household sector private public enterprise – probably make direct contribution sharp rise house price debt accumulation. when capital – increasingly labour well – flow freely across borders, price factor production great extent reflect global growth competitive conditions. on hand, price fix capital, property, influence expect future income different countries. even construction cost increase somewhat – accelerate extent year – primarily price land increase norway. land value considerably high level, price dwell increase extent. norway reap gain strong expansion asian country change division labour countries. the improvement norway’s term trade, couple high growth productivity, deliver strong, positive income shock norwegian economy. it follow land price rise fast pace prices. this real economic effect, monetary policy cannot eliminate. in addition, house price debt accumulation affect structural change capital credit market change lend willingness, demographic trend migration patterns. it difficult determine extent house price rise result structural change wealth gain extent house price push expectation continue high rise house prices. development since begin 1990s may engender expectation house price continue rise. this may increase house purchase pure investment purpose induce young buyer enter house market early otherwise. the pronounce fall bi review 102/2007 5 save past year indicate household take great chances. the house market may state euphoria. we influence house price interest rate, interest rate increase markedly high level order curb house price inflation, krone would significantly strong cpi inflation significantly lower. yet low stable inflation operational target monetary policy. there symmetry well. should house price fall sharply, interest rate set concentrate dampen effect inflation overall activity economy. nevertheless, communication, seek take account possibility debt asset price development may potential source subsequent instability, neither ambition conviction monetary policy control development variables. moreover, state clear term interest rate unusually low would increase gradually normal level. since 2005, reflect interest rate forecast. since inflation expectation firmly anchored, also able increase interest rate gradually even though actual inflation target. the time horizon reach target forecast stretched. let turn economic model use. even though monetary policy cannot operate objective development labour market, asset price debt accumulation, economic variable provide information future price developments, include basis interest rate setting. in order glean much information possible future inflation gain insight interest rate affect economy, norge bank – like central bank – us economic model analytical tool. what make good model depend intend purpose model. the models' purpose must thus give decisive weight choice design model tools. the model must provide indication interest rate working. we assume norway national currency determine inflation time. one model requirement therefore monetary policy anchor inflation expectations. we must also take account economic agent look ahead make decision concern consumption, investment, wage price base decision today's economic policy, also expectation future policy. in addition, build theory experience 1970s 1980s indicate medium long term unemployment could reduce will accept somewhat high inflation. at give point time, basis current statistic anecdotal information provide indication economy evolve month ago. but even basis uncertain. statistic prone substantial revision data different source provide different profile variable. for example, financial market statistic national account statistic show, many previous occasions, different profile household net lending. in order obtain accurate picture today’s situation development next quarters, rely large extent various statistical forecast techniques. such technique model capture time series property data correlation many case feature fairly high degree accuracy without model relationship follow economic theory. norge bank devote considerable resource improve develop model apparatus “nowcasting”. we engage extensive cooperation researcher norway abroad central banks. result documentation work publish come monetary policy report article researcher norge bank. 6 bi review 102/2007 in order forecast somewhat ahead, must gain insight force work affect economy. statistical forecast models, model largely base previous experiences, limit help. for example, previous experience provide limit guidance explain drive force behind cyclical upturn many difference relation early periods. a solid basis economic theory require shed light causal relationships. norge bank's work model recent year aim construct theoretical macro model enhance understand economic developments. by look households' firms' behaviour, analyse effect change structural nature economy. in model give name nemo (norwegian economy model), development norwegian economy explain among thing change business technology, market structure product labour market, household preference regard work leisure monetary policy. a model never able provide exhaustive description reality, good macro model framework ratiocination. in way, model play important role analytical basis interest rate setting. at time, many question condition uncertain model cannot help us. for example, know whether high rate growth productivity permanent phenomenon whether gradually fall back. we little precise knowledge drive productivity growth. it may see period equilibrium high employment, low unemployment low wage share earlier. but uncertain long period last. even use different model anecdotal information, cannot escape need healthy portion qualify judgement make forecast set interest rate. my experience far back 1970s event major disturbance structural change economy, one essentially rely general insight function economy. model rely heavily regression easily break down. a mervyn king, governor bank england, state explicitly point2: “..that’s every variable look at, work it’s grow fast slow use rather mindless regression.…the secret good policy try think trough economics shock hit economy present. that nutshell philosophy policy. don’t rely regression past.” have discuss role monetary policy rather complex economic models, i move final theme may seem prosaic, notably measure current inflation. in general, production level economic statistic probably high norway, show international comparison imf among others. it would also seem cost-effective. improvement frequently make methodology compilation cpi statistics. in august year, index electricity, book air travel revised. last year, statistic norway change method treatment rent house market, previous year food index revised. a general view change statistic production well document place particular emphasis identify effect change might measure inflation. furthermore, statistic comparable, necessarily 2 see mervyn king, governor, bank england occasion tenth anniversary central bank's independence: (see financial times, thursday, 3 may). bi review 102/2007 7 identical, across countries. it positive others interest debate statistic production.3 with inflation target monetary policy, measure inflation particular importance. cpi inflation use reference wage negotiation spring. many financial contract link cpi inflation. a number international study conclude considerable measurement error official consumer price indices.4 the main criticism official index sufficiently adjust change quality capture consumers’ possibility shift consumption away good show fast rise prices. many study conclude consumer price index overestimate actual rise prices. that one reason inflation-targeting country set target high zero. but also study point consumer price index underestimate rate increase components. against backdrop, i discus two particular notional concept use estimate consumer price index norway illustrate uncertainty; impute rent owner-occupied dwell measure clothe prices. a common method impute rent owner-occupied house apply rent dwell equivalent type, often refer rental equivalence. in addition norway, statistical agency denmark, u germany, among others, use impute rent calculate owner occupants’ house cost consumer price index. the consumer price index design measure price development stream good services. it service dwell provide consumer price index capture. house price like asset prices, share price bond prices. it may nevertheless interest look relationship house price rents, least theory. let u assume rental market home ownership market equilibrium. in case, home rental price reflect cost own home. what include cost own dwelling? the cost acquire home must obviously include finance cost determine interest rate. norwegian household primarily finance home purchase floating-rate mortgages. long-term interest rate still important provide information development short-term interest rate time. the long-term interest rate therefore relevant rate. house depreciation also bear user costs. moreover, expect increase price dwell represent gain must deduct costs. if add subtract expectation general rise price economy, leave follow four variable bear user costs: house prices, long-term real interest rates, capital depreciation expect real rise house prices.5 3 a did, example, knut anton mork, chief economist handelsbanken norge, norwegian financial daily finansavisen 25 august. 4 see example lebow, david e. jeremy b. rudd

* dear friends, it pleasure privilege morning share experience view august audience regard india’s preparedness basel ii implementation. i thankful organiser afford opportunity today. a well aware, implementation new capital adequacy framework long exact journey jurisdictions, case india. the country various stage implementation. in india, regard country context tune overall approach regulatory reforms, adopt calibrate approach phase implementation basel ii secure non-disruptive migration new framework. in remark today, i would like briefly touch upon evolution revise framework, broad structure, preparatory measure take rbi implement framework challenge need tackle migration basel ii. at outset, let hasten add move towards basel ii framework, rbi adopt three-track approach capital adequacy regulation india, norm stipulate vary degree stringency different category banks. similar differentiate approach adopt jurisdiction also. this deliberate choice u regard size, nature complexity operation relevance different type bank indian financial sector, need achieve great financial inclusion provide efficient credit delivery mechanism. thus, commercial banks, account lion’s share total asset bank system, basel ii standard co-operative bank remain basel i norm credit risk surrogate measure market risk. the regional rural banks, hand, limit operation rural areas, non-basel standards. basel ii the attempt harmonise capital adequacy standard internationally date back 1988, “basle committee bank regulation supervisory practices”, named, release capital adequacy framework, know basel i. this initiative set first internationally accept framework measure capital adequacy minimum ratio achieve banks. this norm widely adopt 100 countries, india, implement 1992. over years, however, basel i framework find several limitation broad-brush approach credit risk, narrow coverage confine credit market risks, non-recognition credit risk mitigants, encourage capital arbitrage structure transactions. moreover, rapid advance risk management, information technology, bank market products, banks’ internal processes, last decade, far outpace simple approach basel i measure capital. a need was, therefore, felt replace accord risk-sensitive framework, would address shortcomings. accordingly, wide-ranging global consultative process, basel committee bank supervision (bcbs) release june 26, 2004 document “international convergence capital measurement capital standard : a revise framework”, supplement november 2005 update market risk amendment. this document, popularly know “basel ii framework”, offer new set international bi review 102/2007 1 standard establish minimum capital requirement bank organisations. it capitalise modern risk management technique seek establish risk-responsive linkage banks’ operation capital requirements. it also provide strong incentive bank improve risk management systems. the risk sensitiveness seek achieve now-familiar three mutually reinforce pillars. the pillar 1 stipulate minimum capital ratio require allocation regulatory capital credit risk market risk additionally, operational risk well, cover previous accord. the pillar 1, unlike previous accord, provide menu approaches, simplify advance ones, determine capital charge three category risks. the credit risk mitigants use bank specifically recognise provide appropriate capital relief. the pillar 2 framework deal “supervisory review process” (srp), probably well understand two pillars. in fact, element make revise framework comprehensive sweep address entire risk domain banks. let elaborate little. it require bank develop internal capital adequacy assessment process (icaap) encompass whole risk universe – address risk either fully capture capture two pillar – assign appropriate amount capital, internally, risks, commensurate risk profile control environment. under supervisory review, supervisor would conduct detail examination icaap banks, warranted, could prescribe high capital requirement, minimum capital ratio envisage pillar 1. the pillar 3 framework, market discipline, focus effective public disclosure make banks, critical complement two pillars. it recognise fact apart regulators, bank also monitor market discipline exert market powerful sanction impose regulator. it premise basic principle market would quite responsive disclosure make bank would duly reward penalised, tune nature disclosures, market forces. preparatory measure basel ii implementation let say word process adopt india implementation basel ii. though indian bank become fully compliant basel i accord march 2005, rbi initiate preparatory measure even prior that. in august 2004, soon new framework release bcbs, bank advise conduct self-assessment risk management system initiate remedial measures, needed, keep view requirement basel ii framework. further, secure consultative participative approach non-disruptive migration basel ii, steer committee constitute october 2004, comprise senior official 14 select bank (a mix public sector, private sector foreign banks). it form several sub-groups address specific issue basel ii make recommendation reserve bank. base inputs, february, 2005, rbi issue draft guidelines, public comments, implementation pillar 1 pillar 3 requirement basel ii framework. in light feedback receive wide spectrum bank stake holders, draft guideline revise place public domain march 20, 2007 second round consultations. keep view additional feedback received, guideline finalise issue april 27, 2007. a regard pillar 2, bank ask put place requisite internal capital adequacy assessment process (icaap) approval boards. i may mention even final guideline issued, rbi ask bank may 2006 begin conduct parallel runs, per draft guidelines, 2 bi review 102/2007 familiarise requirement new framework. during period parallel run, bank require compute, parallely, go basis, capital adequacy ratio – basel i norms, currently applicable, well basel ii guideline applicable future. this analysis, along several prescribe assessments, place board bank every quarter also transmit rbi. these report receive rbi indicate implementation basel ii bank process get stabilised. the minimum capital adequacy ratio prescribe basel ii norm continue nine per cent, solo well consolidate level. this, however, subject stipulate prudential floor first three year implementation guard significant decline capital ratio bank arise capital relief might accrue basel ii. the bank are, however, expect operate level well minimum capital requirement. the bank also require achieve tier i capital ratio six per cent late march 31, 2010, solo well consolidate basis. a two-stage implementation guideline envisage provide adequate lead time bank system. accordingly, foreign bank operate india indian bank operational presence outside india require migrate standardise approach credit risk basic indicator approach operational risk effect march 31, 2008. all schedule commercial bank encourage migrate approach basel ii alignment them, but, case, late march 31, 2009. it conscious decision begin simple approach available framework. a regard market risk, bank continue follow standardised-duration method, already adopt basel i framework, basel ii also. thus, reckon well-planned carefully-sequenced preparatory work already done, choice exercise rbi national discretion, couple phase implementation schedule, i incline believe indian bank system could consider high state preparedness would well poise seamless migration basel ii next year, tune envisage timeframe. this, however, say process would cake-walk – would considerable challenge lie head us, current phase implementation also move advance approaches. the challenge ahead let briefly outline salient issue challenge might arise indian bank system adoption basel ii framework. the list is, however, mean exhaustive. first, new norm might, cases, lead increase overall regulatory capital requirement banks, particularly simple approach adopt india, additional capital require operational risk offset capital relief available credit risk. this would course depend upon risk profile banks’ portfolio also provide incentive good risk management bank would need prepare augment capital strategic capital planning. second, standardise approach credit risk lean heavily external credit ratings. while rbi accredit four rat agency operate india, rat penetration india rather low. moreover, credit rat india confine rat instrument issue entity whole. besides, credit rat provide lag indicator credit stand entity, lead indicator. the bank would, therefore, need actively reckon aspect icaap exercise. bi review 102/2007 3 third, risk weight scheme standardise approach also create incentive bank client remain unrated since entity receive low risk weight 100 per cent vis-à-vis 150 per cent risk weight low rat client. this might specially case unrated client expect poor rating. the bank need watchful regard. fourth, new framework could also intensify competition best client high credit ratings, attract low capital charge. this could put pressure margin bank. the bank would, therefore, need streamline reorient client acquisition retention strategy. finally, implement icaap pillar 2 framework would perhaps big challenge bank india require comprehensive risk model infrastructure capture risk cover two pillar framework. the validation internal model bank supervisor would also arduous task. in regard adoption advance approach available basel ii, rbi stipulate timeframe adoption approach migration advance approach would certainly pose significant challenge – bank well supervisors. in case, slightly different set issue challenge likely arise would need keep view decision migrate them. first foremost, bank need demonstrate supervisor meet minimum criterion stipulate basel ii framework eligible adopt irb approaches. this could require, inter alia, suitable adjustment risk-rating design operation various product line bank also governance structure ensure integrity rat process. second, unlike simple approach basel ii, advance approach data intensive require high-quality, consistent, time-series data various borrower- facility-categories period five seven year enable computation require risk parameter (such default probability loss give default, etc.). the bank would perhaps need thorough review internal process view redesign upgrade able capture information need create requisite databases. third, robust risk management architecture, include strong stress-testing framework scenario analyses, would necessity advance approaches. a system within bank validate accuracy internal rat process would essential element risk management set up. fourth, overarch requirement efficient data management effective risk management structures, would state-of-the-art technological infrastructure might need significant investment improvement achieve seamless enterprise-wide integrate risk management, sharply focus strategic plan would necessary. fifth, considerable leeway available bank advance approach determine regulatory capital requirements, high standard corporate governance would critical maintain integrity advance approaches. sixth, complexity advance approach require highly skilled staff human resource management bank industry, particularly public sector banks, could emerge bind constraint, adopt advance approaches. this would need innovative strategy concert effort part bank able attract retain right mix talent organisation. finally, advance approach would also cast onerous responsibility supervisor guide bank system implementation phase 4 bi review 102/2007 also validate internal models, system process adopt regulate banks. this, needle say, would require considerable capacity build augmentation domain knowledge expertise supervisor ensure non-disruptive migration advance approach basel ii. let hasten assure we, rbi, quite live issue strategic intervention already plan regard. conclusion i provide brief overview indian approach implement basel ii framework state preparedness bank india. let conclude remind present basel ii framework provide significant incentive bank sharpen risk management expertise enable efficient risk-return trade offs; also present valuable opportunity gear internal process international best standards. this would require substantial capacity build commitment resource close involvement banks’ top management guide arduous undertaking. it

argentina, euromoney conferences, london, 13 september 2007. * * * the first thing come mind i draft speech explain basis monetary financial strategy extent contribute promote macroeconomic stability last years. i must admit, paradoxically, financial turmoil last week give big hand. this first time, many latin american countries, whole macroeconomic program – include global monetary financial policy strategy – stress. so, stress test provide u unique opportunity witness policy action. it also allow u ass internal consistency intertemporal sustainability approach. a market come pressure, emerge economy show general resilience. but, category. in de-leveraging scenario, country solid economic fundamental (or “liquidity suppliers”), include large fiscal current account surpluses, flexible exchange rate regime abundant foreign reserve likely outshine “liquidity consumers”. a analyze behavior asset class, argentina’s performance monetary, financial exchange rate market show first camp. in nutshell, country rid storm due good macroeconomic management. we establish new framework that, view, go last next decades. it base interaction five pillars: 1. fiscal solvency; 2. external sustainability; 3. a prudent consistent monetary policy ensure equilibrium supply demand monetary market; 4. countercyclical financial policies. they include active fx accumulation management. moreover, development sound well-matched financial system act buff turmoil; 5. a manage float exchange rate regime. let elaborate upon interaction pillar key keep economy move long-term equilibrium. firstly, fiscal account show surplus, boost increase tax revenues. the primary balance currently stand almost 3.5%, achieve five consecutive year budgetary discipline. a result, ratio debt gdp continue decline. finance requirement manageable context restrain access capital market emerge market economies. secondly, since 2002 current account balance project remain positive 2007 six consecutive years, unprecedented event since mid-1940s. argentina take advantage structural change world economy yield high commodity price several export products. this fact, combine factor abundance natural resources, reasonable infrastructure high level bi review 101/2007 1 education standards, put country interest competitive position global economy. shipment manufacture product (of agricultural industrial origin) lead growth exports. this increase occur together great diversification term product and, especially, destinations. this boost active trade policy pursue last year open diversify markets. for example, number country argentina sell product grow steadily 159 1999 190 2006. this factor clearly help mitigate risk associate adverse shock trade partners. and, despite likely deceleration u and, probably, europe, i expect significant shift away scenario time soon. today, commodity price depend almost exclusively long-term equilibrium supply demand particular market. and balance virtually unaffected recent financial turmoil. especially, soft commodities, demand seem immune recent developments. in fact, agricultural price show persistent upside movement recently associate structural change: sustain growth demand (rather negative supply shock time history). steady demand base high consumption emerge market economy worldwide. the middle east, southeast asia latin america deliver best economic performance last decades. together, act positive factor balance (and also mitigates) prospective weakness u europe. wheat prices, instance, show new record high last month explain high demand come emerge world (mainly india). this keep inventory low ratio stock-consumption minimum levels. escalate shipment also grind increase use agricultural product corn input produce substitute fossil fuel (to consume industrial countries). accord recent usda studies, corn need energy demand grow, quantity, world’s total production for, least, next five years. this phenomenon contribute sustain high quotes. a by-product, affect food price overall due impact cost produce meat dairy products. consequently, experience high food price worldwide. the impact inflation particularly large develop countries, foodstuff usually high weight consumption basket (and, consequently, high weight cpi). additionally, countries, cereal dominate daily diet (according fao, cereal represent 52% diet develop economy compare 31% develop world). however, emerge market economy – food exporter argentina many country latin america consumers, include many asian country – also face sustain increase food prices. therefore, twin surplus (fiscal external) trademark argentine economy last year expect remain so. a oppose happen emerge markets, able show positive cash flow come real side economy together flexible exchange rate regime solid central bank give country paramount position face external turbulences. 2 bi review 101/2007 nevertheless, fiscal side, consolidate primary balance reach outstanding 5.3% 2004 decline two percentage point current levels. go forward, commitment increase primary surplus essential keep sustainable growth towards equilibrium. so, need preserve deepen surplus priority. mainly, still go transition phase typical post-crisis periods. and, transition stage – key macroeconomic variable converge long-term value – take time raise enormous challenges. for instance, take long country chile fully stabilize economy achieve sustain growth. our neighbor put place gradualist approach normalization period. it involve four common element utmost importance: consolidate fiscal solvency, reestablish external sustainability, restructure liabilities, rebuild financial system. once aspect addressed, progress consolidation full-fledged inflation target regime achieved. thus, several years, chile live high inflation, patiently build credibility institutions. so, experience emerge economy show flexibility gradualism policy design implementation adequate approach phase history. in argentina, despite notable recovery, several feature current macroeconomic performance indicate economy still head towards new long-term equilibrium. neither history international experience possible find precedent 2001-2002 crisis. unlike case brazil, mexico southeast asia, abandonment convertibility regime include simultaneously institutional breakdown, huge devaluation, destruction financial system default public debt. in addition, country long history macroeconomic instability. monetary regime unsuccessfully shift one extreme other. while eighty money supply grow vis-à-vis finance fiscal deficit, past decade, rigidity convertibility regime neither consistent structure economy government fiscal behavior. there several example normalization phase still take place: monetary transmission channel rebuilt, since credit private sector account 11 percent economy, still far latin american average. therefore, patiently rebuild power monetary policy develop require infrastructure important step towards consolidate growth stability. meanwhile, monetary financial policy conceive general equilibrium approach, fiscal solvency, monetary balance external sustainability mutually determined. so, argentine economy simply different stage crisis compare current situation latin american countries. thus, hasty diagnosis and, i hear many analysts, simplistic comparison among various countries’ situation may lead inappropriate policy recommendations. the path towards effective inflation target regime sequential one. build strong pillar track central bank operate strategically. under circumstances, sustainable long-lasting reduction inflation rate argentina depend comprehensive, joint coordinate action monetary policy, fiscal policy, wage policy, competition policy transition phase. bi review 101/2007 3 and this, take last three pillar i mentioned, outcome monetary financial strategy set central bank argentina last years. in fact, turbulence experience today enable u see monetary financial policy strategy action: • a prudent consistent monetary ensure equilibrium supply demand monetary market. • countercyclical financial policies. they include active fx accumulation management sound well-matched financial system act buff turbulence. • a manage float exchange rate regime. far erratic, move strategy line intertemporal goal equilibrium monetary market, preservation value currency stability depth financial system. i say “intertemporal” central bank “an across-the-cycle” view rather short-term one. in first place, policy guarantee stability ensure equilibrium supply demand money. thus, see current regime control money supply combine necessary do monetary prudence (as show sixteen run quarter compliance self-imposed monetary aggregate targets) flexibility (which enable u weather recent turbulences). we consolidate monetary policy scheme base control money supply since adequate economy transition, still make intensive use relatively liquid mean payment relatively low bank penetration. the strategy implement various instrument allow u absorb supply peso derive fx accumulation policy. this aggressive policy feasible central bank strengthen balance sheet positive annual results. instrument include placement security fix float rates, repo market, reserve requirement policy, early payment rediscounts. the latter result central bank incentive lead significant monetary absorption last years. we also work deepen repo market empower interest rate reference policy tool. we gradually persistently hike rate. since 2005, interest rate 7-days repo operation increase 500 basis points, act important absorption instrument. recently, establish regular auction mechanism provide daily liquidity expand universe security take underlie asset operations. what recent trend money supply reflect? m2 show downward trajectory, steep fall year-over-year change 2007-2006 vis-à-vis growth rate 2003 2004. in fact, first time crisis, money supply grow nominal gdp. these clear indicator monetary policy prudential bias. also, state-owned bank start manage liquidity line rest financial system. let’s recall hold 26 billion peso liquidity various government agency 10 billion peso still sight deposits. this prudent monetary stance contribute achieve stable macroeconomic position. the different measure core inflation track show today similar monthly variation experience 2006: around 0.7% average; range 0.4% 0.9%. additionally, first quarter 2007 (last data available), gdp deflator grow average 2006. then, full use available instruments, contribute stabilization core inflation foster stability financial system. 4 bi review 101/2007 but, make mistake this: central bank concern current level inflation. there reason complacency. a consequence, joint work fiscal, monetary, wage competition policy need do make sustain progress next years. prudential fx accumulation another example speak itself. a every insurance policy, represent “abstract” benefit used, “concrete” one situation financial stress: $43 billion external liquidity central bank’s coffer enough discourage speculation. an additional element strategy develop past year face contingency recovery bank liquidity solvency. due improve regulatory framework, develop sound financial system today act “turbulence buffer” rather “amplifier”. just reserve play role liquidity insurance monetary authority, banks’ cash first defense line unexpected events. for reason, bank regulation foster recovery liquidity, equivalent almost 40 percent total deposits, one sound region. to strengthen monetary financial system, also adopt measure produce i consider one major breakthrough history: system independent public sector, take trade domestic currency, lender last resort also lend domestic currency. in regard, set strict guideline reduce exposure national, provincial, municipal public sectors. ceiling establish base capital institution relevant jurisdiction. in addition, overall maximum restriction set 35 percent bank’s total assets, fully effective now. a result, banks’ exposure public sector account le 17 percent total assets, vis-à-vis around 50 percent crisis. besides, take specific measure prevent cannot repay u dollar borrow currency, encourage development credit market domestic pesos. this action strengthen stability system also crowded-in private sector, help deepen market. in context high growth credit firm households, non-performing portfolio hit all-time low. the system already show profit couple fiscal year now, process capitalization extension term liability gather momentum. thus, financial system mature good prepare face sort disruption. lastly, current manage float exchange rate regime core monetary financial strategy. on one hand, avoid ensure “foreign exchange insurance” favor inflow hot money. on other, aim prevent short-term volatility affect spending, save investment decisions. and prove adequate scheme transition towards long-term equilibrium economy. under free float, exchange rate would reach significantly high quotations, run serious risk go back devaluation-inflation dynamic recurrent throughout argentine economic history. our action include – sequential combine – adoption set tool – monetary, exchange financial regulation measure – dodge every possible inflationary impact inject liquidity system. on foreign exchange side, central bank coordinate intervention state-owned bank act aggressively future market stabilize exchange rate. bi review 101/2007 5 we also resort use monetary financial regulation instruments: buy back security auction secondary market, optimize strength bill note auction accord prevail liquidity condition intensify operation repo market transparent auctions, among others. all all, central bank action show u consistency effectiveness strategy. we prove necessary “artillery” preserve money exchange market stability and, once, wide variety tool maneuver face turbulence show clear symptom permanence time. moreover, prove commitment price stability (with limitation derive instrument hand transition stage) intertemporal approach, is, look economic cycle. this conceivable course action central bank strategic vision. in view, framework extremely useful transition phase achieve five-year cycle high continue economic growth social inclusion. now, time strengthen calibrate take u next level: challenge turn framework permanent policy long-term parameters. the development pluri-annual target monetary, fiscal wage policy order set predictable horizon long-term investment example tool next stage requires. look ahead, investment rate of, least, 25% gdp need sustain current level economic growth time, help attain price stability time. for purpose, harmonization whole set instrument economic policy orient protect purchase power national income. it about, focus macroeconomic stability “across-the-cycle” perspective achieve sustainable economic policy time. otherwise, effort vain trap typical argentine pendulum, swing one end another spectrum potential policy continuity whatsoever. in fact, face synchronic challenge: achieve sustain growth build institution simultaneously. to implement policy effectively benefit future generations, possible way keep consistent gradualist approach build right infrastructure way back. the successful story country understand important reconcile goal instruments. especially, stage one, combination fundamental economic policy tool allow u achieve gradual long-lasting reduction inflation context economic growth include citizens. thank you. 6 bi review 101/2007 lars nyberg: monetary financial stability central bank perspective speech mr lars nyberg, deputy governor sverige riksbank, conference 10th anniversary central bank bosnia herzegovina, sarajevo, 13 september 2007. * * * lady gentlemen, what interaction monetary financial stability? this one discuss issue central bank academia today, likely remain high agenda foreseeable future. many central banks, include swedish riksbank, dual tasks: maintain price stability promote financial stability. i begin discuss task separately, turn question success bring inflation raise regard financial stability, influence conduct monetary policy sweden. before proceeding, i stress view i express own, necessarily reflect member executive board riksbank. moreover, keep mind remark primarily base experience inflation target central bank, operate small open economy. price stability the tame inflation, destructive price-wage spiral 1970s 1980s, one major success story modern economic policy making. economic theory tell u high inflation bad number reasons. these theory appear vindicated. the last decade see strong global economic growth, while, time, output volatility dropped. in practice, two path emerge achieve price stability. one way fix exchange rate regime, currency board. under arrangement, country simply import monetary policy country highly credible low-inflation regime. this path emerge weapon choice many emerge economies. these country want achieve price stability, avoid costly deflation otherwise might necessary anchor inflation expectations. the way independent central bank mandate maintain price stability. this mandate often formulate term inflation target. the inflation target operate swedish riksbank stipulate consumer price inflation 2 per cent per year, tolerance interval plus/minus 1 percentage point. for practical purpose arrangement close find in, example, uk, australia, norway eurozone. it also say general consensus inflation target sweden successful one. financial stability a i mention earlier, many central bank today also objective promote financial stability. while close universal agreement price stability means, yet emerge, attempt none withstanding, consensus work definition bi review 101/2007 1 financial stability.1 give problem define measure financial stability, pay attention it? one answer simply cannot afford so, financial crisis carry huge cost society. this show event japan nordic country early 1990s, much south east asia 1997. in fact, one could even claim, financial stability take precedence price stability, sense latter quite irrelevant financial system brink collapse. an important difference price stability financial stability responsibility price stability rest squarely central bank, financial stability necessitate cooperation central bank, supervisor government. however, exact role play different authority differ country country. another difference number instrument available policy makers. in case price stability, basically exist one instrument (either short-term interest rate nominal exchange rate). maintain financial stability, hand, require wide spectrum policy measures, professional supervision, legal framework encourage “moral hazard”-type behaviour crisis management plans. a recent complication surge cross border bank activities, mean national authority engage financial stability work, increasingly must work foreign colleagues. while internationalisation bank industry hold potential efficiency gains, increase household welfare, also add score new challenges. perhaps serious challenge term home-host problem. this can, essence, describe follows: suppose bank, marginal importance home country, set branch another country, turn systemically important country. give bank important home country, home supervisors, responsibility supervision, might think bank merit close supervision. however, host country, foot bill salvage operation case bank fails, incentive monitor bank huge. this dilemma new theory, become great practical importance financial globalization progressively make national border le relevant. asset prices, financial stability monetary policy be instance goal come conflict other? this question become particularly relevant last year asset price surged, while, time, consumer price inflation remain muted. on whole, i think reasonable assume price stability long run reinforce financial stability. the main reason low stable inflation reduce risk misallocating investments. although i believe low inflation foster financial stability, would wrong disregard possibility change inflationary process unintended consequence stability financial system. the success bring inflation low nominal real interest rates. moreover, factor integration emerge market world trade system, high productivity growth, put downward pressure price manufacture goods. this may induce key interest rate lower, otherwise would justify cyclical position economy. give fact low inflation regime yield high stable growth, conjunction low interest rates, wonder asset price surged. while much price movement fundamentally based, risk household firm might become optimistic future earn interest rates. put differently, risk 1 see e.g. schinasi, g. (2004): ”defining financial stability”, imf work paper, wp/04/187. 2 bi review 101/2007 asset price rise unsustainable level transition regime high inflation regime low inflation. another, unrelated issue, concern risk price credit markets. the last year saw risk premium credit market fall record low levels. the fall risk premium mean effect asset price important change risk free rate alone would suggest. while low risk premiums, take face value, signal healthy economy, many supervisor central bank concern risk premium fall far. a know, risk premium credit market rise dramatically summer. uncertainty value u subprime mortgage back security ignite furious “flight-to-quality”, actually seize important segment money market. it early tell permanent outcome event be. however, clear signal return high risk premium tight credit conditions, asset price inflation likely slow down. the area current regime low interest rate small risk premium mark impact probably residential property household debt. the rise house price last ten year indeed unprecedented duration, magnitude synchronisation across countries. in sweden, cause substantial amount public concern, often ask question significant overvaluation house market household overly indebted. answer question daunt task, require educate opinion equilibrium price residential property optimal level household indebtedness. such assessment complicate fact number important structural change mortgage markets. without go detail, weigh available evidence together, think residential property sweden significantly overprice general. nor believe household general overly indebted. however, preclude possibility country house price household indebtedness rise level beyond fundamentally motivated. yet, even don’t believe house price household indebtedness disconnect fundamental drivers, still reason u concern rise property price household indebtedness. in last years, sweden elsewhere, household debt grow much fast disposable income. obviously, sustainable long run, household ultimately would unable service debts. in long run likely indebtedness house price increase roughly rate nominal growth economy. this type adjustment, restrain growth rates, normally occur smoothly, household begin feel finance cannot tolerate high level indebtedness. however, overly sharp correction “hard landing” like, could lead weak growth economy long period time. in case, would also effect inflation. so, short, sweden situation prevail subdue inflationary pressure call expansionary monetary policy, while, time, property price surge fashion way deem sustainable. how can, should, central bank small open economy inflation target deal situation? the first thing central bank engage “open-mouth operations” constantly remind everyone existence risk speech documents. one publication prove particularly useful regard financial stability reports, publish increase number central banks. by take systemic view financial system, financial stability report investigate collective impact stem action individual financial institutions. by communicate find market participant general public, central bank raise awareness risk financial stability, might otherwise go unnoticed. bi review 101/2007 3 but, times, may enough, inevitable question beg answer – how, all, central bank let change asset price influence monetary policy? the riksbank run flexible inflation target, mean also take real economy account set interest rates. change in, example, property price routinely take account framework since trajectory policy rate forecast horizon set outlook inflation output, outlook affect change property price among things. however, close impossible properly quantify, capture risks, overly sharp correction property price time future. we therefore take risk kind account different way normal approach, forecast inflation real economy serve foundation. this do adjust time policy rate changes, example raise policy rate somewhat early would justify forecast inflation real economy. by so, hope minimize probability hard land scenario. conclude remark if i sum experience last years, i think three conclusion drawn. first all, long asset price inflation deem macroeconomic risk, address within framework flexible inflation target. if deem threat stability financial system, brunt policy response would monetary policy, rather regulatory side. secondly, i think problem manage risk asset price monetary policy decision process large extent pedagogical, i.e. explain target asset prices, completely ignore them. however, monetary policy topic lot people opinion, never go please everyone. in fact, recent year riksbank criticize put either much, little, emphasis property prices. finally, i would like underscore necessity stress-testing bank sector sudden shift property prices. you whole staff phd run kind advance model tell asset overvalued. that’s fine, end day might wrong, would like know consequence go bank system. let end thank central bank bosnia herzegovina host conference congratulate bank 10th anniversary. 4 bi review 101/2007 david dodge: a clear case transparency remark mr david dodge, governor bank canada, canada-uk chamber commerce, london, uk, 12 september 2007. * * * it 26 month since i last speak london certainly, much change world since then. we see remarkable continuation robust global growth, fuel increase international trade facilitate continue evolution expansion capital markets. domestic demand begin grow strongly europe asia slow unite states, begin ease concern relate global imbalance i speak last visit. however, credit spread continue narrow, lend standard loosen early part 2007, grow use structure financial product increase distance investor underlie credits. although central banker raise concern past 18 month price credit whether appropriately reflect risk, late spring year spread risky asset begin widen, trigger largely concern relate market u.s. subprime mortgages. in august, concern turn consternation, investor structure product – especially asset-backed commercial paper (abcp) – "discovered" u.s. subprime mortgage might include asset underlie products. compound consternation worry counterparties might weak financial state previously anticipated, exposure assets. this lead tighten condition dislocation money market generally. one key factor behind recent trouble money market was, i believe, lack transparency. transparency can, course, mean different thing different contexts. in term financial markets, i refer ability – well willingness – participant obtain use full timely knowledge market activity, include precise nature traded. it live event august, combination ongoing effort bank canada strengthen function international financial institutions, lead use remark today make clear case transparency. in so, i limit comment financial markets. transparency underlie theme pervade much policy-makers do, domestically internationally. so, i begin remark discussion financial market lack transparency contribute market dislocation see recently. i return theme i speak i last – importance strengthen international financial institution increase transparency advice operations. finally, i'll say word health canadian economy. financial markets: need transparency let begin remark recall 2005-06 period, many central banker – include – become concern appear excessive ease credit conditions, describe "wall liquidity" build around globe. what create wall liquidity? well, i mention last time i here, base global excess desire save relative desire investment. these excess save act drive real longer-term interest rates, even time many central banker raise policy interest rates. a longer-term interest rate declined, investor intensify search good returns. this search yield lead narrow spread risky assets. a well, bi review 100/2007 1 loosen lend standard markets, lender become will take risk. it also provide opportunity increase issuance structure products. package sell loan structure allow higher-risk asset take quality lower-risk loan fuel demand higher-risk asset embed significant leverage. this financial engineer factor spur merger acquisition activity, include corporate takeover private equity firms, well lend market market subprime mortgage unite states. in many cases, structure product become increasingly complex difficult investor understand. the security often make use leverage contain layer derivative top various type assets; asset package repackaged, sell resold, myriad forms. in complex process, transparency underlie credit often lost. because originator loan intend securitize rather leave balance sheets, lack incentive carefully ass creditworthiness borrower. and investor often lack ability, make effort, see complexity instrument. thus, investor unaware creditworthiness root asset potential difficulty liquidity instrument itself. compound problem fact model upon structure product value assume could readily trade liquid market. in august, assumption test find fully warranted. i want emphasize significant benefit development new, complex instruments. they provide ability separate different type risk, credit market risk. this promote good risk management allow risk bear best able so. both bank non-banking institution create different type loan could package sell different investor across global economy. and take many loan balance sheet enhance ability bank sector originate new loan remain well capitalized. a i mention earlier, central banker worry quite time credit spread appropriately reflect risk. so, welcome re-pricing risk begin spring year. indeed, may, saw spread high-yield corporate bond emerging-market bond begin widen level close historical norms. we also saw re-pricing u.s. subprime mortgage reflect rise delinquency rates. this process mean people take great deal risk face losses. but general, necessary re-pricing risk proceeding, market function properly. in august, however, process hit fairly major bump road. to begin with, saw spread risk inherent structure product also mean wide dissemination underlie problem associate asset root instruments. moreover, complexity lack transparency many structure product add market dislocations. it extremely difficult investor peel back layer security derivative determine, confidence, creditworthiness asset back particular security market value security itself. even supposedly sophisticate investor become extremely uncertain that, turn, lead fear. such fear make market le liquid – money market particular – "wall liquidity" evaporate summer sun. investor seek shelter security least risky, shortest-term, transparent assets. the re-pricing credit risk ongoing process. unfortunately, may take somewhat long previous periods, opacity legal complexity many structure products. all imply early draw definitive conclusion current experience. but one lesson, i hope clear everyone, absolute importance transparency market function properly. vendor financial instrument need structure investment way 2 bi review 100/2007 market player clearly see buying. credit-rating agency need clearly indicate rat highly structure product use degree certainty rat conventional, single-name issuers. at time, investor take responsibility diligent research, good understand nature investment demand great transparency lacking. investor rely simply pronouncement rat agency deliver seal approval! instead, must homework make concert effort understand buying. however, process successful access information need. now i want spend minute discuss role central banks, bank canada particular, august. a liquidity dry up, central banker many part world quite appropriately become involved. many central bank inject short-term liquidity money market required, fulfil two fundamental roles. first, absolutely normal proper central bank provide liquidity bank quite solvent face market become illiquid – point walter bagehot recognize century ago. bank need know access central bank's liquidity facility required. at bank canada, stand liquidity facility available end day, access penalty rate 25 basis point target overnight rate, institution pledge broad range easily price security collateral. follow onset market dislocations, increase supply settlement balance normally see increase demand cash balances. our second fundamental role conduct monetary policy transparent way keep policy interest rate close target, order control inflation. the event august put strong upward pressure key overnight rate use conduct monetary policy. and carry open market buyback operation inject liquidity order maintain rate. we also temporarily expand list security eligible use market participant buyback operations. all told, action role effective improve function overnight money market. so restore original list security eligible use buyback operations, gradually reduce level settlement balances. i want absolutely clear one point: the action take provide liquidity support smooth operation financial market way signal change monetary policy. in fact, step maintain monetary policy stance keep target overnight rate 4 1/2 per cent, judge appropriate keep inflation target medium term. but overnight market canada well way back normal operations, mean problem money market resolved. term fund remain somewhat expensive, yield spread bankers' acceptance treasury bill remain abnormally wide. with respect market asset-backed commercial paper, canada – like country – see problems. one specific segment canadian abcp market – market third-party, non-bank-sponsored, structure finance, asset-backed commercial paper – particular problems. this represent roughly one-third canada's $120 billion abcp market. at core difficulty guarantee liquidity behind securities, differ guarantee provide unite state europe. canadian third-party abcp tend include clause guarantee liquidity event "general market disruption." many, all, liquidity provider decline step paper come due, essentially say continue operation part commercial paper market indicate general market disruption. effort resolve problem market third-party abcp way. discussion investor bi review 100/2007 3 liquidity provider – international bank – continue montréal. and i remain hopeful that, time, see useful results. the balance canada's abcp compose conduit sponsor canada's major banks. these bank agree provide global-style liquidity support conduits. but immune global local problems. a result, banks' conduit roll short term high interest rate and, instances, bank take mature paper onto balance sheets. nevertheless, major bank appear well place deal current dislocations. in joint statement last month, institution say commitment support abcp market underpin strength financial positions, confidence underlie assets, ongoing commitment provide liquidity conduit upon maturity. further, data publish canada's superintendent financial institution show domestic bank sector well capitalized. at bank canada, welcome effort help re-establish well-functioning money market canada. and confident bank capacity continue support conduit necessary. institutional transparency i say early one lesson event august absolute importance transparency debt market function properly. but importance transparency limit money market debt instruments. in view, clear case transparency generally operation financial markets. in country fairly clear rule require transparency operation mutual funds, investor tell purchasing. hedge funds, nature, le transparent. but also, i believe, clear case increase transparency, least respect objectives, operate procedures, governance. the objective account standard also increase transparency. but difficult firm put precise value complex instrument report purposes. for many instruments, well-established market marked. and model instrument value simply – statistical model generate estimate value within often wide range. this mean important firm transparent method use estimate value range possible value around estimates. let say word importance transparency government-sponsored institutions, whether domestic international. i begin word sovereign wealth funds, control increasingly large amount money significant global financial forces. some funds, public pension fund canada, already adhere high standard transparency. but cases, often insufficient transparency operation funds. too often, objective behind fund clearly defined, lead misconception motives, particularly origin foreign exchange reserves. a case private pool capital, high standard transparency report governance, well objectives, would helpful public pool capital. finally, i would note need transparency apply international financial institutions. in vein, bank canada, along colleague bank england, work promote strengthen surveillance capacity governance practice international monetary fund (imf). a work continue improve surveillance, must also expand effort help make imf truly representative institution country around world, ensure emerging-market economy appropriate voice within institution. a well, must ensure fund govern transparent way, manage director staff accountable work do. 4 bi review 100/2007 canada's economic health before concluding, let say word canada's economic situation. canada enjoy roughly 15 year sustain economic growth, low stable inflation increasingly healthy public finances. our unemployment rate low 30 years, great proportion population work ever before. at least part credit continue economic performance go sound framework macroeconomic policy, include transparent monetary policy inflation target i mention earlier, well sound fiscal policy. over past five years, robust global demand – particularly energy primary product – key contributor solid economic growth canada significant improvement term trade. overall, canadian economy adjust well change relative prices, support flexible exchange rate regime. labour shift area sector le demand demand greater. for past three years, canadian economy operate near, above, production potential. strong economic growth lead rise income across country. the market skilled labour tight throughout canada, especially western provinces. in circumstances, upward pressure inflation. against backdrop rise income employment, surprise house sale price continue rise, despite canada's conservative mortgage-lending practices. what see look ahead? the bank's last full economic projection conduct monetary policy report update publish middle july. in document, project continue strong economic growth outside north america somewhat slow growth unite state next several quarters. in context, base-case projection canada average annual economic growth 2 1/2 per cent 2009, slightly estimate growth rate potential. this would allow economy return production potential 2009. inflation project return 2 per cent target early 2009. recent development suggest near-term economic prospect unite state weak early expected. it seem likely adjustment u.s. house sector pronounce protracted, exacerbate dislocation financial markets. this imply weak demand canadian export early expected. however, economic growth canada first half year turn strong projected. and fix announcement date last week, say canadian economy appear operate production potential estimate july. domestic demand remain robust, buoy continue strong labour market higher-than-expected increase house sale prices. but recent development financial market lead tighten credit condition canadian borrowers, temper growth domestic demand. against background, judge current level target overnight interest rate – 4 1/2 per cent – appropriate. however, significant upside downside risk outlook inflation. on upside, possibility household demand canada could strong anticipated, downside, ongoing adjustment u.s. house sector could severe spill u.s. economy broadly. in addition, uncertainty extent duration tighten credit condition canada and, hence, temper effect growth domestic demand. conclusion let conclude. dislocation financial market easy deal with, certainly welcome. but learn retain extremely valuable lesson bi review 100/2007 5 events, particularly term critical importance transparency, global financial market emerge event strong efficient before, benefit u all. 6 bi review 100/2007 jarle bergo: will strong growth bank industry continue? view balance risk speech mr jarle bergo, deputy governor norge bank (central bank norway), bank industry seminar primary capital certificates, oslo, 13 september 2007. the text may differ slightly actual presentation. the address base assessment present norge bank’s press conference follow executive board’s monetary policy meet 15 august, financial stability report 1/07 previous speeches. * * * thank invite seminar primary capital certificate give introductory speech development bank industry balance risks. a know, strong global focus financial institution financial market present, frequent use word "turbulence", "problem" "crisis". i spend time background development try ass possibility similar problem norway. i also point risk element industry bear mind. first, however, i give brief review economic situation norway affect bank industry. the norwegian economy financial sector the norwegian economy cyclical upturn. over past three years, mainland gdp grow approximately 4½ per cent annually, high rate growth continue 2007. in first half year, annualised growth close 6 per cent, even gdp growth third fourth quarter zero, annual growth well 4 per cent. a chart shows, four-year period strong growth see since 1971. the strong rate growth limit extent feed high rise price consumer good services. consumer price inflation adjust tax change exclude energy product (cpi-ate) admittedly pick gradually since late summer 2006, relation economic situation, underlie inflation remain low. after hover around 1-1½ per cent long period, year-on-year rise cpi-ate 1.8 per cent august. other measure underlie inflation show approximately rise prices. the year-on-year rise total consumer price index (cpi) ½ per cent recent months. this electricity price substantially low year last year. there number reason inflation low environment high economic growth. first: norway’s term trade improved. price export good oil gas, freight, fish, industrial commodity engineer product increase considerably. in addition, market growth abroad provide market opportunity norwegian export goods. at time, norwegian importer able shift demand new market central europe asia, lead fall price many import consumer goods. the term trade improve 40 per cent since 2002. this result vigorous rise norway's disposable income. even exclude oil, mark improvement. second: an ample supply labour boost output growth. in particular, supply foreign labour increase sharply eu enlargement 2004. over past two years, labour inflow account 30 per cent growth labour force norway. at time, enable norwegian company bold accept new assignment make investments, knowledge procure labour bi review 100/2007 1 throughout europe. high inward labour migration scope relocate portion production abroad lead increase competition labour market probably curb wage growth. third: the norwegian business sector quick adopt new technology reap benefits. in comparison countries, productivity gain service sector stand particular. on balance, factor contribute economy’s high capacity growth. but strong activity growth result high level capacity utilisation. shortage labour factor input reported. this may curb growth norwegian economy lead high wage cost inflation. inflation expect pick ahead. the upturn also benefit financial industry. strong economic expansion push already high level lend growth. a result, total asset norwegian bank mortgage company rise sharply past decade. growth lend household high since 2000, growth corporate lend show sharp rise towards end 2005. profitability financial industry norway high. what outlook ahead? will strong growth continue? the strong rate growth witness past year sustainable time. capacity utilisation high labour shortage many sectors. monetary policy must orient bring inflation target avoid overheat real economy. the scenario ahead, then, continue upward adjustment interest rate curb high rate economic growth. it likely credit growth gradually slow, may also pose challenge banks. i return later. risk financial stability norway in norge bank’s recent financial stability report, publish june, conclude overall outlook financial stability satisfactory. we nonetheless highlight number factor might constitute risk. in connection international risk factors, place emphasis uncertainty surround international economic condition concern low risk premia financial markets. i think fair say development bear u here. other risk factor relate vulnerability norwegian bank customers, low interest margin bank new capital adequacy rules. uncertainty surround development international economic condition financial market there recently considerable turbulence international financial markets. could substantial impact norwegian financial market could serious consequence growth employment norway? let u look reason turbulence spread. the source turbulence find u house market particularly subprime mortgage market. in addition, type loan frequently offer low rate interest small repayment first year loan term high interest rate later. mortgage structure involve gamble rise house prices. if house price rise, borrowers’ collateral increase value, allow mortgage refinance good terms. or borrower turn around sell dwell profit. this happen period, house price inflation slowed, partly result tight monetary policy. the fall house price towards end 2006 2007 result rise default mortgages, especially subprime segment. in 2007 2008, interest rate 2 bi review 100/2007 increase substantial portion recently grant subprime mortgages. this probably result rise default mortgages. house start also decline considerably. the sharp fall house investment reduce annual rate u economic growth ¾ percentage point average past year half. house market development u may result sluggish trend private consumption may amplify tendency slow growth us, may spread global economy. at moment, spillover effect seem moderate downward revision growth estimate modest. in us, half total mortgage debt securitised sell investment manager world. this one large fix income market world account volume term almost 10 per cent global security debt. subprime securitised issuance show sharp rise 2004 increase 2005. estimate subprime mortgage share total volume securitised mortgage u uncertain vary 12 18 per cent. in chart, share 12 per cent, usd 665 billion. one reason popularity securitised subprime mortgage development collateralize debt obligations, cdos, base portfolio mortgages. the rat agency actively involve develop products. mortgage often package way security secure senior tranche give aaa rating. this give subprime market access fund insurance company investment manager otherwise would invest market. high lend growth would probably develop without type financing. the security least secure tranche (equity tranche) demand investor seek high returns, hedge funds. it difficult price cdos. a rule, issuer calculate fair value use complicate mathematical models. because price difficulties, little trade security since issue. this result problem fund interest selling, force sell. in winter 2007, rise default subprime mortgage result sharp increase credit spread bond back type mortgages. the credit spread bond back subprime mortgage rise june wake problem two fund specialise investment kind bonds. credit premia also increase fix income instruments, conventional mortgage bonds, corporate bond loan emerge markets, summer 2007, although far moderate scale subprime-backed securities. in last half july, turbulence spread financial market segments. the risk premium require investor rose, equity price fell sharply. the contagion due uncertainty risk subprime-backed financial product represent financial system, lack information invest products. conduit structure investment vehicle (sivs) among investor group invest financial product base subprime mortgages. a rule, investment company wholly partially own banks. they invest asset high rating, senior tranche subprime-backed securities. these investment debt-financed, primarily short-term money market asset-backed commercial paper (abcp). high rat asset give investment company favourable fund rates. due turbulence subprime market, interest rate abcp rise sharply maturity reduced. the flow money investment company money market dry up. bank large extent finance investment company themselves. however, increase banks’ liquidity requirements. there example bank capacity finance investment companies. bi review 100/2007 3 due uncertainty financial institution expose subprime market, many operator become cautious extend loans, eventually also lead liquidity problem interbank market. on 9 august day ensuing, many central bank offer extra liquidity safeguard liquidity bank system. norge bank supply liquidity norwegian bank system ordinary market operation 9 august. in many countries, money market still dependent injection extra liquidity central bank. the bank system’s capacity willingness redistribute fund still moderate. this increase banks’ finance costs. the turbulence financial market also lead sharp rise price transfer credit risk, i.e. credit default swap (cds), bank companies. cd price u bank rise first time march begin rise end-june. development cd price european bank lag behind somewhat, last half july cd price rise sharply u european banks. this also affect norwegian bank enterprises, increase cd price dnb nor considerably low european bank average. kredittilsynet (financial supervisory authority norway) announce end august financial market turbulence seem little impact norwegian banks. kredittilsynet’s analysis show norwegian bank directly expose subprime market limit exposure hedge funds. norwegian bank indirect exposure regular connection foreign bank credit institution expose subprime mortgage hedge fund norwegian counterparts. however, general liquidity problem international money market might also affect norwegian bank lead high fund costs. to extent, fact happened. norwegian money market rate rise relative risk-free interest rate, le major economies. it uncertain sensitive risk premia event high demand funding. the price obtain dollar liquidity seem increased, also affect norwegian banks. since end june, yield curve norwegian money market become steep short end. two- three-month rate rise money market rate period. we know long turbulence last consequence real economy. so far, turbulence result substantial reassessment international outlook economic growth. the oecd revise growth estimate 2007 somewhat, particularly u european countries, imf indicate same. uncertainty regard 2008 probably greater, turbulence seem little impact emerge economy far, prospect strong growth continue world economy whole. the turbulence lead fall short-term interest rate expectations, particularly us. long-term interest rate also declined. interest rate expectation also fall somewhat norway. cover bond norwegian bank mortgage company also give right securitise mortgages. will lead development similar see us? the rule cover bond enter force 1 june 2007. these bond give bondholder preferential claim relation specify selection mortgage company’s assets. dnb nor, terra-gruppen sparebank 1 group establish cover bond company purpose. so far mortgage transfer bank type mortgage institution high level security. because high level security, new type bond expect somewhat low yield traditional 4 bi review 100/2007 bank bonds, likely reduce banks’ total fund costs. dnb nor boligkreditt terra boligkreditt issue cover bonds. in addition low finance costs, reason bank establish mortgage credit institution asset mortgage credit institution easily convert liquidity issue cover bonds. norwegian cover bond different u cdos back subprime mortgages. the regulation ensure norwegian cover bond transparent substantially secure investment alternative. the cover pool mortgage credit institution consist mortgage maximum loan value ratio 75 per cent. the loan value ratio cover pool norwegian mortgage credit institution far issue cover bond well this. all holder cover bond right mortgage credit institution’s cover pool. in words, tranching case cdos back subprime mortgages. investor also overview risk parameter mortgage part cover pool. this mean norwegian cover bond far transparent respect asset bondholders’ cover cdos back u subprime mortgages. another difference subprime mortgage u norwegian mortgage regulation relate provision credit strict norway. subprime mortgage u sell agent mortgage broke subject federal supervision. in number cases, mortgage extend person income. before norwegian bank extend loan, ass customer’s debt-servicing capacity. norwegian bank also require advise customer take mortgage feel customer find difficult service loan. risk factor relate domestic condition event take place abroad actually liquidity crisis root uncertainty valuation asset distribution loss among institution crisis due size loss themselves. the credit risk senior tranche subprime cdos probably manageable. but forget credit risk traditional sense ass risk elements. loan norwegian household enterprise account approximately 70 per cent banks’ balance sheets. risk factor relate customer group therefore important financial stability norway. household strong household debt growth sharp rise house price constitute risk factor regard financial stability norway. household debt growth high since 2000, primarily drive low interest rate sharp rise house price income. loan secure dwell show high increase growth. strong competition bank push lend margins. the new capital adequacy rule (basel ii), involve substantial reduction risk weight mortgages, may also contribute rise mortgage growth decline lend margins. real house prices, deflate consumer prices, build cost house rents, historically high. deflate disposable income, however, house price rise moderately past ten years. in recent months, sign slacken house market. the rise house price slowed. resale home turnover still high, take long sell dwell compare time last year. bi review 100/2007 5 financial market innovation also contribute strong lend growth. in recent year loan product introduce facilitate mortgage equity withdrawal – credit line secure dwellings. these loan normally extend borrower good collateral debt-servicing capacity. they therefore present little risk financial stability context. credit line secure dwell rapidly increase volume account 12 per cent mortgage bank mortgage credit institutions. foreign-owned bank among first offer credit line secure dwell far high share mortgage classify kind loan. other aspect household behaviour house market increase vulnerability give great cause concern. first, number interest-only mortgage risen. the possibility interest-only period buff household debt-servicing problems. for many households, buff already used. kredittilsynet’s 2006 mortgage survey, include loan secure dwell exclude credit lines, show around one six mortgage survey include introductory interest-only period. this share somewhat high 2005. another aspect increase vulnerability number borrower high loan value ratio, particularly age 35. household debt growth high income growth since 1999. the debt burden, define debt relation disposable income, therefore increase markedly. households’ financial position nonetheless sound. a measure here, house wealth norway almost four time high total household debt. debt wealth are, however, unevenly distributed. combine mark turnaround house market, would create problem expose groups. however, financial situation household whole satisfactory. unemployment unusually low, must expect increase somewhat medium term. household disposable income expect show continue high growth ahead. due long period strong debt growth sharply rise house prices, however, households’ financial position become vulnerable. corporate sector corporate profit high recent years. these positive development broadly base mainly drive favourable economic condition norway abroad. enterprise average large financial buffers. banks’ lend property industry account approximately one third lend corporate sector. this sizeable exposure one industry possible risk factor relation financial stability norway. both property enterprise tenant generally healthy financial position. price commercial property market rise considerably past two years, market participant expect sharp rise continue. low demand norwegian economy may result slow rise market expects. combine high interest rates, may reduce profitability commercial property market, increase banks’ losses. loss loan property industry account large share banks’ loan loss bank crisis. outlook bank industry bank norway experience extremely favourable development past years: strong lend growth, minimal loan losses, high return security market firm cost control. despite low interest margins, banks’ net interest income nok rise result strong lend growth. measure relation total assets, however, net interest income 6 bi review 100/2007 falling. in recent years, offset reduction costs. today’s high debt growth sustainable time, unlikely pressure interest margin abate. give developments, bank must reduce cost increase income source maintain current profitability. to illustrate effect low lend growth banks’ income, carry simple calculation interest margin hold constant. if lend growth among bank 3 per cent 2006, banks’ net interest income pre-tax result would approximately 6 per cent low year. the composition banks’ income fairly stable past ten years, even though net interest income become le important since 2002. one reason development net price gain security increase period. bear mind favourable period security markets, difficult maintain income share price gain period normal return security markets. with slow rise house commercial property price low lend growth, combine normalisation loan losses, bank may find difficult maintain high level profitability witness recent years. the new capital adequacy rule strong impact norwegian bank continue year ahead. how bank choose utilise capital free result reduce minimum capital requirements, may impact competition structure norwegian bank sector. freed-up capital may use finance lend growth, acquire institution pay back capital shareholder stakeholders. on average, norwegian banks’ capital adequacy solid. however, substantial reduction minimum capital requirements, even though transitional arrangements, also entail risk bank reduce capital extent buff need meet unforeseen event may become small advisable. banks’ profitability may also depend duration severity liquidity problem international financial markets. although norwegian bank probably somewhat le expose bank many countries, impact may nonetheless felt. it must also expect strong focus liquidity risk financial institution supervisory authorities, least work international regulation period ahead. thank attention. bi review 100/2007 7

little possible say cryptically".1 this type communication strategy probably quite unthinkable central bank today. but u professor economics alan blind describe central bank communication long ago. and i believe description pretty good one thing actually worked, say 15 20 year ago. i would also guess even either monitor work financial sector time would agree me. but since begin 1990s riksbank well central bank take considerable step towards great openness clarity – regard try achieve go it. constantly work towards efficient communication high riksbank’s priority list ever since inflation target introduced. but pace work vary condition monetary policy demand central bank changed. so sometimes fairly long period without major change method communication, sometimes make many change fairly short period time. particularly past two year make number change lead debate. this often happen time change, particularly require learn process – involve – everything fall place. and also case change riksbank’s communication. it therefore quite natural question arisen: why riksbank make changes? haven’t make thing unnecessarily complicate – try “fix something isn’t broken”? have even go far openness? these important question i shall try answer tonight. give right information right time right way particularly important time unease. there recently unrest financial market around world. sweden affect market turbulence extent several countries. i would nevertheless like take opportunity say word view happen right riksbank's role context. but i so, i would first like discus change method communication make past two year reason behind them. what reason behind increase openness clarity? many consider riksbank currently one world’s open central banks.2 and take step direction past two year particular. but reason behind development towards great openness? i think two reason – democracy efficiency. the first concern role independent authority. the second link fact communication financial market general public essential monetary policy financial system function efficiently. 1 page 38 blinder, a. s., (2006), “monetary policy today: sixteen question about twelve answers”. i fernandez de lis, s. f. restoy (ed.), central bank 21st century, banco de españa. 2 see, instance, eijffinger, s. p. geerats, (2006), “how transparent central banks?” european journal political economy, vol. 22, 1-21. bi review 106/2007 1 our independence require openness the riksdag ultimately therefore swedish people give riksbank considerable independence. but “freedom responsibility” go hand hand requirement insight accountability. this thing democracy. openness also something traditionally imbue swedish public administration system general. one corner-stones principle public access, mean authorities’ activity far possible carry open way. and also apply riksbank, course. but openness requirement also necessary condition monetary policy work. it work unless riksbank objective activity support legitimate people. and require open clear. it easy critically examine monetary policy conduct well live principles. most people probably agree riksbank’s openness contribute good monetary policy debate recent years. openness clarity contribute monetary policy function good but democratic reason lead riksbank central bank become open clear. another important reason quite simply regard mean easily achieve objective make monetary policy efficient. there three main aspect i would like emphasise context: • firstly, easy communicate interest rate decision make really aim achieve low stable inflation. this provide great credibility help anchor expectation around target. it important reason riksbank begin publish inflation forecast material decision base early new inflation-targeting system. i believe would possible build confidence price stability target quickly open regard work decisions. • secondly, openness clarity currently important part monetary policy itself. you could say one tool toolbox. so i mean this? there relationship interest rate different durations. and expectation short-term interest rates, central bank governs, important long-term interest rates. a central bank therefore ”indirectly” influence interest rate long duration influence expectation short-term interest rates. great influence interest-setting throughout economy – yield curve – make impact monetary policy effective. this often call conduct monetary policy aid “management expectations”. and best way provide good information. • the third final aspect increase openness clarity “outwards” contribute work efficiently within riksbank. this quite important argument. the open are, easy others evaluate well monetary policy functions. this give u extra incentive good job. what process towards openness clarity result in? the path towards become open clear always easy, time cause debate. two issue particular subject lively discussion past year. the first publish forecast interest rate path. the second concern representative riksbank send signal regard interest rate speech press releases. 2 bi review 106/2007 interest rate path natural step towards openness in february 2007 present first time forecast development repo rate. prior central bank norway new zealand publish interest rate paths. but group grown, addition riksbank march year also icelandic central bank. at begin month also decide publish forecast path policy rate – number important variable – connection monetary policy meeting. this mean publish interest rate forecast six time year, instead three before. by publish forecast interest rate become open clear regard view future monetary policy. along way use three different assumption policy rate – remain unchanged, develop accord market expectations, and, accordingly, develop way find likely. reason want present interest rate path make forecast policy rate provide central bank good tool influence expectation among households, company agent financial markets. in case view differ market view, long need take rather circumstantial route via qualitative assessment market pricing. additionally, become easy u show think also think – simple communicate view drive force behind economic development monetary policy achieve. if succeed communicate view think, easy others make good assessment continuous basis new information affect future development interest rate. this reduce fluctuation interest rate due speculation regard riksbank’s intentions. one aspect may give much attention become simple household plan private economy form impression executive board consider suitable development interest rate future. previously, many probably refer interpretation make financial advisers. but information available monetary policy report. although forecast interest rate course regularly revised, reduce uncertainty view future developments. i believe positive everyone. the objection convince but course also potential problem central bank present forecast interest rate path. one decision many central bank currently make group persons. how group decision-makers agree forecast policy rate? the riksbank’s experience far show need problem. nor norwegian central bank, decision make executive board consist seven persons, appear major difficulty agree interest rate forecast. other argument also raise interest rate path. one argument could impair credibility instead make difficult u communicate general public financial markets. let u assume riksbank first publish particular interest rate path. would credibility impair new information lead make another decision regard policy rate previously announced? i don’t think so. i believe broad understand among households, company market agent need adapt monetary policy reconsider set bi review 106/2007 3 repo rate future new information change economic picture. we clear fact forecast definition uncertain become ahead stretches. and interest rate path present monetary policy report indeed forecast. it promise! the fact perfect knowledge future reason refrain open clear possible regard believe happen. we must form opinion policy rate develop future regardless whether publish not. if turn make incorrect assessment forecast, would le incorrect refrain tell anyone it. it hardly reasonable try gain great credibility hide thing send unclear signal one important variable analysis. i believe good open decision base on, inflation target well-established able open. another objection central bank publish interest rate forecast connect function market. this mean principle financial market agent could stop look information access central bank’s forecast interest rate slightly long term. how market view economic prospect normally reflect long-term market rates. this source information could thus lose would impair function market. but i perceive it, sign far. in addition, i find difficult imagine market agent would stop make independent assessment publish view interest rate developments. they anyone know interest rate path forecast therefore strong reason continue search information via channel riksbank. so far clear market agent actually slightly different view regard interest rate develop future. and actually sign thing be. it quite natural forecaster make different judgements, particularly slightly long term. in long term, also factor expect monetary policy significance interest rates. we far present two forecast policy rate, i mention earlier, fairly large measure ”learning doing” involve everything fall place. everything always work perfectly start. but i said, purpose communication become clear efficient. and i fairly convince get there, new system established. clarity way express speech press release the riksbank also change method signal monetary policy speech press releases. in broad sense, signal mean communicate way intend repo rate. a narrow – perhaps common – interpretation signal representative riksbank describe speech press release consider interest rate set next meeting, perhaps slightly ahead. previously, riksbank signal ”by degrees”. between monetary policy meet individual executive board member hold speech theme "the current situation” something similar. there indicated, le explicitly, think interest rate set. when time monetary policy meeting, sufficient information assume release “by degrees” regard executive board whole reason economic agent would surprise interest rate decision take meeting. but broad definition signal – way communicate intend repo rate – publication repo rate forecast 4 bi review 106/2007 course also become part signalling. at interval two months, general public financial market receive detail description majority executive board consider interest rate set future. it thus evident need “signalling degrees” speech monetary policy meet decline significantly. it also important reason early year decide would normally reason indicate speech press release repo rate would set next meeting. but also problem early signal lay behind decision. in certain situation probably difficult determine whether signal send speech interpret individual member’s opinion whether reflect view majority executive board. if individual member send different signal probably also difficult distinguish clear message "cacophony voices", quote professor blind again. this type problem seem rather unnecessary. a central bank able clear regard view future need loosely-grounded speculation interpretation – necessary kremlinologist interpret riksbank. we hope solve problem new way working. a weakness early signal process concern responsibility riksbank role independent authority. it question democracy. this responsibility includes, instance, fact general public must good insight decision-making process – decision monetary policy meet must make correct manner. this minute take monetary policy meet published, chairman deputy chairman general council riksbank right attend executive board meeting. there must doubt interest rate decision actually make monetary policy meet point time – informal way prevent insight. if signal prior meet lead people believe interest rate decision make advance meetings, doubt may arise. a conclude reflection riksbank’s communication let me, i go discus recent development financial markets, conclude discussion riksbank’s communication reflection. the fundamental purpose change make communication shall become even open clear regard think. but time change – particularly interest rate path – mean stick neck open criticism different way before. we long describe policy form simple – albeit perhaps slightly mislead – policy rule, show composite picture; way look u make decisions. the publication interest rate path also mean become clear reconsider view policy appropriate future view differ market. it therefore perhaps surprise debate arisen. but refrain make change consider necessary run risk criticise good strategy. i convince best method conduct monetary policy long term describe openly honestly possible act reasoning. this definitely something general public require u role independent authority. so, refer back question i ask beginning. no, i think make thing unnecessarily complicate try fix thing broken. we make change consider necessary improve base make monetary policy bi review 106/2007 5 decision provide true honest picture monetary policy conduct possible. what happen financial markets? in principle, communication always important central bank corner-stone part activities. when world around u mark uncertainty unrest, question communication become even important. there recently considerable unrest financial markets. but riksbank nevertheless see need specifically go public comment developments. sweden affect extent many country swedish interbank market financial system function comparatively well. but let nevertheless say word happen role riksbank play context. general uncertainty increase need liquidity abroad… over summer saw sign problem u house market. the unrest increase reveal begin august several financial institution make significant loss connection u sub-prime market. the background number household experience difficulty pay mortgage gradually increased. it also difficult ass extent different market agent expose asset concern – balance sheet credit risk end up. this start point general reassessment risk financial markets. to make long story short, one say general uncertainty lead increase demand safe asset treasuries. government bond rate fallen, rate investment push up. this probably risk premium increased, low long period time. for instance, interest rate loan deposit banks, interbank rates, rise many countries. for instance, european central bank (ecb) federal reserve see need supply extra liquidity slow rise interbank rates. in unite kingdom, bank england choose use position lender last resort grant emergency liquidity assistance mortgage institution, northern rock. emergency liquidity assistance give institution question assess solvent lack sufficient liquid funds. …and home sweden also affect turbulence financial markets, albeit much less extent than, instance, unite kingdom, germany unite states. the fact sweden affect despite being, were, involve problem start unrest remarkable. we part global financial system isolate northern outpost. the riksbank govern short-term rate apply one day, so-called overnight rate, remain stable around repo rate. in brief, riksbank’s method steer interest rate work well. but interbank rate slightly long duration risen, although much part world. this primarily question different effect uncertainty financial markets, rise risk premiums. on whole, swedish financial system interbank market nevertheless function well. 6 bi review 106/2007 what role riksbank? what riksbank unrest money market? one important task continue ensure economy develop stable manner. we conduct monetary policy attain inflation target 2 per cent. where possible, price stability objective allow scope this, also ensure production employment develop balance manner. this involve closely monitor development follow forecast growth inflation develop. at recent monetary policy meet make assessment financial unrest could slow growth inflation somewhat future uncertainty increased. at time, economic growth strong sweden abroad. to attain inflation target 2 per cent ensure good development economy future, decide raise repo rate. we also make assessment interest rate would need increase around way outline june. but continue development financial market one factor among many take consideration decisions. if monetary policy function, interest rate-setting must also function. a i mentioned, steer short interest rate market. we set repo rate daily adjust liquidity bank system interest rate close repo rate. the bank also receive much liquidity need day collateral. in addition, also deposit borrow collateral overnight riksbank deposit lend rate respectively. if see serious last problems, possibility take action. how act depend happen situation time. and take action, clearly describe why. the riksbank close contact swedish bank financial market agents. although see indication extensive liquidity problem present, continue, always, closely follow development financial markets. this responsibility financial stability also come in. we ensure payment system function safe efficient manner. part work involve regularly analyse development financial market financial system’s capacity withstand shock might arise. we present analysis regularly; recently may year. we also involve shape regulatory framework ensure design achieve stable system. in work regard financial stability work close cooperation swedish international authorities. if situation go far serious liquidity problem nevertheless arose, detail plan deal them. if bad come worst, possibility grant emergency liquidity assistance financial institution supervision finansinspektionen (the swedish financial supervisory authority). but institution question solvent. loan grant interest rate high lend rate steer interest rate system see swedish financial system threatened. swedish bank must take possibility grant thus take unnecessary risks. here link ambition open clear. an open attitude set limit show game rules. we clearly describe view role “lender last resort”, instance, financial stability report.3 by open manage emergency liquidity assistance reduce risk situation may unnecessarily arise 3 financial stability report 2003:2 bi review 106/2007 7 force provide assistance. it also reduce risk force provide support appropriate. give right information right time right way important. it particularly important time uncertainty increasing. i hope i manage communicate today principle guide u regard external communication recent years, also picture recent situation. i also hope i succeed communicate ambition clearly report why. thank you! 8 bi review 106/2007 ardian fullani: issue relate bank albania’s activity speech mr ardian fullani, governor bank albania, regional meeting, saranda, 24 september 2007. * * * honourable participants, it special pleasure come back wonderful city. today’s meet hold framework new communication strategy bank albania various group interest. meet different region albania help u good understand specific characterise certain geographic areas, raise premise ever harmonic complete development country’s level. i would like elaborate issue relate bank albania’s activity, i think, viewpoint coverage effects, involve group interest participate meeting. first i would like deal briefly issue communication. nowadays widely accept chance long-term success become reality one capable communicate proper language, proper actor due time. more concretely, central bank constantly communicate simply transparently market stakeholders, include broad public, order efficient forward-looking. this necessary premise guarantee institutional credibility, real independence sound accountability. for long time bank albania start think forward-looking way process i may actually declare already start obtain first fruits. accord different estimates, deem market efficiency increasing, inflation expectation anchor around target, awareness financial stability constantly increasing. notwithstanding above, claim term information clarification bank albania’s decision-making greater. proper language translation understand strategic operational decision (monetary policy decisions) strategic target. our ambition regard great i would invite stakeholder general bank system particular make effort cooperation. the bank albania confident financial market albania already create complete physiognomy. the participation many foreign institution international reputation testimony regard. recently efficiency enhanced, reflect both, trade volume reduce interest rate volatility. however, bank albania notice market develop good faster. presently, i opinion objective reason would weaken financial market efficiency consequence transmission monetary policy economy. the bank system get possibility interpret correctly signal bank albania, due time intensity. also, bank system seriously prepare respective structures, also professional human resources. this standard requirement, postulate modern times, commit maximum. i would let know bank albania already prepare soon enough launch specific package, centre efficiency financial market, particularly bank one. a new law repurchase agreements, regulatory change require reserve bi review 106/2007 1 maintain calculation, rarefaction treasury bill auction viewpoint time, presentation base rate part package. all measure implement sole package revolutionize inter-bank market operation, vital link financial market monetary policy transmission economy. on hand, would make operational tactic bank albania efficient. i invite bank system become part process, actively participate consultation case precede launch package. it suggestion comment welcome moment. monetary policy decision-making bank albania second issue i would like deal with. i would like repeat consumer price stability primary target institution i govern. recently, i believe occasion comprehend statement bank albania supervisory council risk inflationary environment present. also, enlist statement probable factors, accord consideration make concern real inflationary pressure economy. the data disclose instat show annual inflation august 2007 record 4.2 percent, somewhat upper limit target band 2-4 percent. august record high monthly rate, 2.1 percent, wholly unusual figure compare precede years. i confident understandable evidence analysis cause relate unforeseeable factor (unforeseeable shocks) reason demand economy good services. it underline current year factor first nature numerous relate development within country “imported” development international economy. to concise, i would briefly highlight: 1. the energy crisis, year appear early usual accord different assessments, continue beyond business may envisage plan begin calendar year. naturally, effect lack energy complex; affect directly productive capacities, create additional cost (alternative source energy) final products, increase overall uncertainty. i think element sufficient create ambiguity markets, generate inflationary premise economy. 2. during year face another problem. it international conjuncture raise prices, exert impact market good services. fuel cereal vulnerable conjuncture. the need economy two article increasing, domestic resource limited, make albania dependant imports, consequence international market prices. 3. in general, economy demand estimate high end 2006 major part 2007. this fact evidence large credit growth economy, enlargement current account, increase import good vehicles, household electrical appliances, machinery equipment. generally, increase demand certain period time mean inflationary pressure economy; therefore reason seriously concern problem. 4. nowadays, public expectation future inflationary development focus effort central bank ensure long-term price stability. more concretely, perception every economic agent create future inflation. in cases, expectation mostly base also fact verify past. but, successful central bank, succeed anchor public expectation numeric target consider 2 bi review 106/2007 optimal rate inflation. therefore, much focus direction, i would like emphasise meet bank albania’s attitude, remain determine effort keep inflationary expectation anchor around 3 percent, figure constitute also numeric target. to end, continue orient political operational decision-making towards meet target”. a final issue i would like consider another major objective bank albania, one relate financial stability. a may already know bank albania license supervisory authority bank system segment financial system (non-banking financial institution foreign exchange bureaus). be simultaneously even important decision-making authority area financial economic policies, understandable delicate challenge remain harmonisation major priorities: effective monetary policy without damage financial stability financial stability without damage monetary policy effectiveness. currently trendy issue. many experts, decision-makers, academic lay great emphasis problem rank financial stability principal, shake take upon entire infrastructure arose, nourish grown. therefore, i consider important come back back issue. due distant history, i think prudence term financial stability never excessive. i would like assure albanian bank system sound financial position, capitalise profitable. consolidation bank system merger acquisitions, aim attract internationally well-known investor non-contestable experience bank business prevail philosophy regard. i believe successful direction. recently new entry system, highlight internationally well-known banks, intesa-san paolo, credit agricol banka societe generale. a conclusion, may state present albanian bank system composition appropriate, guarantee perspective support economy. the entry new bank directly impact raise value bank business albania, reflected, inter alia, increase competition among bank aggressiveness bank system towards market share. the bank albania deem reflection phenomenon also rapid growth credit economy. more concretely, credit outstanding grow 8 percentage point gdp three last years. in july `07 annual growth 50 percent, make u believe may account 28 % gross domestic product year end. the bank albania, pronouncements, argue phenomenon natural process associate bank business every country. also albania, country region, rapid convergence process certain parameter european union. to end, completely aware fact growth rate continue high. leave aside probable effect aggregate demand economy, i think condition rapid growth, real challenge stand credit portfolio quality. the bank albania remain determine observance whole regulatory supervisory package, aim guarantee safe credit portfolio. we agree concept crystallise recently, make u understand certain bank run market share detriment professional rigorous treatment application loan. under condition many objective obstacle exist, deem maximum prudence show extend loans. let remind fact still inherit deficiency term ownership titles, collateral execution, address identification, property register credit register. non-recognition non-acceptance bi review 106/2007 3 deficiency increase likelihood objectively subjectively, decision-making extend loan may wrong. i feel well i see certain considerable cases, decision-making take place within short period time, sufficient enough verify case associate credit practice. i avail opportunity require bank system observe rigorously bank supervision risk management regulations. give current structure credit stock economy, i consider important advise bank seriously ass exposure foreign exchange risk prudent management. finally, i would draw bank system attention also another problem, i raise time ago. i observe great prudence term governance internal audit, problem term transparency, window services, commission policy recent innovation electronic transactions. our support lack direction. you may consider bank albania possibility permanent consultation assistance. i would assure totally concentrate will support assist bank institution aspire bring innovation, western practice standard albania. in conclusion, let say word city gather today, potential support bank system provide it. today saranda one culminant place may best show-case possibility quality albanian tourism, important sector presently contribute 9 % country’s gross domestic product. currently figure 1 million tourist year become reality perspective go even beyond, continue pay necessary economic, social institutional attention tourism. beyond impressive figures, tourism development translate also constant improvement albania’s image country progress, value posse provides, increase level employment revenue many area stratum population, provision value many environmental, historical cultural, geographic curative, economic social potentials, etc. notwithstanding optimistic situation, forget albania mediterranean country, find one develop tourism area world, one area large variety type tourism, therefore one area competition tourism service peak, many country region, long tradition sector, turn real tourism industry. our objective improve rapidly solve qualitatively problem road infrastructure, water electricity supply , sewerages, etc., attach improve quality service implementation standards, completion regulatory urban plan tourism areas, variety type tourism tourism products. besides coastline tourism, dominant, mountainous rural tourism, cultural historical tourism, archaeological nature tourism, curative sport tourism, massive elite tourism also developed. all go make sector activity directly indirectly relate tourism absorb investment loans, make banks, domestic foreign businesses, private institutional investors, etc., interest guarantee success. you convince bank business observe attentively, expect signal, sparkle mostly hand. the standard indispensable respected. therefore, i would invite local government, business community, individual saranda orient towards future, towards tourism urban development models, similar advance countries. let conclude thank hospitality. 4 bi review 106/2007 ric battellino: some observation financial trend address mr ric battellino, deputy governor reserve bank australia, finsia-melbourne centre financial studies, 12th bank finance conference, melbourne, 25 september 2007. * * * the topic i would like talk today credit provide intermediaries, broadly mirror image, debt household business sectors. in many country – include english-speaking one – credit rise strongly relative gdp many year now. this ongoing topic discussion among world’s central bank financial commentators, people try understand whether trend sustainable, mean performance economy mean financial stability. i would like touch issue today, particularly relate australia. some fact let start facts. this first graph show two statistic range develop economies: - orange bar annual average growth credit past 30 years; - purple bar annual average growth nominal gdp period. in 15 country shown, credit grow substantially fast gdp past 30 years. bi review 106/2007 1 graph 1 the gap growth credit gdp particularly large country ireland, spain, australia, unite kingdom, new zealand netherlands. across six countries, credit grow average 5 percentage point year fast nominal gdp period cover graph. it matter arithmetic credit grow fast gdp, ratio credit outstanding gdp rise. across 15 country show graph 1, (unweighted) average ratio credit gdp rise 60 per cent 1977 around 135 per cent today (graph 2). 2 bi review 106/2007 graph 2 the extent upward trend ratio, persistence extend period, unusual historical perspective, unprecedented. for australia, data credit go back 150 year certainly case domestic precedent happen past 30 year (graph 3).1 the close previous experience 1880s 1920s. in former case, credit start expand much quickly gdp early 1880s, trend last le 15 years, reverse sharply. the surge credit second half 1920s le pronounce shorter; reverse five years. 1 before 1953, series show graph relate credit provide banks; include credit provide intermediaries. bi review 106/2007 3 graph 3 one clue recent episode credit expansion last long drive important extent household borrow rather business borrowing. we estimate household business credit, vary quality, go back 1920s. before that, possible get guide split borrow business household look institution lending. for example, credit extend trade bank traditionally mainly go businesses, extend save bank mainly go households. the next couple graph decompose series total credit show graph 3 business household components. in case business credit, graph 4 show ratio business credit gdp exhibit big cyclical secular swings, take place around flat trend 150 year show graph. period financial sector relatively unregulated, 1880s past couple decades, result ratio business credit gdp elevated. the subdue credit growth 1950s 1960s, period financial sector heavily regulated, also noticeable. 4 bi review 106/2007 graph 4 i don’t think outcome surprising. in long run, however, various economic relationship work tend tie relationship business credit gdp. specifically, business profit cannot consistently rise fast slow gdp, long run p/e ratio also cycle around flat trend. the combination two fact mean growth value business equity must also tie gdp growth long run. in turn, work tie relationship business debt gdp, gear company (i.e. ratio debt equity) cannot consistently rise fall. let turn household credit, show graph 5. here picture different. up 1970s, households’ access credit limited. those u 50 year age remember when, order qualify house loan, people first establish long consistent record save bank, even tight limit much bank would lend. many borrower resort “cocktail” loans, high cost, meet needs. bi review 106/2007 5 graph 5 over past 30 years, however, deregulation financial innovation greatly increase household sector’s access credit. this particularly past 10-15 year many bank focus lend household sector credit loss business loan early 1990s, financial innovation allow non-bank lender enter market retail finance. the securitisation loans, development numerous new loan product emergence mortgage broke particularly important. economic circumstance also play important role, business credit. the decline inflation result fall interest rate reduce cost debt, strong ongoing performance economy make household comfortable take debt. these factor contribute growth household credit examine detail couple paper present colleague reserve bank’s annual economic conference last month.2 in short, deregulation, innovation low inflation simultaneously increase supply, reduce cost, finance households, surprisingly household respond increase use it. household credit outstanding rise 20 per cent gdp 1970s 30 per cent 1990, around 100 per cent today. household credit account bulk – 85 per cent – rise overall credit gdp past 15 years, household credit greatly exceed business credit term outstandings. while rise household credit go finance consumption, use acquire assets. if take past 10 years, example, household borrow total additional $770 billion period. of this, 90 per cent use directly buy assets, main component $420 billion house live in, $240 billion house rent $40 billion shares. 2 see kent, c., c. ossolinski l. willard (2007), “household indebtedness – sustainability risk”, reserve bank australia conference paper, 20-21 august 2007; ryan, c. c. thompson (2007), “risk transformation australian financial system”, reserve bank australia conference paper, 20-21 august 2007. available http://www.rba.gov.au/publicationsandresearch/conferences/2007/index.html. 6 bi review 106/2007 the primary effect borrow therefore asset values, noticeable double house prices. while also spill-over consumer spending, expansion household credit large story asset markets. similar development experience many develop economy past decade. look ahead ha expansion household credit run course? will reverse? we cannot know answer question certainty, guess democratisation finance underpin rise household debt probably yet run course. in past, lack access credit result australian household sector finance conservative. even recently 1960s, overall gear household sector (taking account household debt household assets) 5 per cent – is, household own 95 per cent assets, include houses, outright. this mean household sector significant untapped capacity service debt large unencumbered hold asset use collateral borrowings. financial institution recognise find way allow household utilise capacity. the increase debt recent year lift ratio household debt asset 17½ per cent (graph 6)3. i don’t think anybody know sustainable level gear household sector aggregate, give still large section household sector debt, likely high current levels. graph 6 cross-sectional data show rise household debt drive primarily middle-aged, higher-income, households. thus, build household debt 3 measure basis corporate gear (i.e. ratio debt equity, rather debt assets) household gear marginally higher, 21 per cent. bi review 106/2007 7 often portray drive young couple try buy first home, accurate description mainly drive older, higher-income household trade high quality good locate houses, buy investment property take margin loan buy shares. these sign rise affluence, drive prolong economic expansion. over 80 per cent household top half income distribution type debt, compare 30 per cent low decile (graph 7). essentially, higher-income household one capacity financial security take debt. it seem debt one products, like education health, high income elasticity demand – i.e. income rises, demand rise proportionately. it would mistake, therefore, conclude rise ratio debt income necessarily sign financial stress among households. graph 7 it high-income group big increase debt recent year (graph 8 ). about three quarter increase owner-occupier debt decade 2005/06, example, attributable household top half income distribution. if comparable figure debt associate investment property margin loan available, would almost certainly skew distribution debt. 8 bi review 106/2007 graph 8 despite rise debt group households, debt service burden remain relatively low. for household top half income distribution owner-occupied house loan, house loan repayment currently average little le 20 per cent gross income. this rise marginally past decade, remain significantly low figure around 30 per cent household bottom half income distribution. this suggest former group still substantial capacity service debt. at aggregate level across household owner-occupier house debt, median ratio house loan repayment gross income, 21 per cent, marginally high decade ago (graph 9). graph 9 bi review 106/2007 9 another interest feature emerge composition debt break age group. this show large contribution increase household indebtedness come household age 45-65. this group doubt overlap considerably high-income household group. over 10 year 2006, proportion household age 45-64 carry owner-occupier debt increase noticeably, 25 per cent 38 per cent (graph 10). this encourage increase life expectancy, financial security come strong economy low unemployment build substantial hold asset superannuation. graph 10 the trend household increasingly carry debt old age may yet come end. at present, great bulk household still pay debt age 65, factor encourage allow 45 64-year old increase debt past 10 year may due course change behaviour age scale. recent financial innovations, so-called “reverse mortgages”, allow old people access equity house order fund retirement, could one vehicle encourage high debt among old households. the pool house equity own old household large draw even small proportion group could add substantially household debt levels. some implication let end draw implications. the first may yet see end rise household debt. the rise date overwhelmingly drive household great capacity service – middle-aged, high-income group. it surprising, therefore, rise debt exhaust neither collateral debt service capacity group, household sector overall. the factor facilitate rise debt past couple decade – stability economic condition continue flow innovation come competitive dynamic financial system – remain place. while ever case, household likely continue take advantage unused capacity increase debt. this say won’t cycle credit grow slowly time, even falls, cycle likely take place around rise trend. eventually, household debt 10 bi review 106/2007 reach point form equilibrium relative gdp income, evidence suggest point high current levels. it interest consider factor might change behaviour households. one factor demographics. it could age baby-boom generation arrest upward trend household debt due effect group run asset liability move old age. but whether demographic effect sufficient offset effect demographic shifts, increase longevity population general, clear. a second factor monetary policy. central bank could stop rise trend household debt raise interest rate level exhaust households’ debt service capacity. but central bank around world generally conclude level interest rate necessary high need achieve monetary policy objective relation inflation economic growth, policy option followed. the final point i would like talk implication rise household debt financial stability. there two perspective here. the first point view lenders. ha rise household debt leave lender expose excessive risk? any number indicator – arrears rate loans, exposure concentrations, capital ratio profitability – suggest answer “no”. this also conclusion reach financial sector assessment program conduct auspex imf last year. a explain september 2006 issue bank’s financial stability review, even extreme assumption make stress test, bank remain profitable. the second perspective point view household finances. a outline financial stability review publish yesterday, overall household sector finance remain good shape: average real income rising, even interest payments; financial net worth increase noticeably; gear level line international standards; proportion household experience financial difficulties, though high couple year ago, remain historically low. there pocket stress, low number involve – le 20,000 5,300,000 house loan australia 90 day overdue repayment – mean macroeconomic problem, even though doubt cause distress among household community directly affected. at macro level, two issue arise development household finance past decade two. the first rise household debt make household sector sensitive change interest rates. this mean central bank able achieve monetary policy objective small interest rate adjustments. second, household sector run highly mismatch balance sheet, asset consist mainly property equities, liability comprise debt. this balance sheet structure effective generate wealth good economic times, household need recognise leaf expose economic financial shock cause asset value fall and/or interest rate rise. bi review 106/2007 11 jean-claude trichet: the process european economic integration speech mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, fondation jean monnet pour l’europe 2007, lausanne, 21 september 2007. * * * 1. introduction1 it great pleasure invite speaker dialogue européen de la fondation jean monnet pour l’europe. let start say today confront excite challenge unique historical developments. the enlargement european union, currently include 27 country 494 million people romania bulgaria recently joining, exceptional endeavour. more historical development observe euro area, comprise 13 country expand 15 three months’ time join cyprus malta. it fact economic integration increase among country european union. it also true deep integration need creation euro area, well eu enlargement globalisation, highlight need flexible economies. in sense, policy-makers social partner increase responsibilities. they must provide good management ensure well-functioning european union characterise flexibility, integrate labour, product financial market discipline fiscal policies. this lead issue i would like address today, namely process european economic integration. first, i would like share stylise fact feature european union’s euro area’s economic integration process. second, i would like look idea regard economic adjustment processes, particularly euro area. finally, i would like talk europe global context. 2. feature economic integration european union allow briefly elaborate four main feature process economic integration european union, euro area particular. i) first, economic integration reflect mark increase intra-euro area trade good services. let provide figures. export import good within euro area increase 26% gdp 1998, year adoption single currency, around 32% 2006. intra-euro area export import service increase 5% gdp 1998 almost 7% 2006. the continue deepen single market facilitate trade services. a interdependence within euro area become stronger, euro area also become open economy increase extra-euro area trade. extra-euro area export import good rise 24% gdp 1998 around 33% 2006. over period, extra-euro area export import service increase 8% gdp almost 10%. these development clearly show witness creation “fortress europe”. on contrary, european integration complement global integration. 1 i like thank malin andersson input speech, klaus masuch hans-joachim klöckers helpful comments, philippe leclercq, katherine brandt antonio afonso additional contributions. bi review 105/2007 1 ii) a second feature, introduction euro contribute financial integration which, turn, improve free movement capital euro area. financial integration enhance efficiency economic mechanisms, strengthen competition raise potential strong economic growth. for example, recent research london economics estimate benefit integration eu bond equity market around 1 percentage point additional gdp growth ten-year period, approximately €100 billion.2 financial integration also crucial, enhance smooth effective transmission single monetary policy throughout euro area. despite progress, financial integration particularly need number areas, include retail banking. iii) labour mobility constitute third feature i like mention. lack openness country increase risk wage pressure labour market tighten. available evidence suggest that, overall, cross-border labour mobility still limit part european union still regulatory barrier across european union, include euro area respect labour slovenia. this clear contrast situation unite states. iv) a fourth final feature, degree synchronisation co-movement different cyclical position across euro area country increase since begin 1990s. in words, large number euro area economy share similar business cycles. in addition, current inflation output growth difference among euro area country relatively limit compare past. the difference also similar observe across region state within unite states. the decline inflation differential impressive. at begin 1990s, dispersion inflation rate across euro area country was, average, around 6 percentage point (standard deviation measure unweighted terms). last year, inflation dispersion 0.7 percentage point. a real gdp growth rate across euro area countries, dispersion, measure term standard deviations, fluctuate around level 2 percentage point past decades, apparent upward downward trend. while difference temporary, others persistent nature. let stress sustain difference economic growth inflation rate euro area country absolutely normal monetary union, extent relate catching-up phenomena. however, also true persistent differential reflect structural rigidity concern. i address issue later. in sum, evidence strong economic integration among country european union. the adoption euro particularly contribute development reduce information costs, enhance price transparency eliminate exchange rate risk country euro area. in manner, euro act catalyst single market, within goods, services, people capital move freely. nonetheless, lot remain done, instance, order increase service trade labour mobility reduce structural rigidities. 3. economic integration adjustment process euro area let turn adjustment process whose smooth function important eu country particularly euro area. why efficient adjustment mechanism particularly important euro area? in monetary union national monetary 2 london economics, “quantification macroeconomic impact integration eu financial markets”, report european commission, 2002. 2 bi review 105/2007 exchange rate policy long available options, important make sure mechanism adjustment shock function properly. this need avoid situation whereby country region, instance experience specific event asymmetric shock, enter either period protract low growth high unemployment, long period overheating. there many factor improve resilience euro area economy adverse shocks. but address issue, let stress ecb’s single monetary policy contribute proper function adjustment mechanism within euro area ensure price stability, i.e. anchor price stability economic agents’ decisions. i believe important contribution. in words, social partners, agree wage increases, also national authorities, prepare budget design policy field responsibility, be, and, matter fact, fully confident we, ecb eurosystem, deliver price stability. turn factors, well-designed structural reform enhance competition foster flexibility product labour market particularly relevant proper function euro area. in context, lisbon strategy fundamental ambitious programme draw europe’s attention urgency structural reforms. such reform improve long-term growth prospects. they affect positively labour participation improve productivity growth promotion innovation technological change. in recent years, already see benefit number structural reforms, creation 13 million new job since 1999. economic flexibility promote remove institutional barrier flexible wage price-setting mechanisms. specifically, monetary union, adjustment take place national labour markets. therefore, wage set appropriately reflect different situation sectors, firm overall labour market conditions. let stress social partner share responsibility ensure wage settlement fully take account need reduce unemployment enhance labour market access employment. moreover, government also aware way wage set public servant serve role model private sector. and social partner need take account different condition firm sectoral level, internalise repercussion wage settlement competitiveness thus employment company industry, sector region. sufficient wage differentiation would improve employment opportunity le skilled worker region sector high unemployment. in respect, clear excessive wage regulation undermine job creation, particular young le qualify workers, well face problem enter labour market. the proper function adjustment labour market also require completion single market. in particular, exist barrier labour mobility within eu notably within euro area must removed. a product markets, let stress also essential single market deepened, particularly service network industries. great cross-border competition deep integration market across eu country would contribute low price high real wages. it would also enhance price flexibility, thereby adjustment process individual countries. another important market-based mechanism help attenuate impact shock country region well-integrated financial market readily available opportunity diversification financial asset portfolios. this would reduce dependence households’ save spend decision economic financial development country region. this mechanism know “credit risk-sharing channels”. in essence, mean consumption le dependent movement national output, first bi review 105/2007 3 consumer borrow international financial institution active level euro area, second financial wealth household le dependent local condition thank internationally well diversify portfolio allocation. moreover, integrate financial market give rise great competition, result favourable finance condition consumer firms. to provide figures, unite states, period 1963-90, capital market smooth 39% shock gross state product (the equivalent gdp), credit channel smooth 23% federal government, fiscal channel, 13%. around 25% shock smooth out. hence, financial market financial institution contribute 62% absorption idiosyncratic state shocks. we therefore see u example financial channel much important fiscal channel. this additional reason speed financial integration europe.3 accord recent study, level integration euro area increasing, although remain modest. it find country make euro area (excluding luxembourg), capital market smooth 10% country-specific shock gdp 1993 2000.4 national authority also make substantial contribution ensure proper function adjustment mechanism within european union conduct well-designed fiscal policy. the best contribution fiscal policy make proper function euro area discipline medium-term oriented, fully line orientation provide stability growth pact. moreover, improve quality public finance enhance business growth conditions, time allow reduction overall public spend national level. indeed, available evidence point existence significant inefficiency public spend eu oecd countries. in words, would seem public spend could substantially reduce without detrimental impact volume output. additionally, efficient public administration would also allow indirect cost public sector inefficiency, link finance inappropriate taxation regimes, reduced. let finally mention important issue competitiveness. one important market-based adjustment mechanism monetary union work via change competitiveness. in euro area, persistent loss relative cost competitiveness necessarily translate, medium term, period below-average growth abnormal level unemployment. accord recent figures, difference cumulate growth unit labour cost total economy euro area country large small cost increases, respectively, 20% 25% period 1998-2006. in sum, structural reform labour, product financial market together sound fiscal policy crucial enable smooth adjustment process european union particularly euro area. at time, difference price competitiveness unit labour cost across euro area economy need closely monitored, may imply major adjustment country concern year ahead. 4. europe global context economic integration smooth adjustment process clear prerequisite efficient function european union. all europe regularly 3 see p. asdrubali, b. sorensen o. yosha, “channels interstate risk sharing: unite state 1963-1990”, quarterly journal economics vol. 111, 1996. 4 see s. kalemli-ozcan, b. sorensen o. yosha, “asymmetric shock risk share monetary union: update evidence policy implication europe”, cepr discussion paper no. 4463. 4 bi review 105/2007 confront various adverse event shocks, instance context globalisation, translate particular great interdependence economy increase cross-border transaction goods, labour capital. let briefly elaborate aspect. globalisation trigger major transformation world, europe. for instance, globalisation undeniably impact inflation process. numerous channel identify economic theory globalisation influence level prices. without doubt, globalisation associate rise world trade contribute import price moderation,5 notably manufacture sector, primarily due increase import low-cost countries. furthermore, widespread opening-up emerge country almost former centrally plan economy significantly increase labour pool available, lead dampen pressure labour costs, especially unskilled labour. globalisation also exert pressure conducive low inflation indirectly, increase international competition may limit price power domestic corporations. however, time, sudden emergence fast-growing economy global economy exert upward pressure price energy raw material prices.6 regardless intensive research currently pursue particular academia, central bank various international institutions, still remain significant uncertainty aggregate role impact globalisation. even though net effect counterbalance force mostly believe contribute towards reduce inflation, whether long disinflationary effect last future remain open question. ultimately, globalisation opportunity, threat. globalisation provide much-needed solutions. for instance, may allow increase labour inflow euro area, which, certain sectors, would help reduce bottleneck labour market hence ease wage pressures. in addition, globalisation may supply external capital exchange know-how. a matter fact, euro area become attractive place foreign direct investment (fdi). a breakdown extra-euro area liability indeed reveal inward fdi amount 27% euro area gdp, 22.5% unite states. the euro area received, proportionally gdp, similar amount fdi china, 27.3% economies, accord imf statistics. a rise amount fdi come so-called bric group – include brazil, russia, india china. in fact, contrary protectionist think would suggest, eu integration adoption euro seem make europe fit globalisation. the single currency support development diversification export euro area countries, mention earlier. the euro also make significant contribution process open euro area financial markets. on asset side, stock euro area asset hold abroad increase le 87% gdp 1999 124% 2005. on liability side, increase also substantial, around 92% gdp 137%. the rise actually much le pronounce unite state period: u asset grow 80% gdp 1999 90% today, u liability increase 91% 110% gdp. in words, euro area unite state hold roughly 5 see box 13 june 2007 issue monthly bulletin entitle “is downward impact globalisation import price waning”. 6 furthermore, also factor – independent globalisation – help explain decline global inflation, rapid technological progress structural reform help increase growth potential economy thus facilitate price stability, great budgetary discipline finally “better” monetary policy, result enhance credibility central banks. bi review 105/2007 5 comparable asset liability 1999, euro area witness substantial increase since start economic monetary union. finally, globalisation put emphasis need reform raise ability europe adjust major change take place global environment. the implementation reform raise flexibility low adjustment cost european firm worker face globalisation process. raise competitiveness main condition make globalisation success european citizens. 5. conclusion lady gentlemen, let conclude. the successful creation euro area economic integration within europe go hand hand integration europe within global economy. in way create “fortress europe”. this objective interests. it crucial promote economic integration enhance flexibility european economies. this would also enhance adjustment process europe. a regard monetary policy, europe count european central bank eurosystem faithful primary objective solidly anchor inflation expectation euro area. a regard element policy depend central bank, i touch three crucial areas: discipline fiscal policies, fully line stability growth pact; structural reform policies, fully line lisbon agenda completion single market; appropriate monitor relative cost competitiveness indicators. thank much attention. 6 bi review 105/2007 zhou xiaochuan: china’s financial market – innovation development speech mr zhou

organization establish participant financial market country throughout world, rule self discipline formulated. in china, ten year development, inter-bank market evolve multi-layered system many sub-sectors include bonds, inter-bank borrowing, bills, gold foreign exchange markets. in system, major participant qualify institutional investor trade base direct enquiry two parities. the market expand steadily. take inter-bank bond market example. at end august 2007, stock bond reach 10.48 trillion yuan, 25 time end 1997; participant number 7,137, 446 time end 1997. the range market

u house representatives, washington dc, 20 september 2007. * * * chairman frank, rank member bachus, member committee, i please appear discus origin problem subprime-mortgage market response federal reserve developments. i also discus possible legislative option address concerns. recent development subprime-mortgage sector let begin background subprime-mortgage sector. subprime mortgage loan intend borrower perceive high credit risk. although mortgage emerge financial landscape two decade ago, begin expand significantly mid-1990s. the expansion fuel innovation – include development credit score – make easy lender ass price risks. in addition, regulatory change ongoing growth secondary mortgage market increase ability lenders, typically hold mortgage book loan repaid, sell many mortgage various intermediaries, "securitizers." the securitizers turn pool large number mortgage sell right result cash flow investors, often component structure securities. this "originate-to-distribute" model give lender (and, thus, mortgage borrowers) great access capital markets, low transaction costs, allow risk share widely. the result increase supply mortgage credit likely contribute rise homeownership rate 64 percent 1994 68 percent – minority household household lower-income census tract record large gain percentage terms. however, considerable benefits, broaden access mortgage credit occur past decade also important negative aspects. not surprisingly, give weak credit history financial conditions, subprime borrower default loan frequently prime borrowers. the consequence default may severe homeowners, face possibility foreclosure, loss accumulate home equity, reduce access credit. in addition, cluster foreclosure lead decline value nearby property great damage neighborhoods. during past two years, serious delinquency among subprime adjustable-rate mortgage (arms) increase dramatically. (subprime mortgage fix rates, hand, stable performance.) the fraction subprime arm past due ninety day foreclosure reach nearly 15 percent july, roughly triple low see mid-2005.1 for so-called near-prime loan alt-a securitized pool (those make borrower typically high credit score subprime borrower still pose risk prime borrowers), serious delinquency rate also risen, 3 percent 1 percent year ago. these pattern contrast sharply prime-mortgage sector, le 1 percent loan seriously delinquent. high delinquency begin show foreclosures. about 320,000 foreclosure 1 estimate delinquency base data first american loanperformance. bi review 104/2007 1 initiate first two quarter year (just half subprime mortgages), average 225,000 past six years. foreclosure start tend high state stress economic condition rise house price decelerate fallen. adjustable-rate subprime mortgage originate late 2005 2006 perform worst, default one two payment (or even payment all). relative early vintages, loan carry great risk beyond weak borrower credit history – include high initial cumulative loan-to-value ratio le documentation borrower income. in addition, sharp deceleration home price since 2005, include outright decline markets, leave many more-recent borrower little home equity. in situation, borrower (particularly owner-investors) may find simply walk away property best option. moreover, low home equity make refinance – typical way many subprime borrower avoid large schedule interest rate reset – difficult impossible many. thus, house price still soft many borrower recent-vintage subprime arm still face first interest rate resets, delinquency foreclosure initiation class mortgage likely rise further. it difficult precise number foreclosure initiation expect come quarters, depend (among factors) evolution house prices, vary widely across localities. historically, half homeowner get foreclosure notice ultimately displace homes, ratio may turn high come quarter proportion subprime borrowers, weak financial condition prime borrowers, higher. the rise could temper somewhat loan workouts. the originate-to-distribute model seem contribute loosen underwrite standard 2005 2006. when originator sell mortgage service rights, depend term sale, much risk pass loan purchaser. thus, originator sell loan may le incentive undertake careful underwrite keep loans. moreover, originators, fee tie loan volume make loan sale high priority loan quality. this misalignment incentives, together strong investor demand security high yields, contribute weaken underwrite standards. the fragment market structure mortgage originator subprime-lending industry may also contributed. data collect home mortgage disclosure act show independent mortgage company – depository institution subsidiary hold company affiliate – make nearly half higher-priced first-lien mortgage 2006 one-fourth loan higher-priced. in addition, source report majority mortgage obtain broker, often independent entity, take loan application behalf depository institution lender. the various lend institution broke operate different regulatory supervisory regime vary intensity enforcement effort. that fragmentation make monitor broke lender difficult regulator investor alike. market tend self-correct. in response serious financial loss incur investors, market subprime mortgage adjust sharply. investor demand originator employ tight underwrite standards, large lender pull back use brokers. the reassessment result increase attention loan quality help prevent recurrence recent subprime problems. nevertheless, many homeowner take mortgage recent year financial distress. to help borrowers, federal reserve, together federal supervisory agencies, issue two statement – april, mortgage lenders; early month, mortgage servicers – encourage financial industry work borrower arrange prudent loan modification avoid unnecessary foreclosures. the conference state bank supervisor (csbs) join federal agency second statement. often, loan workout interest parties. we also encourage 2 bi review 104/2007 lender servicers identify contact borrower who, counsel possible loan modifications, may able avoid enter delinquency foreclosure. the simple step reach borrower get trouble productive. in addition, member federal reserve board serf director neighborworks america, encourage borrower face payment difficulty seek help contact lenders, services, trust counselors. recently, neighborworks america launch nationwide advertise campaign increase awareness available support 24-hour hotline, respond 2,000 call day, almost double number june. additionally, federal reserve work closely community industry group around country reduce homeowners' risk foreclosure. the community affair office reserve bank provide significant leadership technical assistance. for instance, public-private collaboration initiate federal reserve bank chicago neighborhood house service chicago city chicago produce home ownership preservation initiative (hopi), begin 2003. in ensue three years, hopi program counsel 4,000 people, prevent 1,300 foreclosures, reclaim 300 buildings.2 hopi also model foreclosure prevention program operate around country, include baltimore atlanta ohio. a another example, community affair office federal reserve bank san francisco recently convene series workshop develop community-based solution mortgage delinquency six cities. more 700 lenders, house counselors, community group representatives, government official attended. regulatory response the federal reserve take responsible lend consumer protection seriously. along federal state agencies, respond subprime problem number fronts. we commit prevent problem recurring, still preserve responsible subprime lending. last year, coordination federal supervisory agencies, issue principles-based guidance describe safety-and-soundness consumer-protection standard nontraditional mortgages, interest-only negative-amortization mortgages. we subsequently issue illustration help institution clearly communicate information consumers. in june year agency issue supervisory guidance subprime arms. the guidance describe standard bank follow ensure borrower obtain loan afford repay give opportunity refinance without prepayment penalty reasonable period interest rate resets. we request public comment illustration help lender implement guidance. the board also commit provide more-effective disclosure help consumer defend improper lending. a i discuss testimony committee july, recently issue propose rule regulation z, implement truth lend act (tila), improve disclosure relate credit card revolve credit accounts. we engage similarly rigorous review tila rule mortgage loan conduct extensive consumer test mortgage disclosure purpose. in view, good disclosure schedule mortgage payment life loan help borrower understand term mortgage judge ability make future payments. consumer may also benefit good information costs, include brokers' fees, choose among compete mortgage products. in addition, 2 "the home ownership preservation initiative chicago (hopi): reduce foreclosure through strategic partnerships," presentation bruce gottschall, executive director, neighborhood house service chicago, june 25, 2007,

loan advertisement solicitation second require lender provide mortgage disclosure quickly consumer get information need useful them. improve timely disclosure may sufficient cases. a i discuss july, use rulemaking authority home ownership equity protection act propose additional consumer protection late year. we look closely mortgage lend practices, include prepayment penalties, escrow account tax insurance, stated-income low-documentation lending, evaluation borrower's ability repay. the information gather public hear june subsequent comment letter extremely helpful. the recent problem subprime lend underscore need good disclosure new rule also more-uniform enforcement fragment market structure broke lenders. in regard, csbs partner american association residential mortgage regulator (aarmr) develop nationwide license system database mortgage professionals, make considerable progress. the system expect start january 2008 seven states, another thirty state commit add gradually. such nationwide system would help limit ability originator run afoul state regulator continue operate simply move another state. raise quality underwrite practice lender uniformly high standard important objective. to end, board federal agency work csbs apply two guidance document i mention – nontraditional mortgage subprime arm – state-supervised institutions. the csbs publish nearly identical guidance document urge state implement them. many state do so, move so. to achieve strong uniform enforcement, interagency cooperation among variety federal state agency essential. a i note testimony july, board launch pilot program csbs, aarmr, office thrift supervision, federal trade commission. the goal program expand improve consumer protection strengthen compliance review select nondepository lender significant subprime-mortgage operations. the board review nonbank subsidiary bank hold companies, agency conduct similar review nondepository institution thrift hold companies, independent mortgage lend companies, mortgage broke business entities. the review include evaluation companies' underwrite standard senior-management oversight practice use ensure compliance consumer protection regulation laws. the agency work closely together schedule begin on-site review fourth quarter. the partner agency share information review make joint assessment lesson learned. this project also lay groundwork various additional form future cooperation ensure effective consistent supervision consumer protection. legislative response beyond action underway regulatory agencies, i aware congress consider statutory change help alleviate problem foreclosures. modernize program administer federal house administration (fha) one promise direction. the fha considerable experience provide home finance low- moderate-income borrowers. it insure mortgage make borrower meet certain underwrite criterion pay premium reserve fund designate cover cost event default. this insurance make loan le risky lender 4 bi review 104/2007 investors, make loan eligible securitization government national mortgage association (ginnie mae). historically, fha play important role mortgage market, particularly first-time home buyers. however, fha's share first-lien home purchase loan decline substantially, 16 percent 2000 5 percent 2006, borrower might seek fha back instead attract nontraditional product more-flexible quick underwrite processing. in addition, maximum loan value fha insure fail keep pace rise home value many area country. in modernize fha programs, congress might wish guide design principle allow flexibility risk-based pricing. to alleviate foreclosures, fha could encourage collaborate private sector expedite refinance creditworthy subprime borrower face large resets. other change could allow agency flexibility design new product improve affordability feature variable maturity share appreciation. in addition, create risk-based fha insurance premium match insurance premium borrowers' credit profile would give household access refinance options. the risk moral hazard must consider design government-backed programs; program bail fail investors, would encourage excessive risk-taking. one must also consider adverse selection; program provide credit weak eligible borrower likely costly serve broad risk spectrum. risk-based insurance premium tight screen monitor lender mitigate adverse selection. but ultimately mechanism limits, government program able provide meaningful help highest-risk borrower without public subsidy. whether subsidy employ decision congress. the government-sponsored enterprise (gses) fannie mae freddie mac are, limit extent, assist subprime refinance encourage provide product subprime borrower extent permit charters. however, gse charter likely limit ability g serve creditworthy subprime borrowers. indeed, gse program remove strong borrower pool, risk face program – modernize fha program –

however, view, reason gse securitizations well-accepted secondary market come gse-provided guarantee financial performance, market participant appear treat back full faith credit u.s. government, even

further. if, despite considerations, congress incline move direction, ass whether action could take way explicitly temporary able implement sufficiently promptly serve intend purpose. any benefit might conceivably accrue action would likely lose implementation significantly delayed, private securitization activity would likely inhibit interim. bi review 104/2007 5 implication financial market monetary policy most recently, i sure committee member well aware, subprime mortgage loss trigger uncertainty structure product generally reverberate broad financial markets, raise concern consequence

discus similar issues. it one thing organize one activity governor central bank come together share view agree upon importance regional cooperation, completely another thing bind continue institutional dialogue. today, present another proof commitment show regional cooperation see slogan real process real result products. ii. why cooperation? in general nature character form cooperation shape important problem central bank deal with. therefore stage economic development, economic social challenge face economy bind play important role cooperation. a. common challenge while overall region seem experience macroeconomic stability, issue central bank face today respective jurisdiction main partner bear strike resemblance. most importantly share partners. we accept challenge set similar priority converge objectives. deal much fast globalization financial sector rest economy, guard macroeconomic financial stability face happening, challenge european integration define similar problem across region. structural reform i would consider main future challenge. build stable financial system, enhance financial infrastructure, improve financial markets, deepen broaden innovative initiative provide fundamental grind cooperation. the memory late episode tremble financial market western hemisphere, architecture financial system develop region (meaning bank become major player country) make u aware potential risks. they indicate financial market remain highly expose toward negative phenomenon could develop region’s economies. b. common destination in respect, i see enormous possibility cooperation policy coordination direction information sharing, institution building, modification legal infrastructure lobby european structures. face problem group rather separately allow benefit embrace positive effect “economies scale”. i also invite ecb ec explore possibility adopt “party” treatment entire see region, adopt specific program specific group countries. the process merger acquisition incorporate financial system region big european market. this market driven, business initiative financial community, call institutional integration well. bring central

agency adopt logic coordination process compilation implementation technical assistance area integration, institutional building, financial stability process. this approach benefit region several way importantly avoid major economic social disparity economies, long run potential develop serious threat stability. on hand, several difference emerge certain area developments. yet, provide room cooperation. it fact economy adopt diverse approach toward establish macroeconomic financial stability. we different stage integration. it probably due diverse characteristic contagion prevail phenomenon see region. along path transition economy encounter distinct problem different moments. just point examples: • credit penetrate deep culture economy region still remain fast grow new phenomenon others; • some u experience high capital inflow others expect future; • some peg currency euro; others not. for rest region important know trigger different choices. how authority respond problems, expect, react? due different path take nature problem economy encountered, position different part learn curve. there great deal learn experience accumulate period existence, i believe knowledge must shared. c. common achievement we succeed establish network communication central bank region among governors. i notice always express enthusiasm intensify regional cooperation context. i also happy say contact respective international organizations, highly endorse cooperation promise support regard specific problem characterize financial economic development region. i want take opportunity thank dear colleague (friends i say) institution lead significant effort distinguish contribution provide several important activity organize bank albania context financial stability, monetary policy decision making, foreign reserve management economic research. iii. how cooperate? on personal grind i also identify important area fruitful cooperation bear common benefits. i would like encourage establishment annual see central bank forum. this forum could discus detail topic financial stability, statistics, payment systems, economic research, human resources. i would like encourage active participation second third level central banks’ manager “forum – be”. they must follow example governor engage close cooperation. they follow issue discuss decide amongst governors, open dialogue exchange opinions, identify best business practice standard adopt daily work. 2 bi review 104/2007 iv. conclusion i know many time i might mention word “cooperation” today, i hope still

life, washington: aei press, p. 32). bi review 104/2007 1 my intent today suggest federal reserve somehow omniscient regard path u.s. economy. nor intent suggest federal reserve's knowledge tool sufficiently surgical steer u.s. economy completely unscathed choppy water financial market turbulence. and course, i literally mean suggest common aphorism provide infallible compass guide economy past shock one sort another. instead, goal describe federal reserve's monetary responsibilities, highlight critical role liquidity financial markets, discus recent financial market turmoil. while subprime-mortgage market show early pronounce indication weakness, i believe problem afflict subprime-mortgage market serve trigger fundamental cause recent market turmoil economic uncertainty. monetary responsibility financial market by way background, allow highlight federal reserve's dual mandate monetary policy, embody federal reserve act. the federal reserve's statutory objective institute policy foster maximum employment price stability. to ensure objective consistent strong, endure economic performance time, colleagues, past present, interpret "maximum employment" mean maximum sustainable employment. in pursue objective, federal reserve try foster environment look work reasonably find it. similarly, generally interpret congressional mandate ensure "price stability" mean inflation (the rate price change broad range product services) sufficiently low predictable level factor economic plan household businesses. the principal instrument monetary policy conduct

believe federal reserve treat financial stability goal. often see imply preference policymakers perpetuation exist financial institution products. that view i share. the level economic activity would invariably low financial stability alone guide light; protect incumbent expense innovator would prove detrimental long-term vibrancy economy. we extremely wary protect financial institution various stakeholder incur losses. such action distort asset price critically impair efficiency capital allocation. the desire well-functioning market require u insulate asset price individual financial institution buffet marketplace. liquidity well-functioning financial market now, let briefly highlight key attribute well-functioning financial markets: function best attract sufficient liquidity. in previous remarks, i advance notion liquidity think roughly comparable investor confidence.5 liquidity exist investor confident will assume risks. and liquidity persist risk quantifiable investor creditworthy. to trace origin recent financial market turmoil, let's recall time environment benign financial market flush liquidity. this require long memory, aptly characterize capital market four month ago. in early june, i remark that: there little doubt, then, liquidity financial market high today investor seem will take risks, even today's market-prevailing prices. in unite states, term premium long-term treasury yield low, corporate bond appear nearly “priced perfection,” stock price set new records. credit market highly accommodative issuers, volume loan finance highly leverage transaction escalate rapidly.6these financial market condition were, part, i argued, consequence long period remarkably supportive macroeconomic conditions, acceleration financial innovation, particularly growth structure finance products, continue export culture capitalism emerging-market countries. take together, confidence foster continue propagation new securities, new products, new markets. not surprisingly, liquidity ample. do success sow seed distress? so, could go wrong? in time abundant liquidity, investor long comfortable financial position could readily sell holdings. similarly, financial institution could distribute security originate constraints. like others grow increasingly watchful ebullience financial markets, i wonder whether risk give due: these prices, term credit condition may reflect solid economic fundamental – low output inflation uncertainty, healthy corporate balance sheets, corporate profit exceed market expectation – 5 kevin warsh (2007),

overconfidence.7confidence fleeting. confidence beget complacency. if, liquid times, investor structure product become complacent, may understand fully value underlie assets. high level confidence, perhaps even complacency, also observable behavior many financial intermediaries. many hedge funds, grow size scope, invest less-liquid asset search high expect returns. many commercial bank increase sponsorship structure investment vehicle invest long-term securities, often finance off-balance-sheet short-term commercial paper. those financial intermediary recognize risk extrapolate high level liquidity indefinitely threaten erode market share less-impressive profit profiles. they may hop robust trade market would allow exit position ahead crowd trade. but, paraphrase old wall street saw, ring bell market top bottom. a know, liquidity condition start deteriorate mid-july. subprime-mortgage market suffer significantly rapid withdrawal liquidity. they particularly tempt target: many subprime mortgage product newer, performance history shorter, price rise faster, securitization structure complex, disclosure opaque, credit standard weak asset classes. but, subprime credit problem source contagion cause broad reduction liquidity market functioning, become common refrain? or reduction liquidity – concomitant change investor sentiment – simply manifest first subprime-mortgage markets? if latter case, true cause recent financial tumult may well precede turmoil subprime-mortgage market altogether. and policy prescription judge accordingly. subprime lending: spark, cause throughout summer, delinquency rate subprime adjustable-rate mortgage jump house price decelerate effective interest rate rose. the rate serious delinquency subprime mortgage adjustable interest rate reach close 15 percent july. investor incur large loss force sale security back subprime mortgages. credit-rating agency downgrade numerous security back subprime alt-a mortgages. the result investor skepticism accuracy ratings, combine mount loss mortgage lenders, cause investor pull back broad range structure products, even though unrelated mortgages. finance leverage buyout halted; demand security back syndicate loan evaporated. investor begin shun non-mortgage relate asset-backed commercial paper. these subsequent financial problem may reflection subprime contagion all. instead, may investor fundamentally lose confidence ability value broad range assets, particularly rely robust securitization secondary markets. moreover, uncertainty ability large financial institution fund commitment erode confidence counterparties generally. risk premium term premium rise rapidly, investor seek refuge. the principles, products, practice 7 warsh, "financial intermediation complete

quite volatile, unchanged mid-june levels. in corporate bond market, spread widen somewhat, current level close historic averages, issuance investment-grade bond quite sizable. issuance speculative-grade bond sharply reduced, aside difficulty lbo-related deals, may reflect issuers' willingness await improve conditions. not unlike prior episodes, seem increasingly apparent many investor financial intermediary become content benign economic condition robust financial market tend act confidence great warrant fundamentals. indeed, may overly rely credit rat sole gatekeeper

confidence may cause misallocation resources, investor financial intermediary sideline time, undermine normal function market operations. conclusion some month ago, i asked, "what happen liquidity falters?"8 highlight risk liquidity shock indeterminate point future easy ascertain consequence precision. reduce liquidity condition market today stem pullback investors' willingness take risks, may triggered, i argue caused, loss subprime-mortgage markets. thus, broad reassessment risk position appear work, especially product opaque complex. investor rely credit rat alone confront perform credit market valuations. some may find well-equipped make evaluations. how quickly market normalize may depend speed investor counterparties gain comfort ability value assets. the adjustment process private

bank france, european economics financial centre (eefc), london, 11 september 2007. * * * keep inflation check central banks' main objective. understand inflation process central bank main concern. in recent years, take satisfaction fact price stability achieve countries. at time, inflation dynamic may become complex. our ability consolidate past success future may well depend capacity deepen knowledge what, ultimately, determine inflation rate. today, i would like address three specific question extensively discussed, yet fully answered, academic policy-making community: impact globalisation inflation? ha inflation – output trade-off change consequence? and, finally, money aggregate help u effort achieve price stability? globalisation inflation in last twenty years, great integration goods, services, labour capital market coincide stable low inflation. be link? globalisation make significant contribution price stability. with new large new player (such china india, eastern european countries) enter world economy, cheap import become available develop countries. the fall import price develop economy allow real consumption wage grow without impact real production wages. this, turn, raise level employment compatible price stability, or, put differently, low inflation rate give level employment. the effect globalisation may also felt indirectly increase competition, product labour markets. on product market, globalisation eliminate least productive domestic firm (those set high prices) reduce price power remain domestic firms. it may also create condition wage moderation increase degree competition labour market. overall, development make easy central bank bring inflation without real cost economy. but doubtful count indefinitely "tailwinds". inflation partly depend upon import prices. many good service still produce domestically little competition abroad. domestic factor thus remain crucial determinant inflation rates. globalisation low relative price tradables non-tradables open economy. but overall level dynamic price ultimately remain determine monetary authority provide ensure steady growth overall nominal demand maintain appropriate monetary policy.1in addition, possible effect globalisation inflation reverse future. strong growth big emerge economy increasingly put pressure price oil, food commodities. while labour supply country remain abundant, clear whether remain cheap. indeed, currently see 1 speech charles bean, “globalisation inflation”, lse economic society, 24 october 2006. bi review 103/2007 1 increase export price emerge countries, translate high import price develop economies. this inflationary impact seem grow past years, while, contrast, disinflationary impact globalisation seem slow down. go further, analyst suggest that, capital market integration, real interest rate equalize around world, thus reduce ability national central bank control inflation. however, need true. indeed, classic mundell-fleming analysis conclude monetary policy effective, rather less, case international capital mobility, although operate different channel transmission include exchange rate. but inflation direct result macroeconomic shocks. it process business cycle well expectation play important role. ha process changed? a change output – inflation trade-off? inflation dynamic change past fifteen year so. inflation persistence declined, or, words, upward change path price become temporary easily reversed. also, inflation become le responsive shocks. both welcome development monetary policy. maybe document commented-upon change inflation dynamic so-called flatten phillips curve. this, economists' jargon, mean domestic inflation become le sensitive domestic output-gap; or, alternatively, become stable business cycle. there several possible – mutually exclusive – explanation phenomenon. it may well expectation future inflation become important determinant current inflation expense current output gap, would signal monetary policy become effective anchor inflation rate. most explanations, however, structural nature. it possible that, result structural reforms, nairu decrease many country recent years, thus give "optical" impression horizontal phillips curve period. another interpretation firm change price le frequently le necessary low-inflation environment difficult due increase competition, include abroad. these arguments, however,2 challenge basis that, increasingly competitive environment, set “wrong” price become costly firm term forego profits, encourage adjust price frequently. if anything, accord view, competition globalisation expect steepen phillips curve. in broad sense, globalisation may also responsible flatten philip curve. in open economy, domestic demand change easily satisfy increase imports. a consequence, domestic inflation may become le sensitive domestic output gap sensitive global tension production capacities. 2 notably put forward laurence ball. 2 bi review 103/2007 finally, possible (due immigration structural reforms) labour supply become elastic many countries, and, consequence cyclicality wage (and prices) reduced. 3flatter phillips curve may mix bless central banks. in circumstances, look actual project inflation may sufficient detect incipient imbalance supply demand. in words, inflation become le informative output gap. there risk, then, imbalance allow build point strong reaction may become necessary. to prevent risk, central bank may want look information come broad set indicators, choose ability detect, early stage, potential inflationary pressures. obviously, monetary credit aggregate instance good candidate job. what role money monetary policy? a may know, precisely do context eurosystem’s two-pillar monetary policy strategy assign important role money. this structure base particular premise one important implication. the premise even money systematic immediate influence prices, provide valuable specific information future inflation, time horizon stretch beyond usually adopt construction central bank inflation projections. because long-term relation money growth inflation, money lead indicator property future price developments. though fair say apparent link monetary development inflation deteriorate recent years, still strong statistical evidence link monetary growth inflation low frequency. this relation hold euro area, also us, uk large oecd countries, monetary trend systematically lead inflation trends.4the implication refer need cross-check information inflationary pressure risk price stability; cross-check imply bring together compare different analytical strategy systematically use information relevant decision making. the main issue ensure risk price stability medium term materialize medium longer-term inflation expectation remain solidly anchor level consistent price stability objective. such anchor prerequisite monetary policy make ongoing contribution towards support sustainable economic growth well job creation. of course, monetary policy react mechanically monetary developments, rather respond information monetary aggregate relevant maintain price stability medium term. to make best use informational role money, however, address numerous increase challenges. 3 it worth note everybody convince globalisation play important role flatten phillips curve. for instance, frederic mishkin, axel weber donald kohn emphasize uncertainty surround quantification globalisation effect, laurence ball even question effect theoretical grounds. part doubt come apparent lack robustness result indicate domestic inflation become sensitive global output-gap fluctuations, tend weaken case globalisation explanation flatten phillips curve.

rely sufficiently scientific principle method present, and, second, doubt scepticism whether monetary policy acquire element science future would desirable. i would agree implicit presumptions, although go without say conduct monetary policy always require judgement give imperfect knowledge inevitable uncertainty function economy impact monetary policy actions. frederic mishkin provide u excellent comprehensive review progress make monetary policy become science past fifty year assessment limitation science monetary policy. he also highlight two recent episode unite state demonstrate “judgement” inform “science” result appropriate monetary policy decision change uncertain economic environment; discuss gap science monetary policy likely fill future. i broadly agree review advance make recent decade towards make monetary policy science. these advance allow monetary policy base set “scientific principle rely concrete econometric model – increase sophistication policy relevance – make decision appropriate monetary policy stance. his review assessment scientific principle econometric model respectively, guide provide useful basis decision-making, reflect knowledge contribution academic experience central banker. and i fully share view need continue pursue research analysis provide strong scientific basis monetary policy, while, course, recognise monetary policy-making never transform routine process mechanical application principle rules. nevertheless, several issue i would like elaborate pertain (i) role importance core scientific principle guide monetary policy; (ii) current state limitation scientific aspect monetary policy-making; (iii) orientation future effort towards enhance science effectiveness monetary policy. ii. the science monetary policy: role significance core principle in order ass whether degree monetary policy characterise science feature science, useful keep mind two concept “science” “policy” rather distinct explain precisely mean ask bi review 103/2007 1 whether monetary policy become science. after all, science specific subject systematic organise body knowledge subject, knowledge found objective principle involve observation of, experiment with, certain phenomena. the subject mind monetary economics, monetary policy, course action adopt authority achieve certain objectives. all may sound bite philosophical abstract, need precision systematic approach address issue meaningful way. to end, necessary define monetary policy great detail. in try identify “systematic knowledge” “core principles” monetary policy, turn derive theoretical proposition support empirical evidence, i find useful think monetary policy comprise three essential components: • institutional set • policy framework, include policy objective analytical foundation – theoretical empirical – link objective instrument • communication actual conduct policy. monetary policy become science past fifty year main component base core principle derive theoretical proposition argument scrutinise tested, different degrees, basis available empirical evidence, observe reality: practice performance monetary policy. let elaborate nine principle present mishkin also relation ecb’s monetary policy framework. the first three principle (i) inflation fundamentally monetary phenomenon, (ii) price stability important welfare benefits, include contribution sustain growth reduce output volatility, (iii) long-term trade-off unemployment inflation widely accept clearly underpin reflect ecb’s mandate primary policy objective. the first third principle also incorporate ecb’s analytical framework overwhelmingly support empirical evidence. these first three principle eighth principle importance central bank commitment nominal anchor imply price stability (or inflation target) primary, override objective monetary policy. this consider separate derive principle, integrate mandate ecb. the fourth principle concern crucial role expectation determination inflation dynamic transmission monetary policy also universally recognise constitute one key advance analytical foundation monetary policy. the role inflation expectation main channel monetary policy transmission mechanism motivate focus place central bank analysis use several indicator inflation expectation explain importance attach anchor expectation price stability also ecb’s communication policy. this area, however, progress necessary, i discus late on, order good measure, model favourably influence inflation expectation public large. two principles, (i) importance central bank independence order improve effectiveness efficiency monetary policy (ii) need ensure consistent implementation monetary policy time, reflect institutional set-up central banks, include ecb. political authorities, however, occasionally seem ignore forget significance central bank independence, enshrine eu treaty, precisely basis past experience worldwide evidence clearly demonstrate contribution effective decision-making preserve price stability help minimise output volatility. central bank independence also crucial ensure another principle – commitment strong nominal anchor – credible thus 2 bi review 103/2007 effective ensure price stability. for ecb, unambiguous commitment price stability reflect quantification policy objective communication, importantly determination consistency pursue price stability (the nominal anchor). so far, i fully agree role significance seven, nine, principle propose frederic provide scientific underpin monetary policy. there two principles, however, i consider fully widely accept reflect practice monetary policy: principle concern role usefulness monetary policy rule one pertain role financial friction business cycles. these two principle belong, least yet, core proposition underlie science central bank content important reasons. in case policy rules, simple reason use – central bank – actual conduct monetary policy, although may use analytical purpose benchmark comparison policy implement practice. there several reason rule use practice monetary policy. one reason, i highlight late on, relate imperfect inflation available estimate reliably key variable include rules, real time. in case role financial friction – i consider especially important – i somewhat sceptical inclusion core principle stage yet reach state knowledge incorporate financial friction fully monetary policy framework generally acceptable manner. this principle likely include core principle future, analysis empirical support validity robustness. there is, however, notable omission list key principle guide think central bank conduct monetary policy: role money, precisely monetary credit aggregates, monetary policy transmission mechanism assessment medium long-term risk price stability well financial stability. this principle provide one foundation ecb’s analytical framework. i recognise recent year role significance deemphasised economist central banks, i argue before, fundamental role money conduct monetary policy ignored, rather emphasise explored. and part research agenda help u advance science monetary policy. iii. knowledge gap challenge science monetary policy despite progress make past decades, still important knowledge gap understand model monetary policy transmission mechanism; also number analytical statistical (measurement) challenge must address order advance science monetary policy. i prepare list gap challenge read frederic mishkin’s paper. a comparison list likely advance science monetary policy show large overlap regard area research reason give justify need for, likelihood of, progress. what i would like highlight number commonly identify knowledge gap analytical issues, define priority raise additional issue deserve analysis. iii. 1. the role money, credit financial system in order enhance analysis assessment impact monetary policy price developments, well output fluctuation asset price dynamics, modern economy sophisticate financial sector, priority must give development structural model incorporate bank sector, financial bi review 103/2007 3 intermediary rich specification structure function financial markets. the integration financial system, bank sector particular, state-of-the-art dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (dsge) model empirically estimated, would provide theoretically consistent framework – base sound microfoundations – would allow analysis role money credit – liquidity finance condition – transmission effect monetary policy economy. such model develop ecb, central bank universities, scope extension improvements. although task challenge complexity involve incorporate realistic specification financial sector – financial market friction (or imperfections) – models, important policy point view deepen understand transmission channel monetary policy implication price output dynamics. moreover, bernanke, mishkin, gertler others shown, recent experience vividly demonstrated, information asymmetry financial market imperfection play crucial role determine stability financial system business cycle fluctuations. the analysis role money credit (i) transmission effect monetary policy (ii) information variable provide useful signal assessment risk price stability financial stability need confine development dsge models. these model great merit also limitations. they may able capture (adequately realistically) important feature market financial innovation structural change well behaviour different group agent characterise fundamental difference preferences, asymmetric information alternative approach form expectations. for example, recent years, supply credit bank affect financial innovation – securitisation bank asset development credit risk transfer market – result so-called “originate distribute” business model pursue banks. and witness recently consequence bank business model certain feature financial markets. moreover, capital requirements, process financial integration consolidation (both within europe generally global level) increase role non-bank financial institution also influence expansion credit creation (monetary) liquidity. consequently, good understand model innovation processes, well determinant asset price sectoral demand money credit, necessary order improve economic monetary analysis assessment likely impact change monetary policy stance financial market condition price developments. to end, various avenue analytical work pursue ecb, generally eurosystem central banks, draw wide range complementary model analytical tool involve development new model tools. the broad aim research role money, credit financial system monetary transmission mechanism enhance scientific basis – strengthen analytical framework – policy deliberations. and i confident outcome research provide theoretical empirical support two core principle guide conduct monetary policy: (i) principle i add “the role money credit monetary policy transmission mechanism assessment medium long term risk price stability” (ii) generalisation principle “the role financial friction business cycle” and, i would add, “for financial stability”. event recent week amply manifest importance financial stability function economy. what le manifestly obvious precise relationship financial stability consideration monetary policy. two aspect require, view, analysis research. first, monitor assessment financial stability far mainly rely qualitative evaluation judgements. further progress necessary towards method quantify risk vulnerability identify various segment 4 bi review 103/2007 financial sector relate them, theoretically sound empirically robust manner, overall assessment financial stability. second, even challenging, need understand detail verifiable manner precise relationship cause implication financial instability monetary policy. iii.2. expectation another priority research agenda enhance understand way expectation form different agent economy, manage successfully improve effectiveness monetary policy. inflation expectation play crucial role determine impact monetary policy economy shape dynamic response price output shocks. forecast future price development policy simulation base macroeconometric model depend critically model expectations. by widely accept expectation should, large, form “rationally” sense take account relevant available information concern structure function economy factor policy – notably monetary policy – may affect future price developments. this broad formulation nature formation expectation perfectly reasonable, appropriate superior mechanical backward-looking specification expectation formation. in practice, however, crucial issue must address exactly “all available relevant information concern economy’s structure functioning” obtain process economic agents. often hypothesis “rational expectations” incorporate theoretical econometric model make simplify rather unrealistic assumption available information agent basis make “optimal forecasts” future. and assumptions, essentially relate nature modality associate learn information extract process homogeneity agents, play crucial role determine dynamic economy magnitude of, time lag in, effect change monetary policy stance price level output time. an important implication central role expectation monetary policy transmission process “rationality” expectation – broad sense – effectiveness monetary policy depend expectation market public future policy actions. and fundamental reason adoption public announcement quantitative definition price stability (or operational inflation objective), credible commitment central bank objective, effective communication policy decision aim achieve goal crucial anchor inflation expectation price stability. our experience track record ecb since 1999 positive respect: despite fact ecb, newly create central bank, previous track record successful policy-making, financial market immediately understand ecb’s commitment price stability credible factor expectations. ever since 1999, financial market indicator private sector forecast suggest expectation future inflation remain remarkably well anchor ecb’s definition price stability. for example, expectation derive price nominal indexed-linked bond provide compel evidence long-term inflation expectation well anchor euro area. however, market expectation appear “rational” line ecb’s commitment demonstrate ability preserve price stability, process expectation formation among general public appear rather complex. survey evidence suggest number euro area countries, portion general public perceive inflation deviate sometimes significantly actual inflation expect inflation remain elevate level bear little resemblance actually record inflation bi review 103/2007 5 market expectation future inflation. more analysis need understand discrepancy – promise work already do ecb respect. more generally, research aim incorporate empirically plausible theory expectation formation model particular relevance. this require introduction test hypothesis economic agent learn evolve structure function economy may lead relaxation assumption representative agent characteristic models, include dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (dsge) models, thus allow heterogeneity agent expectations. iii.3. some model methodological challenge this bring key model methodological challenge deserve attention order enhance analytical tool monetary policy: • first, develop model overcome restriction inherent stylise assumption representative agent; • second, cope statistical uncertainty data revisions, impact, particular, estimate important economic concept relevant policy formulation directly observable, like potential output growth equilibrium value unemployment rate real interest rate; and, • third, deal possible non-linearities economic relationships. today’s dynamic macroeconomic (dsge) models, sound microfoundations ability ensure internal consistency invariance reduce form parameter policy changes, many merits, i said. but also limitations, one model aggregate economic variable use one “representative” optimise agent whose choice coincide aggregate choice underlie group heterogeneous individuals. clearly, assumption make analytical convenience. yet, conclusion draw model may far-reaching implications. in real economies, agent organise group firms, pursue economic interest. these distinct individual activity le coordinate kind order emerge – adam smith call “invisible hand”. however, pursuit individual optimise behaviour necessarily imply, priori, optimal outcome aggregate level. indeed, many interaction economy require coordination among economic agent may result suboptimal aggregate outcomes, even agent pursue interests. in addition coordination failures, model involve representative agent appear particularly ill-suited address distributional issues, example involve employ unemployed workers. develop rich multiple-agent model unquestionably difficult nevertheless part longer-term research agenda, potential benefit policy-making significant. we live – make decision – world pervasive uncertainty. however, academic profession make tremendous progress analyse risk well-defined stochastic economies, “knightian” uncertainty confront central banker altogether different dimension. among various form uncertainty central banker face, uncertainty policy instrument affect inflation economic activity – monetary transmission mechanism – uncertainty (statistical) measurement current state economy – data – appear weigh particularly heavily. central banker need good understand time ultimate effect change monetary policy instrument inflation economic activity. for purpose, monetary policy-making require qualitative information theory provides. they must quantitative information magnitude lags, even information imperfect. at time, caution circumspection face 6 bi review 103/2007 model data uncertainty clearly warranted. model uncertainty suggest analysis robustness effect monetary policy action across variety model would valuable. recent research show central bank moderate responsiveness policy decision real activity underlie data know subject measurement error. after all, strong policy response mismeasured data induce unnecessary fluctuation economy. in view this, weight give individual information variable depend precisely variable measured. this especially applicable variable directly observable, relevant policy formulation, potential output growth equilibrium value real unemployment rate real interest rate. it would therefore advisable central bank heavily rely policy decision – respective communication – model policy rule place inordinate weight unobservable parameters, difficult measure real time, subject considerable uncertainty underlie data. my final remark model methodological challenge concern fact macroeconomic model today solve estimate linear form, essentially rely linear stochastic difference approach use macroeconomics since 1950s. again, feature merit limitations: linear model technique powerful easy handle scale large complete models. but number essential policy question simply cannot address within linear frameworks. one prominent question relate emergence time-varying risk premia apparently influence behaviour long-end yield curve. research carry ecb show time-variation appear important understand behaviour long yield premia systematically relate economic fundamentals. model them, however, require nonlinear economic frameworks. similarly, might possibly need nonlinear technique answer question policy deal really large shocks. linear model may give sufficiently accurate answer deal small medium-sized shocks, economic relationship essentially non-linear, model may make considerable prediction error situation large shock carry economy far away state characterise “average behaviour”. for reasons, seem important policy perspective develop employ non-linear model estimation techniques. iv. conclude remark to sum up, past decades, tremendous progress make towards make monetary policy science. undoubtedly, contribute enhance effectiveness monetary policy. at time, still room – indeed need – advance scientific element monetary policy-making address number conceptual, methodological empirical challenges. some challenge consequence nature economic system uncertainty surround evolution time. the economic environment continuously change fast pace result action economic agents. technological advances, financial innovations, process globalisation, even change preferences, influence structure function market monetary policy transmission mechanism. monetary policy-makers take decision background evolve economic environment face host uncertainties. this make task challenge – admittedly also exciting. moreover, observation two important implication monetary policy. first, ability combine “science art” well-structured, balanced, prudent effective way always remain key feature successful performance monetary policy. second, environment continuous change considerable uncertainty, essential central bank provide anchor stability certainty: bi

mexico provide appeal development model many develop countries. i must compliment lead light public policy mexico impressive outcomes. i. india’s development experience: pre-reform period some hold view india poor country part human history though pocket prosperity island riches. however, account others, especially global traveller invade india indicate india prosperous country least till 17th century. accord oecd publication, 1700 ad, broadly defined, india’s gross domestic product (gdp) u $ 90.8 billion 24.4 per cent world gdp (maddison angus, “the world economy: a millennium perspective”, oecd, 2001). lord meghnad desai, deliver first p.r. brahmananda memorial lecture mumbai september 2004, note story 19th century india one gloom doom. he add second half 19th century, data best available, india open economy enjoy export lead growth drain export surplus pay home charges. during forty year period 1860 1900, per caput income growth 0.5 1 per cent. accord lord desai, first fifty year 20th century much le favourable indian economy last forty year 19th century. further, book title “the national income india twentieth century”, professor sivasubramonian observe first five decade 20th century (1900-01 1946-47), get independence 1947, per caput gdp india stagnant, trend growth gdp period 0.9 per cent population grow 0.8 per cent (sivasubramonian, s., oxford university press, 2000). a compare near stagnant growth first 50 year 20th century, could see table 1 (attached), annual growth average around 3.5 per cent period 1950 1980 comparatively better, per caput growth break long period inertia average 1.1 per cent around 1980. the average growth rate bi review 102/2007 1 around 6 per cent since 1980s, embark high average growth path 8.6 per cent last four year could paradigm shift. the indian experience clearly suggest mixed-economy model plan development strategy first phase 1950s 1960s, improve growth rate dramatically relative previous decades, also provide essential build block lay strong foundation indigenous industrial base, vibrant entrepreneurial class, knowledge economy, considerable improvement vertical, social economic mobility. however, inward look import substitution strategy pursue initial decade plan period result decline productivity high cost economy. realize this, significant change policy initiate early 1980s, take account oil shock 1970s early 1980s. these policy measure take india high growth trajectory 1980s wake create macroeconomic imbalance lead crisis 1991 trigger comprehensive sustainable reforms. the policy since 1991 provide ample opportunity build strong foundation economic, political social sphere, lay pre-reform period plan development. ii. development experience: post-reform period trigger reform the policy reform 1980s provide impetus high growth enhance competitiveness growth process turn unsustainable. it manifest grow macroeconomic imbalance decade form high fiscal deficit, high level current account deficit, increase level short term external debt, besides repressive weaken financial system. the immediate provocation crisis 1991 also combination external event generate liquidity problem external front. the gulf crisis 1991 affect india’s oil import due soar oil price also erode export market west asia, cause setback inward remittance tourist earnings. the deterioration export eastern europe, break-up erstwhile ussr, accentuate crisis. around time, india’s credit rat lowered, restrict access commercial borrow unwillingness part normal bank channel renew short-term credit indian bank abroad. exceptional finance measure become inevitable, overall deficit 1990-91 finance almost equally recourse imf drawdown reserves. the severity balance payment crisis early 1990s could gauge fact india’s foreign currency asset deplete rapidly u $ 3.1 billion august 1990 u $ 975 million july 12, 1991. i would narrate story excite journey agony 1991 relative comfort 2007, conclude mention prospect challenge ahead us. reform measure during crisis period, conscious decision take honor debt obligation without seek reschedule several steps, include unconventional ones, like pledge gold international institutions, resort tide crisis. the immediate step undertake included, among others, tighten non-essential import avail credit imf multilateral bilateral donors. a macroeconomic structural stabilization programme encompass trade, industry, foreign investment, exchange rate, public finance financial sector put place create environment conducive expansion trade investment. it recognize trade policies, exchange rate policy industrial policy form part integrate policy framework 2 bi review 102/2007 aim improve overall productivity, competitiveness efficiency economic system, general, external sector, particular. feature economic reform it may interest enumerate important feature economic reform process undertake india since 1991. first, approach towards reform india cautious appropriate sequence measures, complementary reform across sector (e.g., monetary, fiscal external sector), development financial institution markets. the objective progress harmony across sectors. second, pace sequence liberalization responsive domestic developments, especially monetary financial sectors, evolve international financial architecture. the reform debate intensely design essentially indigenously. third, approach reform “gradual steady” rather “big bang” approach. the reform generally view process event. in approach, pace sequence liberalization could temper keep view degree comfort move forward credible way. fourth, major thrust drive reform process quest high growth efficiency along macroeconomic stability. at time, reform “inclusive” sense benefit reform demonstrably share sections, particular, vulnerable sections. this easily significant electoral issue provincial national elections. iii. select economic indicator the major macroeconomic indicator last seven year give table 2 (attached) broadly summarize quantitative achievements. gdp growth over last four year 2003-07, indian economy enter high-growth phase, gdp growth average 8.6 per cent per annum. the acceleration growth period accompany significant moderation volatility, especially industry service sectors. the structure domestic output distinctly shift favor service sector, growth industry also accelerating. indian industry appear respond well global competition restructure technological upgradation recent years. india's growth mainly drive domestic consumption, contributed, average, almost two-thirds overall demand. save investment balance a noteworthy feature ongoing structural transformation indian economy significant increase domestic save investment rates. domestic investment rate increase 24.3 per cent 2000-01 33.8 per cent 2005-06 domestic save rate 23.7 per cent 2000-01 32.4 per cent 2005-06. the household sector continue major contributor gross domestic save save rate place 22.3 per cent 2005-06, account rise profit, save rate private corporate sector rise 8.1 per cent 2005-06. the public sector, start post positive save begin 2003-04, record save rate 2.0 per cent 2005-06 account continue fiscal improvement negative save rate 1.7 per cent 2000-01. it may note 95 per cent investment finance domestic bi review 102/2007 3 savings. give fact indian per caput income increase rapidly policy effort towards financial deepen achieve inclusive growth underway, save rate india could even rise medium long term. the level save rate help continue finance investment need economy domestically, without undue dependence foreign savings. productivity efficiency in tandem acceleration rate investment economy, evidence pickup productivity efficiency capital use. some recent study relate india indicate increase total factor productivity (tfp) growth recent years. for instance, rodrick subramanian, imf work paper 2004, point india seem large amount productivity growth relatively modest reforms. a recent paper barry bosworth, susan collins, arvind virmani (2007) confirm trend. they find output per worker grow 1.3 per cent annually 1960-1980, gdp growth also low 3.4 per cent. tfp growth barely zero, accord calculations, indicate growth output almost entirely drive growth inputs. in contrast, growth output per worker nearly triple 3.8 per cent 1980-2004, tfp increase ten-fold 2 per cent. the evidence increase growth labour productivity also available study (economic intelligence unit, 2007). a study tata service (2003) find all-india manufacture sector, labour productivity (output per unit labour) increase significantly post-reform period, compare pre-reform period. poverty employment the sustain economic growth since early 1990s also associate reduction poverty. base uniform recall period consumption distribution, proportion people live poverty line decline 36 per cent 1993-94 27.8 per cent 2004-05. there also evidence pick-up employment growth 1.57 per cent per annum (1993-94 1999-2000) 2.48 per cent per annum (1999-2000 2004-05). accord report anecdotal evidence, benefit recent surge growth rate gdp restrict large cities, people urban semi urban area also gaining. there evidence reduction employment disguise unemployment informal sector. money, price credit the high growth gdp recent year accompany moderation inflation average 4.9 per cent 2003-07. historically, india see high inflation. the headline inflation rate, term wholesale price index, decline average 8.2 per cent period 1980-81 1990-91 6.2 per cent post crisis period, i.e., 1992-93 2006-07, sharp moderation recent period. during 2006-07, money supply (m3) increase 21.3 per cent year-on-year basis well indicative projection year. it largely reflect surge capital flow country. non-food credit extend schedule commercial bank (scbs) increase 28.4 per cent 2006-07 top 31.8 per cent previous year. the growth bank credit favour retail lending, particularly housing, real estate, trade, transport professional service non-banking financial company – sector hitherto significant credit market. these development lead lively debate sign overheat economy subsequent moderation inflation diffuse attention. 4 bi review 102/2007 iv. monetary policy regulatory framework a regard framework monetary policy, basic objective monetary policy, namely price stability ensure credit flow support growth, remain unchanged india. of late, consideration macroeconomic financial stability assume add importance view increase openness indian economy. in india, broad money (m3) emerge intermediate target mid-1980s base premise stable relationship money, output prices. in late 1990s, view ongoing financial openness increase evidence change underlie transmission mechanism interest rate exchange rate gain importance vis-à-vis quantity variables, reserve bank adopt multiple indicator approach april 1998 whereby interest rate rate return different financial market along data currency, credit, trade, capital flows, fiscal position, inflation, exchange rate etc. juxtapose output data draw policy perspectives. the liquidity management system carry open market operation (omo) form outright purchases/sales government security daily reverse repo repo operation liquidity adjustment facility (laf) emerge main instrument interest rate signal indian economy. in context large capital flow sterilisation, availability policy instrument manage liquidity strengthen open market operation market stabilisation scheme. while prefer instrument indirect, varied, hesitation take recourse direct instrument also, circumstance warrant them. in fact, complex situation warrant dynamic different combination direct indirect instruments, multiple forms, suit condition – especially transmission mechanism. similarly, considerable merit maintain distinction monetary prudential policy central bank, reserve bank hesitate enhance provision requirement risk weight select category bank assets, namely real estate, housing, consumer finance capital market exposures. there also close monitor off-balance sheet exposure banks. detail guideline issued, consultation, product, account prudential aspect credit derivatives. a framework govern banks’ linkage systemically important deposit take non-deposit take non bank financial company also put place. more generally, reserve bank’s approach recognise positive contribution financial innovation make enhance efficiency financial intermediation. at time, reserve bank considers, dynamic setting, appropriate safeguard ensure stability, take account prevail governance standards, risk management system incentive framework foreign, public, private cooperative bank also relate non-banks. overall, progressive cautious policy contribute efficiency stability financial system enable current growth momentum environment macro stability. some important factor shape change monetary policy framework operate procedure india 1990s delinking budget deficit automatic monetization reserve bank, deregulation interest rates, development financial market reduce segmentation good linkage development appropriate trading, payment settlement system along technological infrastructure. with enactment fiscal responsibility budget management act 2003, reserve bank withdraw participate primary issue central government security effect april 2006. the recent legislative amendment enable flexible use cash reserve statutory liquidity requirement banks, without constrain statutory floor ceiling level prescription reserve bank. bi review 102/2007 5 v. fiscal policy reform public debt management: centre state the fiscal system prevalent begin 1990s characterise sustain high fiscal deficit mount debt accumulation give rise inflation, financial repression, overall deterioration macroeconomic fundamental economy. the average gross fiscal deficit central government per cent gdp decade 1980s 6.8 per cent 3.8 per cent 1970s. a positive outcome recent year mark improvement health government finance adoption fiscal responsibility budget management (frbm) act, 2003 central government fiscal responsibility legislation (frls) several state governments. rbi state under india’s federal system government, constitution allocate revenue power expenditure function central state governments. in general, function require maintain macroeconomic stability international relation assign centre, provision public service law order, internal security, public health, sanitation, water supply agriculture largely entrust states. both government layer share responsibility education, health infrastructure, though state critical role. in india, borrow state government subordinate prior approval national government. this embody article 293 indian constitution, which, state government indebted central government, require prior approval borrowings. central approval embed procedure sale state government securities, therefore, cannot violated. furthermore, state government permit borrow externally, unlike centre. the reserve bank play two crucial role relation indian fiscal system, namely banker debt manager central state governments. the rbi act allow rbi agreement state government undertake bank operation management public debt. while undertake role banker central state governments, rbi also provide temporary support tide mismatch receipt payment form way mean advance (wma). the reserve bank organize biannual conference state finance secretary since november 1997. this conference, right inception, provide useful forum interaction among stakeholder (state governments, central government reserve bank) matter relate state finance arrive consensual solution issue policy operational significance. among area deliberated, important one’s relate fiscal responsibility legislation state levels; standardisation budgetary, account transparency practices; cash management; management consolidate sink fund natural calamity fund; evaluation fiscal guarantee etc. the reserve bank proactive respond time time, need states, evident two recent moves. face accumulation large surplus cash balance negative spread earn investment balances, state government approach reserve bank arrange buy-back outstanding state development loan (sdls). accordingly, reserve bank formulate general scheme buy-back sdls concurrence government india. follow recommendation twelfth finance commission, external loan would pass state (in rupee terms) back-to-back basis. consequently, state government would bear foreign exchange risk context loans. again, behest state governments, reserve bank recently organize workshop management foreign exchange risk, benefit state government officials. 6 bi review 102/2007 the reserve bank interact state several front especially regard lend agriculture, small industries, weak sections, depositor protection, financial inclusion, financial literacy, respond natural calamity etc. mainly regional offices. management public debt the aggregate stock public debt centre state percentage gdp high, currently around seventy five per cent. there are, however, several unique feature management public debt india, noteworthy. first, state direct exposure external debt. second, almost whole public debt local currency denominate hold almost wholly residents. third, public debt, centre state actively prudently manage reserve bank india ensure comfort financial market without undue volatility. fourth, government security market develop significantly recent year term turnover, depth participants, significant improvement underway. fifth, contractual save supplement marketable debt finance deficits. finally, direct monetary finance primary issue debt discontinue since april 2006. hence, high stock public debt relative gdp far matter concern far stability concerned, recognise long term sustainability would call gradual reduction prudent levels. vi. external sector reform benefit calibrate sequence strategy liberalisation, india’s external sector become resilient. export grow average rate around 25 per cent last three years, import grow around 35 per cent period. the current account remain surplus 2001-02 2003-04, turn modest deficit since then. there significant strengthen capital account result continue accretion foreign exchange reserves, around us$ 228.8 billion august 31, 2007. a could see table 2, considerable improvement liquidity sustainability indicator external debt. the exchange rate rupee become market determine march 1, 1993 august 1994 india become current account convertible accept article viii article agreement imf. there simultaneously significant rationalization tariff structure gradual manner provide opportunity domestic industry equip face global competition. for instance, custom duty non-agricultural product come 150 per cent 1991-92 10.0 per cent 2007-08. a qualitative change bring legal framework liberalization enactment foreign exchange management act (fema) june 2000. with this, objective regulation redefine facilitate trade payment well orderly development function foreign exchange market india. the extent time capital account liberalization properly sequence concomitant development strengthen bank sector, fiscal consolidation, market development integration, trade liberalization, change domestic external economic environments. it also recognize may link current capital account hence procedure place avoid capital flow guise current account transactions. further, hierarchy establish source type capital flows. the priority liberalize inflow relative outflows, outflow associate inflow totally freed. among type inflows, foreign direct investment prefer stability excessive short-term external debt eschewed. a differentiation make corporates, individuals, banks. operationally, process manage capital account consist operate two routes, bi review 102/2007 7 namely automatic non-automatic. consistent rebalancing desire direction do expand automatic route move prohibit transaction non-automatic approval route late stage, automatic deregulate regime. there significant liberalisation policy framework regard capital outflow past years. each country design policy regime capital outflow keep view specific country context, especially characteristic real sector, merely contextual level inflow extant absorptive capacity economy. first, current regime outflow india characterise liberal incentivised framework corporates invest real economy outside india, include acquisition route. the regime serve country well since indian corporates increasingly able establish synergy overseas units, make lack scale legacy problem india, quickly acquire domain knowledge acquisition. second, significant liberalisation outflow individual household implement follow recommendation committee full capital account convertibility (chairman: shri s. s. tarapore, 2006). further liberalization would do light international experience show resident individual often precede overseas investor initiate outflow perception regard domestic economy’s performance stability appear turn adverse. third, regard regime outflow financial intermediaries, approach characterise caution quantitative stipulation whereby prudential consideration compulsion management capital account relevant. vii. financial sector reform major policy measure financial sector relate phase reduction statutory pre-emption like cash reserve ratio statutory liquidity requirement deregulation interest rate deposit lending, except select segment. the diversification ownership bank institution yet another feature enable private shareholding public sector banks, list stock exchanges, arise dilution government ownership. the bank sector reform combine comprehensive reorientation competition, regulation ownership non-disruptive cost-effective manner. indeed bank reform good illustration dynamism public sector manage overhang problem pragmatism public policy enable domestic foreign private sector compete expand. the regulatory framework india, addition prescribe prudential guideline encourage market discipline, increasingly focus ensure good governance “fit proper” owner director banks. the reserve bank issue detail guideline ownership governance private sector bank emphasize diversify ownership. the reserve bank also provide significant thrust implementation information technology bank sector. foreign direct investment private sector bank allow 74 per cent, subject prescribe guidelines. again, 100 per cent foreign direct investment allow 19 activity automatic route non-bank financial company (nbfcs). there minimum capitalisation norm investments. besides, 100 per cent nbfc subsidiary also establish subject clearance foreign investment promotion board (fipb), government india. there noticeable increase interest foreign entity acquire stake nbfcs. policy initiative take recent past ensure nbfcs adhere regulatory prescription spell them. in cooperative segment, urban cooperative bank (ucbs) suffer problem multiple supervisory/regulatory authorities, also challenge reconcile democratic character financial discipline. therefore, several structural, legislative regulatory measure initiate recent year urban co-8 bi review 102/2007 operative bank view evolve policy framework orient towards revival healthy growth sector. a vision document healthy growth formulated. restructure large weak bank commence well way. similarly, issue relate rural co-operative bank structure regional rural bank (rrbs) consider actively comprehensive measure plan implementation. financial market reform financial market india period early 1990s mark administer interest rates, quantitative ceilings, statutory pre-emptions, captive market government securities, excessive reliance central bank finance fiscal deficit, peg exchange rate, current capital account restrictions. a wide range regulatory institutional reform introduce plan manner period improve efficiency financial markets. these include development market micro structure, removal structural bottlenecks, introduction/ diversification new players/instruments, free price financial assets, relaxation quantitative restrictions, good regulatory systems, introduction new technology, improvement trade infrastructure, clear settlement practice great transparency. reform financial market carefully sequence ensure sync real sector. the reform also important develop environment effective monetary policy make monetary transmission mechanisms. a noteworthy feature government security corporate debt market essentially domestically drive since fii non-resident participation market limit subject ceilings. the linkage money, government security forex market establish growing. the price discovery primary market credible secondary market acquire great depth liquidity. the reserve bank also initiate number step – institutional, procedural operational – make payment system safe, secure efficient. for efficiency enhancement risk reduction, usage real time gross settlement (rtgs) system electronic payment mechanism encourage big way. viii. financial inclusion customer service the reserve bank undertake number measure objective attract financially exclude segment population structure financial system. the broad approach reserve bank aim “connecting” people bank system. measure relate financial inclusion may summarize follows: first, bank advise make available basic bank “no-frills” account nil minimum balance well charge ensure outreach account vast section population. a many regional language india, bank require make available print material use retail customer concern regional language. second, bank also permit utilise service non-governmental organizations/self help group (ngos/shgs), micro-finance institution civil society organization intermediary provide financial bank service use business facilitator business correspondent (bc) models. third, bank also enter agreement indian postal authority use large well spread network post office business correspondents, thereby increase outreach leverage postman’s intimate knowledge local population trust repose him. similarly, bank association insurance companies, bi review 102/2007 9 provide innovative insurance policy affordable cost, cover life disability health cover. fourth, reserve bank encourage use ict solution bank enhance outreach help business correspondent (bcs). a multilingual website 13 indian language matter concern bank common person launch reserve bank 18 june 2007. several initiative also undertake reserve bank improve delivery customer service banks. first, recommendation stand committee procedure performance audit public service set november 2003 cover individual customer's deal bank area foreign exchange, currency government transactions, include pension, besides main relationship account holder implemented. second, order bring together activity relate customer service bank reserve bank india single department, reserve bank india constitute new department call “customer service department” july 1, 2006. the new department facilitate sharp focus customer service issues. third, bank ombudsman scheme, introduce 1995 provide expeditious inexpensive forum bank customer resolution complaint relate deficiency bank services, last revise 2006. the scheme enlarge scope applicable commercial banks, regional rural bank schedule primary cooperative banks. the complainant file complaint form, include online. fourth, recognise institutional gap measure performance bank code standard base establish best practices, rbi set bank code standard board india 2006. it autonomous independent body, nature self-regulatory organisation. bank register board member provide service per agree standard codes. the board turn, monitor ass compliance code standard bank agree to. the code banks' commitment customer release july 1, 2006. the code cover various aspect transaction individual deposit accounts, interest rates, fee charges, remittances, settlement claim respect decease account holders, loan products, safety locker, credit cards, guarantees, collection due complaint grievance redressal. the reserve bank also make obligatory bank display update, offices/branches also websites, detail various service charge prescribe format. fifth, lack financial education part customer bank contribute rise number complaints, especially relate credit card operations, reserve bank accord top priority financial education would ensure customer bank take inform decision. individual bank also start take various step regard “financial education posters”, “short films” websites, etc. ix. prospects, challenge strength short term prospect for monetary policy purposes, reserve bank, annual policy statement, place real gdp growth 2007-08 around 8.5 per cent, assume escalation international crude price bar domestic external shocks. the policy preference period ahead strongly favour price stability well-anchored inflation expectation endeavour contain inflation close 5.0 per cent 2007-08 10 bi review 102/2007 range 4.0–4.5 per cent medium-term. for purpose monetary policy formulation, reserve bank project rate money supply (m3) growth around 17.0-17.5 per cent non-food credit 24-25 per cent 2007-08 consonance outlook growth inflation. while retain stance monetary policy, reserve bank flag importance financial stability first quarter review annual policy statement issue july 31, 2007. data recent development broadly consonance expectation 2007-08. accord central statistical organization, first quarter financial year 2007-08 (april-june, 2007), real gdp grow 9.3 per cent back 9.1 per cent last quarter 2006-07 (january-march, 2007) 9.6 per cent first quarter previous year (april-june, 2006). the wholesale price index, year year basis, decrease 3.79 per cent week end august 25, 2007 compare 5.12 per cent year ago. a august 17, 2007, broad money (m3) supply growth 20.0 per cent year-on-year basis almost previous year. though buoyant broad based, decline non-food credit growth 23.6 per cent august 17, 2007 compare 32.8 per cent year ago. export continue momentum, however, import rise sharply, lead widen trade deficit u $ 25.7 billion first four month 2007-08 (april-july) compare u $ 15.8 billion period previous year. available information indicate continuation growth momentum 2007-08 far strong pace impulse growth get broad-based. steady increase rate gross domestic save investment, consumption demand, addition new capacity well intensive efficient utilisation/capitalisation exist capacity expect provide support growth 2007-08. the recent gain bring inflation stabilise inflation expectation support current expansionary phase growth cycle. it is, however, necessary continuously ass risk inflation outlook emanate high volatile international crude prices, continue firmness key food price uncertainty surround evolution demand-supply gap globally, well india. risk global development continue persist, especially form inflationary pressures, re-pricing risk financial market danger downturn asset classes. excessive leverage enhance vulnerability global financial system. large change liquidity condition obscure assessment risks, attendant uncertainty. give flux associate financial market monetary policy set globally, india cannot immune developments. the policy challenge reserve bank, now, manage current transition high growth path contain inflationary pressure focus financial stability. contextually, reserve bank are, therefore, maintain enhance vigilance able respond appropriately prevail heighten uncertainty global financial, well as, monetary conditions. medium term challenge for large diverse economy low per caput income undergo structural transformation highly uncertain global environment, challenge public policy manifold. i would focus few, reserve bank consider crucial enhance medium term prospect equitable growth. first, 60 per cent workforce dependent agriculture, sector account 20 per cent gdp. further, gdp growth generate agriculture marginally rate growth population, adequate ensure rapid poverty reduction. volatility agricultural production implication overall growth also, experience 2006-07 amply demonstrated, maintain low stable inflation. enhance growth agricultural sector vital ensure food bi review 102/2007 11 security, poverty alleviation, price stability, overall inclusive growth sustainability growth overall economy. recently, honourable prime minister announce major scheme double growth rate agriculture 4.0 per cent 11th plan period. a time-bound food security mission also announce counter rise price food product ensure visible change availability three years. second, manufacture sector record robust growth, despite several infrastructure deficiencies. the inadequate availability modern infrastructure shortage skilled manpower critical barrier growth manufacture sector. it essential augment exist infrastructure facilities, particularly roads, port power, provide enable environment industry prosper. the important issue regulatory framework overall investment climate, address government. one concern cost recovery, expect improve enlighten public-private partnership. third, salient feature fiscal consolidation process recent year even account cyclical element significant reduction key deficit indicators. our study state finance reserve bank india give grind optimism regard fiscal health. we recognize two important area that, addressed, would result fiscal empowerment. one elimination subsidies, inappropriate directly target poor, elimination tax exemptions, patently distortionary. moreover, delivery essential public service education health large section population major challenge. fourth, grow recognition india governance reform critical strengthen state capacity enable perform core functions. the task improve institution economic governance comprise, among others, many organization action essential good function markets. it must recognize good governance co-exist public sector function fairly efficiently, achievable improve undermine it. the business community therefore vital stake improve empower public institutions. i would like endorse professor avinash k. dixit, president-elect, american economic association say second p.r. brahmananda memorial lecture deliver june 2007 mumbai. “finally, i think process design institutional reform offer good opportunity fruitful collaboration academic economist businesspeople. many academic economist use dislike disdain businesspeople prefer statist solution economic problems. this much le true western country days, tendency may persistent india. i hope even regard task improve institution economic governance favorable light, see way constrain opportunistic behavior businesspeople. many also attract idea bottom-up rather top-down reform. there wealth academic studies, theoretical empirical, evolution, performance, limitation institutions. businesspeople clear perception specific governance need industries. the two combine brain energy adapt lesson study indian situations, contribute create good environment continue rapid economic progress country.” (dixit, avinash k., second p.r. brahmananda memorial lecture, june 2007, mumbai, page 17-18) strength the indian economy inherent strength, quantifiable non-quantifiable, would facilitate meet challenge ahead. i already mention extensively quantifiable strengths. apart quantifiable strengths, certain “not easily quantifiable strengths” economy posse i would like mention them. first, vast pool science technology graduate million people familiar english language source strength. the familiarity 12 bi review 102/2007 multiple language india prepare people adapt good multi-cultural situations, make easy fit international system smoothly. second, india also enjoy distinction big democracy world. the existence free press provide insurance excess make government level accountable otherwise. third, impressive initiative many state empowerment woman defend right help gain great self-esteem control personal life social relationships. fourth, political climate characterise may term political system stability, despite coalition cabinet periodic election centre several states. fifth, india remain one young country world next decades. this "demographic dividend" see inevitable advantage provide prerequisite skill-upgradation sound governance realize put place. sixth, term business environment, impressive growth couple market orientation economy bottom-up exercise,

thank you. bi review 102/2007 13 14 bi review 102/2007 bi review 102/2007 15 fatos ibrahimi: the bank system situation future challenge address mr fatos ibrahimi, deputy governor bank albania, european finance convention, tirana, 14-15 september 2007. * * * dear participants, it pleasure participate summit outline main development one key area albanian economy, bank system. in follow discussion, i dwell two main issues: first, key step bank reforms, special focus issue relate commercial bank system’s financial development recent years. second, aspiration albanian economy absorb foreign direct investments, importance financial system fdi growth implication future. 1) the performance albanian bank system reform bank part structural reform undertake albanian authority 1992. in addition macroeconomic stability, reform aim transform albanian economy market economy, privatization establishment financial institution institution social protection. albania go constant process bank system consolidation since transition market economy. in 90s, process relatively sluggish result informal financial market hold country’s economic financial development back. the high interest rate offer market keep efficiency monetary policy steer interest rate pending. in addition, issues, high concentration deposit loan three state-owned banks, operational loss result increase non-performing loans’ portfolio, undeveloped incoherent regulatory framework supervision become impediment expansion reform bank sector. follow period, bank system consolidation process begin progress. this period characterize reduction share state-owned banks, gradual privatization considerable increase number private bank 4 operate 1997 17 bank 2006. in context, central bank extremely prudent select license private banks, three license recent year entirely albanian capital. despite increase number domestic commercial banks, expansion bank activity 2003 prudent one, line country’s economic development. during 1998-2003, bank system’s total asset grow average 13 per cent year, consistent nominal gdp growth period. nonetheless, swift growth bank asset 67 per cent last three years, 2-3 time high cumulative growth nominal gdp. a result enhance confidence domestic bank system, share asset gdp increase 2006 peak level 70 per cent, comparable central east-european countries. the performance commercial loan private sector household also satisfactory. it growth rate constantly exceed expansion rate bank assets. over last years, private loan improve considerably; 2005-2006 record cumulative growth 175 per cent, high growth record region bi review 102/2007 1 central east-european countries. another characteristic support foreign credit institution free choice currency, almost 3/4 (three-fourth) total loan extend foreign currency. thus far may say credit supply prudent levels, since non-performing loans’ portfolio, though increase moderately 3.1 per cent gross loan 2006, provide evidence limit exposure bank sector non-settlement risk. however, despite considerable improvement asset quality commercial banks’ financial performance, growth lend private sector household remain low share gdp – 21.3 per cent 2006, compare 49 per cent central east-european country – provide evidence non-utilized bank service capacity albanian economy. 2) bank law many amendment law financial system make years. these amendment result need adopt european directive area basel core principle effective bank supervision. this process successfully finalize upon approval law no. 9662 “on bank republic albania” parliament. compare previous law, new law complete accurate part it. it integrate new concept full compliance european directive 83/349 important directives. it stipulate change license activity level capital, consolidate supervision, etc. in addition, “risk management”, previously provide specific regulations, summarize specific chapter law. 3) foreign direct investment albanian financial system foreign direct investment assess important develop countries, since positive impact macroeconomic, technological institutional performance recipient countries. the wide experience last decade indicate presence financial fdis improve soundness domestic financial system, good management portfolio risk efficient allocation credit funds. in addition, technological innovation derive fdi inflow affect enhancement bank system competition efficiency, increase variety product service provided. despite positive effects, presence foreign bank country instigate improvement institutional framework, push application international accounting, report supervision standards, help commercial banks’ decision-making process also central bank’s. therefore, fdis expect promote production activity country, also direct indirect impact albanian financial system. foreign production company directly need financial transfer service (channel payroll atms, pos), execute domestic financial system. the international company invest country make use commercial banks’ fund source order prevent exchange rate interest rate risk. there many property-related development albanian bank system. since establishment, domination state-owned bank reduce today, foreign commercial banks’ asset account 90 per cent bank system. the increase number foreign bank system also favour fact investment penalize albania; requirement establish bank similar domestic foreign-owned banks. 2 bi review 102/2007 the current ownership diverse; foreign investor austria, italy, greece, usa, turkey, germany, bulgaria, malaysia arab countries. greek bank present market since 1996; german italian investment present quite long time well, latter grow substantially become one market’s key actors. austrian investment may consider dominant ones. their ownership result acquisition large domestic state-owned bank. the long presence foreign bank albanian bank system influence establishment stable bank system stable growth. despite financial collapse 1997 panic crisis 2002, none case system’s performance source crisis instability. previously, foreign bank conservative term expand geographical activity; however, entry raiffeisen bank market push active. this fact may evidence variety product provide market, growth lend employment clear strategy increase maintain market share. however, economic benefit derive presence foreign bank reach proper level yet. the enhancement quality information provide public large central bank, low intermediation cost, improvement risk management, standardization account financial report system desire level yet. now let u turn briefly possible financial relationship albanian bank system production foreign investment flow. undoubtedly, positive influence foreign direct investment economic growth depend largely recipient countries’ circumstances. it require substantial level financial system development crucial precondition. a develop financial system improve efficiency allocate resource enhance country’s capacity absorb fdi. the entry new investor orient concentration market segment large-size businesses. their impact, along lend capacity bank market, believe crucial proof success albania. in concrete terms, circumstance albania asymmetrical distribution total asset bank market. the reference banks, since term total assets, bank system share 90 per cent. other non-bank financial institution play insignificant role commercial banks. a far latter concerned, many qualitative bank market, whose presence attractive factor absorb fdi. on hand, concentration asset bank loan commercial bank bear risk create oligopolistic environment bank establish term new loans. such situation would increase investment cost public private sector households, well. though thus far case price manipulation bank exercise dominant position market, i deem necessary promotion vitalization financial market segment general. this market require real commitment efficient intermediation financial resource segments. non-bank financial institution need become active expand activity market segment operate in. with regard bank system, bank albania deem revitalization certain institutions, whose activity share small part bank market, crucial. these institution need become active, take responsibility consistent business plan need find new way organization co-operation order enhance competition provide symmetrical re-distribution bank activity market. bi review 102/2007 3 4) the system’s future challenge some sector economy, agriculture, continue credit low level credit all. the contribution bank loan production investment still low. moreover, consider high share loan commercial purposes, may conclude large share loan use finance imports. the level public access bank system parameter set country’s economic development objectives. furthermore, level cash economy extremely high. all phenomenon push border informality reduce monetary policy efficiency. it financial system’s duty responsibility make effort co-operation bank albania government authority find solution problems. in conclusion i would like say result reform undertaken, albanian bank system, dynamic part financial system, make significant progress last years. this progress result clear vision seriousness show albanian authority reform bank sector, fruitful co-operation authority international financial institution imf world bank design medium-term strategy develop sector further. this progress also result numerous challenge albanian bank system face recent years. it may conclude albanian bank system present safe, sound, constant reformation consolidation process. it go new stage, provide business bank client modern bank services, aim reach western banks’ standards. ¨ with regard aspiration albanian economy strategy employ open foreign investors, believe undertake positive impact country’s macroeconomic, technological institutional area. the bank system’s stage development fdi flow economy mutual influence other. hence, albania attract stable long-term fdi flow follow years, impact development financial system considerable. furthermore, demand bank product domestic foreign company grow. 4 bi review 102/2007 glenn stevens: asia, australia financial markets1address mr glenn stevens, governor reserve bank australia, asia society australasia centre ceo asia update luncheon, sydney, 18 september 2007. * * * a would aware, 2007 10th anniversary asian financial crisis. the crisis usually date begin float thai baht july 1997, though problem build time that. the event 1997 1998 profoundly affect region’s economic growth. in speech early year, i review key event crisis.2 rather go grind today detail, i address question asia cop recent distinct change global financial market conditions, talk event affect australia. i want, then, turn issue future and, particular, interest asia-pacific region ongoing effort renovate post-war official architecture international financial system. recent financial event for number year now, many commentator express concern price risk financial markets, investor increasingly will purchase risky asset high price often considerable leverage. easy credit condition accommodate encourage trends. over past couple months, witness something reversal. the initial trigger deterioration u sub-prime mortgage sector, result decline credit standard slow u house market. since exposure risk spread via securitisation global financial markets, loss bear part world, include australia country asia. those loss come light slowly, however, part complex opaque nature financial instrument use make valuation difficult, even impossible adverse conditions. in cases, simply market for, hence way provide objective valuation of, claim question. in ensue climate uncertainty, investor rapidly become quite risk averse, part global capital market suffer severe dislocation. in turn, institution rely heavily wholesale capital markets, either balance sheet fund securitise asset originated, experience difficulties. so-called conduits, credit arbitrage fund various vehicle often issue short-term commercial paper fund assets. this strategy, case design avoid capital requirement loan hold banks’ balance sheets, carry significant maturity mismatch hence fund risk. when investor attitude change abruptly early august, asset-backed commercial paper market around world virtually come standstill, force many vehicle tap line credit banks. this, course, transfer fund pressure banks. since great deal uncertainty likely demand liquidity, bank conserve liquidity reluctant commit lend others anything beyond 1 i thank vanessa rayner assistance prepare address. 2 see “the asian crisis: a retrospective”, address the anika foundation, 18 july 2007. available http://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2007/index.html. bi review 101/2007 1 short horizon. institutional investors, much powerful position month ago, behave cautiously demand high yield accept bank paper. hence, short-term fund rate move high number countries. in cases, even overnight rate spike sharply higher. change attitude risk also spill markets. the difficulty spread beyond sub-prime mortgage per se include broad range instrument euphemistically label “structured products”. a investor look secure liquid assets, yield government security declined, share price fall significant readjustment exchange rates. volatility across range market increase significantly. so risk re-priced, strategy look like easy way make money good time tested. the episode also reminder key role still play core bank system, despite growth capital markets. bank first line liquidity support capital market stumbled. for time least, flow new credit need do on, remain on, balance sheet core intermediary typically case recent years. it helpful, then, countries, core institution profitable well capitalised, since may quite considerable process re-intermediation undertake month ahead. effect recent development asia there several potential channel event could impact east asia. asian investor could expose underlie problem assets; asian institution market could affect backwash liquidity fund issue major markets; asian economy could affect broad macroeconomic effects. let’s consider channels. at point, disclose exposure asian financial institution u sub-prime mortgage market per se limit look small relative total asset institution concerned. actually, digress moment, holder exposures, loss sufficiently small fatally undermine solvency holder, unless holder leveraged. the big problem thus far exposure large, transparent. the sooner table, sooner uncertainty lessen sooner market participant discriminate sensibly among counterparts. this easy achieve give price issues, moment, widespread suspicion absence clear information. it would damage lack information lead lengthy period severely reduce credit flow perfectly good borrower simply investor cannot tell sound not. more information needed. against backdrop rise global risk aversion increase demand liquidity, investor sell emerge asian equity hold late july, result noticeable fall share prices. asian currency fell. these movement especially large, however, compare numerous others see past couple decades. 2 bi review 101/2007 graph 1 graph 2 asian sovereign debt spread u treasury rise recent weeks, though le spread low-rated american corporate debt. indeed, absolute level sovereign bond yield asia change little. bi review 101/2007 3 graph 3 the sharp increase short-term money market rate develop country seem, yet, widespread feature emerge asian markets. there couple reason this. mortgage lend via securitisation play relatively small role asian house finance markets, mean region’s bank fund warehouse loans.3 this, along fact bank east asia tend rely le offshore wholesale source fund many develop country counterparts, mean unlikely bank much additional fund pressure result tight global credit conditions. in fact, foreign bank claim 1997 crisis country total, ratio gdp, decline substantially past decade. 3 see chan, e., m. davy j. gyntelberg (2006), “the role government-supported house finance agency asia”, bi quarterly review, december. available http://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt0612h.htm. 4 bi review 101/2007 graph 4 the rapid growth witness east asian equity market may pose risk. despite asian region net creditor, net private capital inflow positive past years, partly reflect strong equity inflows. if condition global financial market deteriorate risk aversion become entrenched, always possibility equity capital could flow region reasonably quickly. but asian equity market valuation generally high, solid corporate earn keep p/e ratio despite sharp rise equity price record recent years. more generally, judgement, structural change reform asia’s bank corporate sector past decade leave region good shape decade ago cope potential problem may occur.4 bank balance sheet typically stronger, result improvement quality supervisory oversight risk management practices, reduce fragmentation government ownership bank sector. a range indicator also point healthy corporate sector asia.54 there also generally flexibility exchange rate today. that, combine large build-up foreign exchange reserves, mean capital outflows, occur, could handle effectively past. of course, region could still affect international event trade channel. the ratio export gdp increase asian country past decade. while true intra-regional trade expand great deal, remain case considerable part activity ultimately aim deliver good outside region. so major slowdown u economy would still important east asia, slowdown also extend europe. china grow strongly, help region expand even face weak condition elsewhere. but, chinese authority try slow economy avoid overheating. so, asian nation need ass overall economic fall-out current episode formulate policies. 4 for discussion bank system east asia since crisis, see turner, p. (2007), “are bank system east asia stronger?”, asian economic policy review, 2, pp. 75-95. 5 see pomerleano, m. (2007), “corporate financial restructure asia: implication financial stability”, bi quarterly review, september. available http://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt0709i.pdf. bi review 101/2007 5 in summary, impact recent tighten global credit condition asian financial market has, far, reasonably well contained. in comparison extreme volatility experience financial market asian crisis, recent market movement minor. this surprising, really, give nature shock experience today different decade ago. in 1997, epicentre asia, inability distinguish country result regional contagion. in contrast, shock experience today originate develop world, event u house market catalyst. the relatively less degree international integration asian capital market global system has, instance, probably blessing. it would appear analysis main risk east asian economy lie much area direct financial contagion, ordinary macroeconomic impact of, potentially, slow u world economy. effect recent event australia australian financial market part global financial system, become progressively integrate time. this many benefits, least improve access global capital market australian investor borrowers. by token, major event global markets, australian market expect affected. recent week offer clear demonstration fact. a i note earlier, international commercial paper market difficult time past month. for weeks, outstanding paper able roll over, almost impossible many entity issue new paper. the true residential mortgage-backed securities. some australian entity significantly affect disruptions. the underlie asset quality australia clearly sound. loan could call “sub-prime” australia 1 per cent stock total mortgages, compare around 15 per cent us, arrears rate loan considerably le u sub-prime loans. the security back australian loan continue perform. for house loan portfolio whole, arrears rate remain exceptionally low global standards; securitised loan particular, arrears rate steady, 0.4 per cent, past year half. but time like this, investor often unable, unwilling, discriminate different underlie credit risks. in climate, issuer understandably cautious offer new paper likely high cost involved. in words, uncertainty side lead dry flow fund capital market several weeks. in recent days, encourage sign new credit begin flow again. but condition still difficult may remain case yet. in meantime, sort pressure term fund cost financial intermediary observe elsewhere see australia. international interbank rate three month a$ loan recently 50-60 basis point overnight index swap (ois) rate (a measure expect cash rate). the normal margin around 10 basis points. bank bill rate australia much 40-50 basis point ois, compare 5-10 basis point normally. these gap small see comparable country nonetheless significant. 6 bi review 101/2007 graph 5 it important note due shortage overnight liquidity. the system amply supply settlement balance are, fact, much high normal. the rba supply much cash market require cash rate remain level set board, rate indeed remain within couple basis point target throughout. other rate determined, always been, market condition base participants’ expectation cash rate might move well term, liquidity credit premia. sometimes, now, premia know move. it go without say loan rate decide intermediary make loan basis costs, risk assessment competitive considerations. the rba set rates, though take account margin rate cash rate alters. a market work re-price risk individual participant grapple uncertainty possible future liquidity needs, lend borrow keep short term. the rba act assist market function extend pool acceptable security repurchase agreements. the intention give market player additional confidence quality asset turn cash needed, get job re-pricing risk. from point view, mean accept little private credit risk operations, move direction anyway years, reason long sufficiently large stock government security issue market participant could transact volume. provide transaction conduct proper commercial term appropriate margins, judge credit risk manageable. help financial market function undergo re-pricing is, course, one role central bank. but also important lose sight role, make monetary policy pursuit sustainable growth price stability. from perspective, observe fund cost intermediary rise beyond adjustment associate rise cash rate 8 august. some borrower ask recognise high cost rate pay loans, trend continue high fund cost persist. hence appears, stage least, may well observe tighten financial condition australian economy month ahead. bi review 101/2007 7 in assess prospect, bank need take note two forces. the first that, go episode, economy travel strongly, outlook growth inflation revise high recent months. the data since august decision lift cash rate indicate economy least strong board’s assessment time, sign momentum slowing. the second factor outlook u economy weaken presumably affect extent credit market event themselves. it conceivable european economy could affect well, give credit difficulty markets. to extent, global growth, continually surprise strength recent years, could, thing equal, turn bite weak expect month ago. give macroeconomic situation australian economy thus far, additional restraint would perhaps unwelcome. but much restraint occur result market tighten credit condition yet clear. assessment much warrant could affect change international environment well development domestic economy. these matter board need grapple period ahead. asia-pacific international financial system i turn away recent events, absorb are, offer observation asia-pacific region international financial system long run. it commonly observe “centre gravity” global economy shift east, away atlantic towards asia – which, purpose, define include india. there naturally discussion best recognise great importance asia “architecture” international system, include official institutions. some initial progress make small increase quota allocation imf four emerge countries, two asia, late last year. the much hard task find agreement far-reaching change long timeframe way. that important work. but point i would like offer following. in parallel effort reform governance international institutions, need effort find agreement mandate question – is, want imf body actually do, do. it suffice asia (or region emerge world) expect say institution govern without part clear consensus use increase influence. what vision imf’s role? what limit role? those ultimately cede current influence accommodate develop country surely reluctant unless clear mutual understand sort questions. asia must prepare contribute discussion. this require meaningful engagement key issue as: • different national policies, include exchange rate regimes, make co-exist within international system? • respective responsibility various nation foster compatibility? • proper role imf supra-national bodies, occasional lender individual nations, custodian international system time? 8 bi review 101/2007 the recent “review” “1977 exchange rate decision” imf start discussion. it revise agree set word 30 year ago form up-to-date basis guidance imf member exchange rate policies, provide framework surveillance imf membership policies. this good start, start. the key way surveillance actually implemented. that hand imf’s staff management also membership. the membership region need ready play part. by i mean country asia need ready defend policy robustly, also work others understand mitigate unintended consequence policy choices. asian country should, course, expect regions. it worth add that, fora, asian country potentially strong voice coalesce. in g-20, example, china, india, indonesia, japan korea table, australia. if group country could speak unite way issue key mutual interest, would powerful force globally significant group. it easy find common position, course, possible issues. we need look europe – continent work long time – see national difference frequently limit collective regional influence. but extent asian country agree things, potential quite influential. conclusion recent event put financial system test around world. for year people worry so-called “global imbalances” lead trouble asian investor might refuse buy dollars. others fear sort repeat 1997-style “sudden stop” crisis emerge world. but, fact, domestically generate credit event world’s sophisticate economy, unite states, trigger recent reappraisal risk. the result financial strain acute developed, rather develop world. this episode may time run. but sooner exposure problem asset account disclosed, sooner market get back price risk prudently provide credit sensible commercial terms. at present, without enough information, operate impossibly short timeframe, fear tomorrow might bring. asian country appear, date, weather storm fairly well, australia view. but episode remind u importance work improve resilience domestic financial system policy frameworks, task, yet uncompleted, build good international arrangement future. bi review 101/2007 9 kemal kozarić:

crise du marché américain de prêts immobiliers subprime et son impact potentiel sur l’europe ont suscité beaucoup d’intérêt au cours de dernières semaines. je souhaiterais tout d’abord vous fournir de plus amples information sur le intervention de la bce en réaction à la forte volatilité enregistrée sur le marchés financiers. en second lieu, j’évoquerai brièvement la situation économique et monétaire et reviendrai plus en détail sur le raisons sous-jacentes à no récentes décisions de taux. zum abschluss möchte ich einige vorläufige schlussfolgerungen au sicht d finanzmarktstabilität ziehen. *** let begin provide information recent event financial market ecb’s interventions. in july early august, crisis so-called u sub-prime mortgage market intensify appetite global investor risky asset declined. market volatility increase asset classes. stock price decline government bond benefit safe-haven investment flows. in context, several investment fund hold asset-backed security suspend withdrawals. a number european bank admit direct indirect exposure u mortgage market. yet important remark credit loss significant enough materially impact soundness core financial institutions. initially, impact felt u dollar money market, domestic international bank raise short-term liquidity order cope liquidity need number “special vehicles” “conduits” difficulty refinance commercial paper market. on thursday morning 9th august, tension also spread euro money market. these unprecedented circumstance call commensurate actions. therefore, ecb inject additional liquidity money market order restore orderly conditions. let briefly describe operation detail. our first operation carry 9 august mature follow day. it non-regular overnight operation ecb provide liquidity bank fix rate 4.00 percent, level key policy rate. this liquidity provide so-called reverse repurchase agreements. these transaction whereby ecb purchase give amount eligible asset understand repurchase counterparty give price follow day. we pre-announced would fulfil 100 percent bid submit banks. this allow u gauge amount exceptional liquidity need bank system whole contribute calm overnight money market circumstances. a result operation, calm short-term money market restore rest day. during follow three business days, ecb conduct similar overnight liquidity-providing operation variable rate tender minimum bid rate 4.00 percent. in case variable rate tenders, counterparties ask indicate desire amount money interest rate wish obtain it. the eurosystem satisfy first bid high interest rates. the use variable rate bi review 100/2007 1 subsequent overnight liquidity-providing operation line usual practice. thank operations, day 9 14 august ecb provide additional euro liquidity need bank system normal circumstance. it roll progressively small amount day, rate amount bid bank tender become progressively lower. on 14 august, first tuesday follow start tension money market, ecb resort standard instrument market operations, namely one-week main refinance operation usually allot tuesdays. with view ensure orderly condition money markets, ecb allot significantly large amount liquidity would normal circumstances. the approach adopt subsequent one-week main refinance operation 21 28 august 4 september. thank relatively generous allotment, money market rate maturity one week bring back usual levels. however, tension remain money market rate maturity one week. in order support normalisation money market segment, ecb decide implement two supplementary longer-term refinance operations, first decision take 21 august second 6 september, usual maturity three months. in prepare decide upon various operations, eurosystem remained, usual, close contact central banks, include particular, exclusively, federal reserve, bank japan, bank england, bank canada swiss national bank. these central bank also take steps, within parameter operational framework. when compare step take various central banks, important take account difference operational frameworks. in case, important stress eurosystem show capacity react promptly effectively challenges. i convince that, give circumstances, right thing right level right time. monetary policy stance through liquidity operations, ecb fulfil one key responsibilities, namely ensure orderly function money market. i turn primary objective, namely deliver price stability medium term credible delivery price stability medium long term. i would like emphasize primary mandate call monetary policy stance deliver price stability medium term. once level interest rate decide responsibility ensure smooth function segment money market influence. the two responsibility clearly separate mixed. on 6 september govern council decide leave key ecb interest rate unchanged. the incoming macroeconomic data confirm risk price stability remain upside medium term, identify economic monetary analysis. the incoming macroeconomic data also confirm strong fundamental euro area economy support favourable medium-term outlook real gdp growth. data activity third quarter – various confidence survey indicator-based estimate – remain overall favourable. the late data unemployment indicate improve labour market condition global economic activity expect remain robust, likely slowdown unite state expect largely offset continue strong growth emerge markets. this outlook also reflect september 2007 ecb staff macroeconomic projection euro area, foresee average annual real gdp growth range 2.2% 2.8% 2007, 1.8% 2.8% 2008. the monetary analysis confirm prevail upside risk price stability medium longer-term horizons. on basis late available data, cover period end 2 bi review 100/2007 july, underlie rate monetary credit expansion remain strong. this reflect rapid growth broad monetary aggregate, m3 strength mfi loan private sector, continue increase double-digit rate annual basis. against background, monetary policy stance still accommodative side with, inter alia, money credit growth vigorous euro area. at time, financial market volatility reappraisal risk recent week lead increase uncertainty. give current high level uncertainty, govern council deem appropriate gather additional information carefully examine new data, draw monetary policy conclusions. accordingly, govern council monitor closely developments. on basis assessment, act firm timely manner, ensure risk price stability medium term materialise inflation expectation firmly anchor line price stability, even important current context financial market volatility increase uncertainty. in respect, govern council continue pay great attention future financial market developments. financial stability i would like conclude introductory remark draw tentative lesson financial stability supervision episode. let first qualify see current situation. we experience market correction significant reappraisal risk, possibility warn quite time. i recall appearance elsewhere, i say diagnose level risk appreciation global financial market signal under-appreciation risk general. this illustrate particular, exclusively, relatively low level spreads, low level risk premia low level volatility across wide range financial markets. in first issue ecb financial stability review publish december 2004 say high level risk appetite encourage search yield among investor across wide range market asset classes. this phenomenon go several year together significant degree innovation creativity global financial market improve financial efficiency also create new source risk. a i say correction phase can, frequently observe situations, comprehend episode hectic behaviour, high level market volatility element over-shooting. we see distinct possibility ongoing deterioration creditworthiness borrower u sub-prime mortgage market could trigger broad-based market correction. we say financial stability review publish recently last june. the important channel propagation correction turn maturity mismatch and, therefore, strain place balance sheet special purpose vehicle conduit fund medium-term position asset back security – sub-prime mortgage important element – short-term finance commercial papers. it difficulty vehicle face roll short-term fund create much strain saw money markets. now, i know particularly interest lesson draw present episode. a yet end it, i would say stage must prudent draw definitive conclusions. that said, i believe number area know lesson draw international community orientation appropriate improvement seen. first, past decade, experience tremendous increase sophistication financial instruments. while positive effect innovation bi review 100/2007 3 allow market participant good share risk, negative aspect clearly highlight ongoing episode. in particular, degree complexity product design purpose re-packaging sell debt instrument become overwhelming. although i would hesitant impose limitation creativity market participant pursuit innovation enhance efficiency financial markets, view, instrument structure cannot fully understand even bear ultimate responsibility level risk take

briefing, makati city, 12 september 2007. * * * i. the current economic constellation both domestic international business community affirm philippine experience stable macroeconomic environment decade. the inflation rate low stable, outlook inflation benign. this allow monetary authority maintain interest rate low stable level also. our balance payment remain surplus, bolster current account, also surplus, fact four (4) consecutive year now. we build international reserve record-high $30.3 billion, adequate cover short-term liquidity requirements. our strong external position enable bsp ng prepay foreign debt amount us$ 2.1 billion 2006 another $0.9 billion first half 2007. these markedly improve external debt ratios. include payment prepayment full country’s outstanding obligation imf december 2006, milestone philippines’ relationship imf since effectively end country’s use imf resource nearly four half decades. our bank system grow double digit rate asset size deposit base, improve profitability continue capitalize well-above international standards. investor attention response current constellation economic data significantly positive evidence follow developments, particularly first half year: • the stock market reach seven-year high • the peso appreciate account strong export earn sustain overseas remittances. • our sovereign credit spread compressed. • yield domestic security fell record lows. the questions, however, may mind are: can gain sustained? will economic momentum able weather recent domestic global market adjustment volatilities? my quick answer yes. our macroeconomic fundamental sound. because underlie fundamental result fiscal, macroeconomic, bank financial sector reform undertake vigorously continue pursued, i believe resilient therefore le vulnerable domestic external uncertainties. ii. the challenge monetary policy formulation on part bsp, formulate monetary policy assessment global domestic economic issue developments. bi review 100/2007 1 we mindful range circumstance recent time draw important challenge philippine monetary policy. plentiful global liquidity. the strong foreign exchange inflow

policy, complement liberalization foreign exchange regulation allow great access foreign exchange outward investments. we already put “first wave” fx liberalization measures, “second wave” implement end year. third, continue undertake step strengthen domestic financial system help manage risk attendant financial market developments. in bank sector, focus good governance, asset-clean up, capital build-up industry consolidation. we want see stronger, well-governed, better-capitalized bank would effective channel monetary policy. in words, stable financial institution perform intermediation

board governor u federal reserve system, bundesbank lecture, berlin, 11 september 2007. the original speech, contain various link document mentioned, find u federal reserve system’s website. * * * in speech give march 2005 (bernanke, 2005), i discuss number important interrelate development global economy, include substantial expansion current account deficit unite states, equally impressive rise current account surplus many emerging-market economies, worldwide decline long-term real interest rates. i argue development could explained, part, emergence global save glut, drive transformation many emerging-market economy – notably, rapidly grow east asian economy oil-producing country – net borrower large net lender international capital markets. today i review development provide update. i also consider policy implication prospect future. a principal theme early remark satisfy explanation development u.s. current account cannot focus development within unite state alone. rather, understand development evaluate potential policy response require global perspective. i continue take perspective remark today emphasize particular change desire save investment give region, effect global capital flows, may affect saving, investment, external balance country around world. the origin global save glut, 1996-2004 i begin review origin development global save glut period 1996-2004, discuss early speech, turn more-recent developments. a well known, u.s. current account deficit expand sharply latter part 1990s first half present decade. in 1996, u.s. deficit $125 billion, 1.6 percent u.s. gross domestic product (gdp); 2004, grow $640 billion, 5.5 percent gdp.1 national income account identity imply current account deficit equal excess domestic investment capital goods, include housing, domestic saving, include save households, firms, governments. the proximate cause increase u.s. external deficit decline u.s. saving; 1996 2004, investment rate unite state remain almost unchanged 19 percent gdp, whereas save rate decline 16-1/2 percent slightly le 14 percent gdp.2 domestic investment fund domestic save must finance 1 the shift almost wholly attributable similar expansion trade deficit. the balance investment income actually improve period. 2 more precisely, investment grow 19.0 percent 19.3 percent gdp, save decline 16.5 percent 13.8 percent gdp, net change investment le save 3.0 percent gdp. a imply data note early paragraph, net change u.s. current account deficit period 3.9 percent gdp. in principle, change excess investment save change current account deficit same. the difference two figure account bi review 99/2007 1 capital flow abroad, and, indeed, large increase u.s. current account deficit match similar expansion net capital inflows. globally, national current account deficit surplus must balance out, deficit country raise fund international capital market extent (surplus) country provide funds. accordingly, surprise widen u.s. current account deficit associate increase current account surplus rest world. what surprising, however, light historical patterns, much increase current account surplus period take place develop country rather industrial countries.3 the table show current account balance various country region select years. the aggregate current account balance industrial country unite state increase 1996 2004, bite le $200 billion, much rise account increase japan's current account balance; aggregate balance euro area rise slightly.4 in comparison, aggregate current account position develop country swing deficit $80 billion 1996 surplus roughly $300 billion 2004, net move toward surplus $380 billion. in aggregate, shift deficit surplus current account emerging-market world period largely reflect increase save share output rather decline rate capital investment. however, change save investment pattern vary country regions. for example, country develop asia exclude china, $150 billion swing toward external surplus 1996 2004 attributable decline domestic investment. in china, rate save investment rose, save rate rise more, lead increase country's current account surplus $60 billion. outside develop asia, oil exporter middle east former soviet union also important contributor large increase emerging-market current account balances. the combine current account two region increase surplus $20 billion 1996 surplus $162 billion 2004, increase $140 billion. this rise largely reflect high save rates, domestic consumption fell behind surge oil revenues. among emerging-market economies, high save also account increase aggregate current account balance latin america. of course, emerging-market country switch net borrower net lenders, begin pay international debt acquire asset industrial countries. statistical discrepancies, within national income product account (nipa) balance payment definition nipa definition certain international transactions. 3 i use term "emerging-market" "developing" interchangeably. 4 a show table, surplus industrial country unite state increase $150 billion nearly $350 billion period, japanese external balance rise $66 billion $172 billion. the increase japanese current account balance share gdp, 1.4 percent 3.7 percent, occur despite substantial fall gdp share save rate, 30.4 percent 26.8 percent, gdp share investment rate fell even dramatically, 28.9 percent 23.0 percent. for euro area whole, current account balance remain 1 percent gdp 1996 2004, aggregate investment save ratio remain largely unchanged. within euro area, germany's current account balance increase almost 5 percentage point gdp – -0.6 percent 1996 4.3 percent 2004 – save move investment decreased. however, development offset decline balance euro-area countries, include france, italy, spain; decrease mostly associate high investment rates. data saving, investment, current account balance country unite state draw primarily international monetary fund, world economic outlook database, april 2007 (www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2007/01/data/index.aspx); cases, data draw national sources. 2 bi review 99/2007 i note expansion u.s. current account deficit associate increase current account surplus abroad 1996-2004 period. a third key development period sustain decline long-term real interest rate many part world. for example, real yield ten-year inflation-indexed u.s. treasury security average 4 percent 1999 le 2 percent 2004. the difference nominal long-term treasury yield trail twelve-month rate consumer price inflation, another measure u.s. real interest rate, show similar pattern, fall 3.5 percent 1996 1.5 percent 2004. similar movement observe industrial countries: in unite kingdom, real yield inflation-indexed government bond fell average 3.6 percent 1996 2 percent 2004; canada, analogous figure 4.6 percent 1996 2.3 percent 2004. real interest rate measure difference government bond yield consumer inflation also fell germany, sweden, switzerland. however, japan, real interest rate remain low throughout period. in sum, consider 1996-2004 period, three fact explain: (1) substantial increase u.s. current account deficit, (2) swing moderate deficit large surplus emerging-market countries, (3) significant decline long-term real interest rates. many observer focus expansion u.s. current account deficit isolation argue due largely domestic factors, particularly decline public private save rates. but account identity assure u movement current account must involve change realize save rate relative investment rates. the question issue, therefore, whether decline realize save rate unite state reflect decline desire save instead response other, possibly external, economic developments. or, textbook terms, fall realize save rate unite state reflect shift demand save give interest rate (a shift save schedule) decline save induce change interest rate (a movement along save schedule)? in fact, obvious reason desire save rate unite state fall precipitously 1996-2004 period.5 indeed, federal budget deficit, oft-cited source decline u.s. saving, actually surplus 1998-2001 period even current account deficit widening. moreover, downward shift u.s. desire save rate, else equal, lead great pressure economic resource thus increases, decreases, real interest rates. a i discus later, normative viewpoint, good reason believe u.s. save rate high is. nonetheless, domestic factor alone seem account large deterioration u.s. external balance. in early speech, i put forth alternative explanation consistent three basic fact i list earlier. that explanation take key drive force large increase net desire save (that is, desire save le desire domestic investment) emerging-market oil-producing economies, change transform country modest net demander substantial net supplier fund international capital markets. this large increase net supply financial capital source outside industrial country what, early remarks, i call global save glut. to interpret rise net save emerging-market country causal, need identify factor country may cause desire save rise, desire 5 during first part period, rise u.s. productivity high stock price likely contribute u.s. current account deficit increase desire investment reduce desire saving. however, increase stock price may endogenous result factor discuss later, case effect stock market investment dissipate 2004. finally, note text, drive force behind change external balance decline desire save unite states, world real interest rate would rise rather fallen. bi review 99/2007 3 investment fall, both. in fact, several factor appear contribute increase supply net save emerging-market countries. first, financial crisis hit many asian economy 1990s lead significant decline investment country (in part reduce confidence domestic financial institutions) change policy – include resistance currency appreciation, determine accumulation foreign exchange reserves, fiscal consolidation – effect promote current account surpluses. second, sharp increase crude oil price boost oil exporters' income country able will increase spending, thereby lead high save current account surpluses. finally, chinese save rate rise rapidly (by even investment rates); rise save was, perhaps, result strong growth income midst underdevelop financial sector weak social safety net increase motivation precautionary saving. the combine effect developments, i argued, raise desire save relative desire investment emerge markets, turn lead current account surplus countries. but world whole, total save must equal investment, sum national current account balance must zero. accordingly, industrial economies, realize save rate fall relative investment, current account deficit emerge counterpart develop countries' surpluses. this adjustment could achieve decline real interest rate (as well increase asset prices), observed. the effect particularly large unite states, perhaps high productivity growth deep capital market country particularly attractive foreign capital. the global save glut hypothesis thus consistent three key fact i note earlier. to sure, global save glut factor behind decline long-term real interest rate since 1990s. a i describe subsequent remark (bernanke, 2006), term premium also decline period reason debate may include perceive reduction uncertainty regard inflation real economy well increase demand longer-term security various institutional investors, include pension fund foreign central banks. change global pattern save investment surely play important role decline long-term rates, however. recent development i turn review development since i last speak issue two half year ago. in brief, external imbalance become wide since 2004. both geographical pattern imbalance source term save investment rate change bit. nevertheless, broad configuration develop 1996 still seem place today. a table shows, u.s. current account deficit widen past two years, $640 billion 2004 (5.5 percent gdp) $812 billion 2006 (6.2 percent gdp), although fell bite first quarter year, $770 billion annual rate. in account sense, increase u.s. deficit period reflect primarily increase investment rate 19 percent gdp 2004 20 percent gdp 2006. the u.s. national save rate change significantly period. meanwhile, aggregate current account surplus emerging-market economy expand $350 billion, $297 billion 2004 $643 billion 2006; almost increase attributable high aggregate rate saving. a significant portion growth due china, whose current account surplus swell additional $180 billion, rise 3.6 percent national output 2004 9.4 percent 2006. the increase chinese surplus attribute primarily increase save rate 2004 2006. the increase china's save rate could, part, consequence rapid pace growth country. that is, income grow rapidly, consumer credit readily available precautionary motif save remain strong, 4 bi review 99/2007 consumption fail catch up.6 also contribute high save rate authorities' decision limit currency appreciation, thereby restrain import demand boost exports. oil exporter also contribute significantly recent increase aggregate current account balance develop countries. the combine current account balance country middle east former soviet union (which include number large oil exporters) rise $150 billion 2004 2006. again, increase almost entirely reflect high save rates, oil exporter continue save large portion increase revenue result high oil prices. in contrast situation emerge markets, aggregate current account surplus industrial country unite state decline recently, almost $350 billion 2004 $200 billion 2006; decline reflect sharp drop euro-area balance. thus, unlike 1996-2004 period, industrial country unite state absorb part increase net supply capital come emerging-market economies. in aggregate, recent decline current account balance non-u.s. industrial economy reflect increase investment rates; save rate generally remain little changed.7 in short, emerge markets, realize save current account surplus increase since 2004. in industrial countries, period, current account move deficit, primarily high realize rate investment. what real interest rates? since i discuss issue march 2005, real interest rate reverse previous declines. for example, unite states, real yield inflation-indexed government debt average 2.3 percent 2006 compare 1.85 percent 2004. in past weeks, yield average 2.4 percent. inflation-adjusted yield industrial country also start move back fall 2005.8 how fit together? my read recent development although detail changed, fundamental element global save glut remain place. most important, emerging-market country oil producer remain large net supplier financial capital global markets. the mix supplier fund factor motivate supply change bit: china oil exporter account large share develop countries' aggregate surplus, develop asia exclude china account somewhat less. also, expansion region's net supply save past two year appear reflect primarily increase desire save emerging-market countries, whereas previous increase net save also involve decline desire investment east asia financial crisis 1990s. exchange rate policy asia also influence desire save region. 6 the combine current account balance develop asia exclude china narrow bite share gdp 2004 2006, investment rate edge save rate little changed. nevertheless, investment rate region still remain substantially 1996 levels. 7 the combine current account balance euro area move surplus $115 billion 2004 deficit $10 billion 2006, largely increase aggregate investment rate. large decline balance france, italy, spain offset high surplus balance germany. for euro area whole, movement deficit largely reflect increase euro-area investment rate 20 percent gdp 2004 21 percent gdp 2006. japan's current account surplus almost unchanged around $170 billion 2004 2006, increase rate investment match high save rate. 8 inflation-adjusted bond unite kingdom yield 2.19 percent, average, july 2007 compare yield 1.65 percent, average, july 2005. in canada, yield inflation-adjusted bond move 1.76 percent july 2005 2.18 percent july 2007. real interest rates, calculate government bond yield minus twelve-month inflation rates, also move since 2005 germany, sweden, switzerland. bi review 99/2007 5 further increase net capital flow develop economies, else equal, depress real interest rate around world. but i noted, past years, real interest rate move bit. this increase imply global save glut dissipated. however, suggest that, margin, desire investment net desire save must rise industrial country enough offset increase desire save emerging-market countries. this characterization certainly consistent pickup investment rate industrial countries, i note earlier, also consistent, generally, recovery domestic demand growth europe, japan, part industrial world. in summary, economic growth past years, especially industrial countries, apparently sufficient increase net demand save thus raise global real interest rate somewhat. once again, however, i want rely exclusively line explanation behavior long-term real interest rates, factor doubt relevant. in particular, term premium appear recently rise may unsustainably low levels, part great recent volatility financial market investors' demand increase compensation risk-taking. be current account imbalance problem? this analysis source global imbalance address critical normative question: be current account imbalance see today problem? not everyone would agree are, several reasons. first, external imbalance significant extent market phenomenon and, case u.s. deficit, reflect attractiveness u.s. economy overall depth, liquidity, legal safeguard associate capital markets.9 of course, foreign government intervene foreign exchange market invest proceed u.s. capital markets, likely lead great imbalance would otherwise exist. but supply capital foreign government large foreign private investors. from 1998 2001, even u.s. current account deficit widen substantially, official capital flow unite state quite small. during year 2002 2006, net official capital inflow pick substantially still correspond le half (47 percent) u.s. current account deficit period. on gross basis, period, private foreign inflow three time official capital flows.10 moreover, even public investor motivate extent attraction u.s. economy u.s. capital markets. second, current account imbalance help reduce tendency toward recession, one hand, overheat inflation, other.11 during late 1990s, example, develop asian economy experience financial crisis consequent collapse domestic investment benefit able run trade surpluses, help strengthen aggregate demand employment. during period, trade deficit run unite state allow domestic demand grow strongly without create significant inflationary pressures. until year ago, euro area grow slowly 9 an interest vein recent research suggest one reason develop country seek run current account surplus finance acquisition high-quality asset cannot produce economies. refer caballero, farhi, gourinchas (2006) mendoza, quadrini, rios-rull (2007). 10 during 2002-06, gross foreign official inflow total $1,491 billion; net official inflow slightly less, u.s. official outflow negligible. private foreign inflow net private u.s. outflow total $1,659 billion period; gross foreign private inflow $4,697 billion. 11 another way make point current account balance surplus give country flexibility spend le current output, dictate economic condition needs. 6 bi review 99/2007 thus also benefit run trade surpluses; recently, domestic demand europe recovered, trade surplus declined. third, although u.s. current account deficit certainly sustainable current level, u.s. liability foreigner not, point, put exceptionally large burden american economy. the net international investment position (niip) unite states, although substantial negative 19 percent gdp, still small negative niip several industrial economies. a fraction net household wealth, total almost $56 trillion 2006, negative niip even small – le 5 percent. moreover, u.s. investment income balance, essentially represent debt service niip, remain positive, least now. thus, even year current account deficit correspond increase net liabilities, unite state continue earn foreign investment pay foreign liabilities. and, best tell, share u.s. asset foreign portfolio seem excessive relative importance unite state global economy. all said, current pattern external imbalance – export capital develop country industrial economies, particularly unite state – may prove counterproductive long term. i note reason concern early speech, remain relevant today. first, unite state industrial economy face prospect age population workforce grow slowly. these trend enhance need save (to support future retirees) may reduce incentive invest (because workforce eventually shrink). if unite state save more, one likely outcome would reduction u.s. current account deficit rate country add liability rest world. second, large u.s. current account deficit cannot persist indefinitely ability unite state make debt service payment willingness foreigner hold u.s. asset portfolio limited. adjustment must eventually take place, process adjustment real financial consequences. for example, unite states, growth export-oriented sector manufacture restrain shift relative price foreign demand associate u.s. trade deficit. ultimately, necessary reduction trade current account deficit entail shift resource sector produce nontraded good service produce tradables. the great need adjustment, potentially disruptive costly shift may be. similarly, external adjustment china surplus country involve shift resource export sector industry gear toward meet domestic consumption needs; necessary shift, too, likely le disruptive occur early thus le rapidly small scale. on financial side, u.s. current account deficit persist near current levels, foreign investor would ultimately become satiate dollar assets, finance deficit reasonable cost would become difficult. early reduction global imbalance would reduce potential strain associate finance large quantity international liability likely allow smooth adjustment financial markets. finally, long term, develop world recipient, provider, financial capital. because develop country tend high ratio labor capital away technological frontier, potential return investment country high. thus, capital flow toward country benefit country provide capital. prospect reduce external imbalance what prospect gradual orderly rebalancing spend external account around world? the brief answer sign progress appear bi review 99/2007 7 country begin undertake policy change ultimately needed. recently, pickup economic growth outside unite states, together change real exchange rate relative prices, assist process current account adjustment. notably, 2006, foreign growth help u.s. real export good service grow 9.3 percent, export capital good rise 10.8 percent. some gain foreign growth cyclical, due economic reform (in industrial non-industrial countries) thus may persistent. overall, see modest indication improvement u.s. external balance recently. for example, non-oil trade deficit decline modestly, 3.7 percent u.s. gdp 2004 3.5 percent gdp 2006. in addition, 2006, net export make positive contribution u.s. real gdp growth, first year happen since 1995. net export also contribute u.s. growth first half 2007. a well known, however, progress u.s. current account seem unlikely without significant increase public private save unite states. the u.s. federal budget deficit decline recently officially project improve next years. unfortunately, i noted, unite state already reach lead edge major demographic change result old population slowly grow workforce. a major effort increase public private save need prepare economic consequence demographic transition address external imbalances. a global perspective make clear, reduction u.s. current account deficit also require effort part surplus country reduce excess desire save desire investment. over long term, current account surplus emerging-market country seem likely narrow domestic spend catch income. economic policy country assist process. for example, oil exporter collectively save much windfall arise high crude price recent years; spend future develop diversify domestic economies. china officially recognize need increase domestic spend scale back reliance exports. measure could help achieve goal include reform financial sector; increase government spend infrastructure, environmental improvement, social safety net; currency appreciation. in east asia exclude china, continue effort strengthen deepen bank sector financial market would help domestic investment recover linger effect financial crisis 1990s. in cases, indicate policy would reduce global imbalances. moreover, u.s. save efforts, action would convey important economic benefit country undertake even current account balance issue. what implication would gradual rebalancing long-term real interest rates? the logic global save glut suggest that, glut dissipate next decade thereby reduce net supply financial capital emerging-market countries, real interest rate rise – tendency seem likely partly offset increase save industrial countries. however, factor saving-investment balance affect long-term interest rates, include relative supply of, demand for, long-term security change require compensation risk embed term premiums. moreover, distant one-year forward interest rate remain low, indication market currently expect much change global balance desire save investment expect effect change offset developments. accordingly, remind need maintain appropriate humility forecast return asset prices. 8 bi review 99/2007 current account balance (billions u.s. dollars) country region 1996 2000 2004

address professor stanley fischer, governor bank israel, conference association banks, tel aviv, 25 december 2007. * * * today i first speak state economy israel, bank system important part economy; i talk bank israel’s activity regard competition bank system; finally i turn basel ii. 1. the state economy israel’s economy good situation, growth year expect 5.4 percent, even slightly higher. export rise rapidly, current account balance payment show surplus 4 percent gdp, debt/gdp ratio fall 82 percent gdp, compare 102 percent 2003, strong inflow foreign investment israel continuing, unemployment declining, accord quarterly figure already reach 7.3 percent, 11 percent 2003, rate participation labor market rising, price stability maintained, financial economic stability preserved. at present time, inflation rate slightly high upper bind target range, expect return target around middle next year. the bank israel, part, make every effort ensure outcome. the auspicious state economy reflect oecd’s invitation israel start process join organization, improve credit rat grant israel, agreement u government continue provide u loan guarantees, report imf delegation visit israel month. nevertheless, future look le rosy: appear financial crisis u europe become severe. the central bank search right tool deal problem liquidity, result difficulty financial market gap central banks’ interest rate market rate widening. the first sign fruit central banks’ effort become visible. if continues, interest rate gap become reasonable, even problem collapse u house market implication economy remain. till evidence slowdown u economy. however, slowdown expected, financial crisis likely exacerbate situation. israel’s bank hardly expose situation develop international financial markets. nevertheless, israel’s interest spread widened, serious slowdown u occurs, bind affect israel’s economy too. the intensity potential impact israel depend us. therefore, imperative government continue observe fiscal discipline, bank israel continue maintain price stability support financial stability, bank continue prudent, particularly cautious risk management. if fulfill function properly, concurrently business sector continue display enterprise thrive, able continue grow good pace, even background economic slowdown advance economies. in context strategy, chance achieve main objective economic policy improve – convert high rate growth sustainable growth. such growth vital future country, society, economy. growth already improve standard live whole population israel strata. a result, rise poverty rate halt 2006, base relative measure poverty (which relate bi review 151/2007 1 mainly income differentials); base absolute measure poverty (with relate ability purchase basket basic goods), poverty actually decline 2005 2006. in addition, unemployment fall peak 2003 educational levels, include lowest, rate participation labor market rise part country, include outlying ones, rate employment israeli average real wage rise industries, include low-technology ones. 2. the israeli bank what mean israel’s banks? it clear economic buoyancy affect banks. the financial position bank israel improve last years, regard profits, capital ratio, drop proportion problem loans. israel’s economy need bank system remain strong robust. however, correct management contribute success – improve economic situation also play part. therefore, i repeat message i deliver address last year (it sound good yiddish): “bad loan make good times.” this important thing say time particularly present time, view expectation growth slowdown global economy and, especially, u economy, 2008. on point, important aspect process bank currently engaged, support supervisor bank – raise capital ratio. this process follow completion. before i turn subject competition bank system, i would like emphasize one especially important point. the bank recently subject wave attack name competition customers’ wellbeing, i level criticism regard one aspect, bank fees. sometimes bank take step seem invite attacks, must extremely careful. a strong stable bank system, i already stated, vital robustness economy, must weaken it. although nearly propose legislation regard bank purport protect depositors, certain case would harm bank desire entity act competitor banks, final analysis, depositor themselves. it thus essential initiative concern bank system undertake full cooperation bank supervision. 3. competition bank system competition bank system focus attention bank israel among public many years. there reasonable degree competition area bank service business sector, bachar committee deal competition credit capital markets. this year bank fee focus great deal attention. the bank supervision department deeply involve subject year. firstly, supervisor banks, together knesset economics committee, successfully promote bank fee law. follow that, bank supervision department, invest great deal effort, draw new schedule bank fee household small businesses. the new schedule standard banks, contain 68 fees, still small number, significantly few 198 fee currently listed. the new schedule make easy customer know much pay, what. this enable customer compare fee charge different banks, decide offer cheap rate services. we hope degree competition increase long supervise bank fees. the best supervision exercise consumer markets. 2 bi review 151/2007 in addition work invest subject bank fees, bank israel also busy many aspect increase level competition long term bank service household small businesses. the underlie approach topic create source competition within bank system also outside it. the aim offer israeli consumer alternative certain service currently provide banks. in area require cooperation institutions, ministry finance (and specifically commissioner capital market, insurance savings), ministry justice, security authority, tel aviv stock exchange, anti-trust authority, government company authority. what main potential source competition bank system without? 1. money market funds. these likely compete short-term local-currency deposit banks. we hope due course able offer additional cash management services, draw checks. 2. commercial paper. these likely compete short-term local-currency deposit banks. 3. repo-type transactions. these likely compete short-term bank credit. 4. securitization. this contribute general development credit market, include nonbank credit. 5. a platform online distribution mutual funds. this may compete bank distribution mutual funds. in addition above, possible source competition within bank system: 1. simplification switch bank bank. this important step encourage competition within bank system, several significant measure already introduce bank supervision department: bank need provide customer relevant information customer close account process switch bank simplified; transfer account handle bank customer moving; customer possibility transfer activities; cost transfer another bank reduced. the bank supervision department intend tighten enforcement directive regard increase customers’ awareness it. the power supervise bank fee also enable step take necessary reduce cost switch banks. 2. increase transparency bank activity customers. the bank supervision department intend take step towards uniformity simplification report customer bank credit-card activities, provision information give bank service customer commit him/herself sign contract the new fee schedule important move direction. 3. increase chance bank enter bank system. the bank israel, great choice face customers, great competition. on point trade-off number bank system—the banks, competition – one hand, efficiency robustness, other, latter certainly relevant consideration supervisory authority this trade-off focal consideration come decision merger banks. bi review 151/2007 3 the bank supervision department already take step remove barrier increase chance internet bank operate israel, advance privatization postal bank regularize bank activity, bring entry foreign bank field retail bank israel. all which, without waive consideration banking-system stability. here important stress follow two points: 1. the size israel’s economy, high technological level bank system, israel’s geopolitical situation play part foreign banks’ consideration enter israel’s retail bank market. 2. a i mention before, attack banks, i include extensive legislative activity regard banking, likely deter anyone, include foreign banks, start operate israel. some point make already deal bank israel, others discuss ariav committee set minister finance myself. the committee consist appropriate people relevant authority external expert field. the establishment committee signify importance ministry finance bank israel, among others, attribute development israel’s financial system. now must allow committee get work present conclusion due course. i turn last subject today: 4. basel ii the adoption basel ii principle one important task tackle bank supervision department, hence, bank system whole. basel ii advance approach bank management supervision, base establishment risk-management system rather detail rules. this require bank invest much effort set sophisticate information management system extensive database. the bank supervision department devote many resource subject. the supervisor bank already publish schedule delineate path follow prepare complete adoption basel ii. this ambitious project, important succeed implement it. adopt basel ii principle sox 404 improve overall management – particular risk management – banks’ control, institute high international standard israel’s bank system. i hope next year able stand platform look back see much progress vital aspect banking, particular regard competitiveness, efficiency, robustness bank system. thank you.

published, i state "the global financial system swiss bank sector (…) move forward pretty fast speed". in view credit market turmoil experience since then, i would like give brief update assessment

market crisis let first give assessment current situation. on whole, position important international bank switzerland good last june. the deterioration mainly trigger crisis u sub-prime mortgage market. the slowdown u real estate market well surge interest rate sub-prime mortgage lead rise loan defaults. consequently, july price mortgage-backed security (mbs) collapsed, remain practically constant long time. even top-rated security affect slump. in last days, price recover little, volatility remain unusually high (cf. graph 1). graph 1: price security back sub-prime mortgage aaa

mortgage market, turn, correspond significantly le 10% value term total bond share trade worldwide. how possible, then, problem initially limit one segment could spread, trigger widespread turmoil? unfortunately, lot unfold confirm fear last june. first, become evident risk incur many bank high overall. there ever increase willingness part bank accept high risk, which, example, result strong growth lend expand balance sheets. moreover, market probably assess exist risk optimistically, evident view extraordinarily low risk premium bonds, example. second, banks' increase uncertainty risk structure credit market creditworthiness counterparties turn handicap. even affect bank know contingent liability record balance sheets. moreover, lot difficulty gauge creditworthiness counterparties quickly sufficient accuracy. this confidence problem particularly apparent interbank market. the risk premium unsecured interbank loan triple since onset u mortgage crisis. and, third, become clear risk management limitations. in area market risk, event occur – accord model use – even possible, least would consider extremely unlikely. in case liquidity risks, become clear assumption precaution base normal time appropriate extraordinary market situations. possible risks: contagion effect relate market deterioration environment what come next? be bad already past? unfortunately, clear answer question. a risk analysis reveal that, ultimately, future course crisis likely determine two major risks. first, impossible problem far limit partial market could spill additional markets. such danger contagion mainly exist relate credit market far largely unaffected turmoil. these include, example, commercial real estate. risk premium security point clear upward direction late (cf. graph 2). the

economic environment, economic data europe, latin america asia continue provide evidence robust growth momentum. what learn current crisis? how ensure kind market turmoil experience present avoid future, least occur kind scale? and make sure bank sector position emerge comparable even bad disruption unscathed? once need stress definitive conclusion cannot yet draw current crisis yet overcome. however, initial provisional lesson crisis, follow point seem particularly important me. first, bank need improve transparency sustainable basis. the fact that, last summer, bank come information position sub-prime market hesitantly, provide incomplete picture, make significant contribution uncertainty interbank market. consequently, reiterate request bank good job make information available exist risks. in order promote market discipline, must possible outsider able ass bank's resilience normal stress conditions. second, recent event highlight limitation risk-weighted capital adequacy requirements. the problem risk management make clear model bank risk always remain imperfect. in interpret capital adequacy requirement base risk models, must therefore proceed appropriate caution. this particularly relevant view new capital adequacy requirement also introduce switzerland next year. the main change requirements, know basel ii, capital adequacy requirement rely heavily banks' risk assessments. bear mind, lesson learn last summer may well come right time. this beg question whether – addition complex, risk-weighted capital adequacy requirement – criteria, volume limit simple debt-equity ratio also considered. the reason high ratio, great leverage effect loss soundness bank. it i intend question concept risk-weighted requirement way. rather, wish possibly strengthen requirement introduce support measures. for example, compare risk-weighted requirements, volume limit debt-equity ratio advantage key figure basically transparent base complex models. moreover, calculate element relevant crisis, size buff bank need absorb losses. third, strike fact that, date, hedge fund focus current crisis. to considerable extent, attributable much improve management counterparty risk recent years. it view bank strengthen risk management regard refinance decision risk allocation respect external customer hedge funds. the kind internal subsidise refinance cost individual business area observe case create false incentives. in future, refinance cost bank charge internal risk centre constitute integral element risk management approach. to sum up, i would like state certainly true current situation credit market serious. at time, i want stress that, fundamentally, earn capacity international bank high, thank diversify business model, increase resilience. in respect, measure announce ubs, aim strengthen capital base, welcomed. the fact ubs able attract large internationally recognise asian investor purpose serf 4 bi review 150/2007 illustration one way

thomas jordan, member govern board swiss national bank, end-of-year medium news conference, zurich, 13 december 2007. * * * a early first half 2007, turbulence could observe international financial markets. however, event isolate short-lived. in second half 2007, fundamental change situation. the sub-prime mortgage crisis u substantial impact international financial markets, extent never anticipated. i cover three area follow remarks. first, i discus upheaval international money markets. then i talk reaction central banks, particular swiss national bank. finally, i outline lesson learn crisis date. serious disruption international money market at begin august, u sub-prime mortgage crisis spread like shock wave money market important currencies. in so, hit vital nerve international financial system. well function money market essential ensure financial market participant adjust liquidity positions. ultimately, crucial banks' solvency long-term commercial viability. with attention focus money markets, spotlight also fell upon central bank implement monetary policy money market influence level interest, via supply liquidity. moreover, central bank market participant position create liquidity use interbank payment systems. the kind upheaval observe international money market past month never witness live history. rumour report substantial sub-prime position bank lead sudden loss confidence international financial institutions. moreover, bank are, extent, uncertain future liquidity situation. consequently, bank subsequently begin hoard liquidity become extremely cautious grant credit another. the market unsecured interbank loan long term collapse time market foreign exchange swap dry up. since then, bank unable obtain unsecured fund term day week – able pay substantial interest premiums. there three factor exacerbate money market disruptions. first, bank security hold supposedly first class liquid prove illiquid, thereby fail serve source supplementary liquidity. second, participant financial market also falter supply liquidity banks. their confidence bank suffer money market investment consider safe suddenly turn risky. this lead third exacerbate factor: instead help situation, off-balance sheet investment vehicle establish bank make far worse. suddenly, investment company could long refinance market bank therefore force inject liquidity. initially, liquidity bottleneck manifest u dollar money market, all. on one hand, due fact sub-prime loss refinance need mainly affect u dollar positions. on other, liquidity hoard also occur chiefly u dollars. u dollar liquidity particularly tight european banks. thus 2 bi review 150/2007 tension spread rapidly dollar money market euro money market, also swiss franc money market. the extent upheaval three money market see graph 1 show path risk premiums, use three-month fund example. before crisis, risk premium almost negligible. they amount 50 100 basis points, depend currency. the graph also show that, far, crisis move forward two waves. after normalise extent october, situation become increasingly tense mid-november onwards, bank loss reported. stabilisation central bank the turbulence money market challenge central banks. although way steer individual money market differs, ultimately provide amount liquidity necessary maintain key monetary policy rate target level. the snb react rapidly, first central bank provide additional liquidity, 9 august, mean fine-tune measures. in course follow days, continue provide bank system generous supply fund part regular auction procedure. in way, succeed rapidly defuse tension call money market. since then, carry fine-tune measure consistent basis, order dampen sharp fluctuation call money rate either direction. this allow u stabilise short-term swiss franc money market. however, unable prevent risk premium interbank business rising, since largely independent measures. a see graph 2, three-month swiss franc libor rise 2.90% mid-september 2007, substantially level target us. by international standards, however, increase libor minimal. our monetary policy decision 13 september aim calm swiss franc money market, bring three-month libor back around 2.75%. with mind, make fund available bank term three months. we day monetary policy assessment onwards. it first time do since introduction repo monetary policy instrument. at time, undertake significant reduction repo rate use transactions. our aim compensate high risk premium low repo rate, move three-month libor back middle target range. the desire reaction ensue within day three-month libor stabilise 2.75%. we thereby neutralise monetary policy impact high risk premium. a announce short ago, also supply market ample liquidity approach end year, conduct long term repo transaction mind. at operational level, steer three-month libor prove challenge, due high fluctuate level risk premium. simultaneously, benefit operational flexibility become clear. since generally present market daily basis short-term repo transactions, position adjust liquidity measure individual market conditions. over past months, make consistent use flexibility; first, provide bank system generous amount seven-day money, gradually low repo rate so, second, absorb liquidity long require soon call money rate declined. in way, possible retain overall liquidity bank system appropriate level. a see graph 3, average level bank sight deposit change little throughout year, compare minimum reserve period next. our operational process also stand well turmoil past months. payment transaction carry bank sic system run smoothly times, although bank make great use snb intraday loan facilities. in order bridge liquidity bottleneck end day, national bank provide liquidity-shortage finance facility banks. this allow obtain liquidity temporary basis bi review 150/2007 3 needed, provide limit snb provide limit continually cover eligible securities. the continual coverage limit ensure bank access liquidity cushion, even critical situations. actual use limit generally restrained, also case recent months. lesson learn i would like draw attention lesson already learn current crisis. i mention four points. first, worldwide money market upheaval clearly show highly integrate international financial market today. local crisis spread around globe flash. the money market crisis unlikely overcome yet. confidence among financial market participant remain insufficient. the pressure participant still able refinance market short-term basis remain high. a long uncertainty respect scope credit problem exists, disruption money market likely persist. second, central bank play fundamental role calm stabilise money market close consultation target operations. the snb react rapidly tension swiss franc money market. the flexibility monetary policy instrument demonstrate value difficult setting. above all, short-term interest rate calm result measure taken. the difficulty bank refinance long term rise risk premium money market come loss confidence. central bank compensate lack confidence simply inject additional liquidity. on contrary, financial market participant must take fundamental step need restore confidence. third, crisis money market clearly demonstrate liquidity management core task every bank, fall within direct accountability bank executive management. liquidity provision must begin good times. it critical sufficient liquid asset held. only first-class security suitable purpose. these sell market mobilise via repo transactions, even difficult conditions. in acute crisis situation, availability sufficient liquidity, together strong equity position, absolutely crucial. fourth finally, i would like mention that, swiss franc money market, repo business via swiss value chain prove crisis-resistant source liquidity, thank consistent minimisation risks. the repo market allow participant undertake rapid refinance interbank market, independent credit limits, thereby make major contribution stability financial system. that important snb swiss foreign bank operate swiss franc money market join swiss repo system. 4 bi review 150/2007 bi review 150/2007 5 timothy f geithner: restore market liquidity financial crisis welcome remark mr timothy f geithner, president chief executive

important issue affect financial market today. your time good, perhaps good. we go need time perspective know enough draw conclusion recommendation event past six months. the condition lead crisis take long time develop take time resolve. i think appropriate, though, central bank act address challenge market today, also begin define agenda future research policy. on december 12, federal reserve several major central banks, announce series action response elevate pressure fund markets. together, action provide flexible potentially effective set instruments, alongside conventional monetary policy instruments, help mitigate risk liquidity pressure market go forward could pose broad economy. with framework tools, capacity calibrate response market condition change. although specific vary across central banks, approach outline several important common elements. we take action provide finance term long overnight. we choose auction fund broad range collateral, collateral government securities, case broad set counterparties. and activate swap line help relevant central bank provide liquidity dollar markets. the initial spark pressure observe market today sharp deterioration value

bank bahrain, 14th annual world islamic bank conference 2007, manama, 9 december 2007. * * * fellow governors, excellencies, distinguish guests, lady gentlemen. on behalf central bank bahrain, may i welcome inaugural plenary session today’s conference. may i take opportunity thank sponsor organiser conference year concentrate mechanism encourage growth islamic bank industry whilst contain risks. over last 20 year see establishment several islamic bank finance company well islamic bank window bank rush satisfy appetite investor consumer sharia compliant product finance asset car house aircraft project finance. however bank flourish number, increase evidence bank find difficult maintain pace innovation mark 1990s. islamic bank seem increasingly focus real estate asset finance move financial liquid instrument active secondary markets. perhaps take opportunity look challenge face islamic bank see industry, regulator stakeholder may respond. the first challenge success islamic banking. the sensational growth bring islamic bank high profit past five year couple high level liquidity mean islamic bank fight fund ideas. the result see many islamic bank business model structures. the availability plentiful liquidity couple explosion real estate project mena region conspire breed level of, dare i say it, complacency islamic banks. many islamic investment bank project-driven steady source "bread butter" revenue tide slump economic activity. this contrast many major conventional bank loan books, overdraft credit card facility provide steady revenue cover overheads. another challenge face islamic bank multiplicity sharia board judgements. this lead lack homogeneity product one hand, lack uncertainty client whether product develop one jurisdiction sharia compliant neighbour jurisdiction. islamic financial product need level harmonisation term product feature gain mass acceptance. we central bank bahrain work international islamic financial market set certain standard capital money market products, bank could work closely establish common disclosure standard cost financing. additionally, central bank note continue need high quality human resource within islamic banks. islamic bank grow fast difficult bank find enough skilled qualify staff. this cbb participate islamic institution bahrain set waqf fund provide financial technical support upgrade current train program introduce new ones. it hop begin see large number financier qualify sharia – relate subject near future. such initiative benefit islamic bank i urge institution participate fund support fund works. i think point i talk governance challenge face islamic financial institutions. bi review 149/2007 1 a major issue grow importance sharia compliance provide satisfactory framework assure investor stakeholder activity bank within permit scope sharia. islamic bank various mechanism ensure sharia compliance product activity institution. the first obvious body sharia supervisory board. this body produce judgement fatwa product structure bank intend provide. the next body internal sharia review function perform post-facto review activity bank. the last body external auditor which, addition verify account bank, also check ensure bank correctly follow aaoifi sharia standards. there differ perception respective scope authority three body therefore need reach consensus function respective bodies. this clearly area institutions, sharia scholar standard setter need agree upon constitute best practice set agree set standards. the next challenge account standards. there currently 60 aaoifi accounting, auditing, governance sharia standards. this body work testimony commitment continue effort aaoifi since establishment 1990 development account audit standard islamic institutions. however, product continue develop rapidly concept “fair value” come centre stage. conventional account standard respond accordingly. two example ia 39 ifrs 7. correspond modification exist aaoifi standard yet made. this mean that, rat purpose competitive reasons, islamic bank may need follow ifrs aaoifi standard fully cover concern product disclosure. this lack equivalent aaoifi standard make difficulty produce financial statement islamic banks. additionally, aaoifi ifsb standard need adopt institution regulator reinforce status benchmark standard islamic finance. i trust

think set overnight money market rate come 30 day enough steer demand condition maintain stable inflation. rather, policy work basis expectation path bank rate future, policy set vary accord economic conditions: so-called “reaction function”. perception reaction function therefore matter lot great deal effort go transparent three inputs: committee’s objective; mpc’s view shock demand supply affect economy; view economy work policy set affect it. this conference focus one important element this: role financial market set transmission monetary policy. that cover bank’s publication economy works, include committee’s 1999 paper monetary transmission mechanism (mtm), book describe model use forecasting.1 but high-level description miss awful lot real financial part economy connect. financial variable limit short-term interest rate, exchange rate, equities. nothing role long-maturity interest rates, credit spread risk premia – miss whole universe financial asset prices. very little credit generally. next nothing money. and nothing role bank intermediation. these gap perhaps underline degree confusion amongst commentator way money credit feature somewhat prominently committee’s discussion backend 2006 year (chart 1). with strong while, ask whether mark kind change reaction function, imply great stress nominal variables. give near identity deposit bank lending, money credit often use almost inseparably, even interchangeably, wide measure non-bank credit look assess health corporate household sector balance sheets. but circumstance one good approach thing way round, start general credit conditions, examine interaction non-bank bank lending, broad money (partial) counterpart m4l. my remark today follow structure, provide framework observation current tighten credit conditions, well precede expansion. 1 “the transmission mechanism monetary policy”, paper monetary policy committee bank england, april 1999 harrison r., k. nikolov, m. quinn, g. ramsay, a scott r. thomas, “the bank england quarterly model”, bank england 2005. the bank’s wide “suite models” include rich asset price channels. bi review 149/2007 1 credit credit is, course, vital economy, enable household firm make choice whether bring forward defer spend income. there condition would play active role, passively reflect cyclical fluctuation output, employment inflation. in world le complete transparency borrower lenders, low transaction costs, low risk aversion, access credit would rationed; ex ante yield financial assets, include loan bonds, would embody risk premia. so household firm want bring forward spend face shock economy, would able restrict need remain solvent. but nobody belief description real world household company manage affairs. both are, great less degree, ration access credit, give borrower know great deal condition prospect risk-averse lenders, lender face obstacle ensure borrower honour contracts.2 the availability, price term credit– whether unsecured

monetary transmission mechanism (mtm), monetary policy work partly affect lend term effect asset value net worth borrowers.3 but credit condition also depend access credit lender themselves. there important distinction intermediation across bank balance sheet via capital markets, although i shall describe turn blurred. total credit: capital market securitisation for moment, i shall put distinction one side order focus total credit. a series environmental change past decade affect quantity price credit generally. great macroeconomic stability, perception persist le uninterrupted,

a lot securitised (chart 5). for household sector, spread securitised portfolio secure unsecured credit fell 2003 2005 (chart 6). that contribute fall effective rate underlie mortgage personal loan (chart 7). the broad picture hold corporate sector (chart 8). an illustrative decomposition suggest that, especially sub-investment grade borrowers, compression spread could explain solely reduce compensation default risk, excess possibly reflect low liquidity premia (chart 9).4 these fall spread material relative change mpc’s bank rate risk-free yield curve. for example, late “policy cycle”, increase bank rate 125bp 11 month august 2006. during period, effective rate new mortgage rise close 50bp. in words, around 2003, monetary policy need take account progressive loosen credit conditions. the table turned. spread risen; issuance securitised portfolio household loan collapsed; corporate bond issuance fall (charts 10-11). it pretty clear that, time being, adverse shift supply

argued5 macroeconomy whole resilient shock financial system “twin engines” – combine capital market bank system intermediation save credit. the argument capital market impaired, bank take burden, vice

balance sheets. this expand credit; increase liquidity capital markets, reduce liquidity premia embody asset prices; on. and music stops, process reverse fall asset values, leverage liquidity fee other. (for shin, villain mark-to-market accounting, although i would want virtue reduce forbearance overlooked.) thirdly, “twin engines” view may place insufficient weight bank remain principal originator credit, give small firm household cannot issue bond directly capital markets. it argue growth market securitising loan portfolio make bank le relevant overall credit conditions, business cycle, bank’s ability originate credit become le intimately bind financial strength.8 but if, currently, capital markets’ appetite securitised credit diminishes, large proportion loan remain balance sheet banks. all bring back focus potential macroeconomic relevance bank lending. bank lend the economic literature “bank lending” channel monetary transmission mechanism explore condition tighten monetary policy cause term bank lend tighten increase risk-free short-term real rates. the literature typically assume (i) monetary policy tighten effect central bank withdraw reserve system (or slow pace reserve injection); (ii) bank require hold proportion transaction deposit reserves, reduce reserve provision entail slow deposit growth; (iii) unrestricted access liability subject reserve requirements, cannot fill gap leave slow deposit growth must, instead, slow loan growth, tighten credit conditions.9 the first two step seem archaic. we effect monetary policy change control price quantity central bank money system; and, uk, bank choose reserve target rather determine balance sheet ratio kind. but third plank model – restrict access non-deposit liabilities, whether capital-like – plainly still relevant today. in world asymmetric information, bank unrestricted access resources, believe bank’s lend 7 adrian, tobias, h. s. shin (2007), “liquidity, monetary policy financial cycles”, paper prepare current issue economics finance. adrian, tobias h s shin, (2007), “liquidity financial cycles”, paper present 6th bi annual conference “financial system macroeconomic resilience”. analytically, argument, summarise main text, need supplement mechanism somehow impede check balance prevent overshoot fundamentals. 8 loutskina e. p. e. strahan (2006), “securitisation decline impact bank finance loan supply: evidence mortgage acceptance rates”, national bureau economic research (nber) work papers, no. 11983. and estrella, a.

risky borrowers, finance cost rise notwithstanding fall risk-free yields. since august, mpc stressed, however, sufficient circumstance look solely price credit, could increase quantity rationing. the standard view household small firm likely adversely affect circumstance large firms, typically great access capital markets. but disturbance affect wholesale loan markets, need monitor condition corporate bond loan issuance. indeed, need look total credit, carefully across different sector track impact tightening. but timely rich data available bank lending. and interpret straightforward give nature shock system. if reintermediation significant, bank take back balance sheet conduit investment vehicle paper hold onto loan long usual sell onto capital markets. 19 perhaps nothing illustrate cleanly advent credit derivatives. derivative kind unbundle fund (and liquidity risk) underlie risk agent seek exposure via particular contract. so credit derivative unbundles credit risk funding. this complicate interpretation bank lend data (m4l). imagine that, due customer network screen capability, bank originate credit, use credit-default swap shed great portion credit risk via cd non-bank financial institutions. in limit, would world m4l correctly measure (bank) lend m4 one useful measure “liquidity”. but would also world shock credit condition capital risk appetite work largely non-bank lenders, shock liquidity work largely depositor confidence bank system. in real world, story underline need look total credit, analyse monetary data finesse. 20 see bank england inflation report, november 2007, section 1 “money asset prices”, page 16-17. 8 bi review 149/2007 it cannot rule that, while, m4l growth rate may deceive underlie pace credit expansion economy. that important because, nutshell, turmoil financial market “city” event. how potent macroeconomically depend long current condition persist, feedback loop financial economy real economy. a persistence, necessary condition alleviation current strain credit market probably least twofold. first, u house household debt market stabilise. second, bank financial intermediary recognise impairment asset values, uncertainty counterparty credit risk begin reduce. on financial-real economy interaction, must try avoid vicious circle tight liquidity conditions, low asset values, impair capital resources, reduce credit supply, slow aggregate demand fee back other. a variety policy response possible. the announcement yesterday central bank coordinate action via term auction alleviate pressure finance market direct that. second, regulatory authority around world monitor banks’ liquidity capital positions, include context basel ii. and, thirdly, monetary policy also principle play role, effectively “financial accelerator” work bank balance sheets, consistent maintain stable inflation medium term. in uk, start point robust domestic demand; leveraged-buyout sector aside, generally healthy corporate balance sheets; somewhat vulnerable household balance sheets;21 potentially stretch commercial residential property prices. at committee’s november meeting, i explore case “insurance cut” address downside risk tighten credit conditions. the case cut strengthen bank rate, 5¾%, stand level probably mildly restrictive. but weigh upward pressure inflation stem largely rise energy commodity prices. our november projection seem likely validate expectation already embody money market curve bank rate would time lowered, represent offset tighten liquidity credit premia. that so, balance, i conclude immediate cut necessary; “no change” would give committee valuable opportunity explain inflation report implication credit commodity shocks, underline committee remain focus anchor inflation expectation achieve inflation target medium term. look ahead, i note importance distinguish between, one hand, pass macroeconomy shock already occur credit condition commodity prices;

speech mr zhou xiaochuan, governor people’s bank china, "global management forum" organize qing hua university, beijing, 30 october 2007. * * * financial instability turbulence occur every years. a almost impossible avoid mistake completely, key learn live instability turbulences, consequently draw lesson improve financial system. the recently conclude 17th national congress communist party china (cpc) stress objective keep momentum good fast economic growth. that means, financial sector, best prevent financial instability turbulence. the recent subprime turbulence create fairly large disruption financial market u.s. world large, consequently put china high alert. for past five years, china's economy basically maintain steady rapid growth without real bumps. in fact, i bite worry young people may think kind smooth, stable status normal. in fact, likely norm financial system face instability turbulence vary degree every years; free instability would be, fact, abnormal. what's important realize economic distress include current subprime turbulence, contain within valuable lesson worthy discovery scrutiny. indeed, lesson serve important source insight china improve develop financial market macroeconomic policy-making. financial instability turbulence unusual the financial market u.s., develop world, experience turbulence distress one another past decades. in 1970s, high inflation; 1980s, s&l crisis occur prompt authority create resolution trust corporation around 1990 deal consequence crisis. in 1987, stock market crash black monday; autumn 1998, financial crisis asia spread russia brazil, collapse long term capital management trigger distress; 2000, enormous amount wealth evaporate result burst bubble nasdaq market; this, enron worldcom scandal shake security market 2002; recently, year see ongoing subprime turbulence. instability turbulence occur succession. each cause yet unidentified mistakes. a mistake unavoidable, key learn live instability turbulences, consequently draw lesson improve financial system. a matter fact, financial authority introduce significant substantive policy institutional improvement every crisis. by review above-mentioned turbulence u.s., get rough idea improvement occurred. in period high inflation 1970s 80s, role, independence governance central bank carefully studied. a result, operation central bank make lot improvements. we read development biography paul volker autobiography alan greenspan. after black monday 1987, become know general public central bank use liquidity management flexible manner response crisis might otherwise spread quickly. after s&l crisis 1980 early 1990s resolved, regulator carefully examine potential moral hazard deposit insurance scheme. in 1991, federal deposit insurance company improvement act adopt strengthen bi review 148/2007 1 supervision function fdic, establish arrangement prompt corrective action adopt differentiate premium mitigate adverse selection moral hazards. after long term capital management problem, financial sector watch leverage ratio hedge fund carefully urge commercial institutions, commercial bank particular, strengthen internal control leverage ratio. with burst nasdaq bubbles, people begin get taste bubble harms. in aftermath enron worldcom scandals, sarbanes-oxley act passed. though may view small number code reaction, act contain remarkable improvement response problem list companies. a lot reflection see recent turbulence trigger subprime mortgage. a usually say china, good chance turn bad thing good ones. parse china's experience look back china's economic financial development since period open reform, similar picture emerge could see financial distresses, big small, always occurred. in 1985, china experience high inflation rate 8.8 percent. in anti-inflation process, decision-makers learn build two-tier bank system. the blind optimism balance payment exist time also correct process. the high inflation rate record 1988 result several factors, include so-called theory “harmless inflation ” influential 1987-1988. after 1988, view fell completely favor. the next round inflation, start 1993, cause third plenary session 14th cpc central committee lay formal macroeconomic policy framework well various guide perception principles, include kind macroeconomic policy framework established? what role fiscal policy? what role monetary policy? what exactly government plan attempt coordinate? base deliberations, macroeconomic policy-making improve significantly, also learn apply economic leverage appropriately timely, deal inflation. through 1990s, chinese bank sector face predicament characterize underdevelopment sound “credit culture.” during period, shortcoming credit culture exemplify two main type bank lending. the first policy lending, include determine government plan variety administrative interventions. the second so-called “relationship-based lending”. at time, exist large deficiency standard accounting, information disclosure financial statement reporting. enterprises’ access credit largely base management’s personal relationship banks, good relationship get loans. rectify china’s unsound credit culture long painful process. a key step path nation’s first national financial work conference hold november 1997, set vertical management system commercial banks. both central local government thus prohibit interfere loan decisions. this change consider important step forward transform credit culture. at end 1997, asian financial crisis spread full scale. although china avert head-on hit crisis, aftermath produce long-term effect chinese economy, including, obviously, problem non-performing loan (npls). accord account standard use domestically time, 1998 chinese bank system npl ratio 25 percent, although international account standard would put rate high 40 percent – figure underscore npl crisis. indeed, many bank technically insolvent. a bank system status would difficult support sound economic development. such reality buttress china’s resolve carry reforms. 2 bi review 148/2007 in february 2002, second national financial work conference, plan make strengthen financial supervision (later 2003 china bank regulatory commission (cbrc) established). it also decide kick new round reform commercial bank sector, clean bank balance sheets, proceed financial restructure – measure design make major commercial bank financially healthy. over next five years, china carry series reform financial institutions, include commercial banks, also rural credit union financial institutions, security firm insurance companies. the decision carry reform result lesson learned, also lay foundation future development. just enron worldcom case expose unite states, chinese medium unveil fund scandal security trading. in case, institution find manipulate stock prices. the year 2001 also saw yin guang xia case, similar enron scandal list company disclose false information engage unlawful trade stock. in 2003, large scandal list company break collapse de long conglomerate. follow incidents, china’s financial regulation corporate governance standard improve toughen counteract misconduct use complex corporate structures, occur de long case. china’s financial system thus gradually improve knowledge deal instability turbulence vary degrees. while it’s difficult avoid mistake completely, key learn right lessons, make improvements, achieve substantive progress. a chinese say go like “if frequently suffer minor illnesses, may finally exempt major disease”. china must avoid cost kind disease plague japan’s economy 1990s even new century. the mirror image in review international financial instability turbulence since 1970s, may two observations. first, many kind instability turbulence afflict financial systems, minority create financial system itself. the majority reflect problem real economy – so-called “mirror image” financial sector. the real economy financial system mirror other, npl problem usually reflect trouble firm real economy. at time, may also reflect problem account practice, information disclosure, corporate governance. one characteristic modern economy financial system barometer entire economy: trouble real economy often first break financial system. problem financial system, however, cause financial system alone. second, problem develop countries, particularly emerge mature market economies, often relatively new economy often place financial innovation activity concentrated. these problem new market participant regulator alike hard time predict course. naturally, it’s big challenge find solutions. in comparison, problem face emerge market develop country often repeat already experience develop economies. thus, way deal instability often probably draw international historical experience. rethink financial instability turbulence first, economic system policy flawed, sooner late force corrected; objective law function market economy. the u bi review 148/2007 3 subprime turbulence clear case. individual without sufficient ability repay fail meet loan standard nonetheless give large amount home loans. at point, hide risk would surface. when obvious bubble form economy, burst problem bind emerge time. second, risk financial system bring indirect finance much high tie direct financing. so say “debt dangerous”. institutional investor include pension funds, mutual funds, hedge funds, private equity funds, etc, presumably know undertake relevant risk inherent investment. problem arise thus comparatively le painful absorbed. a recent estimate amount subprime mortgage security us$ 200 billion. if risk truly spread among institutional investor direct investors, hard economy large u.s. absorb loss (all give burden fall europe, japan even, much le extent, china). so why, expectations, turbulence continue spreading? an understand lie fact investment risk carry direct investors, certain risk fact leave within indirect finance channels. a know, so-called structure investment vehicle (sivs), often off-balance-sheets bank financial institutions. financial institution keep huge amount debt exposure book – without detect regulatory bodies. off-book supervision actually rather relaxed, many people include regulator even don’t necessarily relevant experience field. because off-book investment institution usually borrow banks, end commercial bank leave hold sizeable portion subprime derivative products. the basel ii bank guideline set requirement debtor bring certain off-book service back on-book timely manner. but banks, exception large european banks, yet take guidelines. and chinese bank currently subject basel ii. a long bank system doesn’t get drag mess, subprime mortgage problem would limit impact. a far direct investment risk concerned, investor absorb losses, central bank generally would stand provide support. a debt risk within bank bear systemic implications, action take curb spread. a illustrate northern rock case dry market liquidity begin threaten spread, bank england must act. review debt instruments, learn creditor-debtor relationship imply great systematic risks. similar case find review lesson asian financial crisis japanese experience. to reduce risk increase financial stability, great effort make develop direct financing. however, it’s vital direct investment product twist simply shift risk back bank system. in process, key foster develop investors, include institutional investor well individual investors, recognize specific risk ability undertake risks. third, analysis research strengthen detect bubble risk prepare different scenarios. a book call extraordinary popular delusion madness crowd describe bubble early year western financial markets. the title book interest remind participant financial market keep rational. when market go overheat, participant often see reason weaken even many try explain away defend irrationality. during tenure u.s. federal reserve, alan greenspan use term “irrational exuberance” alert overheat situation. this, too, reminder rational attitude maintain process economic market overheating. fourth, process diagnose problem prescribe solutions, it’s important misread history. when make corrections, effort exercise avoid overshooting, l effort end sow seed another crisis. among analysis current state global excess liquidity u subprime turbulence, one line think 4 bi review 148/2007 draw origin feed loosen monetary policy follow burst nasdaq bubble 2000. amid large amount analysis spillover effect subprime turbulence china, voice caution development securitized products, trace origin subprime turbulence development securitized product derivatives. worry complex product might generate great troubles, embrace vision “simpler better.” but need remain sober: securitization process jettison quickly. to develop financial market support economic growth, resolute effort need make develop direct finance relate securitization. it almost impossible avoid securitization contemporary development. rather, great effort make develop array financial products, include hybrid product debt-equity mix derivatives. we need recognize problem arise securitization derivative product somehow flawed. instead, trouble result problem information disclosure price mechanisms, design mechanism imply moral hazard. fifth, flexibility adaptability must improved. in deal crisis it’s important realize fluidity situation thus need nimble response. the governor bank england criticize response northern rock floor parliament, blame change position days. in fact, financial market fast changing, judgment must make accord specific conditions. it’s normal one’s conclusion update within days. from perspective adjustment capability deal crisis, key increase microeconomic flexibility. in words, adaptability micro entity change price well market supply-demand improved, thus avoid introduction excess rigidity pricing, supply, demand, institutional design. sixth, guard manage instability, develop country must raise level confidence currencies, market central banks. key point include maintain stability currency value, adopt flexible exchange rate policy, support confidence currency convertibility, increase economy’s ability deal kind shocks, exercise regular assessment economy, provide early warn risk form within economy, research prepare contingency plans. imf’s annual surveillance mechanism – include “article iv consultation” – function effective tool regular health check-up member economies. seventh, it’s truly art find subtle balance need anti-crisis policy-making. it’s important avoid create much moral hazard bail institution whose operation lead major mistakes. at time, it’s necessary consider impact real economy: crisis impact real economy social confidence severe, may result system-wide chain reaction, prompt action would required. of course, reaction vary different circumstances. a subprime mortgage crisis develops, carefully observe two recent policies. first, 2 million american subprime home loan recipient face problem fully repay mortgages. if foreclosure enforced, may lead decline house prices. during process, government may wish take step help poor people difficulties. but fundamental issue people didn’t meet loan condition probably buy large houses. will government’s provision aid subsidy lead moral hazard? should result loss bear taxpayers? second, u (as well handful european) financial institution employ sivs conduit take additional risk exposure. should institution bail out? several big u bank recently create “super conduit” worth us$ 75 billion, try help alleviate crisis. but doing, go price risk relate products? will simply create even great moral hazard? bi review 148/2007 5 above all, need pay close attention deeply think turbulence underway well remedial measure adopt financial regulatory authority mature economy deal it. such reflection bear great significance china develop financial market, improve financial supervision regulation macroeconomic policy-making. 6 bi review 148/2007 rundheersing bheenick: bank mauritius – 40th anniversary year highlight outlook speech professor rundheersing bheenick,

sure year exception. this morning’s business forum challenge opportunity fund management industry already generate number interest point discussion. the schedule next two half day take discussion broad range topic field bank finance moment i focus remark fund management industry. industry size let begin recap fact size growth industry. a heard, fund management industry australia expand remarkable pace past couple decades. since 1990, value fund management grow annualised rate 12½ per cent, stand around $1.7 trillion. this equivalent 160 per cent gdp, 50 per cent 1990. by international standards, australia’s fund management industry among large world, ratio gdp also absolute terms. some report rank australia fourth large fund management industry world term asset management. the data underlie rank compile investment company institute, industry association u mutual funds. this measure cover investment mutual fund unit trusts, therefore favour country australia type investment vehicle quite common. on hand, understate size fund management industry country tend use investment structures. an alternative approach measure size fund management industry add asset pension funds, life insurance company manage investments, regardless precise legal structure reside. this provide broad view fund management industry one comparable across countries. this exercise straightforward, however, consistent international data difficult obtain. after take account measurement issues, colleague bank estimate australian industry among world’s ten largest, though likely towards bottom group top half. it difficult precise but, nonetheless, clear australian fund management industry large international standards. bi review 148/2007 1 reason growth what behind rapid

industry, however, also grow quickly, reflect general reason increase financial awareness household associate search high return offer traditional investment bank deposits; strength world equity markets; demographic trend “baby boomers” enter wealth-accumulation phase lives. a well invest might consider fairly conventional financial products, also notable australia significant direct participation retail investor market sophisticate financial products. for example, retail high net worth investor account two-thirds asset australian-based hedge funds, compare le half globally. the available evidence australia also suggest large retail presence market collateralised debt obligation case markets. over past five years, retail investor estimate purchase around 15 per cent cdos issue australia. one reason high participation australian retail investor market regulatory regime australia restrict retail access financial product long provider meet certain disclosure requirements. this approach beneficial term provide investor great range wealth-generating opportunities, raise important challenges. i want spend rest time today outline challenge face fund management industry. challenge one important challenge raise disclosure-based regime place significant premium financial literacy. this rely heavily ability investor understand information present make appropriate decision base information. some retail investor may position. a particularly tell statistic come recent survey conduct financial literacy foundation, third adult respondent indicate consider risk return choose investment. the fact retail investor apparently devote bulk save buy unsecured, high-yielding debt issue recently collapse property company also suggest people difficulty understand financial risk investment products. the australian government, financial literacy foundation, number initiative underway improve financial education literacy standards. asic also active educate retail investor financial products, range private-sector initiative underway help improve financial literacy standards. one way financial service industry help retail investor make good investment decision provide clear concise information financial products. for time concern length complexity product disclosure statement prospectuses. 2 bi review 148/2007 asic try address concern various initiatives. it also recently introduce regulatory guidance improve quality disclosure retail investor unlisted debentures. a relate challenge face industry financial advice, pay for. there appear general reluctance part retail investor pay financial advice fee-for-service basis. instead, preference commission-based advice, despite conflict interest arise situation. this reluctance pay advice upfront appear form money illusion, whereby investor may feel somehow pay le financial advice cost bury reduce earn future. the regulatory environment australia try deal potential conflict commission–based advice make requirement advisor provide client write statement advice set out, among things, basis advice given, potential conflict interest, dollar value commission stand receive. but question remain whether full disclosure enough deal potential conflict interest associate commission-based fees, whether merit industry move direction offer advice fee-for-service basis. the cost provide investment service retail investor also challenge need addressed. recent research publish apra compare average net return – is, return fees, expense tax – different type superannuation funds. apra find decade 2006, $1,000 invest average retail fund would rise $1,650 fees, expense taxes, compare $1,888 industry fund $2,100 corporate public sector funds. of course, figure average would significant variation return individual funds. while difficult isolate exact cause underperformance retail funds, important contribute factor would fee expense retail fund typically high industry corporate funds. that said, i think encourage competition put downward pressure expense ratio across category superannuation funds. another issue receive attention level superannuation contribution necessary ensure adequate retirement income. determine adequacy contribution rate difficult model rely various assumption future investment returns, income growth, length retirement etc. there also need specify mean “adequate”. most recent research, however, suggest that, ensure adequate replacement income retirement, current level superannuation guarantee contribution need supplement old-age pension lower-income households, voluntary contribution household eligible pension. the issue i raise today are, i sure, well know industry. there many consideration take account resolve them, doubt need large input industry so. conclusion for moment, however, let conclude record transformation superannuation industry past couple decade one great success story australian financial sector. while work need done, conference play important role raise resolve issues. bi review 148/2007 3 i hope discussion next couple day prove thought–provoking rewarding. 4 bi review 148/2007 glenn stevens: central bank communication address mr glenn stevens, governor reserve bank australia, sydney institute, sydney, 11 december 2007. * * * this even i would like talk central bank communication. there plenty people probably think “central bank” “communication” expression normally think belong together. yet communication become steadily open, important, central bank world years. at one time, overnight interest rate use adjust without announcement explanation – “snugging” popular term late 1980s. the market would generally take days, general public considerably longer, work happen monetary policy changing. they usually wait long explanation changing. that long case. these days, central bank say move interest rate, say why, openly. this particular form transparency adopt quite early rba, back 1990, bernie fraser. not announce policy change forthright fashion, central bank set detail assessment economic condition publish material. in number cases, publish minute policy discussions. governor others give speeches, appear parliamentary committee frequently quote various commentator media. for central banks, historically quite discreet organisations, quite change. i want examine reason behind change, case openness. i want also talk limit openness. finally, i elaborate little recently announce change area. why communicate? to begin with, worth ask question: central bank communicate? there least two reasons. the first arise principle accountability open democratic society. the central bank charge important responsibility – maintain purchase power nation’s currency, pursue “full employment” foster stable reliable financial payment systems, among others. it endow substantial power – rba’s case, buy sell financial assets, commodities, real property, lend money make certain regulation – fact, anything could think come within remit “central bank business”. it stand reason central bank expect account way use power pursue statutory goals. the framer reserve bank act 1959 nearly 50 year ago wisely place parliament squarely centre accountability arrangements. in recent times, commonwealth authority company act 1997 require annual report relevant agencies, reserve bank one, begin rba require issue annual report parliament. yet requirement frequent communication grow years. in part reflect increase development capital market speed force respond economic developments. market crave information, central bank’s assessment state economy one part information set. in part, demand communication accompany increase operational independence central banks. when central bank make important policy decision authority delegate parliament, oppose implement decision make minister – case monetary policy – naturally bi review 147/2007 1 expectation accountability. it also reflect general development community’s expectation inform important matters. that natural concomitant affluent, educate mature society. a such, something welcomed. there also role media. our political leader expect answer question medium much frequently, across much broad range issues, case.1 some spill onto institutions, include corporation central banks. the medium respond market demand information here, competitive industry, medium organisation also seek create new market supply intensive, frequent coverage issues, include economic policy. the second rationale communication desire effective policy. some policy action much effect condition expectation constrain current behaviour. this much true case monetary policy. a change cash rate modest size pretty small impact economy. but expectation sequence possible future interest rate change often powerful. what central bank says, much does, affect expectations. even important expectation future inflation. when people expect price rise rapidly, bring forward purchases, put prices, demand high wage on. that help create inflation expect. on hand, people convince inflation contain – perhaps believe central bank whatever require achieve – behave accordingly. in case, price setting, wage purchase behaviour help keep inflation controlled. expectation likely helpful foster economic stability public clear understand central bank’s goal are, central bank think economy work general term likely respond various events, particularly pressure inflation. that central bank spend good deal time talk objective policy framework. it publish exhaustive analysis economic condition offer assessment likely future developments. of course world highly uncertain, central bank cannot spell exactly would response every conceivable scenario. there always potential surprises. but people understand framework goal policy, response knowledge usually helpful achieve policy goal. hence, communication important part policy process. how communicate? and much? so much rationale communication. what channel central bank use? there several. most central bank program publications. australia’s central bank publish bulletin every month since 1937.2 in case central bank publish result research staff. the view paper author alone, much research part knowledge base available policy-makers 1 they also expect respond medium question counterpart democracies, far i see. 2 in australia, recommendation 1935–1937 royal commission commonwealth bank publish regular statistical bulletin. the reserve bank take obligation “separation” 1960. 2 bi review 147/2007 hence usually interest seek understand policy issues. the rba publish research discussion paper since late 1960s. over past 15 year so, many central bank upgrade regular economic reporting, give depth account economic condition analytical flavour. in country formal inflation targets, call “inflation reports”, though much inflation. these document set factual background way show policy maker account economic financial condition decisions. in process usually reveal good deal central bank think economy work – “model”, will. in many, probably most, cases, document contain forward look material. forecast inflation (and often key macroeconomic variables), assumption forecast base extent uncertainty surround forecast are, vary degrees, spell out. a central bank even publish future interest rate path – albeit one heavily condition assumption almost certain realised, one reason another. the rba progressively upgrade regular report. the statement monetary policy appear mid month quarter. this comprehensive treatment local global economies, financial market consideration monetary policy. it contain bank’s inflation forecast, sense risk surround forecast, discussion force condition outlook economy. it also offer account policy decision board make precede period. central banker give public speech issue day. in case, typically take question floor occasion well. sometimes question even topic speech! the speeches, answer questions, routinely sift economists, medium others hint central bank’s intentions. that surprising, though sometimes reader remarkably inventive effort read lines. i certainly marvel account i suppose said. nonetheless, occasion give central bank opportunity talk issue think important, signal, necessary, change view might occur formal assessment economy appear regular timetable. central banker make appearance front parliamentary committees. a may know, case, governor appear twice yearly front house representative economics committee decade now. other official bank appear front various committee appropriate. these hear give elect representative chance ask question length. they key part accountability offer useful opportunity communication. they also play, use well, educative role, develop good understand policy issue would achievable many fora. of course, always risk session question tend aim political point scoring. public communication is, however, two edge sword. for every occasion something important say, another central banker find give speech, release formal document, little new say economy, environment market observer already good understand central bank’s assessment. on occasion always risk communication inadvertently dislodge perfectly sensible expectation – one reason speech document often, quite deliberately, little unexciting side. colour movement necessarily useful central banker’s case. it reason rba was, long time, somewhat ambivalent practice adopt central bank make statement reason policy decision even decision leave rate unchanged. while decision change rate many year accompany pretty detail explanation bi review 147/2007 3 case, decision change rate often mean little new information impart. we adhere old adage “when nothing say, keep mouth shut”. these reservation valid. but increase number central bank manage construct statement issue regularly, without apparently much harm. more importantly, plenty occasion change interest rate widely expected, hence perhaps need little explanation, others change decision require careful explanation. have reflect time year, reserve bank board come judgement downside risk statement long outweigh likely benefits. accordingly, adopt practice issue short statement every meeting, explain policy decision, whether cash rate change. the first “no-change” statement issue last week. last week’s decision good example, fact, one change cash rate need explanation. the statement note concern board outlook inflation, give recent price data apparent strength demand. it also note outlook world economy look little weaker, trend financial market pricing, precede month, likely result rise borrow rate australians. in words, financial condition shift right direction contain inflation, even without adjustment cash rate. hence board decide leave cash rate unchanged, time being. in change communication arrangements, commence february 2008 meeting, statement make day meeting, 2.30 pm, rather next morning. any change cash rate still take effect follow day. this schedule inform market australian day, limit time period decision take publicly announced. the previous practice delay announcement 9.30 follow day originally adopt logistical reasons, long since disappeared. it much good practice, le risky, announce decision promptly possible made. minute limit transparency that bring one remain area central bank accountability communication i would like talk about, treatment minute policy make meetings. practice vary area. the unite state federal open market committee publish minute many years. it prompt initially congressional pressure openness, long move beyond minimum requirement fairly full set minute include vote record individual members. the bank england’s monetary policy committee (mpc) require statute publish minutes. the mpc’s culture expressly, intention creators, one individual accountability. hence minute include vote record members, uncommon significant proportion member differ majority – include two case governor minority. mpc member hold second meeting, subsequent policy meet interest rate decision taken, purpose approve minutes, release prior next policy meeting. the european central bank, contrast, publish minutes. one key reason presidents/governors national central bank sit govern council ecb require make decision euro area whole, oppose decision might suit particular circumstance countries. it argued, unreasonably, publication minute vote might prejudice capacity national governor take euro area, rather national, perspective. the ecb 4 bi review 147/2007 make additional effort communication kinds, include regular press conference. clearly view side question, reflect different institutional arrangement across countries. this argue time that, pursuit optimal degree transparency, would make sense “cherry pick” high transparency aspect every system assume simply graft onto australian system. the nature reserve bank board – majority part-time members, draw various part australian community, seek make decision national interest oppose industry, geographical sectional interest – need consider think disclosure practices. it also important, i think, articulate point reasonable limit transparency system. it case release material always, definition, go lead good inform public debate good policy decisions. in contemplate release minute meet particular, form release might take, need balance legitimate desire information accountability need maintain frank, open discussion meeting. at many meet i take part years, people consider various argument ultimately find unconvincing, need examine interest reach balance decision. people also change mind course meet – one would hope happen occasionally, since one key benefit meet learn respond view participants. it unlikely dynamic meet could sustain every utterance disclosed. the incentive could easily arise people much cautious said, come meet pre-written statement, rather engage genuinely interactive discussion. that would reduce quality discussion and, ultimately, decision. and quality decision, all, seek maximise. what mean decision release minute take lightly. such document write carefully, take account institutional structure, include nature board, need preserve environment candid discussion. rba minute that said, reason why, careful drafting, set minute strike right balance cannot compiled. indeed, now, write minute way. after discussion among board members, recently decide long strong case prepare release minute monetary policy discussion. accordingly, announce last week, future release minute monetary policy meet lag two weeks. the minute november meet release last wednesday. the minute meet hold last week release december 18. in addition, agreement board, i release time website minute meet since i chairman board (that is, commence october 2006 meeting). those interest read document – will, outside medium economic financial professionals, relatively few, i expect – find follow features. first, account main factual material available board issue arise material come discussion. there nothing particularly startle – information available bank pretty much know everyone else. the material cover every single indicator bank track – many. so favourite statistic mentioned, doesn’t mean ignore it. equally, bi review 147/2007 5 statistic prominent recent set minute necessarily see all-important future decisions. the board always strive form comprehensive picture whole economy assess economic outlook prospect achieve inflation objective, come decision. second, account policy discussion occur towards end meeting, outline key consideration involve decision. sometimes consideration quite straightforward. on occasions, may point different direction term implication interest rates, case board make “on balance decision”. the minute set clearly logic behind decision. third, record decision – is, target cash rate bank maintain period next meeting. reader note comment attribute individuals. the material transcript – indeed keep transcript – edit version set detail minutes. no record monetary policy discussion exists. the minute attempt provide “blow-by-blow” description every comment made. but minute release central banks, would sensible so, reason i articulate moment ago. reader also observe pattern vote individual recorded, outcome. that point difference central bank publish minutes. but case decision-makers full-time appointees, case system expressly individual, oppose collective, responsibility decisions. that system australia operates, pattern disclosure reflect institutional arrangements. in interest clarity, let also state minute cover issue monetary policy. other matter board consider time time – bank’s accounts, audit processes, issue concern subsidiary governance question – record publish minutes, public policy case so. there proper disclosure matters, appropriate vehicle, mainly annual report. this line practice central banks, common sense. our view minute type releasing, combination regular statement meeting, large volume material release bank, meet legitimate claim observer know basis board’s policy decisions. it consistent arrangement prevail country would look example good practice. at time, approach preserve candour discussion meet recognise respect basis non executive member board serve. a such, strike right balance. conclusion communication become important part central banker’s tool kit. while rarely find court publicity, neither shirk responsibility explain why. that requirement good governance, also usually make policy decision effective. there limit transparency. more always better, decision disclose additional information hard reverse made, make care. nonetheless, reflect experience evaluate experience around world, recently judge time come move australia’s arrangement conform normal practice elsewhere. i please learn i meet new treasurer couple week ago support changes. 6 bi review 147/2007 this material compete well best seller lists, almost everyone (i hope) good thing read beach summer reserve bank board’s minutes. but professionals, hopefully make modest contribution understand board’s decisions. and rest trouble get sleep … whatever prefer read material, i wish pleasant festive season happy prosperous new year. bi review 147/2007 7 radovan jelašić: social responsibility serbia un “global compact”

ziel gesetzt, journalisten zu arbeiten über die deutsch-amerikanischen beziehungen zu inspirieren, und zeichnet diejenigen aus, die sich durch ihre beiträge um die festigung d bindungen zwischen deutschland und den usa verdient gemacht haben. wa die geldpolitik anbelangt, stehen die transatlantischen beziehungen nun im breiteren kontext d interaktionen zwischen dem eurosystem und dem federal

[ladies gentlemen, it pleasure today festive atmosphere, honour main speaker journalist award ceremony. i grateful, mr kai-jacob klasen, invitation, i move pay tribute tonight memory dr karl klasen. the foundation host ceremony commendable purpose inspire reward journalists’ work strengthen german-american relationships. in area monetary policy, transatlantic relation write broad context interaction eurosystem federal reserve system, always aim, president european central bank, preserve foster close friendly relationship american counterpart.] the goal talk today show worth pursue extend relationship. the euro area unite state share common external internal experience justify increase cooperation exist policy institutional levels. to convince this, i first show unite state euro area face similar external environment economic financial connection reinforce context globalisation. i argue monetary authority unite state euro area face common feature due certain degree internal diversity within large economic areas. this share think experience always prof invaluable duty ensure efficient monetary policy. in last section talk, i demonstrate interaction facilitate institutional cooperation development personal contact american colleagues. trade financial integration: share external environment the euro area unite state large economy world, host 600 million inhabitant responsible around 40% world production. the preponderance two region similar size naturally call parallel made. view outside, two region large economic bloc lead bi review 146/2007 1 globalisation surge world trade, financial flow innovative idea get strong last decades. trade openness the euro area large exporter world. it extra-area export amount €1.9 trillion last year, u export reach €1.1 trillion. together, two economy account almost third world trade. the euro area significantly open economy size. it export import good reach 33% gdp 2006, figure add rise importance trade service – around 10% gdp. in 1998, euro area export import account 24% gdp, trade service 8%. trade openness euro area therefore reinforce since advent euro. the unite state slightly le open, trade good represent 22% gdp trade service 6% gdp. however, among euro area trade partners, unite state play central role. indeed, around 15% euro export good go unite states. look side atlantic, american export represent around 10% import goods. on balance, last years, record large trade surplus unite states. our good export exceed import unite state usd 80 billion. in service sector, trade grow continue grow, connection unite state even important. 22% service export go unite state quarter import come unite states. in particular, export performance travel transportation service always outstanding. nevertheless, euro area trade occur european neighbours, japan china. this could suggest linkage unite state euro area secondary importance. however, would underestimate significance u economy also indirect transmission channels. indeed, unite state play broad role world economy, second-round effect capture crude figure i presented. these second-round effect include trade linkages, also financial confidence linkages. after financial turmoil experience summer, become increasingly important understand them. the importance financial openness the unite states, recent financial trouble originated, euro area open financial flows. u external asset liability exceed usd 13 trillion 2005, figure euro area similar. in percentage gdp, u external asset represent 90 % u gdp u external liability amount 110 % gdp 2005. a regard euro area 2005 well, external asset represent 124 % euro area gdp external liability reach 137 % euro area gdp ; therefore, relative terms, euro area financially open unite states. european investor also central player american markets. a example, euro area stock direct investment unite state reach €600 billion end 2006. some industry particularly present unite states: trade financial sector, course, also chemical industry france, germany netherlands large investment stake unite states. the situation fairly similar direction, around €630 billion u firm invest euro area, principally service industry belgium, luxembourg netherlands. the current level fdi flow show bilateral link continue strengthen future. portfolio investment euro area unite state also impressive magnitude. the stock u portfolio asset hold euro area reach 2 bi review 146/2007 almost €1.5 trillion last year, third european hold worldwide. the euro u dollar also currency denomination majority portfolio asset traded. more three-quarters portfolio asset worldwide denominate euro dollars, accord available data.1all all, unite state euro area large trade financial partners. arguably, unite state seem great impact world business cycles, probably mainly grow importance financial channel transmission macroeconomic shocks. for unite state euro area, trade financial channel have, course, direct consequence monetary policy. for instance, increase import low-cost country ensure import price inflation remain contained. import price decline period 2001-2003 euro area remain stable throughout follow years. however, commodity price experience high level inflation result strong growth emerge economy india china. globalisation therefore mix effect inflation. finally, also argue unite state euro area witness loosen link inflation activity increase openness. this important implication monetary policy. diversity within large economic bloc – common challenge monetary policy although see environment outside euro area unite state gain importance, internal economic situation remain major focus attention within central banks. almost nine year euro changeover, euro area macroeconomic development continue mask diversity across euro area countries. nonetheless, diversity term inflation output growth currently approximately scale unite states. more specifically, euro area inflation differential exhibit strong decline recent decades. start unweighted standard deviation around 6 percentage point begin 1990s, inflation dispersion fall around half percentage point far 2007. more specifically, year overall decline inflation rate among traditional high-inflation country compare last year. however, since august, inflation rate country risen, probably result high oil food prices. this imply dispersion euro area currently somewhat inflation dispersion among 14 u metropolitan statistical areas, fluctuate around 1 percentage point last two decades. the dispersion real gdp growth rates, measure term unweighted standard deviation, move around level 2 percentage point past decades, apparent upward downward trend. this similar dispersion witness output growth across region within unite states. the persistence macroeconomic development euro area a key feature observe economic diversity persistence macroeconomic development across euro area countries. for example, difference cumulate growth real gdp two euro area country large small output increases, respectively, 50 percentage point period 1998-2006. the situation similar across u states. furthermore, equivalent accumulate spread two euro area country low high inflation rate almost 20 percentage point unit labour cost total economy 20 25 1 cpi data, imf, 2005. bi review 146/2007 3 percentage point period. in unite states, spread cpi inflation two metropolitan area low high inflation rate slightly lower, around 18% period. in euro area, addition decline dispersion inflation, activity labour cost developments, another key feature business cycle converge output gap fluctuation become similar across countries. this feature apparent unite states, dispersion cycle trend gdp growth, seem explain roughly equal part growth dispersion states. for instance, last year, acceleration activity rebound euro area’s real gdp growth widely share phenomenon across various euro area member countries. hence, register growth dispersion across euro area country seem mainly explain difference trend output growth, rather cyclical developments, feature i would like reflect on. difference trend output growth euro area the difference trend output growth euro area might reveal structural factor normal feature monetary union. difference trend output growth may, instance, reflect diverse initial condition catching-up process countries. for example, recent years, per caput income ireland rise level well euro area early 1990s level well above. in early 1990s gdp per caput ireland represent 75 % average become first 12 euro area countries. last year, level ireland 30% euro area level. moreover, country may experience equilibrate adjustment process follow shock. diversity stem factor also economically justified, need observe within currency areas. in environment high adjustment capacity, divergence interpret desirable equilibrate mechanism, contribute sustainable convergence among euro area countries. however, cases, persistent macroeconomic differential may reflect inappropriate national policies, structural inefficiency rigidity malfunction adjustment mechanism individual euro area countries. differential result factor may detrimental dynamic economic activity employment. these source macroeconomic differential policy-makers concern measure take national level order increase economic flexibility. the importance function product, labour financial market start monetary policy, single monetary policy uniform policy interest rate euro area country cannot, know, directly influence diversity output growth inflation across euro area countries. this emphasis importance country reach sustainable convergence – prescribe maastricht criterion – participate euro area. well-designed structural policy – undertake national level – implement enhance flexibility product labour market thereby increase adjustment capacity economies. such reform aim enhance productivity growth labour utilisation maintain stable macroeconomnic conditions. in context, lisbon strategy fundamental ambitious programme draw attention urgency structural reforms. the unite states, cross-state labour higher, could also consider role model europe. speak audience journalist business executives, i well aware hard task confront – convey message beneficial effect reform growth job creation. in context, essential understand 4 bi review 146/2007 communicate medium long-term benefit structural reform significantly reward initial investment. i encourage responsible party communication efforts. more specifically, labour market, economic flexibility promote remove institutional barrier flexible wage price-setting mechanisms. let stress social partner share responsibility ensure wage determination appropriately take account productivity labour market condition industrial, sectoral regional level jeopardise competitiveness employment. and one also take account fact wage set public sector often serf role model private sector. in addition, early retirement policy significant negative impact labour supply and, hence, participation employment rate. in context wage setting, sufficient wage differentiation need improve employment opportunity less-skilled worker region sector high unemployment. reform also need product markets. let stress importance fully complete single market, particularly service network industries. a deep integration market would stimulate price flexibility foster competition open product markets. this require exist barrier labour capital mobility within euro area removed. great cross-border competition integration market across euro area country would contribute low prices, area europe may find interest benchmark unite states. these reform could also enhance adjustment process individual country event asymmetric shock differ cyclical developments. national authority make substantial contribution, implement sound structural policies, also ensure proper function adjustment mechanism within euro area implement well-designed fiscal policies. here, i would like repeat best contribution fiscal policy make proper function euro area sustainable medium-term oriented, fully line orientation provide stability growth pact. moreover, fiscal policy also focus increase effectiveness efficiency public sector “high quality” expenditure tax policies. large inefficient public sector put brake economic activity impose high tax burden economy channel resource unproductive uses. there, speak germany, i mention germany exemplary contain overall public spend proportion gdp last year despite many challenge difficult environment. in 2007 commission estimate public spend represent 43.8 % gdp, 4.3 percentage point le 1999. cooperation two major monetary authority i hope i convince monetary authority unite state euro area face challenge similar. internally, diversity large area magnitude, although possibly nature. externally, region count large external sector, significant bilateral linkages. similar experience naturally call close work relations. this interaction become particularly intense since advent euro set european central bank eurosystem, time build long-standing history central bank multilateral cooperation various international institution fora, include bank international settlement since 1930s, international monetary fund since mid-1940s, g10 since 1960s, g7 since mid-1970s and, recently, financial stability forum group twenty. bi review 146/2007 5 contact federal reserve these international organisation provide excellent opportunity federal reserve chairman myself, member board well staff feed ecb/eurosystem, meet regularly. to give idea level contact have, i say ben i meet, g7, g10, g20, imf bi meetings, probably little month average. in addition, mr bernanke i jointly participate number international conferences. indeed, regular meetings, ben i build close work relationship, climate mutual trust, platform direct quick contact special circumstance would require urgent communication. why important? the purpose contact coordination monetary policies. this would incompatible orientation policy towards respective domestic objectives. rather, benefit close contact lie in-depth exchange information view recent economic developments, monetary, financial economic outlook respective economies, policy challenge ahead. this includes, i discuss before, trade financial linkage two economies, directly via economies. share first-hand knowledge world outlook see respective domestic economy influence influence global outlook extremely important today’s globalise economy. on rare occasion past, close work relationship also permit work swift action. a prime example decision ecb take afternoon day terrorist attack 11 september 2001. a second example decision take help stabilise money market condition financial market turmoil last summer. here again, close contact feed prove extremely useful share information financial condition central bank action respective economies. the close contact i chairman is, see, tip “iceberg”. our two institution collaborate closely possible levels, involve board members, management staff. across various domain central banking, set joint platform regular exchange information. in field economic research, set international research forum monetary policy discus theoretical empirical aspect monetary policy. so far, four conference organised, fifth one schedule june 2008. in area payment settlement system infrastructure, organise number joint conferences, instance april 2006 central counterparty clearing, well regular meet federal reserve board. even area education, undertake joint work, example conference role central bank economic personal finance education poland 2006, organise narodowy bank polski, federal reserve bank new york ecb. our tie also facilitate geographic proximity. you may surprise hear mention geographic proximity, give centre eurosystem federal reserve system frankfurt washington respectively. however, ecb maintain permanent representative office imf, street away federal reserve board washington. though liaison federal reserve main raison d'être, office another channel close contact interaction. staff member two central bank also participate regularly conference organise institution. for instance, far 2007, ten staff member ecb, federal reserve board federal reserve district bank present research work seminar conference organise one institutions. staff member also regularly visit central bank, spend several day discuss research work technical issues. on occasions, stay even run several 6 bi review 146/2007 months. since 2003, six

albania, vii annual conference bank albania “monetary policy strategy small economies”, tirana, 6 december 2007. * * * dear lady gentlemen, it great pleasure open proceed 7th conference bank albania. on behalf institution i take opportunity welcome participants. i confident follow two day instigate debate discussion key central bank issues. this year’s main topic focus classical function central bank: “monetary policy”. institutional framework, decision make process, monetary transmission efficiency issue relate financial markets, macroeconomic financial stability, make interest topic discussion esteem speakers. i confident panellist well-known senior experts; therefore, behalf institution i would like thank heartily accept share u view findings. give proceed conference extensively cover theoretical model country experience well i would like briefly present evolution central bank last three years. to pleasure enhancement analytical model capacity albanian institution widely recognize yield great ownership medium run economic financial development programs. since begin transition program design implement setup imf conditional support programs. even current policy setup design program. we currently believe final one get imf financial support, imply economy mature albania right track. after many hardship transition, albanian authority full ownership medium-term development program country. this reason bank albania quite long engage comprehensive process scrutinize choose best options. the year come end mark another important chapter context. in contrast previous two years, bank albania deepen cautious research aspect characterize present future monetary policy. it quite long time central bank publicly announce effort assess objectively professionally future bank albania monetary policy. these sporadic effort part process initiate three year ago objective find answer follow questions: should move another monetary policy regime? what regime would appropriate one? i believe share opinion find answer aforementioned question easy thing. this plain mechanical action. in last three year bank albania involve intensive process assessment, analysis conclusion future monetary policy. and alone throughout process. bi review 146/2007 1 together albanian institution – first foremost fiscal authorities, different european regional central banks, international financial institution academia, try identify suitable monetary policy regime adopted. during last three years, toss idea scrupulously study detail fully fledge inflation target regime. base current feature expect development financial markets, believe inflation target regime provide best policy choice future. a relatively long history low inflation, constant soundness macroeconomic situation, stable sound bank system, free float exchange rate, suitable institutional framework, fiscal consolidation important factor convince u potential success inflation target regime. however, aware still lot do context, particular far monetary transmission mechanism financial market efficiency concerned. furthermore, relatively rapid considerable development albanian economy sure advantage complete independent monetary policy framework provide large size disadvantages. therefore, currency board consider possible option future. on hand, current operational target (quantitative limit net asset bank albania bank system), so-called performance criteria, part today’s decision-making, might able preserve bind power expiration conditional agreement imf 2008. these intermediate objective may replace concrete transparent objective inflation rate, provide direct communication monetary policy decision economy order achieve main target bank albania. consequently, summarize previously say identify inflation target regime best choice versus currency board monetary targeting. another argument support choice various internationally recognize expert compare current setup monetary policy implicit inflation target framework. furthermore, believe regime provide good platform harmonize monetary policy fiscal one, imply fiscal authority seriously commit support propose setup. to purpose, invite albanian government reach consensus key objective policies, monetary fiscal, adopt convergence criterion strategic goal. success endeavour require albania, among things, continuity path sound macro policy even strengthen further. this mean monetary policy focus maintain price stability prudent fiscal policy ensure albania’s deficit debt ratio sustainable low level increase attractiveness international investors. put differently pursue monetary policy focus price stability prudent fiscal policy, doubt reduce albania’s risk premium. the benefit achievement felt throughout economy. to support idea i tell one fresh news. yesterday albania succeed sell internationally seven year fix rate bond lek. this result toss coin, reflection international confidence albanian economy macro policies. this confidence increase 2008, 2009 beyond. regardless monetary policy regime say chance setup successful great develop financial market, understand properly monetary policy signal transmit adequately economy. monetary policy efficiency imply financial market efficiency. 2 bi review 146/2007 this issue part early discussions; however i would like highlight recently take concrete step improve certain financial market segments. we currently try adopt set measure facilitate reformation process financial market deepen it. in concrete terms, government security market interbank market particularly special focus. after several consultation actor place decide come package initiative priority 2008 whose purpose establish incentive minimize risk albanian financial market: - broaden deepen base participant government security market start january 2008 increase investors’ base, eligible directly invest auction government bonds. we believe increase competition so-far privilege enjoy bank system. - reduce interbank market risk so far, bank system apply limit amount lend interbank market. therefore, work introduce new law repurchase agreements, enable risk-free conduct repurchase agreement among commercial banks. - establish delivery versus payment system in order minimize payment settlement risk facilitate intermediation type transaction involve collateralize loans, repurchase agreement outright purchase sale government papers, work put practice principle delivery versus payment system. - enhance interbank market efficiency in collaboration ministry finance agree le frequent government treasury bill auctions. moreover size issue auction schedule increase. this le frequent auction schedule increase number transaction interbank market period in-between two auction bank try reduce cost liquidity. on hand limit opportunity bank liquid base distribute treasury bill investment consequently, seek market option interbank market. - introduce prime rate be convince monetary policy may efficient transparency bank albania aim introduce first half 2008 “prime rate” set orientation rate use commercial banks. regardless measure adopt i would like say financial market segment need come along u challenge. i say financial intermediation role financial institution weak substantial influence intermediation reallocation financial fund economy. i think today’s reality provide lot room make capital market reactive. accord estimates, number major company certify well-known international auditor ever-increasingly become larger. further speech i would like focus another priority bank albania, financial stability. it hold true macroeconomic stability crucial precede important economic financial developments. without macroeconomic stability neither growth, foreign investment reallocation; consequently development. however, macroeconomic stability without financial stability would utopia; would like non-standing bridge. this reason pay special attention bi review 146/2007 3 financial stability throughout 2007. the recent development sub-prime mortgage loan must serve excellent reminder never end surprise time time cause lot turmoil financial market stability. moreover episode highlight necessity harmony monetary policy financial stability. i want make clear financial stability i assume absence financial crisis. first foremost imply functional efficient financial system intermediation role. i personally believe tight regulation truly minimize risks, hand might always conducive sustain growth. therefore, real challenge face find optimal balance deregulation, promote market force financial innovations, negative consequence possible market failure financial crises. obviously, optimal balance hard actualize daily practice. therefore empirical study need made, i believe one main priority newly establish financial stability department. however, i would like underline supervisory authority prudent present year, consider among others rapid growth credit portfolio last 2-3 years. i take opportunity inform bank system public large start january 2008 credit registry begin operate. special attention pay strengthen bank supervision, particular part relate governance commercial banks. moreover, require transparency bank system accountable relationship public. the continuous improvement human capacity involve internal control risk management long time concern bank albania. with reference latter i would like underscore already identify three great risk whose presence would severe consequence financial stability. i say group risk characterize whole region; consequently lot room cooperation context. 1 credit risk credit risk directly relate boom credit economy last years. although statistic indicate share non-performing loan low, prudence required. we know rat re-rating method may tool hand bank keep reality away truth. the entrance big international foreign group put upward pressure bank operator attempt compete borrower may often deteriorate credit portfolio quality. moreover, let u forget companies’ balance sheet lack transparency make another issue matter. to conclude i would like say current development real estate market may potentially negative impact. a considerable rise price real estate account 80 per cent collateral may negative impact case sudden fall price fix asset market. 2 exchange rate risk a november 2007 outstanding credit share 70 per cent foreign currency credit 30 per cent local currency. it impression figure similar whole region. extend credit foreign currency borrower income national currency mean sudden exchange rate depreciation could threaten capacity repay. 4 bi review 146/2007 3 contagion risk result presence big bank group throughout region currently witness large-scale penetration big international bank group throughout region. this development obviously welcome provide good efficient allocation free asset economy. however, i believe prudence require context. a disturb issue parent bank concern one branch region may cause turbulence fact bank group large market shares. moreover, host-host supervision-related concern cover basle standard make whole situation even complex. in conclusion, i would like highlight work guide simple progressive philosophy aim at: - establish sound operate structures; - conclude improve legal regulatory base; - absorb qualify professional human capacity cope future challenges. i express belief bank albania fully capable full ownership design implement monetary policy. dear participants, i try give short overview work last years. i sure speakers’ presentation discussion conference help u good understand certain issue provide answer several questions. i truly believe participant active bring focus new aspects, different experience alternative perspective viewpoints. i wish good proceedings. bi review 146/2007 5 randall s kroszner: loan modification foreclosure prevention testimony mr randall s kroszner, member board governor u federal reserve system, committee financial services, u house representatives, washington dc, 6 december 2007. * * * chairman frank, rank member bachus, member committee, i appreciate opportunity appear today discus recent problem subprime mortgage market possible legislative responses. the challenge face house market moment significant. increase number homeowner community experience problems. we continue work find implement best sustainable solution current challenges. background in recent years, subprime market grow dramatically, enable borrower obtain credit traditionally would unable access it. increase number lender enter market, underwrite standards, industry practices, risk-based price evolve along subprime market. the growth market well recognized. also well recognize problem arise changes. the board belief responsible subprime lend important role play expand credit traditionally underserved borrowers. it also recognizes, however, lend undertake recent year neither responsible prudent. mortgage delinquency foreclosure rate increase substantially past months. over 17 percent subprime adjustable-rate mortgage serious delinquency end september, rate three time high mid-2005. serious delinquency also increase among near-prime prime mortgages, although delinquency remain much low among subprime mortgages. lender initiate foreclosure proceed average 320,000 loan per quarter first half year, 240,000 loan per quarter precede two years. one significant factor increase delinquency rate slow house prices. price decrease slightly nation whole third quarter 2007, decline dramatically regions. over quarter homeowner report house decrease value past year, bite level last see early 1990s.1 these price change affect homeowners' ability resolve financial trouble refinance mortgage pull equity homes, may lead increase defaults. in addition, borrower whose mortgage balance exceed house value may tempt walk away loans. borrower purchase property solely investment purpose may likely default situation; indeed, mortgage bankers' association find disproportionate share serious delinquency associate non-owner-occupied property state high increase delinquencies. a recently release study federal reserve bank 1 reuters/university michigan survey consumers, november 2007. bi review 146/2007 1 boston attribute recent rise foreclosure massachusetts decline house prices.2borrowers lose jobs, surprisingly, may difficulty meet mortgage payments. thus, increase unemployment certain areas, state midwest struggle job cut auto industry, another major factor contribute high delinquency rates. the final major factor explain current increase delinquency rate apparent deterioration underwrite standard begin late 2005. an increase number subprime loan make layer additional risk factors, lack full documentation high loan-to-value ratios. much weaken underwrite standard happen outside institution regulate federal bank agencies. for instance, 2006, 45 percent high-cost first mortgage originate independent mortgage companies.3 in addition, prior late 2005, high demand house rise house price allow borrower recover risk profitable home sale refinancings, hide weaken underwrite standard view. the slowdown house prices, couple shift underwrite standards, likely explanation pronounce rise see default occur within month origination, borrower would experience significant change payment obligation financial situations. look forward, expect substantial payment increase often experience first interest-rate reset result high delinquencies. from end next year, quarter roughly one ten borrower adjustable-rate subprime mortgage schedule experience first rate reset.4 in addition, tighten credit condition report federal reserve's senior loan officer survey suggest refinance may become difficult. in past, many borrower experience reset able avoid payment increase refinance mortgages. the recent decline house price current tight credit conditions, however, reduce viability option significant number borrowers. the federal reserve's response problem subprime market a i testify committee october, federal reserve actively work respond challenges. if benefit homeownership realized, believe homeownership must sustainable access responsible lend available consumers. to achieve this, board belief must appropriate consumer protection responsible lend traditionally underserved borrowers. accordingly, continue coordinate federal state agencies, consult consumer advocates, lenders, investors, others. we take issue seriously, and, along federal bank regulators, begin issue guidance subprime lend 1999 institution regulate. we significantly expand guidance 2001, issue guidance non-traditional mortgage product (such payment-option interest-only loans) 2006, issue guidance adjustable-rate subprime mortgage early year. i would like take opportunity share brief update work federal reserve undertake issues. 2 kristopher gerardi, adam hale shapiro, paul willen, "subprime outcomes: risky mortgages, homeownership experiences, foreclosures,” federal reserve bank boston work paper 07-15, 2007. 3 2006 home mortgage disclosure act data. 4 federal reserve board staff calculation base data first american loanperformance. 2 bi review 146/2007 coordinate enforcement consumer protection law first, enforcement consumer protection law regulation critical federal reserve enforce measure oversight institution examines. a mortgage industry diversified, increase coordination among regulator helpful. in particular, need cooperate state bank regulator increase importance, respond need. in vein, launch cooperative pilot project federal state agency conduct review certain non-depository lender involve subprime market. the review evaluate underwrite standards, risk-management strategies, compliance certain consumer protection law regulations. this initiative bring together federal reserve, office thrift supervision, federal trade commission, state agency represent conference state bank supervisor (csbs) american association residential mortgage regulator (aarmr). the company review include supervise federal agencies, well independent entity license states. loss mitigation effort second, board, along federal financial agencies, work guide federally supervise institution deal mortgage default delinquencies. the federal financial institution agency issue statement work mortgage borrower april 2007, and, cooperation csbs, statement loss mitigation strategy servicers residential mortgage september 2007. together, statement encourage institution work proactively borrower may face delinquency foreclosure, encourage servicers securitized residential mortgage determine full extent authority restructure fail loan pursue appropriate loss mitigation strategies. the board continue encourage servicers investor make every effort keep trouble borrower homes. i, member board, numerous meet recent month wide array market participant consumer advocate understand complexity issue encourage appropriate responses. each twelve federal reserve bank work financial institution community group around country address challenge pose loan performance problems. and federal reserve board's staff work consumer community affair group throughout federal reserve system help identify locality risk high foreclosures, intent help local group good focus outreach effort borrowers. we also talk lenders, servicers investors, independently well hope now alliance, support prudent effort reach many borrower possible. many servicers establish procedure identify segment borrower current could face trouble reset, contact borrower ahead reset, systematically evaluate ability borrower make high payments. on basis analysis, sometimes present prudent refinance loan modification alternative borrower. other efforts, fhasecure product various state local efforts, play role avoid foreclosure. a i discus moment, support effort foreclosure generally bad possible option consumers, investors, communities, avoid whenever viable option exist. change exist terms, however, make lightly, consistent safe sound lend practices, make delay loss investor consumers. in short, pursue sustainable solutions. bi review 146/2007 3 consumer protection regulation finally, board continue work toward effective consumer protection rules. we soon begin extensive consumer test ensure new disclosure effective comprehensible. late month, propose change truth lend act (tila) rule require early disclosure lender address concern mislead mortgage loan advertisements. the board recognizes, however, improve disclosure necessary sufficient address problems. in addition actions, therefore, federal reserve exercise rulemaking authority home ownership equity protection act (hoepa) address unfair deceptive mortgage lend practices. at time propose tila rule change advertise time disclosures, issue, public comment, significant new rule would apply subprime loan offer mortgage lenders. in formulate proposal, look closely practice subprime mortgage market, prepayment penalties, failure offer escrow account tax insurance, stated-income low-documentation lending, failure give adequate consideration borrower's ability repay. i assure propose rule base detail analysis issue statutory authority address them, extraordinary outreach effort gather wide range information opinions, attempt balance need adequately protect consumer maintain responsible lend markets. the rule reflect input obtain public meet 2006 hear deal specifically issue i chair past june. we also consider nearly 100 comment letters, follow june meeting, consult federal state agency consumer advisory council. finally, continue meet with, listen inform opinion from, consumer groups, financial service industry, lawmakers, others ensure propose rule likely achieve goal adequate consumer protection without shut access responsible credit. legislative response congress express understandable appropriate concern subprime lend challenge mortgage market generally. we commend leader congress look problem wrestle challenge address abusive lend encourage responsible lending. the mortgage reform anti-predatory lend act 2007, pass house representative last month, would extend additional oversight consumer protection market. we ask today's testimony comment two issues, address current version act, could address amendment actions. loan modification one issue possible legal exposure servicers mortgage enter loan modification workout plans. because loan servicers play critical role implement possible loss mitigation strategies, timely important question. we believe investor servicers generally want work borrower avoid foreclosure. prudent loss mitigation technique avoid foreclosure help homeowners, usually cost-effective investors. borrower current payment could default reset, instance, may able work lender servicer adjust payment otherwise change loan make manageable. work borrower experience payment problem benefits; instance, late payment affect borrowers' credit 4 bi review 146/2007 scores, preserve wide range option include refinancing. such proactive outreach servicers may mean difference loan payment default, particularly lower-income family may little financial cushion. give substantial number reset expect end 2008, interest industry go historically join together explore collaborative, creative effort develop prudent loan modification program assistance help large group borrower systematically. such program streamline speed process anticipate address delinquent loans, reduce transaction costs, provide guidance borrower mortgage counselors. many servicers are, fact, work counselor play crucial role help homeowners, many even communicate servicers fear, embarrassment, misinformation options. loan modification program bottom-up approach design balance need parties, encourage progress make industry advance programs. because systematic approach deal trouble loan often likely lead good aggregate investor return foreclosures, encourage industry effort pursue approaches. when servicers modify loans, however, may face potential litigation risk investor contractual obligation service agreements. one particular source litigation risk, understand, may different asset class conflict interests. therefore, encourage ongoing industry effort agree standard address issues. we hopeful industry resolve conflict consensual basis preclude servicers take action overall best interest consumer industry. more generally, board support effort industry others develop reasonable standardize approach deal challenges. such approaches, apply consistently predictably, reduce uncertainty ultimately help market function. prudent workout arrangement consistent safe sound lend practice generally long-term best interest financial institution borrower, may instance arrangement prudent appropriate. in try help homeowners, must also careful recognize exist legal right investors, avoid action may unintended consequence disrupt orderly function market, unnecessarily reduce future access credit. provision intend immunize servicers liability craft avoid create moral hazard party disregard contractual obligations, would ultimately negative impact market consumers. sustainable solutions, simply hide short term real repayment challenges, goal. pattern practice violation a second issue possible imposition civil money penalty enforcement agency find pattern practice violations. penalty collect would use establish trust fund consumer whose interest harm lack remedy event, instance, responsible party go business. the proper magnitude penalties, circumstance imposed, congress' decision make. a general rule, board belief penalty violation law sufficient deter prohibit conduct, also reasonably relate injury cause violation. penalty clearly articulated, reasonably match magnitude violation, appropriate effective form deterrence. we would recommend amount civil money penalties, imposed, give ceiling well floor market uncertainty introduce open-ended liability. we would also suggest discretion actual amount bi review 146/2007 5 penalty, within range, give enforce agencies. this sort flexibility enforcement would help agency adjust punishment fit infraction. the propose increase civil money penalty draw attention critical role enforcement play ensure compliance new responsibility enact congress. but effectiveness increase penalty diminish lack enforcement resources. a congress weigh merit bill possible amendments, would encourage also look resource need agency authorize take enforcement action ensure sufficient resource important role available. conclusion the board recognize magnitude challenge face mortgage borrower today. we understand uncertainty harm experience consumer across country house market challenge continue. we engage array activity respond concerns. in come weeks, propose new rule regard advertising, time disclosures, practice find unfair deceptive hoepa authority, believe offer increase protection consumers. we look forward continue work congress achieve sustainable solution challenge mortgage market. 6 bi review 146/2007 malcolm d knight: european financial integration context current financial market turbulence keynote remark mr malcolm d knight, general manager bank international settlements, 2007 eurofi conference “achieving integration european financial market global context”, brussels, 3 december 2007. * * * let thank opportunity address distinguish group executive policymakers. eurofi play lead role identify key strategic issue need address advance towards fundamental goal achieve comprehensive financial integration europe, promote close dialogue market participant policymakers particular financial regulators. in brief remark tonight i want first underscore several important achievement financial integration europe thus far key progress. then i outline several feature current international financial market turmoil implication future progress european financial integration. finally, i comment preliminary lesson financial disturbance currently witness may important shape ongoing process financial integration come years. european financial integration the achievement european financial integration past two decade truly impressive. prior advent euro 1999, european authority take deep successful step stabilise cross-country exchange rate eliminate control international capital movement within euro zone. the introduction single currency le nine year ago lead acceleration financial integration eliminate intra-zone exchange rate risk achieve low stable inflation. indeed, establishment common currency back european central bank clear monetary policy mandate underpin firm fiscal rule help clarify policy responsibility make transparent structure huge multi-country economic region. this expect positive effect european economy and, indeed, global markets. over past two decades, inflation euro area country come substantially, nominal interest rate fallen, inflation expectation become well anchor low stable levels. a result achievements, european central bank rapidly establish key credible institution global financial markets. in itself, move towards great macroeconomic stability boost european financial integration. from early year euro, issuance corporate debt security surged, support elimination exchange rate risk within currency zone high demand large pool investors. likewise, deep euro area-wide interbank money market develop rapidly. this key component – indeed, perhaps key component – financial infrastructure euro zone. it rapid development owe much major effort european central bank elaborate monetary policy procedure liquidity operations. to sure, european financial integration proceed pace across sector markets. integration retail bank markets, instance, remain limited, reflect persistence legal, institutional regulatory differences. but thing moving. even cursory read financial press show financial integration make visible progress almost day day. bi review 146/2007 1 the current financial market turmoil but current turmoil global financial market impact positive picture i sketch you? let recall turmoil follow prolong period broadly base aggressive risk-taking reflect unusually low risk premia low volatility across many asset classes. thus, prior last summer, many careful observer believe price risk low – increase risk premia widely see healthy financial stability perspective. there large element wisdom point view. nevertheless, risk aversion suddenly jump last summer major surprises. a first surprise shock one specific segment mortgage sector unite state lead severe adverse effect country, also euro zone, unite kingdom canada. the impact euro zone surprise many observer increase financial integration greatly strengthen european financial system. a second surprise sudden evaporation liquidity major interbank markets, persist since summer transmit tension credit market heart international financial system. the distortion interbank money market occur mainly unite states, euro zone key economies, unite kingdom. they much le severe japan; major emerge market economy weather global turmoil relatively well far. in euro area, spread market expectation overnight interest rate next three month (the eonia swap interest rate) rate commercial bank borrow period – three-month libor rate – suddenly jump august stay elevate since, usually basis point only. indeed, spread widen since early november, around 75 bp today. since interbank credit market uncollateralised, large premium presumably reflect increase liquidity credit risk concerns, even among large banks. liquidity credit risk what main cause behind unexpected upsurge liquidity risk credit risk? i would stress two key factors: information failure credit markets; weakness “originate-and-distribute” business model adopt recent year large internationally active banks. first, opacity certain part global financial marketplace, particularly market structure financial product off-balance sheet vehicle design hold (the famous “conduits” sivs), lead sudden collapse confidence asset valuation generalise distrust counterparties. a result, market participant wonder size character banks’ exposure – include large european bank – existence explicit implicit backup credit line wide variety market players. begin last summer, crisis confidence trigger evaporation market liquidity instrument concern fund liquidity squeeze institution suspect vulnerable them. second, weakness “originate-and-distribute” business model large banks, primarily unite state europe. there positive aspect model, since help diversify banks’ revenue stream risks. but operation model recent year associate excessive relaxation standard credit origination credit monitor financial system whole. a result current turmoil, originator securitisers complex financial instrument become – many case surprise – “holders last resort” exotic credit products. this development also underline weakness risk management practice investors, underprice risk concern rely excessively 2 bi review 146/2007 external rat monitor risk. and demonstrate wide distribution risk across financial system, support transparency market discipline, make difficult gauge risk exposure market participants. the combination two factor – inadequate public information credit market weakness way credit risk distribute market – help explain current turbulence primarily affect interbank market core modern global financial system weakness foresee last summer. because focus balance sheet regulate bank institutions, observer wrongly underestimate actual degree leverage financial system whole – i mean leverage generate activity commercial banks, also highly leverage institutions, sivs, conduits, lbo-financed firms, etc; is, leverage institution that, implicitly not, predicate backup credit line provide regulate institution time stress. look forward i believe financial integration take place euro zone since advent euro 1999 contribute importantly remarkable rise live standard great financial economic stability. it follow continue financial integration essential remarkable progress europe. so question is: lesson draw current financial turbulence help make future course european financial integration strong immune financial disturbance core? i pretend answer question – least yet. but close let offer four think relevant it. first, firm euro zone monetary policy continue play key role foster european financial integration. the european central bank show great success maintain appropriate monetary stance time fine-tune liquidity operation interbank market ensure overnight rate remain broadly target, monetary condition continue set effectively give prevail macroeconomic conditions. and ecb also lead central bank take action address dislocation longer-term interbank money markets, even though prove difficult realise give term premium come banks’ uncertainty liquidity counterparty risks. my second think clearly need great transparency financial market side atlantic. this take many forms. one reduce product complexity: i expect see emphasis financial asset – include structure product – simple feature make le illiquid difficult market conditions. another refine rat scale assets, give investor good sense risk characteristics. there sign already happen marketplace, rat agency market participant adjust methodology assess rat risk. third, need improvement risk management practice – least liquidity management financial firms; standard credit origination; monitor debt service performance borrowers. experience suggest prior current turbulence investor underestimate tail risk exposed, include interdependency credit, market liquidity risks. improvement stress test play key role here. needle say, stress test consider cross-country nature euro area financial system. finally, great financial stability call close communication cooperation among player financial system, within official sector, also official private sectors. this especially true euro area give multiplicity jurisdiction layer responsibility, put premium cooperation. meet like bi review 146/2007 3 suggest lesson well understand party involved. this augur well future. 4 bi review 146/2007 european central bank: press conference – introductory statement introductory statement mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank mr lucas papademos, vice-president european central bank, frankfurt main, 6 december 2007. * * * lady gentlemen, vice-president i please welcome today’s press conference. let report outcome meeting, also attend president eurogroup, prime minister juncker, commissioner almunia. on basis regular economic monetary analyses, decide today’s meet leave key ecb interest rate unchanged. the late information confirm existence strong short-term upward pressure inflation, hicp inflation rate reach 3.0% november. it also fully confirm assessment upside risk price stability medium term. against background, money credit growth remain vigorous euro area, govern council stand ready counter upside risk price stability, require mandate. the economic fundamental euro area remain sound. however, reappraisal risk financial market still evolve accompany continue uncertainty potential impact real economy. we therefore monitor closely developments. by act firm timely manner basis assessment, ensure second-round effect risk price stability medium term materialise. firmly anchor medium long-term inflation expectation line price stability important time financial market volatility increase uncertainty. a regard financial markets, continue pay great attention development come weeks. allow explain assessment great detail, start economic analysis. accord eurostat’s first estimate, quarter-on-quarter growth rate euro area real gdp third quarter 2007 0.7%, line early flash estimate. domestic demand remain main driver economic growth third quarter, confirm sustain nature economic expansion euro area. the late information economic activity various confidence survey indicator-based estimate support assessment economic growth continue fourth quarter year, though probably moderate pace third quarter. overall, fundamental euro area remain sound. profitability sustained, employment growth robust unemployment rate fall level see 25 years. these factor also reflect december 2007 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections. annual real gdp growth project lie range 2.4% 2.8% 2007, 1.5% 2.5% 2008, 1.6% 2.6% 2009. in comparison september ecb staff projections, range project real gdp growth 2008 revise slightly downwards, whereas 2007 new range lie within upper part previous one. available forecast international organisation broadly confirm outlook. the scenario sustain real gdp growth broadly line trend potential base expectation global economy remain resilient, slowdown economic growth unite state partly offset continue strength emerge market economies. external demand therefore provide ongoing support euro area export investment. consumption growth also contribute economic expansion, line development real disposable income, continue employment growth provide supportive conditions. that said, view potential impact ongoing financial market volatility re-pricing risk real economy, level uncertainty remain high. bi review 145/2007 1 in govern council’s view, risk surround outlook economic growth lie downside. they relate mainly potential broad impact ongoing reappraisal risk financial market finance condition confidence world euro area growth, possible oil commodity price rises, well concern protectionist pressure possible disorderly development owe global imbalances.50 a regard price developments, accord eurostat’s flash estimate, annual hicp inflation rate increase sharply november 2007, 3.0% 2.6% october. oil price rise strongly recent months, food price increase substantially, reflect high global demand. in addition, emphasise previous occasions, currently midst period unfavourable effect energy price strong upward impact annual hicp inflation rates, owe mark decline oil price year ago. look ahead, hicp inflation rate expect remain significantly 2% come months, likely moderate gradually course 2008. hence, period temporarily high rate inflation would somewhat protract previously expected. the december eurosystem staff projection foresee annual hicp inflation 2.0% 2.2% 2007, rise 2.0% 3.0% 2008. for 2009, hicp inflation project lie 1.2% 2.4%. compare september 2007 ecb staff projections, project range hicp inflation 2007 2008 shift upwards. forecast international organisation incorporate recent inflation development give broadly similar picture. these projection largely mirror assume path oil food prices, available future price suggest deceleration course next year. on domestic side, unit labour cost growth project increase projection horizon. in context important emphasise staff projection assume recent oil food price dynamic impact hicp inflation broadly-based second-round effect wage-setting behaviour. this key assumption. a key assumption growth profit margin moderate projection horizon. in combination, two assumption imply, context staff projections, continuation overall contain domestic cost pressures, contribute moderation inflation project 2009. in govern council’s view, risk medium-term outlook price development fully confirm lie upside. these risk include possibility rise oil agricultural prices, continue strong momentum observe recent months, well increase administer price indirect tax beyond foresee thus far. moreover, take account existence capacity constraints, favourable momentum real gdp growth observe past quarter positive development labour markets, strong currently expect wage growth may emerge. furthermore, increase price power market segment low competition could materialise. it therefore crucial party concern meet responsibility second-round effect wage price-setting stem recent commodity price rise avoided. to end, explicit de facto indexation nominal wage price eliminated. the monetary analysis confirm prevail upside risk price stability medium longer-term horizons. money credit continue grow vigorously recent months. the annual growth rate m3 october, 12.3%, likely influence number temporary factors, flatten yield curve, financial market turmoil specific transaction associate restructure certain bank groups. however, even take special factor account, underlie rate monetary expansion remain strong. moreover, sustain expansion loan

remittance abroad. this particularly true serbian diaspora germany 700,000 serbian national still live – let u clear this, i refer still hold serbian passports, good say, yugoslav passports! though fellow citizen leave serbia, do various reason economic political nature, order obtain good employment opportunity flee war-torn regions, etc. – share common denominator. all send money serbia. and, send lot it! base estimates, around usd 3, 0 billion 8.1% gdp send serbia 2006, usd 300 million germany alone! these transaction two important aspects: social – assistance stay behind, care elderly,

jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, economic monetary affair committee european parliament, brussels, 19 december 2007. * * * madame la présidente, madame et monsieur le membres de la commission economique et monétaire, je réjouis d'apparaître devant votre commission aujourd'hui. je commencerai mon intervention par une évaluation de la situation économique et monétaire, en expliquant le raisons sous-jacentes à no récentes décisions de taux. ensuite, je vous fournirai de plus amples information sur le opérations de politique monétaire de la bce en réaction aux tension enregistrées sur le marché monétaire ainsi que sur la stabilité du système financier de la zone euro. zum abschluss möchte ich ein paar anmerkungen zu den auswirkungen d globalisierung auf die preisentwicklung sowie zu entwicklungen im immobiliensektor machen. economic monetary development since previous appearance european parliament early october, incoming information fully confirm view that, context vigorous money credit growth sound economic fundamental euro area, risk price stability medium term clearly upside, i said, behalf govern council, meet thursday, 6 december. the recent substantial increase oil food prices, together unfavourable base effect energy prices, owe mark decline oil price year ago, strong upward impact inflation current context. look ahead, inflation rate expect remain significantly 2% near future, likely moderate gradually course 2008. hence period temporarily high inflation rate would somewhat protract previously expected. look ahead, december eurosystem staff macroeconomic projection foresee annual hicp inflation 2.0% 2.2% 2007, rise 2.0% 3.0% 2008, moderate range 1.2% 2.4% 2009. compare september staff projections, range 2007 2008 shift upwards. these staff projection base two key assumptions. the first recent oil food price dynamic impact hicp inflation broadly-based second-round effect wage-setting behaviour. the second key assumption growth profit margin moderate projection horizon. these two assumption imply, context staff projections, continuation overall contain domestic cost pressures, contribute moderation inflation project 2009. it view govern council risk medium-term outlook price development fully confirm lie upside, mainly relate possible rise oil agricultural prices, increase administer price indirect tax beyond foresee thus far. in addition, background sound economic fundamentals, strong currently expect wage dynamic may emerge, increase price power market segment low competition could materialise. a regard economic activity, incoming information confirm sustain nature economic expansion euro area, real gdp grow 0.7% quarter-on-quarter third quarter, indicate moderation fourth quarter. overall, economic fundamental euro area remain sound. look ahead, eurosystem staff bi review 151/2007 1 project annual real gdp growth lie 2.4% 2.8% 2007, 1.5% 2.5% 2008, 1.6% 2.6% 2009. in comparison september 2007 ecb staff projections, range project real gdp growth 2008 revise slightly downwards, whereas 2007 new range lie within upper part previous one. this scenario base expectation global economy remain resilient, slowdown economic growth unite state partly offset continue strength emerge market economies. however, view potential impact ongoing financial market volatility re-pricing risk real economy, assessment remain surround high level uncertainty. and govern council’s view, risk surround outlook economic growth lie downside. the monetary analysis confirm prevail upside risk price stability medium longer-term horizons. on basis late available data, cover period end october, underlie money credit expansion remain vigourous, even take temporary factor account, flatten yield curve, financial market turmoil specific transaction associate restructure certain bank groups. therefore, monetary credit development continue require careful monitoring, least view good understand response private sector increase financial market volatility. thus far, little evidence financial market turbulence since early august strongly influence dynamic broad money credit aggregates. indeed, expansion loan household non-financial corporation remain robust, may suggest supply credit impaired. to develop complete view impact financial market development bank balance sheets, finance condition money credit growth, data analysis required. the ecb’s govern council stand ready counter upside risk price stability, line mandate. against background, 6 december decide leave key ecb interest rate unchanged. the govern council monitor closely developments. in particular, recent increase inflation remain temporary, essential price wage-setting behaviour remain unaffected current inflation rates, avoid emergence second-round effects. by act firm timely manner basis assessment, govern council ensure second-round effect risk price stability medium term materialise. to firmly anchor inflation expectation line price stability even important time financial market volatility increase uncertainty. in respect, govern council continue pay great attention financial market developments. monetary policy operation lady gentlemen, govern council define monetary policy stance necessary maintain price stability medium term, line mandate define treaty, ecb responsibility also ensure smooth function segment money market influence. i like underline – – two responsibility clearly distinct mixed. since last meet october, tension continue observe last period bank express concern liquidity need year-end. the new-year period traditionally period scarce liquidity, market activity subdue bank prepare year-end balance sheets. in open market operations, ecb therefore pursue endeavour contribute smooth function euro money market. in particular, renew two supplementary long-term refinance operation lengthen maturity main refinance operation settle 19 december one two weeks, thus facilitate 2 bi review 151/2007 coverage year-end liquidity need banks. for specific operation, announce would satisfy bid receive 4.21 percent above, 4.21 percent level weight average rate previous main refinance operation one week before. this announcement consistent early communication actions. it aim minimise uncertainty bank face bid operation cover end year, keep interest rate close ecb’s minimum bid rate. in main refinance operation since begin august ecb allot significantly large amount liquidity normal circumstance aim limit volatility short term rate around ecb’s minimum bid rate. these large amount liquidity always absorb late maintenance period ecb provide bank liquidity need fulfilment reserve requirement average maintenance periods. let also underline provide operation solid collateral, always. overall, ecb’s action permit maintain short-term rate close ecb’s policy rate. the tensions, observe long term money market rate due particular persistence uncertainty surround financial health liquidity need financial institution well impact ongoing global financial market correction, general re-appreciation risks. under tense circumstances, let mention that, reduce volatility short-term rate around key policy rate ecb contain pressure interbank term money market, ecb’s monetary policy operation contribute good resilience european financial system without – course – eliminate cause tensions, originate outside money market. during period, eurosystem remained, usual, close contact major central banks. in context, 12 december ecb, federal reserve, bank england, bank canada swiss national bank announce measure design address elevate pressure short-term fund markets. in particular, ecb participate joint action federal reserve swiss national bank. the ecb offer total 20 billion u dollar two auction eurosystem counterparties ecb-eligible collateral. through action well joint effort central banks, eurosystem well community central bank show capacity cope number challenge euro global money market currently facing. more ever, period tensions, lucidity diagnosis, rapidity decision, absence complacency essence. this absence complacency particularly necessary regard financial stability. financial stability i would like share assessment financial stability situation, describe recent financial stability review. i discus briefly role financial institution supervisory authority cop present financial market correction. with financial system undergo process de-leveraging re-intermediation, uncertainty surround financial stability outlook euro area heighten may persist become clear potential balance sheet effect turbulence spread across individual financial institutions. clarity also need concern liquidity commitment off-balance sheet vehicles, magnitude asset may re-intermediated back onto balance sheet euro area financial institutions. the process improve clarity, start q3 2007 financial statement become available, advance institution publish annual audit account 2007 whole. bi review 151/2007 3 give uncertainties, adjustment process financial system come period may challenging, prepare materialisation risk time. that said, mitigate factor include broadly favourable economic outlook, largely sound balance sheet household firms, generally sound capital position core financial firms. this not, however, provide grind complacency give heighten uncertainties. in fluid environment financial system condition may unexpectedly change, prudence essence policymakers financial institutions. concern role financial institution supervisory authority cop financial turmoil, i would submit three observations. first, give underlie factor financial stress, order re-establish confidence within financial system, crucial promote widespread consistent valuation complex structure product well adequate disclosure bank exposures, particular relate u sub-prime mortgage sector. second, i would welcome effort supervisory community, namely basel committee bank supervision committee european bank supervisors, keep abreast development consider jointly possible measure contain potential effect turmoil. third, i would underline importance stress situations, like current one, effective smooth cooperation exchange information supervisory authority central banks. a policy lesson learn order avoid recurrence similar disruption future, i would say that, still early draw firm conclusions, common understand key issue require analysis. in respect, let recall topics. first, need financial industry provide public information securitisation, credit risk transfer complex structure products. second, need rat agency review methodology complex structure product address seriously potential conflict interest. third, need investor review investment behaviour excessively reliant ratings. fourth, need supervisor implement new capital framework basel ii rapidly effectively possible reflect possible improvement framework, include enhancement supervisory regime liquidity risk. in context, i mention ecb assistance bank supervision committee carry work banks’ stress-testing contingency fund plans. on issue mention above, work already way international european level. the ecb strongly supportive work financial stability forum, well european initiative discuss ecofin council. in context, i would like stress importance effective cooperation policy action take international level. the impact globalisation price development lady gentlemen, let turn impact globalisation price developments. a preface, let say globalisation could influence aggregate price several ways, impact limit short term give inflation ultimately monetary phenomenon. the direct, perhaps visible effect globalisation consumers, implication relative prices. on one hand, globalisation dampen increase euro area import price manufacture good give rise share import lower-cost country china new eu member states. on hand, rise demand associate globalisation contribute significant increase observe world energy commodity prices. although relative price shock necessarily affect inflation, prolong short term impact sizeable relative price shock could result, instance, adjustment friction economy. empirical study euro area 4 bi review 151/2007 tend suggest small dampen influence trade openness price early part decade, though globalisation’s contribution recent movement commodity price – particularly energy food – significant offset upward impact prices. this warrant close monitoring, particular give risk second round effects. in case food relate commodities, also underline importance efficient supply side adjustment agricultural commodity markets. a separate nonetheless potentially equally important channel globalisation affect inflation involve indirect price impact increase competitive pressures, two main aspects. first, principle could contribute compress firms’ price-cost mark-ups competitive force result trade openness would depress profit mark-ups domestic firm compete international firms. in practice, however, effect hard identify and, indeed, aggregate profitability remain high. second, principle competition associate globalisation could alter responsiveness price cost measure economic slack, imply great role foreign condition inflation process. in practice, would appear responsiveness increase last decade, empirical evidence support grow role global measure economic slack inflation process euro area advance economy limited. on balance, net effect globalisation euro area price difficult accurately gauge, may also change time. for reason, ecb continue actively monitor possible ongoing change inflation process. at time, efficient adjustment best facilitate focus price stability continue solidly anchor inflation expectation face considerable relative price shocks. development real estate sector let conclude remark residential property prices. a asset prices, residential property price closely monitor ecb term economic analysis. within context, take euro area real estate sector account assess risk price stability, certainly target house prices, matter, asset prices. we monitor asset price closely potentially high cost price stability economy whole associate strong appreciation rapid reversal asset prices. also, monetary analysis cover monitor money credit often reflect evolution price house purchases. in sense, strategy top economic analysis regularly ass money credit development important benefit monitor side contribute identify limit emergence unsustainable development asset prices. in term recent development euro area real estate sector, late available data house price appear support notion cool euro area house market development prolong period unusually high growth rate many euro area countries. that said, house price growth generally remain relatively buoyant euro area average see historical perspective – notwithstanding considerable heterogeneity underlie country developments. the outlook euro area whole remain soft landing, price increase moderate gradually development evolve line fundamentals. within context, continue moderation residential investment would also likely. the economic assessment complement information monetary assessment, particular annual growth rate loan household october 6.8%, 7.0% third quarter 7.5% second quarter. in sense, indication financial market turmoil has, yet, limit lend households, moderation start long ago second quarter 2006. i disposal questions. bi review 151/2007 5

discussions. * * * 1. introduction i please geneva. the international center monetary bank study (icmb) provide wonderful platform discus wide range economic monetary policy challenges. on behalf icmb foundation board colleagues, i would like thank charles wyplosz successful long-standing stewardship icmb. tonight, i want talk sovereign wealth fund (swfs). broadly defined, swfs government-owned investment corporations. for part, invest fund foreign currency assets. swfs usually manage separately central bank reserves. unlike publicly own pool capital, social security fund public pension funds, swfs explicit liabilities. a see slide 1, estimate asset currently manage swfs exceed combine pool asset manage hedge fund private equity firms. total asset hold swfs remain small, however, comparison combine asset manage pension fund mutual fund worldwide. the rise swfs closely link global macroeconomic imbalance characterize world economy since mid 1990s. since imbalance unlikely unwind near term, swfs likely keep grow disproportionably time. the rapid rise swfs undoubtedly bring number benefits. one recently become particularly evident. against backdrop current market turmoil, swfs welcome source capital, strengthen vulnerable balance sheet world’s large financial institutions. i return important point end lecture. but investment make swfs also give rise considerable political controversy medium coverage. slide 2 provide sample pertinent recent headlines. the political controversy derive fact swfs new. they not. political leader anxious rapid rise swfs increase visibility large investor mature market challenge long-held assumption global economy works. in process, investment decision swfs run risk trigger defensive reaction mature countries. if leave unchecked, process could fee financial protectionism, would clearly detriment global economic welfare. to provide context, i first describe rise swfs. i discus detail i view primary challenge arise swfs. finally, i briefly touch upon number recent policy proposals. on basis ideas, draw history central banking, i offer personal reflection simple effective policy response might look like. in closing, i briefly comment government singapore investment corporation (gic), one prominent swfs world. a know, ubs last week turn gic substantial capital injection connection loss sub-prime credit

every year since 1992. the deficit surpass usd 800 billion, 6 percent gdp, 2006. such large current account deficit unprecedented u history.1 this rise u current account deficit mirror almost one one combine rise surplus south east asian country oil export countries. i refer two country group surplus regions. by definition, surplus region invest le saving, hence, region accumulate net financial claim foreigners. but underlie reason current account surplus two region distinct. the south east asian country saw increase save fall investment wake asian financial crisis.2 since then, country generally continue pursue macroeconomic policy mix support export-led growth strategy sustain savings-investment patterns. meanwhile, oil export countries, export revenue boost increase price oil since 2000. you see slide 4. since domestic investment country increase pace, result rise net save oil export countries. the two surplus region one thing common. in cases, foreign asset accumulate almost entirely official sector. in oil export countries, oil revenue primarily accrue governments. high oil revenue therefore translate high government budget surpluses. in south east asia, currency shadow dollar, foreign asset accumulate primarily central bank form official foreign exchange reserve accumulation. slide 5 show global macroeconomic imbalance lead rapid accumulation global official foreign exchange reserves.3 let leave five stylize fact swfs. first, i already point out, swfs new phenomenon. with caisse de dépots et consignations, france set swf 1816.4 slide 6 show year establishment 14 large swfs currently operation. the kuwait investment authority establish 1953. since then, swfs set essentially two waves. the first one occur second half 1970s. the second wave begin 1996 set norway’s government pension fund – global. the steep increase oil price since 2000, widen global imbalance result accumulation foreign exchange reserve suggest country follow suit. by apply simple rule identify country potentially hold excess reserves, readily identify country obvious candidate future swfs. slide 7 show list country meet follow two conditions.5 they swf present and, judge greenspan-guidotti rule, hold excess reserve least usd ten billion.6 1 note accord snb staff calculations, u current account deficit currently absorb 60 percent world's aggregate current account surpluses. the remain deficit locate largely handful eu country (spain, italy, greece, france uk, 30 percent), central eastern europe (8 percent). the final 2 percent originate develop countries. 2 the exception china, attract even investment since asian crisis, save also increase faster. see, example, genberg et. al. (2005). 3 in countries, reserve accumulation magnify private capital inflows. 4 i grateful benoit coeuré french treasury comment (see coeuré, 2007). 5 summer (2007) similar table also include country already swfs. 6 the greenspan-guidotti rule base definition sufficient level reserve equal level short-term foreign currency debt country. excess reserve calculate reserve excess level. 2 bi review 150/2007 second, term size, swfs become important financial market participants. the 14 large swfs estimate approximately usd 2.2 trillion management.7 some market estimate put combine asset high 3.5 trillion dollars.8 the estimate combine asset world's 14 large swfs constitute nearly half size world’s total official foreign exchange reserves.9 a i point beginning, however, asset world’s swfs still much small asset invest mutual fund (usd 19.3 trillion) global pension fund (usd 21.6 trillion).10third, swfs likely grow substantially come years. market forecasts, assume high oil price large current account surplus south east asia persist, project swfs increase three fivefold nominal dollar term next five ten years.11 my view simplistic linear forecast likely prove flawed. nonetheless, difficult argue basic direction forecasts. the fundamental dynamic behind recent rise swfs disappear night. a i mentioned, estimate excess reserve large.12 in likelihood, least excess reserve transfer swfs come years. moreover, even global imbalance unwind quickly, instance association sharp protract recession unite states, power compound return continue substantial source growth swfs already exist. fourth, swfs far initiate predominantly middle east asia. slide 8 show two region account 77 percent asset large swfs. nonetheless, lose sight fact 16 percent asset 14 large swfs hold develop countries.13fifth, swfs increasingly attempt diversify holdings. they gradually, give prevail size liquidity constraints. like central banks, swfs traditionally investor highly rat fix income assets. go forward, swfs increasingly look investment equity markets, public private ones. several investment recently produce headline global financial press. slide 9 depict them. 3. the challenge in introductory comments, i suggest much anxiety surround swfs stem fact increase presence mature market present challenge long-held assumption global economy works. let elaborate little bite three assumptions. a see, much interlinked. 7 this show table 1 appendix. sources: truman (2007a, 2007b), imf, morgan stanley, ft. 8 morgan stanley, standard chartered, deutsche bank merrill lynch recently produce estimates, range usd 2.5 3.5 trillion. 9 global reserve amount usd 4.7 trillion second quarter 2007, accord imf's cofer database. 10 2006 estimate mckinsey global institute. the size pension fund asset hold oecd country estimate usd 13.2 trillion oecd. 11 the estimate merrill lynch, deutsche bank, morgan stanley standard charter are, respectively, swfs grow usd 7.9 trillion 2011, usd 9 trillion 2015, usd 12 trillion 2015 usd 13.40 trillion 2017. 12 accord snb calculations, excess reserve develop country accord greenspan-guidotti rule reach usd 2.5 trillion second quarter 2007. 13 these locate u (alaska permanent reserve fund), australia norway. bi review 150/2007 3 first, since early 1980s, witness broad-based sustain political momentum deregulate liberalise economic structures, enhance role market force attempt reduce role government global economy. look back, ronald reagan’s confrontation air traffic controller union 1981 mark begin process. most room would probably concur premise secular trend strengthen role free market competition overarch organise principle global economy contribute significantly long period prosperity world economy enjoyed. in context, swfs represent potential threat. sizeable state-sponsored foreign investment mature economy perceive threat free market forces.14 moreover, investment run risk trigger protectionist reaction recipient countries. second, one basic premise open global capital market idea capital flow freely worldwide search investment opportunity yield optimal risk-adjusted rate return. the fact large government-controlled investment company make substantial investment privately own company country raise concern validity hypothesis capital seek optimal risk-adjusted rate returns. government recipient country may doubt motivation behind investments. be swfs pursuit variant traditional motive maximise returns? or could particular government tempt use swf financial instrument pursuit particular political objective? the mere fact question arise could serve trigger protectionist policy recipient countries, thus undermine proper function free markets. third, general rule, capital historically tend flow core economic system periphery.15 most recently, global capital flow periphery core clearly rise. swfs play potentially important role appear reversal global capital flows. the economics student recognise apparent reversal capital flow really new phenomenon, new unexpected variant lucas paradox bob lucas describe seminal paper 1990.16 nonetheless, sense capital increasingly flow periphery core raise variety political sensitivity core countries. i fear many sensitivity likely protectionist nature. a see, three cases, real perceive activity swfs play role challenge deeply hold assumption world economy. in view, important challenge associate rise swfs therefore ensure policy reaction recipient country potential actual swf investment degenerate ultimately amount financial protectionism. let simply mention potential challenge associate swfs, concern swfs could pose risk financial stability.17 a relate concern asset allocation change large swfs could result disorderly market price adjustments.18 while impossible rule effects, risk clearly unique swfs. moreover, strike second-order problems, compare threat activity swfs unleash vicious cycle financial protectionism. 14 sec chairman christopher cox, example, point possible conflict interest arise foreign government ownership business (cox 2007). 15 bernanke (2006) also point capital general rule historically flow core periphery. see, example, jones obstfeld (2000) obstfeld taylor (2003) historical evidence. 16 lucas (1990). 17 see, example, lowery (2007) johnson (2007). 18 see example imf (2007). 4 bi review 150/2007 4. policy response let turn question respond risk associate swfs. a i say introduction, i would like provide judgment kind policy response likely require address adequately risk i try outline. but i so, let briefly touch upon four policy idea currently circulated. first, number european politician call increase transparency requirement relate actual portfolio position swfs.19 a far-reaching development call legislation would block swfs take major stake company strategic sectors.20 second, number politician propose principle reciprocity guide principle grant market access swfs.21 for example, jean-claude juncker, luxembourg prime minister euro-group president, stated, "countries protect market cannot expect allow make unimpeded investment europe."22 in strict sense, principle reciprocity mean swfs allow invest foreign country company country allow invest freely home country swf. since many swfs locate country financially le open typical oecd country, strict application reciprocity principle would place strong limitation swf investments. third, larry summer suggest swfs invest intermediary asset managers, risk associate swfs would mitigated, avoided.23 incidentally, summer argue add benefit indirect investment philosophy generate good risk-return profile. fourth, considerable political momentum behind idea code conduct set guideline swfs. the idea emerge swfs would adopt code voluntary basis attempt alleviate concern important mature market. at october 2007 imf/world bank annual meet washington, finance minister central banker g7 country discuss issue private meet number lead swfs. they subsequently state “see merit identify best practice sovereign wealth fund area institutional structure, risk management, transparency accountability.”24 since then, g7 treasury official continue engage number lead swfs. the u call international monetary fund try identify possible best practices, note model best practice manage international reserves.25 so far, ted truman develop 19 for example, joaquín almunia, eu commissioner economic monetary affair summarise general position european commission call swfs operate eu member country increase transparency operation investments. interview financial time 28 september 2007. 20 in germany, legislation draft would enable german government veto foreign investor intend take stake 25% german company may threaten national security; süddeutsche zeitung, 30 september 2007. 21 reciprocity also raise alistair darling response swfs, see, example, "chancellor back g7 move get tough sovereign wealth funds", the guardian, 20 october 2007. 22 germany's handelsblatt newspaper, 19 october 2007. 23 larry summer swfs, financial times, 30 june 2007. see also summer (2006). 24 statement g-7 finance minister central bank governors, washington, dc. (http://www.mof.go.jp/english/if/g7_071019.pdf) 25 the u policy stance relay public u undersecretary international affairs, david h. mccormick, testimony senate committee banking, house urban affair 14 bi review 150/2007 5 extensive set proposal best practice swfs.26 he call “standard guide activity swfs". the standard set norm transparency accountability respect four different aspects. they are: objective investment strategy, governance, actual investment portfolio fund management behaviour. the effort authority large industrialise country lead swfs develop jointly set “good governance guidelines” timely clearly sensible. there risk, however, effort fail, prove counterproductive demand industrialise country ambitious, guideline ultimately motivate desire mature market impose veil barrier foreign investments. in view, future code conduct set guideline must cover two central issue effective. first, quell concern recipient country respect politically motivate investments, code conduct must contain governance prescription ensure investment decision swfs drive political objectives. i believe institutional design modern central bank offer clue appropriate form governance prescriptions. central bank swfs obviously pursue fundamentally different objectives. but, principle, risk hijack government political aims. in case central banks, problem successfully address adoption institutional design base two powerful features. central bank clear mandate, typically focus around price stability. moreover, generally give statutory independence government pursue mandate. this simple institutional design become best practice make important contribution keep politics largely monetary policy. second, preclude resurgence state ownership economies, swf guideline need spell upper limit investment stake foreign private companies. it difficult determine limit be. a i allude earlier, matter pre-empting majority stake swfs foreign companies. “cross-border nationalisation” private company simply extreme version broad unwelcome trend.27 for reason, i believe alleviate fear excessive meddle government private companies, swf code conduct set limit individual stake level significantly typical threshold control minority, let alone absolute majority. a long recipient country confident particular swf operate accordance two paramount guidelines, reason demand intricate level portfolio transparency swfs. transparency attractive answer intractable problems. but unlikely solve problem i try outline here. indeed, i fear that, cases, extensive transparency requirement swf portfolio could actually end trigger protectionist reaction mature markets. it also important remember stock exchange already impose various disclosure requirement large equity hold list companies. there are, course, host reason swfs should, time, become transparent. many reason presume desire citizen swf country demand accountability. once again, history central bank may provide valuable insight here. the independent central bank become, november, 2007. mccormick moreover stress u remain open welcome investment sovereign wealth funds. 26 truman (2007a). 27 a far i know, larry summer coin term. 6 bi review 150/2007 recognise obligation accountable public. typically, accountability mean transparency. an independent central bank therefore likely transparent pursue mandate. the may turn true swfs. there number difficult question need address set swf guideline become operational. what exactly mean non-political investment mandate? how gauge extent might might political interference pursuit mandate? will need referee determine whether swf comply particular set guidelines? what happen swf initially sign code conduct subsequently fail comply guidelines? a see, much work remain do timeframe tight. ideally, first set guideline agree upon jointly g7 country prominent swfs 2008 spring meet imf world bank. if well design agree upon, set guideline could serve basis determine swfs continue enjoy full market access mature economies. 5. conclusion before i conclude, let say word capital participation gic ubs recently announced. a know, gic recently commit subscribe chf 11 billion mandatory convertible bond issue ubs effort raise capital aftermath loss large sub-prime mortgage positions. subject ubs shareholders’ approval, gic due time become significant shareholder ubs. in process, ubs significantly strengthen balance sheet thereby maintain substantial capital cushion relative regulatory minimum. a strengthen capital cushion welcomed. first foremost, serf confidence-building measure. moreover, uncertain times, solid capital cushion provide insurance potential deterioration global macroeconomic environment. who new asian investor large swiss bank? the gic set may 1981 original seed capital several billion dollar monetary authority singapore (mas).28 the central bank reserve grow steadily throughout 1970s result public sector surpluses. the gic’s objective invest portion foreign reserves, surplus need central bank monetary policy management, longer-term assets. the mandate gic preserve minimum international purchase power asset inflation global exchange rate risk. the objective gic commercial, focus long-term investment returns. in many ways, similar objective large european public pension funds. in fact, gic exceed mandate generate average return 9.5 per cent u dollar term since inception. the size asset manage gic publicly known. the gic state manage usd 100 billion estimate put asset management usd 300 billion. the asset gic invest ten asset class – develop market public equities, emerge market public equities, private equity, infrastructure, nominal bonds, inflation-linked bonds, real estate, commodities, hedge fund short-term asset include currency overlay. geographically, investment concentrate us, europe japan, span almost 50 countries. base know gic, judge reason i outline lecture evening, little cause concern ubs equity stake gic likely acquire. over past quarter century, gic gain solid reputation 28 the original idea set dedicate government investment institution separate ma conceive deputy prime minister dr goh keng swee endorse prime minister lee kuan yew, continue serve gic’s chairman board. bi review 150/2007 7 global investor. with regard specific topic lecture evening, i expect gic demonstrate leadership come month help shape agreement government important mature country set guideline swfs hopefully help address challenge i discuss evening. to summarise, swfs become important source capital flow periphery core today’s global economy. a such, play constructive role mature markets. at time, swfs pose challenge international community. the challenge preclude outcome activity swfs trigger policy response mature market ultimately lead u path financial protectionism. it interest mature market develop country alike avoid outcome. a set guideline address threat politically drive investment decision resurge state involvement global economy represent best currently available option respond challenge swfs. let close broad swiss perspective. switzerland absolute term sixth large current account surplus world. last year, foreign investment swiss company swiss individual generate net income receipt equivalent 12 per cent gdp, approximately chf 60 billion. in words, expert make profitable cross-border investments. this mean strong incentive virtually country keep global financial market open. reference bernanke, benjamin s. 2006, "global economic integration: what's new what's not?", speech hold federal reserve bank kansa city's thirtieth annual economic symposium, jackson hole, wyoming, august. coeuré, benoit, 2007, "faut-il avoir peur de fonds souverains?", forthcoming, le cahiers, le cercle de économistes. cox, christopher, 2007, "the role government markets". speech harvard 24th october 2007 (http://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2007/spch102407cc.htm). genberg, h., mccauley, r., park, y. persaud, a. 2005, official reserve currency management asia: myth, reality future. london, centre economic policy research. gourinchas, pierre-olivier olivier jeanne, 2007, capital flow develop countries: the allocation puzzle, cepr discussion paper no. 6561. hildebrand, philipp m., 2007, hedge fund prime broke dealers: step towards best practice proposal, in: banque de france, financial stability review – special issue hedge funds,” no. 10, april. international monetary fund, 2007, global financial stability report. washington d.c. september. johnson, simon, 2007, "the rise sovereign wealth funds, finance development, september 2007, volume 44, number 3, international monetary fund. jones, matthew t. maurice obstfeld, 2000, "saving, investment, gold: a reassessment historical current account data", calvo, guillermo a., rudiger dornbusch, maurice obstfeld, eds., money, capital mobility, trade: essay honor robert a. mundell, cambridge: mit press, 2000. 8 bi review 150/2007 lowery, clay, 2007, "remarks act under secretary international affair clay lowery sovereign wealth fund international financial system", june 21st, san francisco. lucas, jr., robert e., 1990, why doesn't capital flow rich poor countries?

economic situation remain generally positive, although true say assessment even uncertain three month ago. despite substantial international integration, swiss economy, point, scarcely affect turmoil international financial markets. growth remain strong third quarter. real gross domestic product rise annual rate 3.3%. employment continue improve across board, line expectations. in industrial service sectors, process new job creation carry on. in construction, employment stabilise high level. unemployment continue falling. a result favourable development labour market, consumer sentiment

around 3%. for short maturity bonds, however, search quality investment result drop rates. yield two-year maturities, instance, fall 3.0% 2.0%. however, decline partly offset even fully neutralise increase risk premiums, particular case issuer poor ratings. since september, depreciation u dollar accelerated. the swiss franc also strengthen little euro, although movement volatile nature. monetary financial condition also analyse term volumes. special attention give commercial lending, since shortage credit current circumstance would equivalent tighten monetary conditions. however,

the growth lend still pick pace, confirm momentum business cycle. these loan grow rate 16%, fast boom period 1999 2000. at rate, level attain previous boom soon reach again. the behaviour monetary

external dimension monetary analysis”, frankfurt main, 12 december 2007. * * * the role monetary analysis monetary policy process remain topic utmost importance central banks, whatever strategy pursue. it pertinent adopt new perspective monetary analysis, focus impact global environment monetary development assessed. give recent financial turmoil affect global markets, part via international capital flow global financial linkages, important link monetary analysis international developments. let come straight key substantive issues. in essence, i see three main topic discussion: first: how ass global liquidity implication consumer, commodity asset prices? second: what evidence possible link global monetary liquidity, international portfolio flow domestic monetary growth? third: in context influence exert globalisation and, specifically, cross-border capital flows, implication monetary policy? in remarks, i address issue turn. first all, talk liquidity, important clarify that, field central bank monetary policy, least four distinct definition liquidity – implication policy-making. the first relate “central bank liquidity”, provide money market order steer short-term interest rates. the second refer general “monetary policy stance”, summarise level policy interest rates. the third relate “financial market” liquidity, define ease large volume financial security traded, without affect market price. the fourth refer “ monetary liquidity”, define quantitative term basis monetary financial aggregates. while important – indeed key – monetary policy-making current environment strong money credit growth global level, i deem necessary say word last type liquidity. i think would agree difficult precisely measure global monetary liquidity. there seem universally accept definition among economists. several measure suggest differ many respects. they base different monetary credit aggregates; may vary accord geographical coverage; finally, construct use different type aggregation. even challenge diagnose point global monetary liquidity become excessive. for excessive i mean liquidity pose medium long-term threat price stability start boost asset price level justify economic fundamentals. certainly, normative concept need define excess liquidity. i hope two bi review 149/2007 1 day help u make progress reach common understand ass global liquidity insofar concept established. look current situation, least assert global liquidity increase sustain vigorous pace past years. we also experience high asset price across commodity market area both, house market stock markets. commodity price – notably oil food price – also rise strongly global level. in view, concern – and, central bankers, alert – possibility may spillover consumer prices. in particular, wide availability financial capital low interest rate across large international financial market partly contribute significant rise price various asset recent years. concern impact ample liquidity asset price – notably underprice risk signal ecb – repeatedly voiced. in context rapid liquidity expansion, asset price may overshoot, lead potentially costly boom bust cycles, misallocation resource pressure price developments. in respect, ecb research also show monetary liquidity shock play role drive asset price boom phase asset price cycles. however, issue empirical causality asset price portfolio allocation, one hand, money credit developments, other, remain subject ongoing research. a full understand dynamic force behind global monetary liquidity important provide insight various transmission channel liquidity affect global business cycle, asset price global inflation. in current context, global economic growth global liquidity likely explanation recent increase commodity prices, result inflationary pressure necessarily dismiss “non-core”. the long-run impact global commodity price pressure inflation depend whether reflect temporary shock persistent nominal trend, drive partly ample global liquidity. overall, look major oecd economies, consumer price inflation successfully contain quite time now. however, euro area least, information available current juncture – least monetary data area-wide global level – point upside risk price stability. let address second issue i raise earlier. before deal evidence possible link global liquidity, international portfolio flow euro area monetary growth, worthwhile recall theoretical work jam tobin harry markowitz macroeconomics asset pricing. the bulk tobin’s work 1950s 1960s monetary side macroeconomics. one main objective establish firm foundation sensitivity money demand, money velocity, interest rates. he argue people may prefer liquidity, prefer low interest rate non-cash assets, individual risk adverse. over period, harry markowitz work portfolio choice problems, balance risk expect returns. markowitz show certain give conditions, investor’s portfolio choice reduce balance two dimensions, i.e. expect return portfolio variance. when nobel prize announce 1981, tobin ask work press conference. he try explain lay audience idea people hold different proportion different asset portfolios. 2 bi review 149/2007 he said, “well, know, diversification – don’t put egg one basket”. this explanation lead headline around world: “yale economist receive nobel prize ‘don’t put all your egg one basket’”. a similar argument make nobel prize award markowitz 1990. indeed key result tobin’s markowitz’s work label “benefits portfolio diversification”. manager academic economist long aware necessity take risk, well returns, account make portfolio decisions. the first pioneer contribution money asset price therefore make 1950s, analysis focus case close economy. in setting, give risks, rise expect excess return imply low demand money. in course last 20 years, globalisation financial market owe reduction transaction cost enhancement information flow increase share global wealth invest outside investors’ home jurisdictions. the model tobin markowitz become, therefore, much complicate extend analysis global environment. portfolio theory suggest asset consider imperfect substitute other, difference expect yield reflect marginal risk regardless economy open closed. however, representative agent model long applicable case open economy, presence international capital flow require either asymmetric information heterogeneous belief among various agents. this make theoretical empirical effort search policy solution complicate business. in open economy setting, give risks, rise expect excess return necessarily imply low demand money. domestic asset may purchase foreign investor generate net portfolio inflows, would raise domestic money growth. it also true, however, money credit growth could trigger international portfolio flows. specifically, two mechanism identify liquidity affect international portfolio flows. first, strong money credit growth one country may induce capital outflow foreign asset markets, thereby exert upward pressure price financial real asset abroad. second: at time, ample liquidity condition domestic economy may fuel strong economic growth accompany high asset prices, thereby induce foreign capital inflows. the current magnitude stock global liquidity global save asset price money growth large economic areas, include euro area, affect them. in vein, large net capital inflows, well sudden reversals, may also important real consequence large economy systematically influence domestic monetary development potential implication monetary policy. evidence euro area show international portfolio flow play increasingly important role drive force monetary dynamics. a aware, ecb’s monetary policy strategy attribute prominent role analysis monetary aggregate counterpart assessment risk price stability medium long term. the grow size international capital flow associate globalisation financial market make analysis monetary aggregates, purpose extract information assess price stability, increasingly complex. bi review 149/2007 3 this bring discus third point: implication globalisation international capital flow monetary policy. if globalisation and, specifically, cross-border capital flow affect dynamic monetary aggregates, conduct monetary policy? an improve share understand influence global liquidity cross-border capital flow monetary policy transmission mechanism necessary enhance analysis underlie decisions. our role responsibility central banker remain intact globalise economy, performance task may become challenging. certainly, need timely open exchange information among central bank collaborative research efforts. still, let stress globalisation financial market affect central role override responsibility central banks, preserve price stability within respective jurisdictions. central bank throughout world assign responsibility keep domestic inflation low stable rates. cross-border capital flow may affect velocity money, basic principle anchor monetary policy – friedman’s view “…in long run, inflation always everywhere monetary phenomenon” – remain valid. this also confirm study find strong relationship monetary growth inflation low frequencies. in words, relationship money price strong trend-like development business cycle fluctuations. one interpretation international portfolio capital flow influence monetary development introduce great “noise” shorter-term monetary dynamics, thereby increase importance seek underlie rate monetary expansion look lower-frequency, trend-like component monetary growth. notwithstanding complication create increasingly complex international financial system, money been, remain important indicator inflation. the monetary policy strategy devise ecb, medium-to-longer-term orientation prominence assign economic monetary analysis, well place address implication globalisation inflation dynamic price stability. the broad analytical framework ecb’s two-pillar strategy rest well suit detect risk price stability economy whole. there need intensify analytical effort deepen understand several aspect financial innovations, change international financial system implication assessment medium longer-term risk price stability. indeed, current agenda enhance monetary analysis demonstrates, ecb vanguard develop

mpc’s view shock demand supply affect economy; view economy work policy set affect it. this conference focus one important element this: role financial market set transmission monetary policy. that cover bank’s publication economy works, include committee’s 1999 paper monetary transmission mechanism (mtm), book describe model use forecasting.1 but high-level description miss awful lot real financial part economy connect. financial variable limit short-term interest rate, exchange rate, equities. nothing role long-maturity interest rates, credit spread risk premia – miss whole universe financial asset prices. very little credit generally. next nothing money. and nothing role bank intermediation. these gap perhaps underline degree confusion amongst commentator way money credit feature somewhat prominently committee’s discussion backend 2006 year (chart 1). with strong while, ask whether mark kind change reaction function, imply great stress nominal variables. give near identity deposit bank lending, money credit often use almost inseparably, even interchangeably, wide measure non-bank credit look assess health corporate household sector balance sheets. but circumstance one good approach thing way round, start general credit conditions, examine interaction non-bank bank lending, broad money (partial) counterpart m4l. my remark today follow structure, provide framework observation current tighten credit conditions, well precede expansion. 1 “the transmission mechanism monetary policy”, paper monetary policy committee bank england, april 1999 harrison r., k. nikolov, m. quinn, g. ramsay, a scott r. thomas, “the bank england quarterly model”, bank england 2005. the bank’s wide “suite models” include rich asset price channels. bi review 149/2007 1 credit credit is, course, vital economy, enable household firm make choice whether bring forward defer spend income. there condition would play active role, passively reflect cyclical fluctuation output, employment inflation. in world le complete transparency borrower lenders, low transaction costs, low risk aversion, access credit would rationed; ex ante yield financial assets, include loan bonds, would embody risk premia. so household firm want bring forward spend face shock economy, would able restrict need remain solvent. but nobody belief description real world household company manage affairs. both are, great less degree, ration access credit, give borrower know great deal condition prospect risk-averse lenders, lender face obstacle ensure borrower honour contracts.2 the availability, price term credit– whether unsecured secure – sensitive range factors, include assessment idiosyncratic risk particular borrower, risk common across borrowers. variation factor give rise possibility credit cycle. a borrower’s ability pledge collateral help overcome problem “asymmetric information” enforceability, evidence net worth give continue stake contract lender. this give rise so-called “financial accelerator” channel monetary transmission mechanism (mtm), monetary policy work partly affect lend term effect asset value net worth borrowers.3 but credit condition also depend access credit lender themselves. there important distinction intermediation across bank balance sheet via capital markets, although i shall describe turn blurred. total credit: capital market securitisation for moment, i shall put distinction one side order focus total credit. a series environmental change past decade affect quantity price credit generally. great macroeconomic stability, perception persist le uninterrupted, probably increase supply credit; reduce risk premia, may increase demand (diagram a). other development likely work purely credit supply. the obvious growth instrument credit derivative securitisation, associate increase role rat agency monitor credit risk. this effect shock technology, make portfolio transferable. by offer prospect good meet desire risk profile separate origination investment, bring non-bank financial institutions, capital resources, credit markets, increase supply credit (diagram b). this seem bear significant shift actual credit quantity price middle year. in unite kingdom, non-bank lender account great share credit extension household corporate sector (charts 2-4). 2 stiglitz, j. e. a. wei (1981), “credit ration market imperfect information”, the american economic review, vol. 71, no. 3, pp 393-410. 3 bernanke, b. m. gertler (1989), “agency cost, net worth, business fluctuations”, the american economic review, march 1989, pp 14-31. 2 bi review 149/2007 a lot securitised (chart 5). for household sector, spread securitised portfolio secure unsecured credit fell 2003 2005 (chart 6). that contribute fall effective rate underlie mortgage personal loan (chart 7). the broad picture hold corporate sector (chart 8). an illustrative decomposition suggest that, especially sub-investment grade borrowers, compression spread could explain solely reduce compensation default risk, excess possibly reflect low liquidity premia (chart 9).4 these fall spread material relative change mpc’s bank rate risk-free yield curve. for example, late “policy cycle”, increase bank rate 125bp 11 month august 2006. during period, effective rate new mortgage rise close 50bp. in words, around 2003, monetary policy need take account progressive loosen credit conditions. the table turned. spread risen;

increase liquidity capital markets, reduce liquidity premia embody asset prices; on. and music stops, process reverse fall asset values, leverage liquidity fee other. (for shin, villain mark-to-market accounting, although i would want virtue reduce forbearance overlooked.) thirdly, “twin engines” view may place insufficient weight bank remain principal originator credit, give small firm household cannot issue bond directly capital markets. it argue growth market securitising loan portfolio make bank le relevant overall credit conditions, business cycle, bank’s ability originate credit become le intimately bind financial strength.8 but if, currently, capital markets’ appetite securitised credit diminishes, large proportion loan remain balance sheet banks. all bring back focus potential macroeconomic relevance bank lending. bank lend the economic literature “bank lending” channel monetary transmission mechanism explore condition tighten monetary policy cause term bank lend tighten increase risk-free short-term real rates. the literature typically assume (i) monetary policy tighten effect central bank withdraw reserve system (or slow pace reserve injection); (ii) bank require hold proportion transaction deposit reserves, reduce reserve provision entail slow deposit growth; (iii) unrestricted access liability subject reserve requirements, cannot fill gap leave slow deposit growth must, instead, slow loan growth, tighten credit conditions.9 the first two step seem archaic. we effect monetary policy change control price quantity central bank money system; and, uk, bank choose reserve target rather determine balance sheet ratio kind. but third plank model – restrict access non-deposit liabilities, whether capital-like – plainly still relevant today. in world asymmetric information, bank unrestricted access resources, believe bank’s lend 7 adrian, tobias, h. s. shin (2007), “liquidity, monetary policy financial cycles”, paper prepare current issue economics finance. adrian, tobias h s shin, (2007), “liquidity financial cycles”, paper present 6th bi annual conference “financial system macroeconomic resilience”. analytically, argument, summarise main text, need supplement mechanism somehow impede check balance prevent overshoot fundamentals. 8 loutskina e. p. e. strahan (2006), “securitisation decline impact bank finance loan supply: evidence mortgage acceptance rates”, national bureau economic research (nber) work papers, no. 11983. and estrella, a.

represent key prerequisite guarantee macroeconomic stability serbia today. however, supervisory measure efficient “levelling off” margin “convincing” institution cut credit growth crisis situation financial sector. whereas bank supervisor constantly vigilant keep take measure avert crisis, crisis still happen time. and something common: 1) never plan though risk trend le common knowledge, 2) come result operation almost impossible predict, 3) initial impact always underestimated, soon 4) go extreme, i.e. become overestimated! for seven year now, namely ever since i begin attend annual

european central bank, press brief occasion publication december 2007 ecb financial stability review, frankfurt main, 12 december 2007. * * * i. introduction my colleague i would like welcome today’s press brief occasion publication december 2007 edition ecb financial stability review. the financial stability assessment contain review prepare close involvement escb bank supervision committee. it part base information available 9 november 2007, “cut-off” date review. the primary objective fsr identify evaluate main source risk vulnerability financial stability provide comprehensive assessment capacity euro area financial system absorb adverse disturbances. the december 2007 edition review place special emphasis financial market turmoil, also focus overview chapter. this edition review address several topical issue 19 box also contain five special feature articles. the choice content box article motivate financial market development past months. in presentation, i first devote time ongoing financial market turmoil. second, i review risk vulnerability external environment well euro area financial non-financial sectors, partially affect re-pricing financial risk. i conclude overall assessment risk euro area financial stability, currently see them. 2. the financial market turmoil 2.1 cause start market turmoil, principal underlie cause market tension volatility erupt august that, past years, several intertwine vulnerability create mutually reinforce interplay three developments: (1) strengthen investor risk appetite search yield; (2) sizeable expansion financial market liquidity mid-2003 onwards; (3) increasingly widespread adoption bank “originate distribute” business model. more specifically, environment historically low risk-free asset yields, search yield investor make necessary seek acquire alternative asset offer high return associate great risks. these asset include complex structure finance product relatively illiquid. the “search-for-yield” phenomenon evidence compression credit spread decline market volatility past four year (see chart leave slide 3). against background, bank pursue “originate distribute” business model meet grow base highly receptive investor will include portfolio risky loan re-packaged increasingly complex structure credit products. while “originate distribute” business model facilitate wide distribution credit risk across financial systems, grow concern among global central bank community model reduce degree transparency concern ultimate location risk financial system. the amount loan securitised euro denominate market bi review 148/2007 1 grow past three year (see chart right slide 3). the tendency european bank resort securitisation loan allow dispose credit risk time fuel banks’ loan growth supply side. before elaborate risk emanate interaction three aforementioned factors, might worth recall ecb saw situation six month ago, financial market turmoil gather pace. in context, let refer pertinent quote conclusion include june 2007 fsr (see slide 4). • first, highlight potential u sub-prime mortgage market crisis deepen spread markets, euro area financial institution could exposures. • second, stress prospect financial market liquidity abruptly dry investor risk aversion rise warn abrupt sharp decline market liquidity could reveal vulnerability financial system. • third, concern express implication grow reliance rat agency credit risk assessment. • fourth, discuss possible loosen standard compromise counterparty risk management margin bank environment intensify competition lucrative fee income. • fifth, point reduce financial market liquidity potential hamper banks’ ability sell securitised risky loan thus adversely affect credit cycle. 2.2. propagation channel let elaborate various stage propagation turbulence useful assessment prospect financial market derive lessons. at early stage crisis, still contain u sub-prime mortgage markets, delinquency rate u sub-prime mortgage increase markedly mid-2005, two main reasons. first, interest rate charge sub-prime mortgage initially much low standard mortgage, typically reset much high rate, usually two three year period. second, high rate house price inflation since early 1990s encourage household borrow house purchase intention refinancing, repay mortgage, reset date. once interest rate mortgage start rise, house price begin moderate subsequently fall, many borrower unable service loans, sometimes even reset date aggressively bet house price increases. the development delinquency rate house price inflation show chart slide 5. what prospect sub-prime mortgage markets? recall typical fixed-rate period adjustable-rate mortgage two three years, reset tie one number common indices, closely relate market interest rates. notwithstanding slight decrease index recently, estimate usd 400 billion sub-prime mortgage face reset interest rate next two years. the surge delinquency rate quickly translate fall value residential mortgage-backed security (rmbss), especially back recently originate vintage loans. the value securities, index credit default swap (cdss) securities, mostly continue deteriorate today (see chart leave slide 6); box 2 review examine issue detail. the fact claim cash-flows generate sub-prime mortgage embed broad array structure credit products, often layer top one another, explain 2 bi review 148/2007 unexpectedly severe credit loss underlie u sub-prime mortgage risk potential future credit loss widespread effect financial system. the announcement rat agency early july would downgrade many asset-backed security (abss) collateralised debt obligation (cdos) back pool sub-prime mortgage would revise methodology assign new rat result loss confidence rat cause investor fundamentally reassess expect distribution return wide variety structure finance product risk embed products. these development contribute increase risk aversion substantial decline market liquidity (as illustrate chart right slide 6) result sharp drop issuance volume structure credit leverage loan markets. one main channel propagation amplification financial market turmoil prove off-balance sheet vehicle create bank client invest structure finance products. money-market fund manager investor apparently underestimate exposure incur towards risk u sub-prime mortgage purchase asset-backed commercial paper (abcp) issue vehicles. box 8 review provide detail explanation various abcp structure affect market turmoil. ultimately, liquidity squeeze trigger unsecured interbank money market larger-than-expected fund liquidity needs, perceive future needs, bank liquidity commitment off-balance sheet vehicles, become unable roll large share abcp market. at time, financial institution liquidity balance tend hoard them. box 9 review discus various reason hoard behaviour persist present. the first adverse selection problem: counterparties liquid balance find unable distinguish financial institution sizeable exposure structure credit product not. second, bank hoard liquidity precautionary reason heighten uncertainty potential fund liquidity needs. third, money-market fund also build precautionary liquid balance cover risk potential redemption request investors. i review detail central bank operation aim ensure orderly function money market discuss several occasions, summarise review. the ecb act swiftly decisively, several refinance operations, include initially operation short maturity three-month maturity address tension term money market. it also provide additional liquidity, benchmark allotment amount, context regular main refinance operation (mros) continue aim balance liquidity condition end maintenance period. these operation stabilise effect money market rates, reduce volatility short-term interbank rate around key policy rate ecb contain pressure interbank term money market. they thus contribute mitigate effect turmoil financial system economy. however, tension persist term money markets, show spread euro deposit rate different maturity eonia swap rate remain elevate level (see chart leave slide 7). continue pressure characterise term money market globally, include u dollar, euro pound sterling money market (as show chart right slide 7). a main reason persistence uncertainty surround financial position liquidity need financial institutions. bi review 148/2007 3 2.3 lesson let turn lesson learn far market turmoil. although early draw definite conclusions, number weakness reveal turmoil could generally consider consequence inadequate risk management institution insufficient market discipline. but let specific point four broad area weakness risk management partly relate originate-and-distribute bank model concern (i) monitoring, assessment management credit risk; (ii) management price fund liquidity risk ; (iii) assessment counterparty risk (iv) role so-called conduit structure investment vehicle model transmission tension credit structure finance product market money markets. many weakness previously identified. but combine way anticipate potential severity joint impact core money markets. several issue relate risk weakness require examination, currently undertake various fora, namely financial stability forum basel committee bank supervision. one important issue concern valuation complex structure finance products. investor assume model-based rat structure credit product similar statistical property corporate bond discover product different. for example, so-called bespeak collateralised debt obligation (cdos) become impossible value acceptably precise manner and, current juncture, effort make either mark-to-market product use comparable tradable asset price late available price quotes. another problem – closely relate valuation issue – role rat agency play development structure finance product propagation turmoil well excessive reliance investor rat credit risk assessments. question also raise potential conflict interest activity rat agencies. finally, regard fund liquidity risk, important ingredient turmoil contribute propagation tension credit market money market, maturity mismatch balance sheet abcp conduits. the risk associate fund mismatch aggravate market liquidity evaporate market complex structure credit products. in addition, become clear bank often adequate contingency plan place deal unexpected fund liquidity need arise contingent liquidity facility provide conduit deal risk would face difficulty syndicate bridge loan extend finance leverage buyouts. look forward, current juncture outlook subsequent evolution sub-prime originate turmoil highly uncertain. in order obtain indication possible propagation market tensions, i would like refer box 5 review focus interaction credit market de-leveraging cycles. it conclude environment bank loan widely use collateral asset-backed securities, sudden increase borrower default rate could implication financial performance bank via credit risks, also market income risks. from perspective, important issue euro area global financial stability outlook way ongoing re-pricing credit risk fee evolution credit cycle. a crucial channel determine impact money market tension re-pricing credit risk credit cycle real economy extent affect banks’ lend behaviour and, consequently, finance condition household corporate sector. indication considerable tighten lend standard already emerge side atlantic (see chart leave slide 9). in addition, 4 bi review 148/2007 sign corporate default rate – reach historically low level recent year – forecast increase u euro area (as show chart right slide 9). in event continue increase market tension volatility would constrain banks’ ability extend credit non-financial sectors, turn broad credit cycle could accelerate downside risk economic activity could increase. so far, however, bank credit expansion private sector euro area remain robust. 3. the external macro-financial environment let turn risk vulnerability identify fsr pertain external environment euro area financial non-financial sectors. most risk previously stressed, recent development bear likelihood materialise expect impact euro area financial system economy. the significant appreciation euro vis-à-vis u dollar past month implication outlook adjustment global imbalances, notably finance u current account deficit (see chart leave slide 10). the financial market re-pricing seem trigger noticeable change pattern capital flow us. in july 2007, foreign net acquisition u long-term security decline sharply investor rebalanced portfolio towards short-term instruments. in follow month, u record net outflow long-term security (particularly equities), well decrease short-term liabilities. although capital appear flow back u capital market month followed, event underline potential disorderly unwind imbalance case finance challenge u external deficit. aggregate demand inflation pressure globally, euro area particular, affect substantial persistent rise oil prices, although simultaneous appreciation euro dampen impact euro area economy. limit spare capacity amid robust demand especially emerge economies, continue geopolitical supply risk likely keep oil price elevate level infer future markets. however, considerable uncertainty skew upside, indicate imply distribution future oil prices, extract option contract (see chart right slide 10). 4. euro area corporate household sector turn vulnerability euro area economy, financial position euro area corporate sector remain relatively sound aggregate level, likelihood turn credit cycle, still low, may risen. this amount debt firms’ balance sheet continue grow, cost roll short-term debt. corporate profitability, although high, could adversely affect le favourable macroeconomic outlook, tight credit standard high cost debt. one issue highlight several occasion throughout current year risk associate leverage buy-out (lbo) transactions. the finance package grant large lbo project finalise 2006 2007 characterise excess bear similarity practice u sub-prime mortgage markets. a deterioration finance condition could cause firm involve default, adverse consequence collateralised loan obligation (clo) market lbo loan frequently use asset pools. in addition, number new large lbo deal delay restructure plan transaction withdraw market due turmoil (see chart leave slide 11). all all, market-based indicator suggest current outlook euro area non-financial corporate credit bi review 148/2007 5 quality, deteriorate somewhat, still remain overall fairly solid. default rate remain low, start rise second half 2006 first time since 2003 expect rise period ahead. the balance credit rat upgrade downgrade non-financial corporation remain level close observe previous years. with regard risk euro area household sector, despite heterogeneity across euro area countries, late available data confirm gradual moderation annual rate house price inflation. in country overvaluation appear acute, house market price development continue represent source risk household sector balance sheets, although income growth typically decisive determinant overall risk household finance euro area economies. at time, growth rate lend household house purchase continue decrease average euro area, suggest liability side households’ balance sheet also grow slowly (see chart right slide 11). however, continue rise, although moderate pace, household sector indebtedness sign vulnerability house market add credit risk face euro area bank short medium term. all all, vulnerability could expose part euro area residential real estate valuation particularly stretched, household highly leveraged, borrow take place primarily variable interest rate loan-to-value ratio high. the analysis present box 6 conclude due average relatively comfortable loan-to-value ratios, would take sizeable house price decline addition adverse disturbance debt service capacity mortgage borrower bank would incur large credit losses. 5. euro area financial institution during past weeks, focus implication financial market turmoil concentrate potential effect banks’ balance sheet profitability. while financial condition euro area large complex bank group (lcbgs) improve first half 2007, extent negative impact ongoing credit risk re-pricing financial condition become clear gradually report full year 2007 audit financial results. base data obtain publicly available sources, box 11 review present analysis outcome simple stress-test pertain 21 lcbgs’ fund need capital ratios. among euro area lcbgs, 18 exposure abcp programme 9 leverage loan warehouse risks. in aggregate, exposure correspond additional fund requirement bank represent 5.2% total outstanding loans, 10.4% deposit base. this additional fund requirement, materialise, likely adversely affect institutions’ earn prospects. in stress scenario exposure fully take back onto balance sheet sponsor banks, potential second round effect account for, bank would see capital ratio decline quite substantially, even bad hit institution would still remain solvent (see chart leave slide 12). however, many lcbgs may also target particular capital ratio regulatory minimum pursuit high credit ratings, deteriorate capital ratio could adverse consequence credit quality future fund costs. all all, cannot exclude market re-pricing process could become disorderly, possibly reveal and, far hidden, risk exposures. moreover, dividend policy could adversely affect several institutions. in addition, lcbgs rely fund non-deposit sources, particularly active securitisation businesses, could see revenue decline significantly. reflect 6 bi review 148/2007 concerns, forward-looking financial market indicators, banks’ cd spread share prices, currently suggest challenge pertain bank sector likely remain near future (see chart right slide 12). the market turbulence also raise concern extent nature euro area insurers’ exposure structure credit products. against background, insurer choose disclose exposure u sub-prime mortgage asset-backed security end first half 2007 show box 17 review. these data show exposure general limited, average le 1% overall invest assets, mostly relate high-rated investment segments. these rather limit exposures, especially compare u monoline insurers, explain difference business model euro area insure fact limit appetite high level credit risk. nevertheless, euro area insurer might fairly limit direct exposure u sub-prime mortgage generally structure credit products, secondary effect ongoing credit market turmoil might great concern. 6. overall assessment financial stability outlook let provide overall assessment risk outlook euro area financial stability, see current juncture. with financial system undergo process de-leveraging re-intermediation, uncertainty surround financial stability outlook euro area heightened. this uncertainty could persist considerable period time become clear total valuation income losses, could sizeable, face euro area financial system spread across individual financial institutions. clarity also need liquidity provider intend deal commitment off-balance sheet investment vehicles, much risk eventually flow back onto balance sheet banks. moreover, condition u house market show sign improvement, possibility tension surface structure credit market cannot excluded, especially credit quality deteriorate broad u mortgage market. a adjustment process financial sector come month likely prove challenging, financial system could vulnerable crystallisation risk identify previous issue fsr remain relevant. specifically, risk relate follow fact developments: first, within euro area, substantial increase household sector indebtedness together sign vulnerability house market add credit risk face euro area bank short medium term. second, surge leverage part corporate sector, especially associate lbo activity, raise possibility adverse turn credit cycle involve rise default rate heavily indebted firms. third, although far hedge fund sector relatively unaffected recent market turmoil, uncertainty remain regard hedge funds’ exposure credit markets, well leverage liquidity risk. finally, outside euro area, persistently wide global imbalance continue pose risk unwind disorderly manner. this could bring tension global capital market and, risk materialise, could pose challenge test risk management loss-absorption capacity key financial institutions. all all, risk euro area financial system stability materially increase past 6 months. there are, however, several mitigate factors: the economic outlook remain broadly favourable and, although pocket vulnerability identified, balance sheet household firm largely good shape, bi review 148/2007 7 support overall creditworthiness non-financial sector. moreover, capital position core financial firm also generally sound. this overall positive assessment shock-absorbing capacity provide grind complacency give heighten uncertainties. in environment balance sheet condition could unexpectedly change, vigilance essence financial institution particular step effort effectively manage risk may lie ahead. in respect, recently launch initiative measure taken, policy-makers financial industry, aim restore confidence address weakness reveal market turmoil contribute strengthen resilience financial system. i would like stress particularly importance new basel ii capital accord, fully implement january 2008. indeed, new accord strongly rely significantly improve risk management determine appropriate level capital buff banks. nevertheless, despite improvements, degree sophistication financial market also call constant investment stress-testing method practice order ensure bank full understand potential loss might incur highly unlikely plausible scenario adequately prepare address associate risks. 8 bi review 148/2007 bi review 148/2007 9 10 bi review 148/2007 bi review

canada, canadian club toronto empire club canada, toronto, ontario, 10 december 2007. * * * i'm happy home town toronto deliver final public speech governor bank canada. nearly seven year ago, i give first public speech toronto, fit i last. it become tradition i deliver speech late year issue relate financial system. when i say "financial system," i mean financial institution markets, together clear settlement system financial asset flow. this tradition speak financial system begin 2004 speech i give joint meet empire canadian club need promote economic efficiency canada. you may ask bank canada, well-known responsibility monetary policy, would put emphasis financial system issues. the answer two tightly linked. we care great deal financial system serious disruption would affect ability conduct monetary policy, increase efficiency financial system increase effectiveness monetary policy. at time, contribute stable economy sound monetary policy help reduce risk instability financial system. i'll talk monetary policy bite later. but first, i want look back past seven year – particular, past seven month – discus development see term financial system issues. to begin, i give brief overview bank's role financial system, review issue i've raise past years. then, i discus dislocation financial market begin summer, talk problem relate information contribute market turbulence. finally, i'll look effect event continue have, financial market outlook canadian economy. the bank financial system one reason give financial system speech near year-end coincide publication december edition bank's financial system review (fsr). the purpose previous speech bank's purpose publish fsr; is, improve public understand financial system development trends, point potential vulnerability system, highlight bank's research, promote discussion financial system issue general. ultimately, goal help provide context lead strong financial system policy canada. the late issue fsr publish last week, deal extensively market turbulence begin summer. the bank actively work promote financial system stable efficient. i've already mention financial instability impair bank's ability conduct monetary policy. but importantly, stable financial system crucial economy function well. in canada, responsibility promote financial stability share number agencies. our partner include department finance, office superintendent financial institutions, canada deposit insurance corporation, provincial regulator security commissions. the bank also ultimate provider liquidity facilitate settlement financial transaction lender last resort financial institutions. bi review 147/2007 1 despite importance financial system efficiency, single body responsible promote it. what i mean i say "efficiency"? an efficient system one scarce economic resource allocate productive us cost-effective way. in efficient financial system, investor get high risk-adjusted return investments, borrower minimize cost raise capital. inefficiency stunt investment cut economic growth. the bank canada contribute financial system efficiency monetary policy, keep inflation low, stable, predictable. we also legislate role oversee canada's important clear settlement systems. these system design provide certainty large-value payment security transaction settle real time, use relatively small amount liquidity. this free resource put good use elsewhere. over past four years, i try highlight important efficiency issue canada. in 2004,1 i speak need promote efficiency financial institutions, argue policy framework provide great incentive innovation encourage competition while, time, give financial institution scope improve efficiency. there remain much work encourage innovation, competition, efficiency. i also speak need improve canada's security regulation uniform law regulations, base principle apply everyone, tailor take account differ size complexity firms. there much progress i would hoped. so, canada remain risk see capital market erode business migrate financial centres. i've also talk need improve enforcement security markets, market work efficiently operate clear, transparent, reasonable rule principles, enforce see enforced. some progress make here, i welcome commitment rcmp improve implement many recommendation set nick le pan report last week. however, much good co-operation coordination effort among security commissions, law-enforcement agencies, crown prosecutors, minister justice attorney general absolutely crucial. another efficiency issue i've raise need strengthen canada's regulatory, legal, account framework relate private defined-benefit pensions, risk deal appropriate way.2 pension fund generate important gain term economic

thus enhance viability system private, voluntary defined-benefit pension good canadian worker firms, benefit capital markets. these issue critical canada's future economic prospects. the role bank

david dodge, "economic financial efficiency: the importance pension plans," (bank canada, 2005). 2 bi review 147/2007 responsible authority act research findings, move issue forward. at heart many issue i've mention problem relate information. indeed, one key lesson past seven month information asymmetry lead to, exacerbate, disruption financial markets. so let turn discussion recent events, look problem information contribute market turbulence. market dislocation role information to truly understand events, important context. you find detail account recent event december issue fsr. the turbulence financial market come backdrop remarkable strength global economy. we see continue robust demand canadian good service lead significant improvement term trade, help support canadian dollar. despite positive backdrop, sign potential trouble global economy. a early 2003, bank flag concern global imbalances.3 the high level global desire save relative desire investment naturally serve drive real longer-term interest rates, even central bank around world process raise short-term policy rates. with decline longer-term interest rates, investor step demand risky asset would deliver great returns. this search yield lead narrow spread yield risky asset government bonds. this narrow risky spread become pronounce persistent many central bank begin question whether adequately reflect credit risk involved. in fact, bank canada highlight precise concern far back june 2004 issue fsr.4 a repricing risk appear necessary, real question how, manner, would take place. besides need repricing risk, factor contribute market turbulence begin summer. originator loan – bank non-bank institution – increasingly opt securitize loan make form highly structure asset-backed securities, embed significant leverage. these often sell tranche provide vary degree protection default risk involved. such structure allow higher-risk asset appear take quality lower-risk assets. the increase use leverage structure product pioneer major financial centre new york london, although eventually, non-bank institution begin market product elsewhere, include canada. the ease highly structure product sell fuel demand creation higher-risk assets, include u.s. subprime-mortgage loans. this, turn, contribute global decline lend standards. at times, originator loan few incentive carefully ass creditworthiness borrowers. this originator sometimes distribute loan made. in circumstances, loan securitized sold, originator long face consequence borrower defaulted. i'll return point bite later. but now, suffice say decline standard loan origination, combine financial engineering, help spur great lending. 3 david dodge, "past adjustment future trend canadian economy," (bank canada, 2003). 4 bank canada: "financial system review" (june 2004), p.4. bi review 147/2007 3 the process securitization new. security back mortgages, credit card receivables, type assets, around years. indeed, development market "plain vanilla" asset-backed security important since allow expansion credit market. initially, market develop reasonably transparent way, nature of, risk associate with, underlie asset clear. here canada, example, investor could know certainty mortgage back security meet lend standard set canada mortgage house corporation, loan back security high enough credit quality bank retailer prepare stake reputation securities. these plain-vanilla asset-backed security continue exist remain important source high-quality market-based financing. but recently, see emergence increasingly complex structure products, develop response demand high returns. and security become complex opaque, many cases, become hard assemble understand information need determine kind asset back security, quality assets, counterparty risk involved. a final point complex security valued. trade security secondary market rare. thus, price security transparent. most highly structure security value "marked-to-model" basis, mean statistical model use provide values. but model typically provide estimate values, estimate vary widely change underlie assumptions. indeed, many model assume asset back security readily trade liquid secondary market – assumption clearly always valid. so become extremely difficult put firm value particular security give time. so, see many factor make credit market vulnerable recent dislocations. the repricing risk i mention early was, fact, way august. by late spring, spread lower-rated corporate bond begin widen level close historical averages. a move summer, however, saw rise delinquency rate high probability default u.s. subprime mortgages. and so, rise expectation loss holder security back mortgages. but complexity opacity securities, extremely difficult even sophisticate investor determine, confidence, creditworthiness asset back particular security market value security itself. in circumstances, uncertainty lead contagion dislocation money market generally, even market link u.s. subprime mortgages. liquidity, recently think abundant, become scarce. some investor find asset assume liquid were, fact, frozen. investor suddenly become extremely risk averse, lead surge demand least-risky assets, government bond treasury bills. the lack transparency problem information clearly contribute ongoing market turbulence. the global repricing credit risk take long many u initially expected. this take time unravel complex opaque instrument get underlie assets, find value asset themselves. in addition, uncertainty remain extent bank hold securities, much may require take onto balance sheets, value place them. this uncertainty exacerbate problem global interbank fund market, strong balance sheets, canadian bank somewhat le affected. over time, market force still expect work problems. but market need information operate efficiently. so, interest market participant make sure party access necessary information. 4 bi review 147/2007 globally, market structure asset-backed security remain stress. in canada, problem acute market structured, non-bank-sponsored, asset-backed commercial paper. the information need properly price product begin make available. with information, investor provider asset liquidity progress towards restructure agreements. a go forward, expect investor demand great transparency lacking. vendor financial instrument need structure way market player clearly see buying. more fundamentally, investor must take responsibility diligent research, good understand nature investments. put another way, investor must demand access appropriate information homework, must homework. it seem many desire outcome accomplish natural market force respond events. for example, investor demand much high rate return opaque products, strong incentive vendor provide product transparent. let touch briefly role credit-rating agency this. there article current fsr expand issue relate possible reform credit-rating process.5 one thing clear future, credit-rating agency find advantage explain clearly rationale for, limitation of, rat highly structure products. there natural, self-correcting market force work lead rat agency improve processes. indeed, credit-rating agency work hard improve process likely few client will pay services. a i understand it, agency work improvements. but credit-rating agency blame lack information highly structure product sell highly-sophisticated investor so-called exempt market. in retail market, security regulator impose strict requirement information must provide prospectus term sheet. but requirement exempt market. it seem basic disclosure need every market. and since security design exempt market usually require carry rat credit-rating agency, one way ensure appropriate information available could require issuer publicly disclose information make available credit-rating agencies. in way, investor would access information need order make inform decisions. another issue need think get right incentive place loan originators, credit quality maintain credit appropriately priced. i mention early that, cases, creation loan largely immediate securitization reduce incentive originator maintain credit standards. since originator immune default risk loan completely securitized sold, lack proper incentive adequately ass creditworthiness borrower. it may natural market force go long way towards rebalancing incentives, question asked: be way encourage appropriate use securitization? it may possible, example, asset-backed security carry type "branding" "certificate origination" would provide clear incentive loan originator exercise due diligence extend loan securitized. or, look way encourage originator keep substantial portion risky tranche product sell books. 5 mark zelmer, "reforming credit-rating process." bank canada “financial system review” (december 2007): p 51-57. bi review 147/2007 5 implication monetary policy economy let discus impact recent market dislocations, work bank canada, canadian economy. the impact bank two-fold. first, undertake open-market buyback operation make sure canadian bank access stand liquidity facility, able deal overnight liquidity difficulties. this normal role central bank, continue. but, wake recent events, currently look whether type liquidity disruption canada might good address bank canada facility would provide liquidity term long overnight. we also examine change necessary allow bank accept wide range security buyback operations. the bank's role, course, conduct monetary policy aim deliver low, stable, predictable inflation. we work ensure financial system proper amount liquidity overnight interest rate – key policy rate – remain close target. but see since summer widen spread short-term market interest rates, rate commercial paper, target overnight rate. this important, short-term market rate crucial link way monetary policy transmitted: key policy rate, cost credit, spending, production, employment and, ultimately, rate inflation. these wide spread persisted, represent tighten credit condition canada. these tight credit condition come financial market difficulty intensify past week bank fund cost increase globally. at time, increase risk attach prospect demand canadian export outlook u.s. economy – particularly u.s. house sector – weakened. uncertainty relate factor lead exceptional volatility financial currency market globally. while remain upside risk inflation canada, factor considered, bank judge shift downside balance risk around october projection inflation. in light shift, low target overnight rate last week. before next interest rate decision january, ass economic financial development balance risks, full projection economy inflation. conclusion lady gentlemen, know i step governor bank end january, conclude thirty-five year involvement economic policy within public service. since last public speech governor, i think might apt conclude remark today three important lesson economic policy i – i believe many canadian – learn past thirty-five years. the first lesson individual firm must always prepare adjust quickly change global economic circumstances. the world evolve way cannot predict, must prepare deal change seize new opportunity arise. perhaps even importantly, cling activity long economically justified, however difficult painful adjustment may be. not adjust option. in end, rapid adjustment le painful prolong activity long hold comparative advantage. this lesson i many canadian learn difficulty 1970s early 1980s. second, learn importance achieve maintain sustainable level public debt. canadian pay real price 1990s control growth public debt, wisely use favourable condition past decade bring ratio public debt gdp. although condition necessarily favourable 6 bi review 147/2007 next decade recently, nonetheless, effort reduce debt-service burden need order prepare inevitable effect age population. third, learn important contribution central bank make economic welfare maintain confidence future value money. in 1970s, witness economic social instability cause high volatile inflation. in 1980s, pay price recession get inflation control. since early 1990s, inflation-targeting regime keep inflation low, stable, predictable 2 per cent. this, together fiscal consolidation, help keep growth steady, employment rise historically high levels, unemployment fall level see decades. my colleague bank continue search technical improvement inflation-targeting regime, i confident bank successor, mark carney, continue keep inflation low, stable, predictable, benefit canadians. finally, let close say enormous privilege able serve canadian three half decades. i grateful opportunity, i hopeful that, way, effort year may encourage others follow service canada people. bi review 147/2007 7 stanley fischer: tomorrow’s economic agenda address professor stanley fischer, governor bank israel, israel business conference, tel aviv, 10 december 2007. * * * the announcement newspaper israel business conference bear slogan “come join us, you’ll part tomorrow’s economic agenda”. and i would like talk today, “tomorrow’s economic agenda.” the objective agenda rapid sustain growth, benefit would enjoy whole population. such growth critical future economy, future society, future country. the reason simple, like effect compound interest: if, example, manage grow next 25 year average rate 6 percent year, year 2032 israel’s gdp reach ni 2,830 billion (at 2007 prices), compare ni 660 billion 2007. if hand economy grow 3 percent year period, gdp reach ni 1,380 billion. that huge difference 100 percent, prof late friend professor herbert stein use say: “the difference 3 percent growth 6 percent growth 100 percent.” if succeed travel along path rapid, sustain growth, mean available deal various problem confront u – field education, economy, social fabric, security, etc. failure cost country society dearly. today i speak two important aspect growth: (1) fact actual economic growth permeate whole population; (2) need maintain fiscal discipline. 1 actual economic growth permeate whole population growth 5 percent year, economy enjoy since 2003, significantly improve standard live whole population. a) in 2006 rate poverty, base relative measure relate mainly income differentials, stop rising. moreover, use absolute measure poverty, i.e., ability purchase basket basic goods, rate poverty actually decline 2005 well 2006. b) the decline unemployment since 2003 see educational levels, include lowest. c) the increase rate participation labor market evident part country, include outlying area (the northern southern districts). d) the rate employment israeli rise industries, include low-technology one (such construction, agriculture, hotel catering, electricity water). e) the average real wage rise industries, include low-technology industries. what conclusion draw this? it’s simple: long stick path rapid growth, people absorb labor market, standard live segment population rise. hence importance rapid continuous growth economy, society, country, everyone enjoy benefits. bi review 147/2007 1 2 the need maintain fiscal discipline in order achieve rapid continuous growth, government’s strategy – enable economy continue grow economic financial stability maintain – must adhere to. the essence strategy fiscal discipline, alongside bank israel’s interest rate policy, continue process structural reform area promote growth improve country’s social fabric. one area, possibly important, without doubt education; hence vital importance comprehensive reform field. i turn fiscal discipline. in order escape recession grip economy early 2000s, government adopt fiscal strategy aim reduce share expenditure gdp, reach 52 percent, also budget deficit. there two good reason so: need free resource private sector, main source growth, need reduce debt burden, 2003 reach 102 percent gdp threaten undermine economic stability. the situation serious obtain u government guarantee could borrow international markets. a result policy, extra advantage global economic growth, since mid-2003 economy grow impressive pace 5 percent year, debt burden reduce 82 percent gdp, government’s interest payment debt fell ni 10 billion, government’s share gdp fall 45 percent, export expand swiftly, current account balance payment show surplus 5 percent gdp, unemployment rate drop 4 percentage points, rate poverty decline (based absolute measure), tax rates. this huge success, must protected. at present, uncertainty global growth risen, even important israel maintain fiscal discipline. what government’s fiscal strategy? it set rigid framework discipline base budget target expenditure budget deficit, make sure adhere them. this greatly enhance credibility eye investor domestic international financial markets. the high level government’s credibility, combine success policy, lead reduction israel’s sovereign risk premium, improvement credit rating, oecd decision invite israel start process join organization, agreement u government extend guarantees. the result government business sector borrow reasonable cost. thus, yield maturity index government bond fall 5 percent 2003 3 percent today. households, too, pay low interest loans. for example, index interest mortgage fall average 6 percent 2003 average 4 percent currently. now, prior approval 2008 budget knesset, government set budget target next year, proposal make abandon targets. it would dangerous accept proposals. abandon target set government likely severely undermine credibility, cancel much progress made. just now, uncertainty continue global growth increased, must go back undertakings. i support effort minister finance, back prime minister, ensure framework budget 2008, base expenditure deficit target set government, soon receive knesset approval. these effort certainly important consideration lead israel’s recently improve credit rating, help minister government much make sure undertake implemented. 2 bi review 147/2007 the responsible way increase expenditure certain item alter order priority budget, within framework target set, implement conjunction reform would boost efficiency. the budget 2008 already reflect change priorities, increase expenditure defense education. it obvious education one important subjects, future economy, society, country. human capital israel’s main natural resource. it therefore vital invest education promote reform raise level youngsters’ achievements, remain within budget framework. maintain budget framework, growth-inducing reform education reform constitute important contribution government achievement goal tomorrow’s economic agenda – rapid sustain growth benefit entire population. such growth critical future economy, society, country. bi review 147/2007 3 lorenzo bini smaghi: bank consolidation, innovation access credit speech mr lorenzo bini smaghi, member executive board european central bank, cesifin, florence, 11 december 2007. * * * 1. introduction1ladies gentlemen, i would like thank invite take part conference, cover important topic, european also local level. a know, financial industry go unprecedented period consolidation. fundamental change regulation technology spur record number bank merger acquisition (m&as) countries. very recently, even witness significant series cross-border m&as bank sector, especially europe. this consolidation bring major change bank industry, also important consequence economy whole. in speech today, i would like talk implication development finance condition small medium-sized enterprise (smes). after briefly describe consolidation process, i consider impact on: i) bank system whole, ii) shareholder value, iii) credit smes, iv) small banks. moreover, i offer think possible implication current credit turmoil. 2. bank consolidation let start overview bank consolidation currently experiencing. in last ten years, number bank europe (to precise, 15 eu country prior 2004) decrease almost 30%, time total asset hold bank system increase 100%.2 this process imply average bank size term total asset rise significantly, €1.8 billion €5 billion, increase approximately 200%. in italy, bank consolidation strong 14 countries: number bank fall 10%, banks’ total asset increase 75% average bank size increase 100%. bank merger acquisition main path bank consolidation. this activity buoyant europe, judge number deal volume, also term cross-border transactions.3 over 800 m&as take place past ten years, total value put €500 billion. italy alone see 200 deals, total value €100 billion. all all, push towards consolidation bank sector substantial. 1 the view express reflect author. i thank j.-l. peydró-alcalde input preparation remarks. 2 ecb calculations. 3 ecb calculations. bi review 147/2007 1 there also large number cross-border m&as recent years: 100 past two year europe. in last three years, average value per transaction increase significantly, even without consider exceptional case acquisition abn ambro rbs, santander fortis. in italy, contrast, cross-border deal limit average value, comparison european country well domestic m&as. the main reason unprecedented wave consolidation financial sector common countries. in response fundamental change regulation technology, financial institution attempt improve efficiency attract new customer expand internationally add range products. the desire preserve fall margin increase market share attract new customer often fulfil way m&as, since allow financial institution grow rapidly improve knowledge new product markets.4 by achieve economy scale scope, merger make bank efficient5, least eliminate poor management, might also help financial institution good diversify portfolios. 3. effect bank system there several way bank m&as improve efficiency.6 first, big bank may gain access cost-saving technology spread fix cost large base, thus reduce average costs. efficiency gain may also result economy scope: deal may allow merge party enter new market cross-sell product wide customer base. finally, consolidation may improve managerial efficiency. however, extent exploitable scale scope economy might small commonly thought, efficiency gain result good management might elusive large, complex institutions. the direct cost arise m&as take several forms: consolidate different organisation easy task may lead inefficiencies. there also external costs. these take several forms. first, financial product (in particular, deposit small business lending) market mainly local. therefore, m&as involve bank large market share might cause adverse price changes, harm consumers. second, m&as might distract participant small business lending, rely soft information local level, le custom-made product easily manageable within large organisations, i elaborate little later. third, depend type business geography, bank m&as could harm bank customer reduce competition. therefore, since bank m&as affect bank also customers, quantify efficiency gain become difficult. an important first step towards analyse potential externality bank customer ass value create bank shareholder depositors. this i go now. late on, i analyse impact bank m&as finance small firm entrepreneurship. 4 focarelli, panetta, salleo (2002). 5 jensen ruback (1983). 6 see amel, barnes, panetta salleo (2004). 2 bi review 147/2007 4. create value shareholder the main message academic literature bank consolidation beneficial relatively small size, little evidence merger yield economy scope gain managerial efficiency.7 however, value creation bank merger acquisition improve time, possibly activity complex lesson learnt.8 moreover, estimate value gain bank merger stem cut cost eliminate overlap consolidate backroom operations.9 in addition, merger focus activity geography enhance shareholder value.10 with respect risk, evidence m&as reduce bank risk. the evidence indicate primary determinant bank risk reduction come diversification gains, gain associate achieve too-big-to-fail status, and, less degree, synergy gains.11 5. implication merger acquisition small medium-sized enterprise now let turn social benefit cost stem bank consolidation, particular respect finance small firm entrepreneurship. bank consolidation bank m&as imply reduction number bank increase bank size. this repercussion access credit small new firm since bank m&as change bank efficiency competition, also change way bank evaluate corporate borrowers: decrease soft vs. hard information lend decisions, i.e. bank m&as might distract participant small business lending, rely soft information local level. the academic result base u data suggest small business lend increase follow merger small banks, decrease large bank combine. therefore, short run look small business hurt large bank mergers. this negative effect, however, partly offset lend bank market, especially years. that is, provide bank system competitive, new big post-merger bank start cut lend small firms, bank system step start lend companies.12 a consequence, term lend volume small businesses, bank m&as seem harmful medium term. however, could case lend standard become tough – especially loan spread – merger. the empirical evidence suggest reduction spread acquirer target bank market overlap and, consequently, potential cost savings. however, spread widen significant market overlap and, therefore, increase market power post merger.13 in fact, look megabank merger us, empirical evidence suggest type merger imply shareholder value creation bank involve loss loan 7 see e.g. houston, ryngaert (1994), piloff (1996), berger et al. (1999). 8 delong deyoung (2004). 9 houston, james, ryngaert (2001). 10 delong (2001). 11 penas unal (2004). 12 berger, saunders, scalise, udell (1998). see also berger, goldberg white (2001). 13 erel (2007). bi review 147/2007 3 customers, especially small credit-constrained, acquisition in-market deal.14 all all, impact bank m&as lend small firm depend whether reason merger increase market power reduce cost and, therefore, improve efficiency. these conclusion appear even robust also analyse european experience since, side atlantic, bank play special role finance many firms.15 let consider evidence european countries. the evidence similar study do u data, sometimes evidence even stronger, since europe bank key source finance many firms.16 for instance, italian data show bank m&as adverse effect credit, especially m&a follow termination business relationship. the effect last three year end period absorbed, suggest firm able compensate negative shock.17 in addition, also base italian data, contract interest rate bank loan fall bank small share local bank market combine. the opposite result observe merger large banks.18 base evidence countries, relationship customer target bank likely acquirer customer relationship terminate bank. these effect pronounce small customer alternate lend relationships.19 furthermore, merger reduce equity value small publicly trade firm customer target bank reduction value increase size target bank.20 6. role small bank all all, evidence europe similar us. if small business tend suffer bank m&as, especially bank involve small, seem role small banks. the key characteristic lend smes “softness” information generate decision-making compare large bank rely “hard” information. hard information base account data personal knowledge repeat interaction lender borrower.21 because soft information important lend small businesses, supply credit small firm may negatively affect m&a activity result large bank show preference transaction-based lend relationship-based lending. in fact, evidence suggest small bank use soft information lend are, therefore, key sme lending.22 moreover, i say earlier, m&as small bank increase bank efficiency lend smes. small bank also lend risky firms, generally smes.23 14 see carow et al. (2006). 15 see ecb (2007). 16 see ecb (2007). 17 bonaccorsi di patti, gobbi (2007). 18 sapienza (2002). 19 degryse, masschelein, mitchell (2005). see also sapienza (2002). 20 karceski, ongena, smith (2005). 21 stein (2002). 22 berger, miller, petersen, rajan, stein (2005). 23 jiménez, ongena, peydró-alcalde saurina (2007). 4 bi review 147/2007 we see m&a deal bank le likely extend credit small businesses. therefore, could especially difficult firm almost credit history (e.g., start-ups) obtain credit, especially m&as large banks. empirical evidence suggest bank consolidation slow rate new business formation primarily drive large bank acquirers. consolidation small medium-sized bank show positive impact new business development. but case effect short-term.24 a result, effect bank m&as new firm resemble finance small firms. 7. outlook i would like touch upon development current period financial turbulence offer comment potential impact consolidation firms’ access credit. obviously, difficult stage predict development i shall refrain so, i shall nevertheless try draw conclusions. the sub-prime mortgage crisis could give rise three type scenario. first, would seem likely certain period time securitisation decline. the valuation operations, multiplier effect bank allow credit use efficiently, prove difficult, even rat agencies. there tendency rat agency bank review valuation model illiquid asset general. furthermore, financial intermediary – particular bank – need overhaul liquidity management practices. the strong demand liquidity currently witnessing, continue prompt bank obtain fund directly monetary authority rather interbank market, demonstrate risk able liquidate asset quickly low cost market underestimated. a return normal condition markets, hopefully new year, require re-thinking financial institution valuation model well dependence, liquidity management requirements, counterparties could experience kind difficulty. thirdly, financial intermediary may need increase capital absorb potential loss refinance investment vehicle off-balance-sheet items, which, basel ii next year, appear balance sheet. what impact development bank consolidation? on one hand, bank could focus next month aim review internal organisation, improve balance sheet restructure. there could pause consolidation process. furthermore, restrictive finance condition could discourage merger acquisitions, often finance short term bank loans. on hand, one way reinforce solidity asset side balance sheet could proceed either merger acquisitions. recently, witness strengthen capital large bank emergence new shareholders, particular foreign shareholders. the emergence large sovereign fund country financial system need strengthen interest development international financial system, even raise number question term transparency, objective stability. 24 see francis, hasan wang (2007) black strahan (2002). bi review 147/2007 5 overall, process concentration may continue next month affect major financial institutions. recent development also show process concentration necessarily one direction, i.e. consolidation. in particular, see break-up one large european institution, perhaps grow disproportionately large. the need strengthen asset base bank could lead downsize elimination business lines, thereby create opportunity institutions. what effect trend credit non-financial firms, particular small medium-sized companies? on one hand, need restructure strengthen assets, beyond drying-up securitisation, could lead slowdown lend banks, particularly affect recent turbulence. on hand, maintain profitability bank could lead reinforcement relationship clients, particularly high-quality one term balance-sheet profitability transparency. from point view, credit small medium-sized companies, le standardised, could suffer. however, bank cease pursue certain type activity, particular large bank option regard reorganisation activities, current turmoil could create opportunity competitor enter new market search new customers. consequently, level bank competition could increase considerably come month could benefit end customer. it still early predict effect prevail come months. the situation differ greatly across countries, sector institutions. the recent data credit condition indicate increase cost finance non-financial corporations, particularly debt instruments, i.e. exclude finance stock market. although overnight rate remain practically unchanged june september 2007, short-term bank interest rate loan corporation increase around half percentage point euro area, similar amount italy. a regard long term interest rates, market rate fell around half percentage point june september, long-term rate bank loan increase 15 30 basis points. the bank lend survey publish european central bank end september indicate condition credit corporation become restrictive result market turbulence. this tighten seem pronounce large corporations, line evidence available unite state unite kingdom. nevertheless, fact cost bank finance increase total finance costs, also include market financing, might suggest credit condition become whole le favourable corporation dependent bank credit, particular small medium-sized corporations. a regard reason differ attitude among bank respect credit activity, bank lend survey provide evidence certain reappraisal expectation regard growth, general sectoral level, well cost availability finance banks, heart current market tensions. indeed, response question add late version survey, bank report perceptible worsen finance conditions, regard interbank market also debt instrument maturities. despite le favourable supply conditions, demand credit credit actually grant remain dynamic third quarter 2007, euro area whole also italy. this suggest that, overall, cannot conclude credit squeeze currently occur euro area. credit supply condition remain favourable previous surveys. this rule le favourable development ahead, line intention record surveys. 6 bi review 147/2007 these consideration suggest caution need assess future developments. too often past, hurry forecast prove wrong one way another. therefore, important closely monitor underlie market condition ask financial institution clarify, soon possible, current balance sheet position also future strategies, particular regard relation customers. thank attention. reference amel, d., c. barnes, f. panetta c. salleo (2004), “consolidation efficiency financial sector: a review international evidence”, journal bank finance, vol. 28, n. 10. bce (2007), “il finanziamento delle piccole e medie imprese nell’area dell’euro”, monthly bulletin, august. berger, a.n., a. saunders, j.m. scalise g.f. udell (1998), “the effect bank merger acquisition small business lending”, journal financial economics, vol. 50, n. 2, pp. 187-229. berger, a.n., l.g. goldberg l.j. white (2001), “the effect dynamic change bank competition supply small business credit”, european finance review, vol. 5, n. 1-2, pp. 115-139. berger, a.n., n.h. miller, m.a. petersen, r.g. rajan j.c. stein (2005), “does function follow organization form?

be islamic finance go niche market global appeal? what key driver enhance efficiency competitiveness islamic finance industry would turn help broaden appeal turn enhance sustainability? in brief remark i touch debates. 2. despite transitory challenge – typical new emerge industry, view prospect growth islamic finance promise rest build effective system islamic finance.1 grow interest lead rise investment islamic finance result phenomenal growth islamic finance businesses. interest discipline already extend beyond muslim islamic country non-muslim population jurisdiction non-islamic financial institutions. the avoidance forbid investment (“haram” products) interest rate speculative structure prohibit islamic jurisprudence islamic finance’s emphasis equitable financial system offer distinct appeal muslim attract option. appeal shariah compliant finance mechanism also likely powerful tool enhance access development finance empower poor vulnerable groups, particularly islamic bank extend reach rural area currently effectively serve conventional system. 3. irrespective religious appeal affiliations, consumer would eventually attract islamic finance position offer efficient competitive alternate avenue financial intermediation cater segment population economy service retail personal bank project finance. this happen key message principle islamic finance flexibly, constructively innovatively interpreted, conceptual framework developed, nurture translate effectively practical applications, work launch good develop interface linkage islamic conventional finance unleash synergy advantage global financial development. driver enhance efficiency competitiveness 4. few key driver enhance efficiency competitiveness islamic finance include: (i) financial engineer innovation. (ii) global financial center regulator support islamic finance industry. (iii) standard governance prudential regulation supervisory guidance require tweak regulation properly identify assign proper weight new 1 “building effective islamic financial system.” dr. shamshad akhtar, governor state bank pakistan, global islamic financial governor’s: financial regulator forum islamic finance, kuala lumpur, 27 march 2007. bi review 146/2007 1 different type risk associate special unique characteristic islamic finance business. (iv) development adoption simple standard cost effective legal framework contract associate new hybrid products. (v) flexible practical application enforcement shariah principle injunction acceptability public. 5. take items, first emphasize financial engineer innovation one potent tool islamic finance key driver attract global economic financial player’s interest critical competitiveness sustainability islamic finance. increasingly scholars, academic practitioner work global bank offer wide range wholesale, retail trade finance bank solutions. for instance: (i) vanilla sukuks compliment range hybrid sukuks: sukuk –ijara, sukuk-musharaka, sukuk-moharba forth – per imf recent study today twenty odd different variant sukuk. (ii) islamic derivative market offer islamic equivalent interest rate swap/option call profit rate swap/option islamic cross currency fx swap options. this appreciable development give shariah compliant transaction fulfill existence underlie real asset generally approve uncertainty (jahala) speculation undue risk take (gharar). (iii) private equity already structural compatibility islamic financing, although deploy shariah eligible uses. (iv) personal bank solution float save investment account information technology use offer online, atm telephone bank services.

(vi) in case move bancassurance establishment associate takaful institution append insurance sweetener also wave, though slow take off. 6. there scope deepen financial engineer innovation exploit edge promote equity base finance structure hybrid debt: equity instruments. this allow islamic bank offer rich multiple option customer, allow bank opportunity proper fund mobilization asset diversification. it allow avenue proper diversification integration financial service pool risk blend islamic conventional finance epitomize risk share stakeholder align reward consistent risks. 7. second drive factor would global financial center regulator support islamic finance industry. currently wave interest islamic finance fascinate help attract global bank asia europe use skill augment application islamic finance principles. a expect approach level enthusiasm pro-activism vary western world. i would like highlight emerge approach unite kingdom set course conducive practical approach development islamic finance i would advocate develop 2 bi review 146/2007 jurisdiction pursue. u.k aim strike balance whereby fsa’s recent paper2 highlight adopt “no obstacle favors” policy islamic finance. recognize secular framework, u.k upfront, practical candid require financial institution find mechanism conform fsa basic regulatory framework, open accommodative interpretation rule regulations. to conform fsa requirements, islamic financial institution ensure structure evolve compliance fsa requirements. meanwhile, u.k provide necessary flexibility require relief regulation case case basis. equally supportive u.k rationalization multiple tax applicable purchase sale property facilitate sukuks islamic mortgages. 8. third critical driver islamic finance effort launch central bank reach understand bank regulation supervision. broad understand evolve financial institution conform standard financial regulation supervision requirement applicable conventional banks. there steady progress improvise modify regulatory framework recognize safeguard require risk associate islamic bank solution require capital treatment special unique characteristic islamic finance business. the difference asset liability structure islamic finance complexity associate different islamic products, however, tend alter risk perception associate financial system. 9. a such, work ifsb industry continue critical evolve good understand different risk cushion risks. ensure harmonization consistent adoption, application implementation evolve standard islamic finance product challenge absolutely require avoid regulatory arbitrage industry certain islamic jurisdictions. potential distortion inevitable islamic prudential regulatory capital adequacy standard require guidance awareness. furthermore, line spirit bank international settlement subscribe regulatory standards, ifsb standard also voluntary, rather compulsory compliance. while would result difference time adoption standard islamic industry, expect grow awareness market investor factor difference compliance choice institutions. 10. fourth critical driver islamic finance would development adoption simple standard legal frameworks. contract core islamic transaction define rule sale purchase/trade/exchange good services. contract structure around nature transaction could either form trade financing; asset base finance different form partnerships. under islamic finance preference give trade physical asset well trade right grow hybrid product demand legal documentation multiply add cost transaction. certainty contract another important element islamic contract law. the body islamic contract law rich supportive participant’s right transaction onerous, complex prone different interpretation rulings. equally challenge question enforceability term condition lack ability court arbitrate litigation case dispute contracts. 11. fifth, recognize islamic finance evolutionary stage sustainability would depend critically regulator work islamic scholar reach flexible shared, unified, understand principle element international level, despite difference faith disciplines. there number faith discipline across muslim jurisdiction (for e.g. syria pakistan 2 financial service authority: islamic finance uk: regulation challenges. micheal ainley, ali. mashayekhi, robert hicks, arshadur rahman ali ravalia. november 2007. bi review 146/2007 3 predominantly hanafi school, bahrain, dubai abu dhabi pursue maliki school, saudi arabia qatar rely hanbali school). rather pursue harmonize views, faith develop application add cost transaction, introduce doubt viability islamic finance give split opinions, confuse public basically rely scholar endorsement product business. these difference along different interpretation shariah scholar board advisor within banks, significant, carry risk sharia arbitrage carry complication regulators. reach consensus shared/harmonized guidance among scholar different belief faith evolve unify institutional mechanism adoption common shariah standard ensure proper enforcement effective internal control compliance would let industry grow compete level play field. flexible simple interpretation basic tenet level scholar would enhance public acceptability. 12. finally, keep macro consideration aside, islamic bank late starter face real challenge compete well establish conventional industry. furthermore, full-fledged islamic bank per license requirement confine islamic business products, conventional bank islamic window inherent advantage compete aggressively offer conventional islamic businesses. different approach license debate implication competitiveness industry whereby argument put forward interest foster healthy competition bank allow choose offer without imposition license policy constraints.3 to propel islamic industry allow dedicate islamic bank well accept course long regulator shield provide preferential treatment institution create level play field regulatory supervisory oversight. next stage development 13. competitiveness islamic finance future would depend government regulator perceive nurture future development islamic finance address issue highlight develop institutional, regulatory supervisory framework effective enforcement. in next stage islamic finance development, need substantive work islamic finance area of: (i) standardization contract documentation would reduce transaction cost risk litigation. (ii) development dispute resolution mechanism sharia compliance matter regulator position resolve these. (iii) proper implementation evolve guidance regulatory standard special feature islamic without comprise international standard islamic conventional bank subject too. (iv) development interface regulator – far seem systematic alliance central bank coordinate standard set compliance. there however need good coordination bank non bank regulator also late launch

interaction market credit risk welcome address dr han reckers, member executive board deutsche bundesbank, conference interaction market credit risk, berlin, 6 december 2007. * * * lady gentleman i would like warmly welcome conference interaction market credit risk, hold jointly research task force basel committee bank supervision, deutsche bundesbank journal bank finance. a board member deutsche bundesbank, i proud institution host conference distinguish researchers, bank practitioners, regulators, central bankers. i especially proud deutsche bundesbank offer host conference one year ago clear interaction market credit risk would receive much attention today. give recent event financial markets, interaction different risk type become quite topical. the conference topic choose result outstanding forecast power. rather, main motivation research task force form work group interaction market credit risk diversification benefit market credit risk – really make headlines. instead, another aspect interaction market credit risk become newsworthy. it question economy affect credit risk start trade or, words, credit risk transform market risk. the uncertainty finally bear risk severe effect market participant would expected, say, one year ago. i talk much ongoing turbulence detail i sure reason behind deserve rigorous analysis. instead, let give information conference come being. at risk bore member work group interaction market credit risk, i think may help participant academia, industry regulatory authority relate topic conference interest three groups. trader front office consider market credit risk jointly long time, regard counterparty risk also purpose capital arbitrage, instance. by contrast, ten year ago hardly case bank book, credit risk mostly risk type considered. about decade ago, trade credit risk – either securitisation credit derivative – start grow rapidly. the chance sell buy credit risk, instead hold loan maturity, place bank increase pressure know present value asset well maturity. this pose challenge risk model present value depend complex way market factor like interest rate exchange rates. therefore, surprise growth credit trade accompany rapid technological progress, instance, development new credit portfolio models. it difficult say come first – word – whether new risk measurement technique egg increase credit trade hen vice versa. technological progress continue present day. the interaction market credit risk take account sophisticate models. the increase trade credit one hand offer opportunity diversification credit risk whole financial system contribute financial stability. on bi review 146/2007 1 hand, also see development incur new risks, inadequate recognition risk inside single bank, new adverse risk-taking incentive imperfection hedges, it, finally, new effect one discover before. these development first reason bank managers, regulator central banker improve understand interaction market credit risk. in addition developments, industry representative concern diversification effect market risk credit risk ignore regulators, could lead high minimum capital requirements. a deep understand diversification effect relevance risk aggregation bank second reason conference interaction market credit risk. at end 2005, research task force project group interaction market credit risk receive mandate, first, collect summarise information state art measure interaction market credit risk, second, set conduct research project rather broad field. a vastly unexplored research area, new work group become one research-oriented group research task force. lady gentlemen, conference contribute bring together three group involve interaction market credit risk: bank practitioners, regulators, researchers. the need make exchange idea knowledge obvious. the interaction market credit risk simply complex recognise without proper methodological framework. both bank practitioner regulator therefore need input researchers. researchers, turn, need learn regulators’ bankers’ experiences. finally, bank practitioner regulator close contact either way, so. thus, come surprise host conference tie well several bundesbank’s activity aim bring industry, regulator research together. such event are, instance, rtf conference concentration risk autumn 2005 annual series bundesbank spring conference autumn conferences, science-related topics. this series enjoy fairly high reputation. lady gentlemen, time almost over, let take opportunity thank philipp hartmann ecb klaus düllmann bundesbank assume burden main organiser conference. i would also like thank scientific committee great job select 13 paper 80 submissions, hiroaki kuwahara basel secretariat support prepare workshop. last least, thank go m bothe team people contribute workshop one way another. once again, i would like extend warm welcome workshop hope two day lively enrich discussion. 2 bi review 146/2007 jean-claude trichet: the process european economic financial integration keynote speech mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, journalist symposium “konvent für deutschland”, berlin, 5 december 2007. * * * 1. introduction1 e ist mir eine große ehre, al gastredner zu diesem journalisten-symposium berlin geladen zu sein, um über die wirtschaftliche und finanzielle integration europa zu sprechen. d gedanke ist nicht neu. bereits al d vertrag von rom vor einem halben jahrhundert unterzeichnet wurde, stand d freie grenzüberschreitende verkehr von waren, dienstleistungen, kapital und personen im mittelpunkt d bemühungen d innereuropäischen politik, die schließlich zum europäischen binnenmarkt führen sollten. [it great pleasure invite guest speaker journalist symposium berlin talk european economic financial integration. the idea financial economic integration new. even time treaty rome signed, half century ago, prime focus intra-european policy facilitate free flow goods, services, capital people across national frontiers, initiative become single market.] if allow me, i continue english. today, european union comprise 27 country population total 494 million people, romania bulgaria join january year. the impressive enlargement eu go hand hand successful creation economic monetary union among 13 eu country 317 million citizens. the 13 become 15 january next year, cyprus malta join euro area, add another 1 million people population euro area. however, europe still need make progress fully reap benefit euro. in respect, achieve objective “konvent für deutschland”, enhance ability make reform germany, urgently needed. this bring issue i like address today, namely european economic financial integration. first, i like share fact process economic financial integration europe. second, i like talk economic adjustment processes. smooth adjustment process enhance economic financial integration crucial proper function european economies. 2. economic financial integration europe allow elaborate three aspect economic integration europe, namely trade, labour mobility business cycle synchronisation. i) first, economic integration reflect mark increase intra-euro area trade good services. let mention figures. the share export import good term gdp within euro area increase 6 percentage point 1998 2006, stand around 32% gdp. the 1 i like thank malin andersson input speech, klaus masuch hans-joachim klöckers helpful comments, well katherine brandt, annalisa ferrando, arne gieseck, matthew hart, christophe kamps andrea lüske additional contributions. bi review 145/2007 1 share intra-euro area export import service increase 2 percentage point period, almost 7% gdp. a trade integration within euro area become stronger, region also become open outside world. the share extra-euro area export import good rise 9 percentage point 1998 2006, around 33% gdp. over period, share extra-euro area export import service increase 2 percentage points, almost 10% gdp. german extra-euro area trade contribute particularly strongly developments, increase 31% german gdp 1998 51% 2006. german trade good example fact euro area open economy “fortress europe”. by comparison, unite states, export import good lower, represent 22% gdp trade service 6% 2006. ii) a second aspect process economic integration degree synchronisation co-movement different cyclical position across euro area countries. this degree synchronisation increase since begin 1990s. in words, large number euro area economy share similar business cycles. in addition, decline inflation differential across euro area country impressive recent years. the level dispersion currently low level among 14 u metropolitan statistical areas.2 dispersion real gdp growth rate across euro area country fluctuate around level similar one observe output growth across region within unite states.3 iii) labour mobility within eu constitute third aspect economic integration i like mention. labour mobility offer additional choice workers. it dampen effect country-specific shock decrease risk wage pressure labour market tighten. available evidence suggest that, overall, cross-border labour mobility still limit within european union regulatory barrier still existing, even within euro area respect labour slovenia, example. germany belong country currently prevent labour mobility eu countries. this come time many company report problem find properly skilled labour. for instance, german industry currently report significant shortage labour, accord survey european commission. comparable figure labour mobility eu unite state difficult obtain figure interpret cautiously. still, unite states, geographical labour mobility appear far higher. let turn financial integration europe. the introduction euro contribute intra-european financial integration which, turn, facilitate free 2 at begin 1990s, dispersion inflation rate across countries, belong euro area, was, average, around 6 percentage point (standard deviation measure unweighted terms). so far year, inflation dispersion 0.5 percentage point. dispersion among 14 u metropolitan statistical area move around 1 percentage point past two decades. dispersion real gdp growth rate across euro area country fluctuate around level 2 percentage point past decades. 3 it stress difference temporary, others persistent. sustain difference economic growth inflation rate euro area country normal monetary union, extent relate catching-up phenomena. however, also true persistent differential reflect structural rigidity concern. 2 bi review 145/2007 movement capital euro area. financial integration strengthen competition raise potential strong non-inflationary economic growth.4 it also improve smooth effective transmission single monetary policy throughout euro area. financial integration also help financial system channel fund economic agent surplus save shortage; particular, enable agent effectively trade, hedge, diversify pool risks. a result, good share diversification risk. accord academic research, unite states, period 1963-90, capital market smooth 39% shock gross state product (the equivalent gdp), credit channel smooth 23% federal government, fiscal channel, 13%.5 around 25% shock smooth out. hence financial market financial institution contribute 62% absorption idiosyncratic state shocks. we therefore see u example financial channel much important fiscal channel. this additional reason speed financial integration europe. in recent study, find situation euro area country begin converge towards unite state inter-euro area country capital flow increase. it find would become euro area country (excluding luxembourg), capital market would smooth 10% country-specific shock gdp 1993 2000.6 a set indicators, publish ecb, point increase degree integration euro area financial bank market since 1999.7 moreover, size capital market – term ratio total value stock, bond loan market gdp – increase substantially since 1999, potential grow even further, see comparison unite states. in period 1995-99, 177% gdp euro area 279% unite states; 2005-06 increase 256% euro area, 353% gdp unite states. in germany ratio rise 202% 229% gdp. integration retail banking, contrast, slow far. there still significant difference bank deposit lend interest rate across euro area countries. in euro area, cross-country dispersion high intra-regional dispersion rate unite states.8 this notwithstanding, overall evidence grow economic financial integration among country european union. the adoption euro contribute development reduce information costs, enhance price transparency eliminate exchange rate risk country euro area. nonetheless, fields, lot 4 a research study conduct london economics estimate benefit integration european bond equity market around 1% additional gdp ten-year period. london

adjustment process euro area economic financial integration prerequisite smooth function euro area. in monetary union like euro area, regional monetary exchange rate policy long available options, important ensure market adjustment mechanism function properly. such mechanism need order prevent country region, experience country-specific shock, enter period protract low growth high unemployment, long period overheating. there many factor improve resilience euro area economy adverse shocks. in context, ecb’s monetary policy contribute proper function adjustment mechanism within euro area ensure price stability, credible ensure price stability therefore anchor price stability economic agents’ expectation decisions. this anchor expectation important enable market participant set suitable prices. and let add best way anchor inflation expectation independent accountable central bank. german history provide best possible example this. well-designed structural policy enhance flexibility product labour market crucial absorb shock effectively. needle say, responsibility implementation policy hand national governments, parliaments, social partners. in context, lisbon strategy fundamental ambitious programme design draw europe’s attention urgency structural reforms. such reform improve long-term growth prospect euro area by, one hand, positively affect labour participation and, other, improve labour productivity growth promotion innovation technological change. we know well structural reform often face resistance economic agent sensitivity public opinion. therefore, essential understand communicate medium long-term benefit structural reform significantly outweigh short-term cost. the ecb therefore strongly support government implementation structural reforms. for instance, germany, labour market reforms, implement year ago, significantly contribute job creation, low unemployment recent economic upswing. it essential result jeopardise interrupt even reverse reform process. unemployment germany still high reform require good utilise labour potential country. more specifically, labour market, economic flexibility promote remove institutional barrier flexible wage price-setting mechanisms. let stress government social partner share responsibility ensure wage determination appropriately take account labour market condition industrial, sectoral regional level jeopardise competitiveness employment.9 government aware wage set public sector often serf role model private sector. moreover, sufficient wage differentiation need improve employment opportunity le skilled worker region sector high unemployment. in respect, excessive wage regulation undermine job creation, particular young le qualify worker well face problem enter labour 9 see, example, analysis role wage development 1970s explain european unemployment o. blanchard, “the medium run”, brook paper economic activity, no. 2, 1997, pp. 89-141. 4 bi review 145/2007 market. in particular, set minimum wage level line productivity reduce employment chance le skilled worker unemployed. a see germany follow unification, period adjustment painful, reform unit labour cost moderation finally pay contribute robust growth. i remember observer argue several year ago much strong wage increase need germany high growth. the recent evidence confirm view. on contrary, increase competitiveness see german economy – thank moderate unit labour cost development – important prerequisite strong job creation observe recent years. not germany, also euro area whole, employment growth impressive eight half year since euro changeover. employment growth amount 14.9 million person euro area, oppose 3.8 million previous eight half years. reform also need product markets. let first stress importance fully complete single market, particularly service network industries. a deep integration market would stimulate price flexibility foster competition open product markets. great cross-border competition integration market across euro area country would contribute low prices. it could also enhance adjustment process individual country event asymmetric shock differ cyclical developments. it also important promote financial market integration development readily available opportunity portfolio diversification. this would help attenuate impact country-specific shocks, i mention earlier. national authority make substantial contribution ensure proper function adjustment mechanism within euro area conduct well-designed fiscal policy. a i stress many occasions, best contribution fiscal policy make proper function euro area sustainable medium-term oriented, fully line orientation stability growth pact. moreover, fiscal policy also focus increase effectiveness efficiency public sector high quality expenditure tax policies. large inefficient public sector put brake growth impose high tax burden economy channel resource unproductive uses. in respect, welcome effort german government reduce regulatory burden further. in addition, late fiscal development germany encouraging. for first time since german reunification, general government expect record balance budget, record deficit maastricht treaty’s threshold 3% gdp period 2002 2005. while partly base revenue-increasing measures, increase standard vat rate begin year, success fiscal consolidation also significantly attribute expenditure restraint. indeed, share government expenditure gdp drop 4½ percentage point past four years, reach level considerably low euro area average. at current juncture, important government stay course, maintain moderate expenditure growth strengthen incentive work invest. if policy continue path structural expenditure restraint last improvement fiscal balances, germany could become fiscal role model euro area would well prepare fiscal challenge short long run. it particularly important country prepare le favourable economic condition rise fiscal burden, long run, associate population ageing. in context, gradual increase pension age germany important step right direction. it help reduce large ageing-related fiscal burden young active generations. bi review 145/2007 5 let finally mention crucial issue competitiveness, one important market-based adjustment mechanism monetary union.10 competitiveness usually assess basis various measure cost price competitiveness11, complement account “non-price” factors, quality technological content good produced. a special feature competitiveness differential euro area persistence. over period 1999 2006 difference around 25 percentage point euro area country low high cumulative growth rate unit labour cost economy whole. germany austria belong first group countries, ireland, portugal greece belong second. persistent difference competitiveness may normal phenomenon economy process sustainable catching-up, lead high level per caput income, whenever economy cope structural change past shock nature would reflect new relative price equilibrium. that said, persistent loss relative cost competitiveness also relate, instance, number structural rigidity lead inertia price wage formation. they may worry signal economy, indicate need caution. hence, development price cost competitiveness across euro area economy need closely monitored. it important party concern – private sector, social partners, national public authority – contribute flexibility price wages. in manner, economically unjustified loss competitiveness would avoid risk possibly protract adjustment cost competitiveness channel minimised. 4. conclusion lady gentlemen, let conclude. the single currency economic monetary union impressive remarkable success, perhaps europe’s remarkable since treaty rome signed. it u consolidate great success ensure reinforce year come. a regard monetary policy, europe count european central bank eurosystem faithful primary mandate deliver price stability medium run 317 million fellow citizens. a regard policy areas, depend central bank, let stress three area sound policy absolutely essence: sound fiscal policies, fully line stability growth pact; structural reform policies, fully line lisbon strategy achievement single market; last least appropriate monitor relative cost competitiveness indicator euro area. it encourage see past reform contribute job creation reduce unemployment. it important government continue direction reverse past reform point start bear fruit. thank much attention. 10 see, extensive discussion adjustment mechanisms, “the eu

bank expose subprime mortgages. in financial markets, fear loss spread segment u mortgage market. consequently, spread uncollateralised collateralised money-market interest rate long maturity remain unusually wide many countries. finally, liquidity crisis lead many euro area u bank tighten credit term several customer groups. what consequence financial turmoil denmark? i focus two issues. firstly, development affect danish financial system? and secondly, cyclical impact turmoil? at short end money market, international financial turmoil reduce danish banks' readiness lend krone other. there indication certain increase precautionary liquidity, sign tension short end bi review 145/2007 1 money market, danmark nationalbank conduct extraordinary open market operation connection. danmark nationalbank's normal open market operation take place via so-called open window. the demand loan certificate deposit meet rate interest determine danmark nationalbank. in words, counterparties fairly wide scope structure liquidity vis-à-vis danmark nationalbank. the development banks' mortgage-credit institutes' account danmark nationalbank indicate substantial increase precautionary liquidity via channel. longer-term uncollateralised money-market interest rate krone increase due international turmoil. the fluctuation spread uncollateralised collateralised money-market interest rate have, however, le pronounce denmark euro area especially usa. even normal circumstance turnover segment danish money market relatively limited, naturally high interest rate affect numerous financial product link cibor similar interest rates. from time time, danish bank difficulty raise dollar-denominated loans. this isolate danish phenomenon; bank european country experience difficulties. danmark nationalbank cannot provide liquidity facility cover borrow requirement foreign exchange since role primarily link krone-denominated liquidity. bank large business volume foreign exchange must ensure adequate contingency fund plan relevant currencies. overall, danish money market navigate fairly successfully rough waters, ultimately show danish financial system good shape. nevertheless, denmark affect international turmoil. financial statement 3rd quarter show danish bank also expose investment vehicles, liquidity line structure credit products. the exposure loss were, however, relatively small size. lend danish bank increase substantially recent years, see growth rate excess 30 per cent. earn high loss low. particularly mortgage loan homeowner grow significantly. growth lend strong large deposit-loan gap kr. 400 billion accumulated. this amount banks' lend exceed deposit customers. consequently, danish bank rely financial money market source financing. development abroad summer show risky base one's business financing. the price market finance may change rapidly, market may "dry up". the international liquidity crisis provide opportunity test contingency fund plan review business strategy light findings. it easy use danish bank finance growth via financial money markets. finance become expensive, rise cost finance undoubtedly reflect banks' earn price charge customers. growth lend remain high, declining. some bank adopt le aggressive business strategy put expansion plan hold. others express intention reduce commitment international investment vehicles, liquidity line structure credit product due reputational risk. development show strategy base double-digit growth rate cannot simply extended. the strong growth lend corporate sector entail great risk loss banks. this risk rising, low level. unpleasant surprise never rule out, economy still favourable. and financial statement 3rd quarter also show banks' earn remain high. solvency generally sound, writedowns low. view perspective, danmark 2 bi review 145/2007 nationalbank currently opinion international turmoil may serve "useful" wake-up call danish banks. the necessary adaptation change circumstance make timely manner without serious cost large majority bank economy whole. what cyclical impact turmoil? growth global economy unusually high recent years. however, turmoil financial market give rise concern future development. growth decline usa, although crisis u mortgage market derive financial turmoil yet fully reflect rest economy. so far, upswing set continue europe asia, outlook also positive africa latin america. oil price rise strongly recent month put damp growth prospect also add inflationary pressures. until now, international organisation reduce growth forecast moderately – except respect usa, growth 2008 predict le 2 per cent – recession foreseen. clear concern express whether uncertainty link financial market downturn house market – usa – spread rest economy, thereby curb growth usa also affect europe. in danish perspective, outlook export market remain positive, downward trend. denmark still strong boom hot labour market capacity pressure large part economy. the rate unemployment remain surprisingly low. the tight labour market mean capacity pressure remain high, although growth demand expect moderate somewhat. this pressure lead surge import recent quarter also high rate wage increase high domestic price pressure, reflect fact wage price normally react cyclical development substantial time lag. a potential setback may therefore prolong cost level outset high compare abroad. the high temperature economy moment entail major risk case. on account fixed-exchange-rate policy, interest rate denmark align euro area, far economic cycle denmark is. contrary expectations, interest rate rise recently. this due turmoil financial markets. in situation would somewhat remarkable danish government still propose expansionary fiscal policy 2008. when prepare new finance bill 2008, government reassess fiscal policy view ease pressure economy. omit may entail tough requirement late stage. next spring bring collective bargain within public sector. among public-sector employee expectation sizeable pay rises, support recent years' shortage labour focus quality public-sector services. several political party speak favour extraordinary wage boost large small group public-sector employee via special pool fund earmark purpose. i would like issue strong warn make wage bargain public-sector labour market parliamentary issue stage. the risk party attempt bi review 145/2007 3 outdo one another imminent, premature intervention politician prevent genuine bargaining. this could set unfortunate precedent. a enough, next spring also see collective bargain financial sector. i therefore take opportunity point result sector may send signal rest labour market. finally, i would like thank danish banker association fine cooperation. i look forward continue along positive lines. 4 bi review 145/2007 rakesh mohan: india's financial sector reform – foster growth contain risk address dr rakesh mohan,

unprecedented occurrence term emerge magnitude financial sector losses. the sudden loss confidence among traditional counterparties reflect extreme information asymmetry arise complex layer risk diffusion high leveraging; breakdown risk assessment repute rat agency like. the speed contagion extensive involvement large, repute regulate financial institution indicative regulatory shortcomings, necessitate unconventional response central banks. all raise serious concern relate ability flexibility national financial system withstand shock emanate unusual developments. it also spur reconsideration aspect monetary policy financial regulation, particularly relate maintenance financial stability. india far remain relatively insulate development impact analysis suggest exposure trouble sub-prime asset relate derivative negligible comparison many economies. whereas may regard fortuitous, perhaps nuanced approach financial sector reform development serve u well; approach mark conscious gradualism implementation coordinate sequence move several front predicate preparedness change financial system particular, economy general. we also build appropriate safeguard ensure stability, take account prevail governance standards, risk management system incentive framework financial institution country. overall, progressive cautious policy contribute efficiency financial system sustain growth momentum environment macroeconomic financial stability. nevertheless, reserve bank maintain enhance vigilance able respond appropriately prevail heighten uncertainty global financial conditions. the policy challenge continue ensure financial stability india period international financial turbulence, maintain momentum high growth accompany price stability. against backdrop, i think i would take opportunity review india's approach financial sector reforms, path traverse almost two decade restrictive, even repress past, nuance somewhat unorthodox approach institute competition efficiency financial intermediation challenge face development financial sector year ahead. bi review 145/2007 1 i. financial sector reform outcome in retrospect, key success financial sector reform india since institute early 1990s maintenance financial stability period mark repeat financial crisis across world. the process reform noteworthy turbulence around path also sheer dimension change achieve position started. until begin 1990s, state financial sector india could describe classic example “financial repression” (mackinnon 1973; shaw 1973). the sector characterised, inter alia, administer interest rates, large pre-emption resource authorities, extensive micro-regulations direct major portion flow fund financial intermediaries, relatively opaque account norm limit disclosure, dominant public ownership. compartmentalisation activity different type financial intermediary strong entry barrier thwart competition result low level efficiency productivity severe credit constraint private sector, especially absence access external finance. capitalisation level low due lack commercial consideration credit plan weak recovery culture also result large accumulation non-performing loans. the predominance government security fixed-income security market india mainly reflect captive nature market financial intermediary mandate invest sizeable portion fund mobilise security finance high government borrow administered/concessional interest rates. in capital market, new equity issue govern plethora complex regulation extensive restriction little transparency depth secondary market trade securities. comprehensive exchange control result little depth foreign exchange market external transaction govern inflexible/low limit prior approval requirements. monetary policy subservient fisc. the provision fiscal accommodation ad hoc treasury bill lead high level monetisation fiscal deficit major part 1980s. the expansionary effect fiscal spend seek curb interest rate regulations, credit ration high reserve requirements, effectively prevent development financial markets. elsewhere, i attempt document various facet india’s experience financial sector reform – guide objective intellectual/analytical underpinnings; choice pace sequencing; specific aspect policy measure bank sector, non-bank financial companies, term lend institution financial intermediaries; development financial markets; change monetary policy framework (mohan, 2004; mohan, 2006c). today, i propose undertake evaluation financial sector reform term actual outcomes. ii.1 monetary policy while assess monetary policy, would reasonable assert largely successful meet key objective post-reforms period since early 1990s. inflation average close five per cent per annum decade go by, notably low average 7-8 per cent previous four decades. structural reform early 1990s couple improve monetary-fiscal interface reform government security market enable good monetary management second half 1990s onwards. a number factor increase competition, productivity gain strong corporate balance sheet also contribute low stable inflation environment, appear calibrate monetary measure substantial role play well. more importantly, regime low stable inflation has, turn, stabilise inflation expectation threshold level inflation tolerance economy come significantly (table 1). 2 bi review 145/2007 it encourage note despite high international crude oil prices, commodity price elevate food prices, inflation remain low inflation expectation appear consistent stable. consequently, nominal real interest rate fallen. due financial restructure low interest rate recent years, growth rate interest expense corporates decline consistently since 1995-96; decline significant implication improvement bottom line corporates sector whole resilience financial shocks. in term monetary policy framework, india’s approach somewhat unorthodox. traditionally, central bank pursue twin objective price stability growth employment, recent years, great attention give maintenance price stability inflation target regimes. although explicit mandate price stability indian context, objective monetary policy india evolve maintain judicious balance price stability ensure adequate flow credit productive sector economy. consideration financial stability, however, ascend hierarchy monetary policy objective recent year view increase openness indian economy, financial integration possibility cross border contagion. accordingly, believe regulation, supervision development financial system remain within legitimate ambit overall monetary policy broadly interpreted. in wake financial sector reform open economy 1990s, reserve bank switch 1998-99 multiple indicator approach whereby macroeconomic financial market data quantum rate variable examined, along output, frame monetary policy. we believe specific feature indian economy, include socio-economic characteristics, make necessary monetary authority operate multiple objective indicator time come. a single objective monetary policy, usually advocated, particularly inflation target (it) framework, luxury india cannot afford, least medium term. a regard it, even though increase number central bank adopt it since early 1990s, number central banks, notably federal reserve, retain multiple objectives. internationally, unique even best way monetary policy make different approach framework lead successful policy adapt appropriately diverse institutional, economic social environment (issing, 2004). moreover, evidence suggest average inflation well volatility prominent non-it industrial country has, fact, somewhat low prominent it industrial countries. it find beneficial effect level long-term interest rate either bi review 145/2007 3 (gramlich, 2003; ball sheridan, 2003). furthermore, it framework reduce flexibility available central bank react shock (kohn, 2003). emes face additional problem it regime. these economy typically open expose large exchange rate shock significant influence short-run inflation. a boom-bust pattern capital flow lead substantial movement exchange rates. emes may manage exchange rate heavily since commodity-price sensitive advance economy commodity price fluctuation wreak havoc forecastability consumer price inflation (eichengreen, 2002). an empirical evaluation experience emes adopt it confirm it challenge task economy compare develop economy adopt it. while inflation emes indeed low adopt it, performance good experience develop it countries. deviation inflation target find large common emes (fraga, minella goldfaj, 2003). inflation target sufficient condition success. in view above, characterization inflation target "the gold standard stabilize monetary policy" misleading. indeed, recent episode financial market turmoil, even central bank explicit inflation target price stability predominant objective force scale emphasis price stability, notwithstanding continue inflationary pressures. such central bank inject liquidity reduce policy rate – cases, hold back early expectation tighten – lay great emphasis financial stability growth. the overall macroeconomic record indian economy since early 1990s indicate acceleration growth significant reduction inflation. inflation average 5 per cent current decade far, substantially low around 8 per cent precede two half decades. pre-emptive monetary prudential measure lead welcome situation reduction inflation acceleration growth ensure financial stability. indeed, cross-country comparison major emes adopt it indicate growth india amongst high inflation remain relatively low (table 2). amongst sample g-20 major asian countries, growth india 2000-2007 second high china. inflation india current decade halve prevail 1990s is, present, low many develop economies. a recent survey mckinsey company ceo across world, develop country emerge market economy (emes), find among country surveyed, india high proportion ceos, 40 per cent, expect inflation increase come year (mckinsey quarterly, 2007). thus, would appear that, least, among business leaders, inflation expectation well-anchored india. although average growth monetary credit aggregate past 3-4 years, financial stability maintain judicious use monetary prudential measures. thus, recent record macroeconomic management india exemplary, even amongst emes target inflation. the challenge monetary policy reduce inflation medium term towards international levels, maintain momentum high growth preserve financial stability. 4 bi review 145/2007 ii.2 bank sector in post-reform period, bank experience strong balance sheet growth environment operational flexibility. concomitantly, financial health bank improve significantly, term capital adequacy asset quality. moreover, progress achieve set groundwork adoption international best practice prudential account norms. increase competitiveness productivity gain also enable proactive technological deepen flexible human resource management. these significant gain achieve even renew commitment social bank viz., maintain wide reach bank system direct credit towards important disadvantage sector society. the bank system's wide reach, judge term expansion branch growth credit deposit indicate continue financial deepen (mohan, 2006a). on liability side, deposit continue account 80 per cent total liability asset side, share loan advance investment see mark cycles, reflect banks' portfolio preference well growth cycle economy. in regard, share loan advance decline second half 1990s account industrial slowdown well tighten prudential norms, banks' credit portfolio witness sharp growth period 2003-07. bi review 145/2007 5 the overall capital position commercial bank witness mark improvement reform period (table 3). illustratively, end-march 2007, 81 schedule commercial bank operate india maintain crar 9 per cent relative basel i norm 8 per cent. for indian bank system, ratio capital risk weight asset work 13 per cent currently. while improve capitalisation public sector bank initially bring infusion fund government recapitalise banks, subsequently, public sector bank allow raise fund market equity issuance subject maintenance 51 per cent public ownership. a result, ownership public sector bank well diversified. despite tighten prudential norm term classification non-performing assets, result measure asset quality bank improve considerably share non-performing loan (npls) (as ratio total advance assets) decline substantially consistently since mid-1990s. in fact, ratio net npls net advance 1.0 per cent india comparable several advance economy (table 4). improvement credit appraisal process, upturn business cycle, new initiative resolution npls (including promulgation securitisation reconstruction financial asset enforcement security interest (sarfaesi) act), great provision write-off npls enable great profitability, contribute reduction incremental npls. 6 bi review 145/2007 efficiency gain reflect containment operate expenditure proportion total asset (table 5). this achieve spite large expenditure incur indian bank installation upgradation information technology and, case public sector banks, large expenditure voluntary pre-mature retirement nearly 12 per cent total staff strength. bi review 145/2007 7 in consonance objective enhance efficiency productivity bank great competition, consistent decline share public sector bank total asset commercial banks. nevertheless, public sector bank appear respond new challenge competition, reflect increase share overall profit bank sector. this suggest that, operational flexibility, public sector bank compete relatively effectively private sector foreign banks. share indian private sector banks, especially new private sector bank establish 1990s, total income asset bank system increase considerably since mid-1990s (table 6). indian private sector banks, particularly new private sector banks, make rapid progress term increase income asset size since mid-1990s. in term branch expansion, compound growth rate private sector bank period 2002-07 almost three time schedule commercial bank four time public sector bank (table 7). among private sector banks, four big bank viz., centurion bank punjab, hdfc bank, icici bank uti/axis bank experience rapid branch expansion range 16-46 per cent per annum term compound growth rates. while private sector banks, group, record compound growth 24 per cent per annum staff, public sector bank witness decline staff strength period reflecting, inter alia, restructure facilitate great use 8 bi review 145/2007 technology computerisation. in term growth capital reserve surplus, new private sector bank experience annual growth range 30-68 per cent, deposit advance increase 32-51 per cent 39-71 per cent, respectively. net profit record compound annual growth 27-36 per cent. in term parameters, private sector bank grow much fast exist private sector banks, might expected. there discussion recent time policy branch license bank reserve bank india: could restrict competition growth new banks. these data exhibit high growth experience lead private sector bank arguable whether could much fast expansion without impair prudential quality integrity balance sheets. what encourage significant improvement productivity indian bank system term various productivity indicator (mohan, 2006a). these improvement could drive two factors: technological improvement, expand range production possibility catch effect, peer pressure amongst bank compel raise productivity levels. here, role new business practices, new approach expansion business introduce new private bank utmost importance. to sum up, significant improvement performance public sector bank witness past decade so, facilitate phase introduction wide-ranging financial sector reform since early 1990s. gradual introduction best international practice norms, refinement supervisory practices, tighten risk weights/provisioning norm regard sector witness high credit growth, great market discipline bring raise capital capital market list stock exchanges, interest rate deregulation, scale statutory pre-emption amongst key factor lead good performance. concomitantly, great competition induce domestic bank sector successful introduction new generation private sector banks. despite strong growth balance sheet new banks, bank system exhibit remarkable stability. although instance weakness new private sector banks, pre-emptive measure form merger bank strong banks, infusion new capital change ownership, voluntary involuntary basis, contribute strength domestic bank system, engender confidence depositor enable maintenance overall financial stability. notwithstanding substantial improvement, domestic bank system need strengthen face great external competition introduction financial innovation full capital account convertibility. bi review 145/2007 9 ii.3 financial market the notable impact financial sector reform clearly discernible development various segment financial market india. the reform since early 1990s lead regime characterise market-determined interest exchange rates, price-based 10 bi review 145/2007 instrument monetary policy, current account convertibility, substantial capital account liberalisation vibrant government security capital markets. derivative instrument cautiously introduce phase manner, product diversity and, importantly, risk management tool. all development facilitate process price discovery various financial market segments. there significant increase trade volume market liquidity (table 8). illustratively, average daily turnover money market increase rs.427 billion 1997-98 rs.888 billion 2006-07. the operation liquidity adjustment facility (laf) largely able steer overnight rate within corridor set policy rates. under laf, reserve bank absorb (reverse repo) well inject (repo) liquidity, depend upon liquidity condition consistent overall monetary policy stance. change fix reverse repo/repo rate set rbi time time conduct laf, central bank conduct daily auction banks, emerge main instrument interest rate signal indian economy. inter-bank turnover foreign exchange market nearly quadruple 2000-01 2006-07 rs. 840 billion. average daily turnover foreign exchange market (inter-bank well merchant) increase u $ 5 billion 1997-98 u $ 23 billion 2006-07. the exchange rate indian rupee exhibit significant two-way movement recent years. efficiency foreign exchange market also improve reflect decline bid-ask spreads. in government security market, issuance long-term security enable development yield curve across 30-year maturity. in government security market, drop turnover 2004-05 2005-06 could attribute factor “buy hold” tendency participant insurance companies, hold substantial portion government securities, particularly long maturities. furthermore, certain regulatory change introduce late 2004 allow bank hold large proportion bi review 145/2007 11 investment portfolio “held maturity” (htm) category reduce proportion portfolio use trading, thereby affect magnitude g-sec trading. the decline could also attribute increase interest rate period, prompt bank player hold rather trade, avoid trade losses. to keep market liquid active, reserve bank recently allow short sell government security among eligible participants, trade “when issued” segment, facility see much activity yet. effort also increase liquidity active consolidation exist securities. the derivative market also gain vibrancy last couple years. the total notional principal amount outstanding treble march 2005 june 2007 lead significant jump interest rate relate contracts. over period, notional amount interest rate relate contract quadrupled, foreign exchange contract nearly treble (table 9). certain legislative change 2006 provide clear legal legitimacy otc derivative contracts, somewhat ambiguous earlier. the government security exchange board india along reserve bank take step activate corporate debt market. a experience elsewhere, among various financial markets, corporate debt market indeed difficult develop variety reasons. the expansion pension fund insurance industry progressively result presence large financial investor base, help overall expansion financial market particular corporate debt market. it quite apparent exist well-functioning, deep, liquid, well-integrated market bonds, currency derivative india, contrary often asserted. the trade volume generally witness significant growth various segment financial market. it noteworthy increase foreign exchange market turnover india april 2004 april 2007 high amongst 54 country cover late triennial central bank survey foreign exchange derivative market activity conduct bank international settlement (bis). accord survey, daily average turnover india jump almost 5-fold u $ 7 billion april 2004 u $ 34 billion april 2007; global turnover period rise 66 per cent u $ 2.4 trillion u $ 4.0 trillion. reflect trends, share india global foreign exchange market turnover treble 0.3 per cent april 2004 0.9 per cent april 2007. in view above, comment often make regard miss financial market rather misleading. moreover, empirical evidence point towards great market 12 bi review 145/2007 integration (mohan, 2007c). a good deal development indeed take place government security market, forex market, otc interest rate derivative like. the corporate bond market indeed infancy; and, effort make develop various exchange trade derivative markets. it, however, need recognise financial market often govern herd behaviour contagion. deregulation, liberalisation, emergence financial conglomerate globalisation financial market pose grow risk financial stability. in regard, need stress volatility currency bond market significantly adverse employment, output distributional consequence compare volatility equity markets. premature liberalisation money bond market lead large volatile capital inflows, could potentially exacerbate complication macroeconomic monetary management. furthermore, excessive fluctuation volatility financial market mask underlie value give confuse signals, happen develop markets, thereby hind efficient price discovery (mohan, 2006c). a large segment economic agent india may adequate resilience withstand volatility currency money markets, reserve bank’s policy approach increasingly vigilant proactive incipient sign volatility financial markets. notwithstanding progress make since early 1990s, reserve bank recognise domestic financial market need develop much further, especially order support recent acceleration growth momentum indian economy context envisage move towards full capital account convertibility. the indian experience demonstrate development market arduous time consume task require conscious policy action effective implementation. without real sector development term physical infrastructure improvement supply elasticities, financial sector misallocate resources, potentially generate bubble possibly amplify risks. hence, financial sector reform complementarity pace process reform real sector india. give large weight stability, especially view low income level large segment population, careful cautious approach development financial market follow far would need pursue come years. the pace progress would depend upon development necessary expertise public sector banks, expansion private sector bank foreign banks. we recognise need develop various segment domestic financial market help good risk management various market participants. the demand various risk management tool could expect increase, especially presence potentially large fluctuation exchange rate interest rate future. in recognition need widen range instrument available market participants, reserve bank place draft guideline introduction credit derivative country. more recently, draft report introduction currency future india also put public domain comment feedback; work progress introduction interest rate futures. sum up, widely recognise indian financial sector last decade transform reasonably sophisticated, diverse resilient system deliver wide variety financial service efficiently profitably, spectrum financial market segment financial institution able participate operational functional autonomy environment increase deregulation international competition. the acceleration growth real economy suggest financial system serve well overall need economy. during period, global financial environment become risky wake new instrument participant rapid advance communication technology integrate market worldwide, unique feature indian reform process institute carry forward objective sustain accelerate growth momentum contain risk entrench financial stability. bi review 145/2007 13 iii. indian reform outcome international context some commentator criticise indian approach financial sector reform unclear, timid conservative context cross-country experience advocate bold drastic measure speed transition high growth. there also discomfort approach foreign banks, although even regard, ahead wto norm set roadmaps review deadline conditional upon broad consensus international commerce financial services. admittedly, cautious somewhat conservative approach financial sector reform relative emes. in regard, important note steady upward shift india’s growth path, also accompany endure stability. a remarkable feature india's growth experience resilience global domestic shocks. in regard, broad objective financial sector reform enhance efficiency productivity, process reform initiate gradual properly sequence manner reinforce effect. the approach consistently upgrade financial sector adopt international best practice consultative process. with increase deregulation financial market increase integration global economy, 1990s turbulent global financial markets: 63 country suffer systemic bank crisis decade, 45 1980s. among country experience crises, direct cost reconstruct financial system typically high: example, recapitalisation bank cost 55 per cent gdp argentina, 42 per cent thailand, 35 per cent korea 10 per cent turkey. there high indirect cost lose opportunity slow economic growth addition (mckinsey & co., 2005). it therefore particularly noteworthy india could pursue process financial deregulation open economy without suffer financial crisis turbulent period world financial markets. the cost recapitalisation public sector bank le 1 per cent gdp therefore low comparison. in assessment, gradualist approach appropriate, particularly context democratic polity, give multi-ethnic linguistic composition country. the steady pace reform bear fruit, include large section society within reform process. what remarkable sheer magnitude quality reform effort evident actual outcomes. the bank system india undergo significant change last 16 years. a cross-country survey crucial bank indicator reveal indian bank system comparable develop economy term key indicator (table 10). the capital adequacy ratio 12.4 per cent system whole end march 2006 comparable advance economies. similarly, banks’ non-performing loan total loan steadily decline low many emerge economies. in term return assets, indian bank system’s performance comparable advance economy germany u.k. 14 bi review 145/2007 cross-country comparison indicate many country also achieve considerable progress strengthen bank sector. however, noteworthy aspect indian experience able strengthen bank system without crisis negligible cost fisc, simultaneously achieve acceleration growth, price stability consistent development financial markets. our bank sector reform unique world combine comprehensive reorientation competition, regulation ownership non-disruptive cost-effective manner. indeed, bank reform good illustration dynamism public sector manage overhang problem pragmatism public policy enable domestic foreign private sector compete expand (reddy, 2007). the overall stability impart system undergo reform serve u well far face recent financial developments. to exemplify argument, i think i would spend time recent financial developments, possible cause likely consequence good appreciate conduct india’s financial sector reforms. iv. recent international financial developers: issue monetary policy financial sector regulation in contrast early crises, cause-and-effect sequence blur current turmoil view extreme information asymmetry. some define feature global economy could direct bear current crisis are: “great moderation” – i.e., sustain decline inflation/inflation volatility consequently, secular low nominal real interest rate across world could enhance appetite risk; significant monetary accommodation major economy – us, euro area bi review 145/2007 15 japan – since 2000 reflect abundant liquidity financial markets, macro imbalance u asia, sizeable currency misalignment carry trades, compression risk spreads, mispricing widely diffuse risk even real sector implication several emerge economies; strong macroeconomic performance asia contribute relentless search yield increase appetite risk (mohan, 2007e). the combination sustain low inflation accompany accommodative monetary policy worldwide could generate excessive confidence ability central bank monetary policy keep inflation rate interest rate low indefinitely, lead price risk hence excessive risk taking. this result analogous excessive foreign borrow undertake private sector borrower bank east asian country 1990s exchange rate see relatively fixed, hence risk perception low, hence risk priced. it may ironic perceive success central bank increase credibility monetary policy, give rise enhance expectation regard stability inflation interest rates, could lead mispricing risk hence enhance risk taking. yet another view success failure central banks, repeat assurance stability guidance market future path interest rates, couple availability ample liquidity invitation market underprice risks. this view, consequently, put blame central bank fail give space market ass risk eschew surprise element policy. it possible increase globalisation result containment price tradable good period hence measure inflation, excess liquidity show elevate asset price worldwide, along increase cross border capital flow search yields. a withdrawal monetary accommodation commence response perceive visible inflationary pressures, sub-prime crisis reveal vulnerability starkly confidence plunged, market freeze trigger panic among investor lender regard inability value complex risky asset structure derivative products. accord estimates, total loss relate sub-prime could exceed u $ 200 billion (the economist, 2007), fifth india’s gdp measure market exchange rates. accord oecd estimates, loss could amount u $ 300 billion. with deterioration credit confidence, bank force advance loan off-balance sheet “special investment vehicle (sivs)” use capital thereby render borrower credit constrained. thus, argue sub-prime symptom rather cause. arguably, outcome could quite different if, instance, interest rate decline back ebb inflation accommodation monetary policy therefore excess liquidity. there also persuasive opposite view, best articulate alan greenspan, great moderation inflation could attribute real economy phenomena: long run productivity growth us; impact new worker china india dampen wage growth worldwide hence inflation. it widely understand credit market characterize information asymmetry. first, availability information technology reduce cost information collection maintenance considerably. thus, widespread belief arise information credit quality small borrower may widely disperse across jurisdiction make impersonal, packaged, processed, sold. second, availability technology, belief information available structure basis, great deal financial innovation could take place essentially enable investor risk taker become progressively remote ultimate borrower actual risk lay. a whole host intermediary form mortgage brokers, mortgage companies, society like able package mortgage asset include non conform loan sell different category investors, include special investment vehicle (sivs), hedge fund like, regulated. the 16 bi review 145/2007 guide principle behind activity feasible credit rat agency enough information continuous basis rate instrument packaged. it certainly argue new development since mortgage back security (mbs) asset back security (abs) u time successful provide liquidity credit market continuous basis without accidents. the difference perhaps mb package government sponsor entity (gses) subject certain relatively well enforce norm presumably reduce potential risk embed instruments. these consideration lead third set issue relate role effective financial regulation supervision. ha recent crisis underscore need strengthen oversight financial market advance countries? traditionally, financial surveillance place relatively emphasis bank regulation. bank leverage financial entity also effective trustee public money virtue hold deposits. hence, effectively regulate supervise order maintain public confidence bank system depositor protect excessive risk-taking banks. on hand, investor hedge fund high net worth individual need protection. they inform investor able exploit information efficiency market and, therefore, able understand risk imply information asymmetry. the current crisis was, however, trigger difficulty encounter investor take large exposure sub-prime mortgage investment without account potential risk embed instruments. what approach issues? although current move jurisdictions, particularly u.k., move towards “principles-based” regulation, traditional “rules-based” regulation, continue traditional rules-based regulatory approach now. while progressively provide great flexibility bank portfolio decisions, relative situation reforms, keep close eye risk exposure regulate financial institutions. we therefore cautious derivative introduce gradually, base perception risk management capability various regulate institutions. admittedly, cause impatience institution believe risk management capacity high order. however, issue consider reality large variance different institution capabilities. it true financial market cannot hold hostage laggard institutions. so, adopt measure approach introduction modern financial innovations. second, monitor exposure bank risky sector seek limit exposure sector prudential regulations. bank exposure capital market form (both fund base non-fund based) cannot exceed 40 per cent net worth. similarly, observe high credit growth certain segment real estate, housing, non bank finance company (nbfcs) retail credit, risk weight increased, along provision norm standard assets. third, term evolve global prudential framework, emphasis generally capital, mean reduce vulnerability risks, prudential requirement liquidity risk. aspect relate liquidity largely leave regulator ass prescribe suitable framework pillar ii basel ii. in indian context, bank flexibility devise risk management strategy per board approve policy, reserve bank take step mitigate liquidity risk short-end, risk systemic level institution level well (reddy, 2007c). some important measure regard are: • overnight unsecured market fund restrict bank primary dealer (pd). repo market – bilateral repos collateralize borrow lend obligation (a form tripartite repos) developed. a result, volume shift overnight unsecured market collateralize market. bi review 145/2007 17 • a great inter-linkages excessive reliance call money borrow bank could cause systemic problems, prudential measure introduce address extent bank borrow lend call money market. on fortnightly average basis, call market borrow outstanding exceed 100 per cent capital fund (i.e., sum tier i tier ii capital) late audit balance sheet. however, bank allow borrow maximum 125 per cent capital fund

various prudential norm activity believe could systemic effects. the regulatory intervention graded: high deposit take institution low non-deposit take institutions. the recent crisis develop financial market also illustrate thin line separation are: difficulty experience non-deposit intermediary sivs eventually fall deposit take regulate institution banks. thus, feel judicious prudential regulation supervision heighten market surveillance anticipation necessary healthy governance financial markets. we have, course, careful stifle entrepreneurship financial innovation. but need constantly ask question: “financial innovation towards objective?” a long financial innovation see promote price discovery, great intermediation efficiency, hence, overall efficiency growth, must encouraged, appropriate safeguard maintain financial stability. the lesson current financial market crisis go ways. on one hand, market innovation indeed help bring financial market close need credit access earlier. despite problem associate sub-prime borrowers, must recognize almost 10 million borrower benefit market enable access house finance, deem possible earlier. with 20 per cent borrower report delinquent, difficulty, still mean 8 million people clearly benefit market. on hand, difficulty encounter draw attention kind issue arise speed innovation incentive structure flaw malpractice occur, intrinsic difficulty arise capture commoditizing information perhaps yet susceptible commoditization. 18 bi review 145/2007 a key question emerge current development financial market relate role monetary authority context crisis. this issue concern u central banking. over last decade two, would appear focus central bank narrowing, relative complex responsibility traditionally shouldered. a great deal write issue, great deal change term practice and, countries, regulatory structure alter move central bank relatively pure monetary authorities. accord view, central bank focus largely keep inflation low stable, also contribute financial stability. to quote harvard economist kenneth rogoff: "indeed many economist believe central banker could perfectly well replace computer program implement simple rule adjust interest rate response output inflation. but [this] view theoretically rigorous, reality not" (businessworld, september 17, 2007). although central banks, u federal reserve, explicit mandate also promote growth, good deal think recent time tend argue inflation control would promote growth central bank would good concentrate objective alone. it instructive examine central bank do current context. the response central bank recent event financial market show concern financial stability assume override importance, irrespective legislative mandate hand central bank part ongoing reforms. this evident fact central bank initially react injection liquidity, include special facility expansion list eligible collateral. discussion involve central banker various forum indicate willingness consider course action favour protect growth. a know, u federal reserve go cut interest rate promote growth interest financial stability; u.k. authority provide liquidity specific institution, give blanket guarantee depositor safety deposits. accordingly, become evident central bank role beyond inflation targeting. evidently, growth financial stability matter central banks. when come crunch, role lender last resort (lolr), discharge responsibility guardian financial stability, central bank need perform function complex. should central bank lender last resort system whole inject systemic liquidity open market operation only, also provide liquidity individual financial institution judge solvent illiquid? how arrive judgment adequate information individual institutions? can detail information without ongoing responsibility regulation supervision? this issue dissimilar, term existence asymmetric information, problem adequate transparency information relate value collateral underlie asset back securities. bank financial institution typically leverage institutions: thus judgement relate solvency depend valuation asset time difficulty arise. in current case, bank invest chain vehicle security whose value doubt. bank also commitment vehicle whose liquidity and/or viability doubt. when provide lolr liquidity support, central bank make judgement solvency institution provide liquidity? a great recognition appreciation appropriate role central bank gain ground, possible result rethink function central banks. a case point separation financial regulation supervision monetary policy could contribute ineffective inadequate surveillance context current crisis. there view problem information asymmetry might get aggravate bank report monetary authority regulatory body charge bank supervision. bi review 145/2007 19 since reserve bank india also bank regulator supervisor, receive continue information bank activities; moreover, time current turmoil, also obtain information quickly lead systematically important institution exposure relevance. thus, high scope prompt corrective action. v. challenge future let conclude turn emerge challenge face financial sector india could shape path next generation reforms. the sustain acceleration growth, support range anecdotal indications, result movement large number household high income consumption categories, enhance demand financial services. alongside, industrial production export growth remain buoyant rise prominence service economy generate surge demand financial intermediation. a lead indicator sizeable expansion already underway domestic bank lend household small medium industrial service enterprise poise emerge new growth drive financial sector activity. for indian financial system, big challenge extend innovate meet new demand financial inclusion respond adequately new opportunity risks. innovative channel credit delivery serve new credit need developed, perhaps great use information technology intensify skill development human capital. acceleration growth past year brighten medium-term prospect growth indian economy. a past, domestic save expect finance bulk investment requirements. in context, bank system continue important source finance could strong demand bank credit. although bank credit witness sharp growth since 2003-04 onwards, need recognise credit-gdp ratio still remain relatively low. moreover, significant segment population remain exclude bank services. a growth process strengthen become inclusive, expect demand financial product could continue witness high growth come years. thus, likely growth bank credit monetary aggregate could high might expect historical relationship elasticity view ongoing structural changes. this, however, raise critical issue central bank appropriate order monetary/credit expansion. in absence yardstick, excessive growth money supply could potentially show inflationary pressure course time, give monetary lags. indeed, recent inflationary pressure across globe attributable, part, global liquidity glut. in absence inflationary pressure conventionally measured, excessive money credit growth could also lead asset price bubbles, adverse implication bank sector stability lag conventional inflation. thus, reserve bank face ongoing challenge provide appropriate liquidity system ensure growth non-inflationary environment. demand house finance emerge key driver bank credit past years. a income grow pace urbanisation pick up, and, view substantial backlog, demand house house finance expect record continuous high growth next years. in view expect high demand, pressure real estate price may continue. moreover, real estate market characterise opacity imperfection develop countries, certainly india. such development easily generate bubble real estate market, problem elasticity supply, information asymmetries. strong demand house buoyancy real estate price environment non-transparency, thus, could potentially pose risk bank system. in conjunction interest rate cycles, bank system well regulator would need vigilant future npa us-like sub-prime woes. 20 bi review 145/2007 high investment need grow economy depend heavily upon ability financial market raise resource saver allocate efficiently productive purposes. in view acceleration growth well focus inclusive growth, financial market play great role efficient allocation resources. further development financial market also need view grow openness envisage move towards full capital account convertibility. the reserve bank therefore continue take measure deepen, widen integrate financial markets. while permit wide range instrument player financial markets, need ensure development take place orderly manner avoid sub-prime like accident ensure stability. there premium ensure stability low-income country like india, significant share population position withstand large change interest rate exchange rates. prudential exposure norm exposure bank nbfcs need fine-tune protect balance sheet bank interest depositors. the formation credit information bureau expect provide credit history borrower could allow great flow bank credit relatively neglect sectors, also impart stability financial sector. so far, financial sector reform calibrate progressive integration world economy. a key consideration choice pace sequence management volatility financial market implication conduct monetary operations. full capital account openness inevitably lead challenge manage impossible trinity independent monetary policy, open capital account, manage exchange rate. in context ongoing financial sector reforms, need recognise impact financial fluctuation real sector develop economy significantly different mature economy specialise technology intensive product degree exchange rate pas low, enable exporter importer ignore temporary shock set stable product price maintain monopolistic positions, despite large currency fluctuations. mature well develop financial market country absorb risk associate exchange rate fluctuation negligible spillover real activity. on hand, majority develop country

consequence turn, implication financial sector stability soundness. a challenge policy context full capital account openness preserve financial stability different market great deregulation capital outflow debt inflow occurs. the vulnerability financial intermediary perhaps address prudential regulation supervision; risk management non-financial entity development corporate debt market forex

consequences, domestic monetary conditions. go forward, continuous need adapt strategy liquidity management well exchange rate management effective monetary management short-term interest rate

regime capital flows. global development expect increase role determine conduct monetary exchange rate policy bi review 145/2007 21 country. in environment global convergence, retain independence monetary policy may become increasingly difficult, call hard choice term goal instruments. in india, favour adoption inflation targeting, keep attainment low inflation central objective monetary policy, along high sustain growth important develop economy. apart legitimate concern regard growth key objective, factor suggest inflation target may appropriate india. first, unlike many develop country record moderate inflation, double digit inflation exception, largely socially unacceptable. second, adoption inflation target require existence efficient monetary transmission mechanism operation efficient financial market absence interest rate distortions. third, inflationary pressure still often emanate significant supply shock relate effect monsoon agriculture, monetary policy action may little role. finally, economy large india, various regional differences, continue existence market imperfection factor product market regions, choice universally acceptable measure inflation also difficult. a regard bank regulation supervision, unique theoretical model one practical approach regulation supervision financial system. india traditionally follow institution-based system regulation. in india, current model regulation reserve bank exchange relevant information regulator synchronise manner function effectively. the supervisory activity reserve bank benefit price stability objective, recognise safety soundness bank must evaluate jointly responsibility ensure stability growth economy. in regard, reserve bank joint responsibility monetary policy supervision insight authority use technique le blunt precisely calibrate problem hand. such tool improve ability manage crisis and, importantly, avoid them. in backdrop, recommendation separate bank sector regulation conduct monetary policy observer appear independent history, legacy efficiency current regulatory system india. such recommendation essentially base uk experience – subject severe criticism episode involve northern rock – completely ignore huge diversity regulatory system country include prevail successful international financial centre us. a note several policy statement indian context, principal challenge public policy ensure smooth transition high growth path, accompany low stable inflation well anchor inflation expectations. from central bank perspective, new challenge face u many. first, indian bank system attain international excellence, require action several front like introduction great competition; convergence activity supervision financial conglomerates; induction new technology; improvement credit risk appraisal; encouragement financial innovations; improvement internal controls; establishment appropriate legal framework. the role reserve bank context amount promote safety soundness allow bank system compete innovate. second, central bank, reserve bank would need develop financial markets, especially money, government security foreign exchange market enhance efficiency transmission mechanism, along corporate debt market. third, price stability financial stability would continue concern expect increase credit expansion global integration. thank
