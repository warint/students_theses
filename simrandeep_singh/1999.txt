1BIS Review   36/1999Mr White discusses the Asian crisis and the Bank for International SettlementsA paper presented by Mr William R White, Economic Adviser, Head of the Monetary andEconomic Department, Bank for International Settlements, at the conference on “Asia and thefuture of the world economic systems”, organised by the Royal Institute of InternationalAffairs and held in London on 17-18 March 1999.The Asian crisis, perhaps even more than the Mexican crisis which preceded it, has raisedsome fundamental issues about the workings of the international financial system. In thecourse of the Willard process1 and in many other fora, the behaviour of private sector agentswho are internationally active has been widely analysed with a view to devising prescriptionsand policies that might reduce the incidence of destabilising activity on their part. The role ofthe public sector has also been an object of scrutiny, with the IMF and the World Bankreceiving particular attention given the size of the public resources they command and theirinfluence over the governments of emerging market economies. Before proceeding to thespecific subjects on which I have been asked to comment by the organisers of this conference,it seems to me worth pointing out that the Bank for International Settlements has also beencaught up in these deliberations, although the implications for us may be less significant thanfor others.A. A new role for the BIS or an old one?The most recent Communiqué issued by the Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors ofthe Group of Seven2 announced the establishment of a new Financial Stability Forum. TheForum will bring together representatives from each of the G7 countries,3 the principalinternational financial institutions and the various international committees whose workfocuses on financial stability. The objective would be to ensure a constant dialogue betweenall those in the public sector concerned about international financial stability, with a view toensuring closer coordination of the work being undertaken and an enhanced (moral) authorityfor any decisions taken as to best practices in this area. The BIS will be represented in theForum along with other international financial institutions, and many of the internationalcommittees also represented on the Forum meet regularly at the BIS. In addition, the BISGeneral Manager will serve (in his personal capacity) as the Chairman of the Forum and itssecretariat will be based in Basle.In some ways, both the process of consultation and the substance of the work being proposedare rather similar to what has been going on in Basle for many years.4 As to the former, whatis increasingly referred to as the “Basle process” involves groups of national officials comingtogether to discuss international issues of common interest with a view to reaching decisionsabout recommended forms of behaviour. The Basle Concordat5 and the Basle Accord6 areprobably the best known examples of the genre. Once a consensus has been reached in such                                                          1In response to a request by President Clinton at the APEC Summit in Vancouver, a meeting of representatives of22 countries (G7 plus 15 significant emerging markets) was convened at the Willard Hotel in Washington on 17February 1998. Subsequently, three working groups were set up which reported in October 1998 (seeBIS/IMF/OECD/World Bank (1998a), (1998b) and (1998c)).2See Group of Seven (1999).3Each country would be represented by a senior official from the central bank, Treasury and a regulatory agency.With time, it is envisaged that representatives from emerging markets will also be included in the Forum.4See White (1998a).5See BIS: BCBS (1975).6See BIS: BCBS (1988).
BIS Review   36/19992fora, national officials must return to their home grounds, where sovereignty still reigns, andconvince local lawmakers and commercial interests of the desirability of following theinternational norms agreed upon. Central bankers and regulators have followed such processesfor years in Basle, and the new Forum will in a sense extend this process to includegovernments themselves. As to the latter, the work undertaken in Basle under the auspices ofcentral bank Governors has a scope and substance which should ensure it makes a usefulcontribution to the deliberations of the Forum.A useful conceptual framework for describing this work is a four-dimensional matrix, whosefirst two dimensions consist of a traditional flow-of-funds table with columns (theinstitutional sectors involved in the international financial system) and rows (the variousmarkets). The third dimension is the infrastructure which supports the first two dimensions(payment and settlement systems, legal infrastructure, etc.), while the fourth dimensioncomprises the simultaneous clearing conditions in all the markets subject to sectoral budgetconstraints. In this conceptual framework, failures or shortcomings with respect to any of thefirst three dimensions will have implications for market clearing conditions which will in turnfeed back on the real economy. It was the recognition that financial instability has suchmacroeconomic implications which led policymakers to coin the new phrase“macroprudential policies” — namely, policies designed to strengthen each dimension of theinternational financial system referred to above (institutions, markets and infrastructure) thushelping to limit the damage should some shock hit any part of the system.It is more a product of historical circumstance than design that the Basle communitycomprises relevant committees of national experts7 in each of the three defined areas. Withinthe first sectoral dimension is the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), whosework is by now well known. More recently Basle has also become home to the secretariat ofthe International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS). An offer has also recently beenmade by the Swiss Government, with support from the BIS, to relocate the secretariat ofIOSCO to Basle. But, in any event, that group (representing the international investmentdealing community) interacts regularly with the Basle Committee and the IAIS in the form ofthe Joint Forum, the Secretariat of which is also located at the BIS. As for the seconddimension of the matrix (markets), the Euro-currency Standing Committee (ECSC) has had along record of deliberations, publications and data collection pertaining to the evolution ofinternational financial markets and possible systemic implications. The third dimension isinfrastructure, and in this domain the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS)has been increasingly active in recent years.8 Finally, the way in which the market clearingconditions bring together the dimensions referred to above has recently been reflected in therenaming of the ECSC. Reflecting the new mandate given to it in February 1999 by theCentral Bank Governors of the Group of Ten countries, this committee is now to be called theCommittee on the Global Financial System (CGFS). This name is intended to emphasise anew focus on how those dimensions of the international financial system ultimately come                                                          7It is important to emphasise the concept of national experts. It is these people who provide the central input to allthe decisions made by the committees and the documents they produce. The staff of the BIS, in particular thoseproviding secretariat support to the committees, have as their primary function to support the cooperation ofothers. This makes the BIS quite a different type of organisation from both the IMF and the World Bank group,though perhaps less different from the OECD and the WTO.8Issues having to do with the legal infrastructure underpinning the international financial system have also been ofgrowing interest to the Basle community, although until now ad hoc procedures have been relied upon rather thana standing committee directed to such issues.
3BIS Review   36/1999together in a market framework, and how steps might be taken to make that framework morestable.9The active prospective involvement of the Basle community in the Financial Stability Forumis only one aspect of its response to the Mexican and Asian crises. The Monetary andEconomic Department of the BIS, which traditionally provides analytical and statisticalsupport to the work of the various Basle-based committees, will also focus more intensivelyon such issues. Moreover, with the establishment last year of the BIS Financial StabilityInstitute, there is now another vehicle for the practical dissemination of the best practicesestablished both by the relevant BIS committees and other groups concerned withinternational financial stability. These are admittedly small contributions by a relatively smallinternational financial institution, but they may go some way to helping avoid a repetition ofthe dramatic events we have seen in international financial markets since mid-1997.The subject matter assigned to me today seems to fall neatly into two categories. The first ofthese (monitoring capital flows, currency boards and foreign exchange controls) has to dowith resolving the so-called “impossible trinity” problem. Since a country cannotsimultaneously have free capital flows, a fixed exchange rate and an independent domesticmonetary policy, what should be given up? The second topic (reform of capital adequacyratios, regulating the regulators) has inter alia to do with minimising the fallout whenmacroeconomic problems do emerge. How can regulation make the system more stable inprinciple and how can we assure that those principles are being applied in practice? The restof this paper deals with these two issues. It will come as no surprise if I also choose tohighlight the particular contributions which have already been made, or are in the process ofbeing made, by the Basle-based committees in response to both the Mexican and Asian crises.B.Monitoring short-term capital flows and responding to themA belief that has recently grown in strength is that increased transparency on the part of alleconomic agents would sharply improve the functioning of markets and lead to greaterfinancial stability.10 It is hard to object to this at the level of principle, though it isdisconcerting that much of the impetus for this belief comes from a misapprehension. It hasbeen frequently asserted that the size of the inflows into the Asian countries later affected bythe crisis would have been much smaller had individual investors been made aware of theaggregate exposure of these countries. It is hard to believe that the basic problem was ashortage of information given that the international financial statistics collected semiannuallyby the BIS and the OECD (based on banking statistics and trade credits) were widelyavailable. These data clearly indicated both growing debt levels and a very high proportion ofshort-term debt in the case of many countries. Indeed, concerns based on these figures (albeitsotto voce) were raised as far back as 1995 in the quarterly publications of the BIS as well asin successive BIS Annual Reports.Perhaps reflecting the availability of such information, some non-bank financial institutions11and equity investors seemed to begin moving out of Asian markets much sooner than                                                          9Generally speaking, measures taken to strengthen individually each dimension of the system might be assumed tostrengthen the system itself. Nevertheless, there might well be instances where a more comprehensive (cross-committee) approach might prove still more beneficial. The design of public sector safety nets is a good case inpoint.10See BIS/IMF/OECD/World Bank (1998a) and BIS (1997), Chapter IV.11See BIS (1998a), Chapter V.
BIS Review   36/19994internationally active banks, whose eventual response was both sharp and highly disruptive.Informal enquiries about the banks’ behaviour would appear to indicate that a shortage ofinformation about international exposures was not the basic problem. Indeed, while in somecases credit officers failed to detect the risk, in other cases the senior management of banksseems to have overridden the specific recommendations of their credit officers. While thismay still have been sound strategic practice, given the limited exposure of individual largebanks, the collective impact on the debtor countries was severe. This in itself would indicatethat some form of market failure took place, though not necessarily one based on a shortage ofinformation.To say that a lack of information was not the heart of the problem is not to say that theavailable data were ideal. Indeed, after the Mexican crisis, the (then) ECSC made considerableefforts to improve the semiannual banking statistics collected by the BIS. Steps were taken toexpand the number of reporting countries, and the reporting and publication lags were reducedfrom more than six to less than five months and still further reductions are planned. Inaddition, steps were taken to reclassify the exposure of national banking systems on the basisof “ultimate risk” to deal with the problem of loans booked by emerging countries ininternational financial centres. In another development, the Inter-Agency Task Force onFinance Statistics12 has agreed to build on and replace the existing set of BIS/OECD externaldebt statistics with a new set13 of debt statistics which is jointly issued by the BIS, IMF,OECD and World Bank. It brings together for the first time the best international comparativedata currently available on external debt. This data will be published quarterly from 15 Marchonwards, on as timely a basis as possible. 14The monitoring statistics referred to above are drawn in very large part from the on-balancesheet positions of a limited number of (albeit important) creditor institutions. An obviousshortcoming is that they do not pick up the off-balance sheet positions of any institutions, northe aggregate positions of non-regulated financial institutions.15 The former problem can berectified with time, under current legislation. However, the latter problem is thornier and is atthe heart of the debate about the role of hedge funds in the Asian crisis. Many Asian-Pacificauthorities (including representatives from Australia, Hong Kong and Malaysia) feel stronglythat hedge funds set out systematically to destabilise their currencies and their financialmarkets.16 However, other evidence is less compelling in support of this hypothesis17 and,even if accepted, would not necessarily lead to the conclusion that such funds should beregulated. As the US authorities consistently point out, many other institutions also engage inhighly leveraged position taking, including the proprietary trading desks of both regulated andunregulated institutions. The implication of this fact is that the authorities might have to                                                          12This Task Force, which is chaired by the IMF, comprises the BIS, the European Central Bank, Eurostat, the OECD,the United Nations and the World Bank.13The data are not new in the strict sense because all of them have been published elsewhere before. Moreover, asindicated in the text, by far the largest part of the information is provided by the BIS international locational andconsolidated banking statistics. For a description of the exact relationship between the BIS locational andconsolidated banking statistics, see BIS (1998b), pp 32-43.14These data can be found at www.bis.org/publ/r_db9901.htm or at www.oecd.org/dac/debt.15Being drawn from creditor sources, they also fail to pick up securities issued in domestic markets and purchased byforeign investors. To date, this does not seem to have been a major drawback to the use of these creditor-basedstatistics.16A common tactic, seen both in Hong Kong and later in South Africa, was for hedge funds to sell short the currencyas well as a long-duration investment (e.g. shares and bonds) whose value was particularly sensitive to short-terminterest rates. If the monetary authority supported the currency by raising interest rates, the speculators profitedfrom the domestic play. If the monetary authorities let the currency slide, the profit was on the currency play.17See BIS (1998a), Chapter V.
5BIS Review   36/1999regulate this kind of activity at all types of institutions, in turn raising the issue of how toprevent it from simply moving offshore.What does seem to have been agreed in the international community is that it would bedesirable to have more information about the activities of highly leveraged investors who areinternationally active. Not only does this seem prima facie a good thing, but some authoritiesalso consider such information a fair counterpart to the provision of more information bypublic sector authorities about their own off-balance sheet activities.18 Currently, threeavenues are being actively explored within the Basle community. The Basle Supervisors areprimarily concerned about the health of banks and wish to be assured that the loans made tohighly leveraged institutions are subject to the proper kind of credit analysis. A subgroup ofthe BCBS (the Brockmeijer working group) has already published two documents, oneoutlining deficiencies in past banking practices and the other suggesting guidelines for goodpractice in the future.19 The CGFS has two initiatives under way. One is a reprise (under thesame chairman) of the 1994 Fisher Report20 which acted as a catalyst for enhancements todisclosure practices by financial institutions in relation to market and credit risk exposuresarising from their trading activities, including those involving off-balance sheet instruments.The primary objective of this exercise is to encourage further improvements in disclosure soas to ensure that market participants have an adequate basis for an appreciation of the risksthey are running in dealing with, investing in or lending to, financial institutions. The secondCGFS initiative is to examine what kind of aggregate information about exposures would helpto improve the functioning of markets, taking as a starting-point the BIS international bankingstatistics.Having adequate knowledge about short-term capital flows is one thing. Establishing anexchange regime to minimise their disruptive effects, while maintaining their longer-runefficiency benefits, is quite another. As already stated, a country cannot have completelyliberalised capital flows (assuming a high degree of substitutability between domestic andforeign assets), a fixed exchange rate regime and an independent monetary policy. The eventsin Asia and more recently in Latin America have highlighted the need for trade-offs, but havenot provided guidance as to optimal solutions. Indeed, what is of particular interest is howquickly opinions have reversed about the desirability of specific options. This in turn raisesthe fundamental issue of how much any of us really understand.Consider first the issue of capital controls. It was less than two years ago that the IMF wasvigorously pursuing the issue of revising Article VIII of the Fund’s statutes to allow the Fundto promote actively the liberalisation of the capital account in emerging market economies.21Today, there is a much greater willingness to recognise that some capital controls may have a                                                          18One feature of the Asian crisis was that a number of governments supported their currencies extensively usingforwards and other forms of off-balance sheet intervention. This information was hidden from the public and,when revealed, indicated that the true level of reserves was much less than thought. This contributed to the aura ofpanic and the sudden desire on the part of creditors to withdraw. To provide an example of proper behaviour inthis regard, the G10 countries agreed to adhere to a template on foreign exchange exposure drawn up by asubgroup of the ECSC. This template will serve as the basis for the statistics to be submitted to the SDDS databaseoperated by the IMF.19See BIS: BCBS (1999a) and (1999b).20 See BIS: ECSC (1994).21 It is worth reminding ourselves that the postwar Bretton Woods agreements were designed to discourage suchflows. Keynes and others were concerned that capital flows would cause problems which would lead countries toretaliate in the form of trade protectionism. Since, in light of the experience of the 1930s, the fear of protectionismwas of primary concern, it was considered at that time to be an acceptable trade-off to give up the benefits of amore open capital account.
BIS Review   36/19996useful role to play. References are frequently made to the Chilean experiment and their carefuluse of controls over short-term capital inflows. Concerns about a possible prolongation of thecurrent crisis through a devaluation of the Chinese renmimbi are assuaged through referenceto the fact that China still has capital controls. Even the Malaysian experiment, as flawed andpotentially dangerous as it was,22 does not seem to have had the dire consequences predictedby many at the time. A consensus also seems to be forming that, if controls are required todeal with a crisis, they should be directed to incoming capital only, should favour longer-termover shorter-term inflows, and should be accompanied by clear indications as to when theymight be removed. Note that the new consensus does not extend to questioning the longer-term benefits of international capital flows.When we turn to the issue of exchange rate regimes, a similarly rapid change of views seemsto have occurred. Prior to the Russian and Brazilian crises, a constant refrain was thatcountries using a fixed exchange rate regime to stabilise inflationary expectations also neededan “exit strategy”. This last point was in recognition of the fact that real exchange rates tend torise during a disinflationary process, leading to a deteriorating current account which in turnundermines the credibility of the fixed rate regime. Since the onset of the Brazilian crisis, wehave been hearing an increasing number of references to the desirability of imposing acurrency board in Brazil. Going even further down this path, the Argentinians, who alreadyhave a currency board, have hinted at dollarising the economy if the Argentine peso comesunder further attack. Both suggestions have validity to the extent that dedication to an“immutable” fix reinforces the credibility of the regime and leads to a stronger domesticcurrency and lower interest rates.23Yet, such policies are also the very antithesis of the exit policies of such recent fashion. Thequestion remains unanswered as to what will happen if the current account continues todeteriorate under such a regime and the unemployment rate continues to rise because ofexcessively high domestic labour costs? Since domestic legislatures are always sovereign,fears would remain that the exchange regime policies could be reversed. At the very least, asubstantial credit risk premium might be expected to remain for borrowers from suchcountries, at least until they set their “house” in order. This having been said, it remains withinthe realm of the possible that a combination of initial sharp currency depreciation, impositionof a still more credible exchange rate regime, sticky domestic wages (even as prices rise) andfiscal probity might be sufficient to deal with the longer-term competitiveness problem.24What is also surprising in light of the Asian experience is that the merits of voluntarilyadopting a regime of floating, the polar extreme to the immutable fix, has not received moreattention.25 This is particularly surprising given the (albeit questionable) hypothesis that most                                                          22 The greatest danger arising from the unilateral Malaysian imposition of controls on outgoing capital was that itwould increase investors’ fears that the same policies might be followed elsewhere. In practice, it took the Russiandefault and effective declaration of non-convertibility to initiate a withdrawal of international investors fromemerging markets more generally.23 The gains could be particularly great for Brazil since the government’s internal debt is large and very short-term.Thus, lower interest rates lower debt service and the deficit and this presumably would make the currency strongercontributing to a virtuous circle of lower interest rates in turn. The stronger currency would pay a further dividendin that a significant proportion of the government’s internal debt service is indexed to the US dollar. This highlyinteractive and non-linear system could also operate in reverse were confidence not to return.24 Szapáry (1998) makes similar observations with respect to eastern Europe.25In the Financial Times of 22 February 1999, reporting on the G7 meeting of Finance Ministers and Central BankGovernors on the preceding weekend, 28 items were listed as being on the G7 timetable for reform of theinternational financial system. The only reference to exchange rates was “Considering necessary elements for
7BIS Review   36/1999Asian countries suffered enormously from pegging their currencies too tightly to the USdollar. In the early 1990s, as the dollar weakened against the yen, pegged Asian currenciesbecame over-competitive. This led to massive capital inflows (especially from Japan),domestic overheating and an unprecedented increase in production capacity in many areas.The fact that the peg against the dollar was considered inviolate also encouraged domesticresidents (including banks) to borrow abroad in foreign currencies at low interest rates. All ofthese tendencies were to create major problems later, problems which might have beenavoided had the domestic currencies been allowed to appreciate in the face of capital inflows.Later (from early 1995), dollar strength against the yen coincided with a period when theprices of products extensively produced in Asia were already under pressure globally. Thecombination proved unsustainable and the peg had to be given up on the downside in anenvironment of full-blown crisis with attendant (and domestically painful) requirements forboth fiscal and monetary tightening.26There is, of course, no single right answer to the choice of an exchange rate regime either foremerging or industrial economies.27 The right answer for a single country depends on thatcountry’s particular circumstances. However, clarifying the criteria for making choices wouldnow seem a particularly ripe area for fruitful analysis in the case of emerging marketeconomies. Clearly, some important mistakes have recently been made in this area. And thewide variety of recommendations being made to different countries by academics and othersargues for an assessment of the criteria on which those recommendations are being made.C.Improving international banking regulation and supervisionRegulation and supervision are not the same. The former has to do with setting out rules,while the latter has to do with ensuring that the behaviour of financial institutions is overseenand that the rules are followed. We must distinguish as well between principles and practicesin both areas. For example, it has been relatively easy28 to lay out certain Core Principles ofBanking Supervision, but the next stage of ensuring their global implementation will be muchmore difficult and time-consuming. In light of some of the banking problems which emergedin Mexico and more recently in Asia, let us consider some recent advances in the area ofinternational banking regulation and supervision.Perhaps the best-known of all the international banking regulations are the Basle CapitalAdequacy Ratios. These ratios are now being re-examined by the BCBS with a view to havinga consultative document in the public domain in April 1999. While developments (such assecuritisation and advances in credit risk modelling practices) in industrial countries gave themain impetus for this review, the re-examination was also motivated by the Mexican andAsian developments. In particular, it has been pointed out by some analysts that thepreferential treatment of bank loans made to counterparties in countries which are members of                                                                                                                                                                     maintaining sustainable emerging market exchange rate regimes”. Martin Wolf in the Financial Times has alsodrawn attention to this puzzle of omission.26One reason why countries may currently hesitate to adopt floating is that they confuse what might happen undersuch a voluntary regime with what did happen (effectively an uncontrollable depreciation) when countries wereforced off their previous peg.27 These issues bring us back to the literature on optimal currency areas pioneered by Robert Mundell. Many of thepertinent criteria for joining such an area (a truly immutable fix) were revisited in the period leading up to theintroduction of the euro.28 The operative word here is “relatively” since the background documents on which the Core Principles were basedtook over 15 years to agree upon and the Core Principles themselves took over a year to draft.
BIS Review   36/19998the OECD29 may have contributed to both Mexico and Korea attracting more short-termcapital than was healthy. Further, it has been suggested that the low capital requirementsimposed on short-term interbank loans also shifted lending into such categories, increasing thelikelihood of a sudden and dangerous reversal.Without wishing to deny these suggestions, it is important to note that there are alternative(perhaps even complementary) explanations of the behaviour of internationally active banksin the Asian crisis. An important consideration, affecting Japanese and continental Europeanbanks in particular, appears to have been the search for return abroad in light of heightenedcompetition and shrinking margins at home.30 While acceptance of this explanation might alsohave implications for a revision of the Capital Accord, the implications would be of adecidedly different nature.31A second factor which may have influenced bank behaviour was the existence of safety netprovisions provided by public sector entities, both domestic and international. For example,consider the case of Korea. Once it became clear the domestic authorities would not letKorean banks fail, interbank loans funded from abroad bore Korea’s sovereign credit status.Moreover, given that the loans were short-term and denominated in dollars or yen, there wasno explicit won currency risk. Finally, in light of the Mexican, Thai and other internationalrescue packages, there was a perception that there was no liquidity risk either. In suchcircumstances, it was perhaps not surprising that internationally active banks were willing tolend as much as they did at ever narrowing risk spreads. This interpretation of events haspublic policy implications with respect to safety nets, as much as they do for the specificationof capital adequacy ratios.Developments in international banking and capital markets in the years spanning the Mexicanand Asian financial crises contributed to a desire to revisit the credit risk baskets in the CapitalAccord, and indeed the whole approach to credit risk which underlies that Accord. Thebiggest losses in banking traditionally arise from credit risk. The Basle Supervisors will, asnoted, be issuing a consultative document with a view to having a revised Capital Accord assoon as possible. They will also soon be issuing a paper which investigates the potential use ofin-house credit models to replace or augment more traditional regulatory measures of capitalrequirements. While the problems inherent in this approach are even more daunting than inthe use of such models to evaluate exposure to market risk, technology is advancing so rapidlythat it merits keeping an open mind.Applying capital ratios in practice is also not as simple as one might like, in large part becausethere continues to be much uncertainty about the accounting definitions which underlie thesecalculations. This certainly applies in many emerging markets, and this fuzziness perhapsexplains why there seems to be no clear relationship between actual movements in capital                                                          29 This so-called “Club Rule” was originally adopted after lengthy consideration failed to reveal an acceptablealternative.30 Similar forms of behaviour, otherwise known as “irrational exuberance” or “excessive optimism” have been seenin a large number of different markets across the world in recent years. Some discussion of the underlying forces atwork is provided in the BIS 67th Annual Report (see BIS (1997), pp 3-4 and Chapter VIII). See also White (1998b)and the French and Belgian contributions in BIS (1999).31 Such global tendencies towards enhanced competition seem likely to be further encouraged by the introduction ofthe euro in continental Europe, the prospective demise of Glass-Steagall in the United States and the introductionof “Big Bang” in Japan. Such trends might imply that capital ratios should on average be higher than they havebeen.
9BIS Review   36/1999ratios and subsequent crises.32 Yet it must be said that there remain problems in certainindustrial countries as well, with Japan being a particularly important example even ifprogress has been made recently. There continue to be important international differences inthe provisioning for future losses and the definition of non-performing loans. Moreover, whatcounts as capital has also been changing as financial institutions have creatively issued newliabilities which may or may not be a charge on future earnings. Both these issues have beenactively addressed33 by the Basle Committee, though more work will be necessary to attaintruly harmonised global standards.Considering now the principles of banking supervision, the preparation of the Core Principlesof Banking Supervision was an enormous step forward in at least four ways. The Principleswere comprehensive; they addressed all banks and not just those which are internationallyactive; they were drawn up in association with representatives of emerging markets; and theywere designed to provide a checklist of good practice, not only by national supervisors butalso other interested parties in both the public and private sectors.34 Moreover, thedissemination of these Core Principles has already had an influence extending far beyond thePrinciples themselves, in that the process is serving as a model for the creation of similar setsof core principles in a wide range of other areas. The IAIS (insurance) has already laid out aset of core principles as has IOSCO (investment dealers), and the CPSS (payment andsettlement systems) is in the process of doing the same. Finally, a perusal of the variousrecommendations of the working groups associated with the Willard process indicates thatcore principles and international standards of best behaviour have become the flavour of themonth.35 Whether all these principles can be effectively transformed into action in all of theseareas having a bearing on financial stability remains to be seen.Turning principles of good behaviour into good practices in the financial area will certainlynot be an easy task. Principles provide guidelines of behaviour, but what is also required is anincentive system to ensure that actions follow words. At the present time, four complementarysets of processes in the supervisory area look promising: a code of transparency for nationalsupervisors; peer pressure; tightened residency requirements; and market discipline. The firstthree of these provide incentives for national supervisors to enforce the Core Principles. Thefourth provides incentives for owners and managers of banks to act in accordance with thesePrinciples. While the specifics of the processes pertain to implementation of best practice inthe area of banking supervision, similar incentives might be applicable in other areas as well.The first process, directed, inter alia, to ensuring implementation of the Core Principles ofBanking Supervision, has been the preparation of another code — namely, a Code of GoodPractices on Transparency in Monetary and Financial Policies. This Code, which is being puttogether by the IMF in association with the BIS and relevant international committees ofregulators, deals in part with the need for transparency in the formulation and conduct of all                                                          32 See Lindgren et al (1996), who conclude that capital ratios had no systematic predictive power in emerging marketbanking crises.33 See BIS: BCBS (1998).34 It is also worth noting that these Principles are not cast in stone but will have to be constantly revisited, andrevised. This implies an ongoing iterative process between the Basle and emerging market Supervisors, who drewup the Principles, and others (in particular the IMF) who will be seeking to apply these Principles in the field.35At the BIS, the CGFS has, as noted, recently proposed a template, agreed with the IMF, for providing informationabout national foreign exchange reserves and contingent assets and liabilities affecting them. The CGFS is alsolooking into the possibility of preparing a set of good practices for the establishment of well functioning markets;this would be a follow-up to a “Report by a Study Group on market liquidity” which is currently being revisedprior to publication.
BIS Review   36/199910policies (deemed Financial Policies) having implications for financial stability. If informationabout how the supervisors are behaving is a necessary condition for ensuring that the banksare behaving properly, this Code of Transparency seems a useful initiative. The Code ofTransparency is still in the process of being finalised, but in its current form it is based upon asensible if (to some) radical framework. Akin to what is increasingly being accepted in therealm of monetary policy, the draft Code suggests there should be transparency with respect tothe supervisors’ mandate, the effectiveness of their powers, and their democraticaccountability to other bodies. In effect, this Code of Transparency tries to ensure that thesupervisors do their job in implementing the Core Principles.As noted above, transparency may be a necessary condition to ensure that supervisors carryout effectively their task of implementing the Core Principles. But it is hardly a sufficientcondition. While the IMF will be monitoring compliance with the Code of Transparency (andalso the implementation of the Core Principles themselves36), the influence the IMF can exertmay be relatively limited unless the country in question has an active programme with theIMF. One complementary suggestion that might be helpful is the exercise of “peer pressure”on national supervisors. Indeed, given that effective banking supervision is often resisted bythe political authorities (because of connected lending and other reasons), Central BankGovernors and Finance Ministers from developed countries might usefully try to put similarpressure on their counterparts in emerging markets.37 In a similar if more extreme vein, a thirdsuggestion would be to limit more aggressively the “right of establishment” in the world’smajor financial centres. In effect, banks without an adequate supervisory framework in theirown country would not be able to conduct an international banking business. This may seemradical, but has been a dictum among industrial countries since the 1975 Basle Concordat.38As well, some still more practical issues having to do with the incentives given to supervisorscannot be overlooked. Supervisors must be paid adequately to prevent a constanthaemorrhaging of staff to the private financial sector. Other working conditions must besuitably attractive, including personal legal protection from litigation arising from officialdecisions. And lastly, supervisors must be properly trained and their training continuouslyupdated to reflect new circumstances created by a changing financial world. Theestablishment at the BIS of the Financial Stability Institute will go a small way to helping inthis last regard. However, the personnel challenge is huge and many years of intensive effortswill be required to respond to it adequately.The last set of incentives applies to the owners and managers of banks. Aside from effectivesupervisory pressure, how can they be induced to behave in ways which are consistent withappropriate corporate governance and effective risk management? The first and most obviouspoint is that they should suffer in light of inappropriate behaviour. This implies that theowners should have their own capital at stake and that managers should be treated as thestewards of that capital. What is also increasingly needed is for market discipline to be used toget the attention of owners and managers. Financial institutions which are thought to be badly                                                          36It is possible that the IMF and World Bank will also play a role in implementing “Codes” elaborated by otherBasle-based committees.37 Financial stability in emerging market economies by the Group of Ten (see Group of Ten (1997)) contained anumber of practical recommendations as to how financial stability might be promoted. A meeting of Central BankGovernors and Finance Ministers from both industrial and emerging markets took place in Hong Kong in October1997 with a view to exerting pressure of this sort. Sadly, most industrial countries were represented only by lower-level officials.38See BIS: BCBS (1975).
11BIS Review   36/1999managed, or willing to take excessive risks, should have to pay a market price for this; fundsshould be available only at a premium; collateral requirements should be onerous and shareprices should be marked down. Moreover, a similar price should be exacted from firms whichrelease too little information to allow judgements to be made in this regard.39 Hence the focuson public disclosure.A last word is also warranted on the role of rating agencies. The activities of these firms haveexpanded enormously in recent years and their interest in financial institutions has increasedcommensurately. In light of the recent experience with both sovereign and private sectorratings in East Asia, no one would contend that all ratings have been perfect. Yet it is the verydifficulty of the task of assessment that leads one to conclude that professional and specialisedefforts in this area are warranted. Ratings increasingly complement, and sometimes evenreplace, in-house credit risk assessments, and they clearly have the capacity to affect marketprices of debt and equity. Ratings thus provide information which helps markets to imposediscipline on the owners and managers of financial institutions, and this market disciplineserves as a useful complement to internal discipline and the discipline imposed by thesupervisory and regulatory authorities.While this last statement might seem at first glance to recommend a surfeit of disciplinarysources, the costs of recent financial crises indicate that efforts directed to crisis preventionhave thus far been clearly inadequate. On the presumption that markets are normally efficient,market discipline should normally be relied upon. At the same time, the supervisory andregulatory authorities must recognise that market failures do occur and should focus theirefforts on how such failures might be redressed. The BIS, whether in its old role or some newone, hopes to continue to make a material contribution to these efforts to encourage financialstability.ReferencesBank for International Settlements (1999): “The monetary and regulatory implications ofchanges in the banking industry”.

1BIS Review   35/1999Mr Tietmeyer discusses the euro: the new common currencyAddress by the President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, Prof Hans Tietmeyer, on the occasionof the 7th Europe Lecture sponsored by the VSB Foundation, UtrechtsNieuwsblad/Amersfoorts Courant and Hogeschool van Utrecht in Utrecht on 29 March 1999.IIt is a great honour and pleasure for me to address you here in Utrecht this evening. Holding aEurope Lecture in the Netherlands is really something special. In your open-minded, livelyand progressive country, European spirit and culture are at home. Since the establishment ofthe European “Community of six”, your country has certainly ranked among the mostintegration-oriented nations in the EU. So it comes as no surprise to find that some of themost momentous decisions have been taken under Dutch presidencies.Particularly in the field of monetary integration, European history has undoubtedly beenwritten in the Netherlands.- The summit meeting at The Hague in 1969 marked the starting point of the first (albeitvain) approach to a common European currency during the seventies.- It was in Maastricht in 1991 that the Community mapped out and adopted a new routeto a common currency. On the basis of the Maastricht Treaty, entry into monetaryunion was finally accomplished at the beginning of this year.- The Amsterdam Summit of 1997 was intended to lay the political foundations for alasting monetary union. As you will know, for a long time it seemed essential to us inGermany, too, that definite political progress should soon supplement that far-reachingmonetary step towards integration. Unfortunately, although some headway was made,the agreements reached in Amsterdam proved unable to fulfil expectations in majorrespects. But that was least of all the fault of the Dutch hosts. All that remains for thetime being is for us to pin our hopes on an Amsterdam II.The Netherlands has, however, not only been the venue of major formal agreements onmonetary integration; it has also engaged in practical monetary integration itself – not onlymultilaterally, but also in bilateral terms. Given the close links between the guilder and the D-Mark, the Dutch have lived from an early date in a de facto monetary union with theirneighbours in Germany. That early, bilateral monetary union had two major characteristicsthat we all desire for today’s European monetary union as well: First, it was unequivocallystability-oriented. And second, it proved viable even in difficult times. Such as during theupheavals in the European Monetary System in 1992-3. At that time the Dutch flatly rejectedpreconditions on the part of others for the purpose of separating – at least for a while – theguilder from the D-Mark. The D-Mark/guilder duo held up, even in hard times. The Dutchalways turned out to be reliable partners, even when German policies were themselvestemporarily in turmoil in the wake of reunification. And where overcoming structuralproblems on the labour market is concerned, the Dutch have for some time rightly beenmentioned as a model for us in Germany.
BIS Review   35/19992In the meantime, both currencies, the guilder and the D-Mark, have integrated their traditionof stability into the euro. And the Dutch and Germans alike hope that the euro will take overand expand that legacy.IIThe common currency, with its present structure and present strategy, did not just fall intoEurope’s lap. The road to that goal was a long one, and involved many setbacks. And thepresent blueprint for the design of monetary union and for a monetary policy geared to themedium term is the quintessence of the experience gained over the last thirty years. Needlessto say, that also includes good experience, such as the lastingly successful linking of our twocurrencies on the basis of our common orientation towards stability. But disappointmentslikewise played a part. Europe had to learn why over-hasty exchange-rate experiments and amonetary policy aiming directly at employment and growth targets ultimately always failed.The long road began back in the sixties, when changes in the fixed rates of the Bretton Woodssystem altered the exchange rates within the Community as well. It was then that initial ideasof a common European currency came up in the Commission. To many people, they appearedto be a logical consequence of the common market, and particularly of the CommonAgricultural Policy, which was based on fixed units of account. The subject was first taken upseriously by the summit meeting at The Hague in 1969. A working group chaired by the thenPrime Minister of Luxembourg, Pierre Werner, was commissioned to map out the route to amonetary union.It was not long before the two key questions of a monetary union cropped up at that time:First, how can the necessary economic convergence of the participating countries be ensured?That is the question as to the economic foundation. And second, which political framework isneeded, and how can it be achieved? That is the question as to the political foundation. At thetime, the Werner Group recommended, in answer to those questions and after a heated debate,that economic, political and monetary integration should be implemented in parallel, invarious stages. At the end of each stage, the progress made in all three areas should bescrutinised with a view to deciding, in the light of the result of that scrutiny, whether the nextstage could be inaugurated. In the final stage, not only the monetary policy responsibilities butalso, in particular, key economic and fiscal policy powers should be transferred to theCommunity.But it soon turned out in the ensuing negotiations that, above all, the political leadership inFrance at that time was not prepared to make any such a conceptual commitment. Hencevirtually all that was achieved was exchange-rate cooperation in the context of what latercame to be known as the “Currency Snake”. The more far-reaching plans for a monetary unionwere largely shelved again.After a number of upheavals, the Bretton Woods system finally collapsed at the beginning ofthe seventies. That collapse was accompanied by the first sharp oil-price hike. After that,some considerable differences emerged in Europe between the ways individual countriesweighted their economic and monetary policy objectives. One group of countries relied on anexpansionary monetary policy. They hoped that such a policy would help the economy toadjust quickly to the changed conditions. Another group, by contrast, took advantage of thelatitude that had been gained by the ending of the linkage to the dollar to regain monetarystability relatively swiftly. Thus, France, Italy and the United Kingdom left what was known
3BIS Review   35/1999as the “Snake” in the mid-seventies. Only the “little Snake” (comprising the Beneluxcurrencies, the Danish krone and the D-Mark) was left as a community of stability.It was not until 1978, on the joint initiative of French President Giscard d’Estaing and GermanChancellor Helmut Schmidt, that the subject of wider-ranging monetary cooperation inEurope was taken up again. After long discussions in the countries themselves – some of themcontroversial – the European Monetary System (EMS) was set up in 1979, once more with theparticipation of France and Italy. The crucial question in the negotiations had been, inparticular, whether this EMS would tend to gear itself to the best stability standard or only tothe average level. In the end, the proposal was accepted that a parity grid should be devisedfor the currencies participating in the EMS, rather than making the ECU (which was a basketof currencies, and therefore represented their weighted average value) the standard ofreference. In this way, the strongest currency in the group could set the standard for stability,and act as the anchor. That decision primarily determined the route taken during the eighties.Hence an interaction of two developments emerged as early as the beginning of the eighties:Firstly, it became ever more evident that the stability-oriented approach yielded bettereconomic and social results over the medium term. Not only did inflation remain lower; thestability-oriented countries as a whole also came off better with respect to employment andgrowth. And secondly, the EMS exacerbated the political dilemma faced by the weakcurrencies. Either there were domestic policy adjustments, including a possibly uncomfortabletransitional phase (at least as long as the markets were not fully convinced of the sustainabilityof the new stance), or frequent devaluations were unavoidable, with corresponding tarnishingof the political image.Against this background, notably France, led by the then Finance Minister, Jacques Delors,performed a dramatic U-turn in anti-inflation policy in 1982-3. The same course was thenincreasingly adopted in the other EMS countries. That cleared the way in the eighties for thestart of a far-reaching convergence process. Monetary stability was then assigned higherpriority everywhere. Inflation rates declined. Exchange-rate realignments in the EMS becameless frequent. And the D-Mark increasingly took over the function of the anchor currency inEurope – a function which it subsequently came to share more and more with the guilder.Even so, the European Monetary System was, of course, not a monetary union. Parity changeswere still possible. And they were still necessary since monetary, fiscal and economicconvergence remained incomplete. In the financial markets, the reputation of the traditionallystrong currencies and their central banks remained distinctly higher than that of the others, notleast because of the differences in performance during the seventies. That fact was reflected inthe interest-rate differentials, particularly in the longer-term markets. Moreover, a number ofcountries – above all, France – found it politically difficult to accept the actual dominance ofthe German anchor currency.Furthermore, through the envisaged single market, European integration gathered newmomentum during the second half of the eighties. This increasing economic integrationrevived the issue of a common currency under the motto “A single market, a single currency”.The summit meeting in Hanover in 1988 commissioned a group of experts chaired by thePresident of the European Commission, Jacques Delors, to submit new proposals. Then, in theautumn of 1989, the Berlin Wall fell. The prospect of achieving German unification at thesame time suggested the question of the even greater political integration of Germany into the
BIS Review   35/19994European Community. It was these two factors, the single-market project and Germanunification, that formed the political background to the Treaty of Maastricht.At the beginning of the nineties, two opposing forces were acting on the exchange-rate patternin the EMS: On the one hand, since there had not been any central rate changes since 1987,many people believed that a seamless transition from the existing EMS to monetary union waspossible. Even the UK had joined the exchange-rate mechanism in 1991, after long hesitation.All this seemed to immunise the prevailing central rates, even though considerable differencesin the anti-inflation policy stance had meanwhile built up between individual countries. Onthe other hand, in particular the ending of the East-West divide in Germany engendered ineconomic terms an asymmetrical shock involving a potential revaluation tendency for the D-Mark.On balance, however, in the euphoria deriving from the new prospects, the financial marketswere initially prepared to accept the parities prevailing in the EMS, despite the lack ofeconomic convergence. Alas, the policy makers in those days failed to adjust the exchangerates in good time in that “window of opportunity”. Thinking in terms of political prestige wasunduly prevalent. But when, in Denmark, the first referendum on the Maastricht Treatyresulted in a “No”, the financial markets began critically to reconsider the parities in the EMS.That gave rise to the massive, but avoidable, monetary upheavals of the autumn of 1992. Afterprolonged controversy, the fluctuation margins in the EMS were finally widened, on Germaninsistence, at the beginning of August 1993, although the narrow margins ruling between theD-Mark and the guilder were retained under a special arrangement. That was the rightdecision. Not only in order to re-establish calm in the EMS, but even more to save the“monetary union” project from harm. Like that, the EMS remained intact as a framework formonetary integration.IIIIf one surveys the almost thirty years of monetary history before and around the MaastrichtTreaty, then in my view four main lessons stand out very clearly:First, in the medium and long run, stable money has distinct economic and social advantages.Inflation is not worth while. It does not solve, but rather causes, economic problems.Monetary stability, by contrast, is a major, albeit on its own no doubt insufficient, basis forgrowth and employment.Second, an independent central bank can safeguard stable money more easily. After all, it iseasier to pursue a steady, medium-term-oriented approach, apart from day-to-day politicalconcerns. And a medium-term-oriented approach, in turn, helps one to respond that little bitearlier to threats to the value of money, and not to attach undue importance to short-termfactors. Moreover, given an independent central bank, political developments do not exercisea direct impact on confidence in the currency. Consider, for instance, the resignation of the ECCommission two weeks ago, which did not really affect the financial markets. That wouldvery likely have been quite different if the currency had been closer to day-to-day politics.Third, a durably sound fiscal policy contributes materially to safeguarding stable prices andthe longer-term room for manœuvre. In certain situations, it may make sense to toleratedeficits for a while. For instance, as part of built-in flexibility, or in the context of a sustainedtax reform that stimulates both effort and investment. But, judging by past experience,
5BIS Review   35/1999demand management via the expenditure side ultimately increases only the influence of thestate and the debt burden.And fourth, only in the event of sufficient convergence of the economic performance and theeconomic policy priorities can exchange rates remain stable in the long run. Quantitativetargets for exchange rates, without adequate convergence in the field of anti-inflation policy,are counterproductive. That applies above all to exchange rates between major currency areas.Exchange-rate targets are apt to lead to conflicts between external stability and internalobjectives. And the financial markets perceive the vulnerability of such arrangements. Thatencourages, rather than curbs, speculation. If the targets then fall, there may easily be morepronounced overshooting.Happily, these four lessons are included in the Maastricht Treaty. They form the foundationfor today’s common currency, the euro. First, the Treaty gave European monetary policy theprimary target of ensuring price stability. Second, the European System of Central Banks –comprising the ECB and the participating national central banks – has been assigned a largemeasure of independence for that task. Third, the Treaty, or more specifically the jointlyagreed Stability and Growth Pact, commits national fiscal policy as well. The underlyingorientation is: under normal cyclical conditions, the public sector budget should be close tobalance or in surplus. The fiscal policy makers in all participating countries should take thisprecept very much to heart. And fourth, the Treaty stipulates that even general exchange-rateorientations, which may be formulated by the Council of Ministers in special situations, mustnot jeopardise the primary objective of the ECB (namely, ensuring price stability).The stipulations of the Maastricht Treaty did not just drop from heaven or come from narrow-minded technocrats. Hence they should not be interpreted merely legalistically as the outcomeof negotiations – an outcome that could not be helped. In important respects, after all, theyconstitute the lessons of European monetary history over the past few decades.IVThe euro has been reality for a quarter of a year now. The general public has been followingits progress with interest and not uncritically, albeit sometimes with a little too muchagitation. Not every movement in the external value amounts to an underlying trend,particularly when the dollar value is reflecting unexpectedly strong economic performanceand special international political developments. Composure is appropriate, but disregard isnot. We in the ECB Governing Council do not pursue an exchange-rate target, but we are, ofcourse, interested in a lastingly strong and stable euro. The euro must try to gain the strengthof its predecessors and, above all, must win confidence and a reputation of its own. Aconfidence-inspiring orientation of monetary policy is important to that end, but insufficient initself. Other policy areas, too, must make their due contribution. And there seem to be someserious deficiencies, especially as far as structural policies are concerned.That is likewise the common position of all ECB Governing Council members. An underlyingjoint sentiment has developed gratifyingly fast among the Governing Council members. Wefeel ourselves to be part of a common body, bearing joint responsibility for the entire euroarea. Thinking in, and the decisions of, the Governing Council have so far reflected genuinesupranationality, rather than a mere aggregation of national interests.
BIS Review   35/19996Incidentally, it is of course very good for the ECB Governing Council that two Dutchmen aresitting in the debating and decision-making chamber, as heavyweights in the field of anti-inflation policy; one of them as the President of the ECB and the other as the Governor of theDutch central bank. What makes them heavyweights is not their stature or just the fact thatthey are Dutchmen. The crucial factor is their intellectual capacity and, above all, theirunambiguous orientation towards stability. But perhaps these factors are in some wayinterrelated.The European System of Central Banks, which is composed of the European Central Bankand the national central banks, has likewise performed its duties pretty smoothly up to now.After all, the Maastricht Treaty explicitly relies largely on the national central banks for theconduct of monetary policy. Cross-border cooperation has on the whole functioned veryefficiently so far. There have of course been a number of minor mishaps. Given the giganticsize of the task, how could it have been otherwise? But, all things considered, it can be said:the Eurosystem works.The most important thing is, of course, that the euro is currently displaying a high degree ofprice stability. That applies all round to a number of other currencies in Europe andthroughout the world. The high domestic stability of the US dollar is attracting particularattention. And that against the backdrop of a tightening labour market and of strong domesticgrowth that has now persisted for some years. At any rate, there have been no signs to date ofthe upturn in the inflation rate that used to occur as the business cycle progressed. Manycommentators have interpreted that as a new era. Some of them have even gone so far as toconsign the phenomenon of inflation to the archives of economic history for good.The notion of a secular trend towards stability presupposes a structural break triggered by twodevelopments: the onmarch of globalisation, and the surge in productivity due to hugeadvances in communications and data processing. The consequent increase in competition issaid to have led not only to substantial new cost pressures and possibly to a global glut ofgoods and services. In addition, substantial changes in the behaviour of policy makers andeconomic agents are said to have occurred. And that, it is claimed, will continue.True though some of these observations undoubtedly are, the proposition of a structural break,resulting in the final discontinuance of inflation, appears to me to be over-optimistic. It mustsurely be countered by a number of opposing factors:First, the decline in commodity prices is presumably, at least to some extent, only temporary.Some people, indeed, are speaking of an ongoing inverse oil-price shock – an oil-priceimplosion, so to speak. Judging by past experience, however, such shocks seldom last long.The recent rise may suggest that.Second, it remains to be seen whether the faster pace of productivity growth really turns out tobe a lasting phenomenon. And it is not all that easy to tell whether it is primarily driven bytechnological progress. It might also be, at least in part, a reflection; in America, of the longperiod of relatively high capacity utilisation; in Germany, of the steep rise in labour costsduring the first half of the nineties, and of the shedding of labour thereafter.Third, even if the surge in productivity were sustained, it could lastingly foster price stabilityonly if it were not fully exploited for distribution purposes or re-distribution purposes, letalone over-exploited. That may not be a serious problem in America, because of the great
7BIS Review   35/1999flexibility and mobility prevailing on the labour markets there. But in Germany, for instance,wage-rate policy – backed to some extent by government policy – is today largely geared tothe growth of productivity, even though unemployment is high and labour-market flexibilityand mobility are very far from adequate. But in the event of expansionary wage-rate policyand of structural rigidities on the labour market, the academic argument that higherproductivity automatically implies greater price stability does not hold good any longer.And fourth, even if a tendency towards greater stability were durably to take hold in the non-monetary field (something we do not know), that would not release monetary policy, for itspart, from its obligation to keep the monetary side in order. For overly expansionary monetarygrowth always poses a threat – both to price stability and to the stability of the financialmarkets.We must not disregard the fact that it was precisely more monetary discipline in a number ofEuropean countries – often buttressed by greater autonomy for the central bank – whichplayed a major role on the way to price stability during the eighties and nineties. Thatreassured the monetary side. And it helped to engender changes of behaviour in other areas,too. That effect must not be reversed. It is never appropriate to proclaim the death of inflation.The seemingly dead may actually live longer.By saying this, I have no wish to kindle fears of inflation. But I do want to draw attention tothe fact that, in the third millennium, it will remain true that:In the long run, there can be stable money only if monetary policy keeps monetary growthunder control, the markets are sufficiently flexible, and policy makers ensure appropriateunderlying conditions and keep government finances in check. That is why the brave newworld in Europe – especially since it is not as brave as all that in a number of Europeancountries – will need a durably stability-oriented monetary policy, even if monetary policyalone cannot safeguard the stability content of the euro.VUnfortunately, the first quarter-year of the euro has been marked by a number of politicaluncertainties. At the European level, the resignation of the EC Commission highlighted someunsolved problems. And the economic policy stance of specific countries and its presentationhave apparently given rise to some bewilderment, even if the debate meanwhile seems to havebecome less strident again. But that bewilderment is evidently also exerting after-effects. For,in all the assertions on the Treaty, some presentations have been understood to imply that, inthe final analysis, some major precepts of the Treaty no longer possess the binding force theyused to have.The question of the appropriate assignment is manifestly of paramount importance for futureanti-inflation policy and, most probably, for monetary union as well. Hence I will brieflyrevert to this topic once again. First, the overriding question is: Should monetary policy havean unequivocal priority mandate, such as that of the Maastricht Treaty, with its primaryorientation towards the target of monetary stability? Or should it rather be an integral part of aset of political decisions on the correct dosage of all instruments?On this score, it must be clearly recognised: an unequivocal mandate to the monetary policymakers is an essential precondition for the independence of the central bank. And the
BIS Review   35/19998independence of the central bank requires, for its justification, a far-reaching basic consensus.Just as the independence of the ECB and the ESCB is ensured by, for instance, the approval ofall EU countries for the Maastricht Treaty. But a basic consensus implies extracting one targetfrom day-to-day political debate and making it inaccessible to political intervention. This iswhy we have constitutions. If monetary policy makers had no priority target, but onlyobjectives of equal urgency, then they would have to choose between a variety of economicpolicy goals on each occasion, and thus make value judgements. To do that, however, in ademocracy one needs a mandate from the electorate.Hence monetary policy can be independent only in the presence of a clear primary mandate.Needless to say, that does not imply that monetary policy makers do not have to pay heed toother targets, besides that of monetary stability, e.g. to growth, employment and externalequilibrium objectives. But the hierarchy of targets must be clear. And it must likewise beclear that durable monetary stability is a key contribution to the achievement of the othertargets.This brings us to a second consideration: is the independence of the central bank lessimportant nowadays than it was, say, in 1991? If anything, the opposite appears to be the case.For one thing, we have to assume – more so today than in the early nineties – that the euroarea will be determined by nation states for a long time to come. Without a central Europeandecision-making process that is free from thinking in terms of nation states, a political centralbank would be apt to generate severe conflicts between the participating countries.For another, the financial markets have become even more emancipated since 1991.Credibility has become even more important. And building up confidence in the currency onthe part of citizens and financial markets is without any doubt one of the great strengths of anindependent central bank – but only, of course, if it pursues the right policies. Just look at thehistorically low interest rates of the euro – of a new currency without a stability record of itsown, looked after by the European Central Bank, an institution without a success story of itsown. There can be no doubt that the independence of the ECB is already paying off. But itmust remain effective in full. Integration into ex-ante coordination systems with other policyareas is inappropriate.There remains a third aspect: which primary objective should the independent monetarypolicy makers pursue? The Treaty settled that. And this must remain the answer. Not merelyfor legalistic but primarily for objective reasons: In the longer run, inflation is always amonetary phenomenon. Although a sound monetary policy, in isolation, cannot alwaysaltogether prevent the emergence of inflationary trends, it can make it very difficult forinflationary trends to persist.On the other hand, monetary policy can do virtually nothing to counter structuralunemployment, such as mainly prevails today in many countries. For example, it can neitherenhance labour-market flexibility nor widen an unduly narrow wage-rate spread. Nor can itcreate a fiscal and wage environment which is conducive to more private investment. At best,it could, in theory, temporarily lower real labour costs by means of a surprise inflation. Then adifferent assignment would simply imply dropping the goal of stability.There remains the influence of monetary policy on business activity and on the relatively lowproportion of cyclical unemployment in Europe today. I have no intention of denying that.But, particularly under the conditions prevailing today, confidence and the continuity and
9BIS Review   35/1999calculability of policies are more important than feverish activity. Hence a forward-looking,steady monetary policy such as the ECB is aiming at is the right approach in terms ofeconomic activity as well. Pursued over an entire business cycle, such a policy results inrelatively low interest rates.Needless to say, continuity does not signify immobility. But the decisions must be taken onthe basis of thorough and longer-term analysis and detailed monitoring of all the requisite dataand facts. Of course, monetary policy must also take due account of what is happening inother policy areas. But it has a clear responsibility, and clear priority, of its own. And ittherefore cannot be a party to negotiations with policy makers in alliances or pacts of anykind.VIWithout any doubt, the structural deficits on the labour markets of many countries in the euroarea constitute a serious problem. They must be addressed. Otherwise, significant successeswill not be registered in the field of employment. The basic thrust of the adjustments issubstantially known. They must be in the direction of greater flexibility, greater personalresponsibility and greater differentiation, with policy makers naturally needing to ensure thatthe process is socially cushioned and balanced.To tackle a challenge posed to more than one at the same time, there are, in theory, alwaystwo possible approaches: coordinated agreements or competition. It may, of course, makesense for European countries to try to find common solutions to the labour-market andemployment problems (always provided that they point in the right direction). Such jointagreements might perhaps enhance the acceptability of “unpopular” measures in individualcountries. But one cannot be certain of that. It might alternatively throw an undue strain onEuropean integration. In particular, it might pose difficulties in the real world: the points ofdeparture in the various countries often differ distinctly. Moreover, such an approach mightblur the responsibilities. And it might encourage unwelcome centralisation in the direction ofBrussels.In the final analysis, after all, each country always has to conduct its own employment policy.It has to tackle its own problems. But nowadays, of course, political solutions are alwaysembedded in global competition. Well, it is a feature of competition that some respond fasterand others more slowly. That is so in this case, too. Enhancing the effectiveness of the labourmarkets is no zero-sum game in which one country loses the jobs that another gains. Rather, itis the only way to achieve durable overall employment gains in Europe. Here, each countrymust go its own way. The Netherlands is definitely one of those countries which haveaddressed their problems more promptly than, say, Germany. But a country that stands still,loses ground. This is what happens in competition. However, that is not the curse, but ratherthe blessing, of competition.VIIThere can be no doubt that the euro opens up many options for Europe’s future, ranging fromless dependence on exchange rates to larger and more effective financial markets and lowercosts. But it is no less true that, following the advent of the euro, the demands being made onthe participating countries, on their economies and policies, have risen. Now that the euro hasarrived, policy makers actually have no choice but to accept these demands. The monetary
BIS Review   35/199910union must not engender internal conflicts within the Community. That is why it is soimportant for all countries to continue to meet the obligations of the Maastricht Treaty in full,and, in particular, for national fiscal policies to be disciplined. The ECB, in its latest MonthlyBulletin, has therefore rightly called for full compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact.In one respect, the Maastricht Treaty has taken a different path from that envisaged in theWerner Report of 1970. Although monetary policy is to be conducted supranationally, fiscalpolicy, despite all the monitoring, remains in national hands. This implies a vulnerable flank,which can only be protected by the actual common orientation of all member states, especiallythe large ones. After the convergence criteria had already been interpreted generously forsome countries at the time of entry into monetary union, it is now essential not to slow down,let alone stop, the fiscal convergence process.For one cannot rule out the possibility that monetary union, too, will run into stormy seassome day. In the long run, those hard times will probably demand more community spirit fromall the participating countries. And they will demand a greater capacity to act and to takedecisions from the EU. This makes it all the more important to rectify the present politicaldeficiencies and to set the stage soon for more political “community spirit”. Not in the senseof a political super-state, but rather in the clear distribution of responsibilities, and in thecapacity to take political action at the European level.Though aware of these political deficiencies in procedures and rules, I fully appreciate thecurrent capabilities of the existing European institutions and their great support of theintegration process. In particular, I welcome the fact that the recent summit of the EuropeanCouncil in Berlin has reached – besides the financial agenda – agreement on two importantissues: The Council has taken a quick and clear decision on the nomination of the President ofthe next European Commission for a full mandate. And the Council reaffirmed itscommitment to include the democratic states in central and eastern Europe in the integrationprocess. In the Presidency’s Conclusions it is said: “Enlargement remains a historic priorityfor the European Union.” Nevertheless, this priority calls for further reforms in theCommunity. Otherwise, observers may get the impression that, in some discussions, very littleseems to have changed over the past thirty years.As long ago as the summit meeting at The Hague in 1969, tension between enlarging anddeepening the Community was perceptible. At that time, just like today, the heads ofgovernment linked an enlargement of the Community to reforms in the area of agriculturalfunding. And, as long ago as that, they didn’t dare to take the step towards a clear definition offunctions, and towards a clear and new decision-making structure, able to respond quickly andsubject to unambiguous parliamentary control. It seems almost like a miracle that, all thesame, the Community has since grown to fifteen member states, and actually introduced a(hitherto successful) euro in eleven countries at the beginning of this year. Given theseachievements, the Community must not now rest on its laurels.The common currency has imparted new momentum to European integration. Due advantagemust be taken of that stimulus. I very much hope that the euro does not mark the end, butrather the beginning, of ongoing European integration which naturally does not shrink fromfurther enlargement. A clear basic orientation and an improved ability to act and takedecisions are essential prerequisites of any such development. Europe must not suffer the fateof the dinosaurs.
11BIS Review   35/1999
1BIS Review   34/1999Mr Sabirin discusses recent developments in the Indonesian economyPresentation by Dr Syahril Sabirin, Governor of Bank Indonesia, at the Banque de France, Paris inMarch 1999.Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.It is a great pleasure for me to be here today at the kind invitation of the Banque de France, and tohave an opportunity to share with you the most recent developments in the Indonesian economy. Thefinancial and economic crisis experienced by Indonesia since July 1997 was indeed very dramatic andtraumatic. But the many steps we have taken have reversed the situation and established conditionsfor stabilization and a return to economic growth. We have launched and continue to implement aneconomic recovery program, designed not only to reverse the situation, but also to establish a strongerfoundation for sustainable growth in the future.Let me begin by giving you a brief description of some of the factors which demonstrate that progresshas indeed been made and which, as a result, should allow you to make a more positive assessment ofthe Indonesian economy. First, the value of Indonesia’s currency, the rupiah, is the clearest indicatorsuggesting that the worst of the crisis is believed to be over. As you may know, from a pre-crisis levelof around Rp 2,430 per US$ in early July 1997, the rupiah weakened to reach a low of just under Rp17,000 in June 1998. This represents a loss of about 85% of the rupiah’s value at its worst point. Noeconomy could survive such a hard blow without serious harmful repercussions. One of our firstpriorities has therefore been to strengthen and stabilize the value of the rupiah. As a result, the sharpvolatility of the rupiah during early 1998 gradually waned due to actions deterring speculative attacks.The monetary authority’s strict discipline and support from the IMF and other international financialinstitutions played a very important role, pushing up the rate to a range of Rp 7,500–8,000 at end-1998. Despite the more recent weakening of the currency associated with the rumors on China’sdevaluation, the Brazilian devaluation, and some scattered domestic problems, the rupiah has shownits resilience, signifying the improved confidence on Indonesian economic performance andprospects. From mid-October 1998, the rupiah has moved upward and downward within a range ofonly around 13%. Indeed, the bank restructuring program, the details and the implementation ofwhich were announced about a week ago, was the latest piece of economic recovery program thatcontributed to the improved confidence.Now, let me turn to the macroeconomic indicators. GDP suffered a sharp decline in the aftermath ofthe fall in the rupiah’s value. Indonesia’s gross domestic product, which had grown by over 7% perannum for over a decade until 1997, grew by only 4.9% in 1997 and then contracted by about 14% in1998. This contraction was due primarily to a sharp decline in production, private investment andlower household consumption due to the steep depreciation of the rupiah and high interest rates thathad to be introduced to stop the free fall of our currency. We are confident, however, that the rapidfall in GDP growth has now been checked. For 1999 the economy will still post a negative growtharound 2% to 3% year on year, and the economy is estimated to have some positive growth in 2000.Another important indicator, inflation, shows an even more positive trend. During its worst point inearly 1998 Indonesia’s inflation rate reached almost 13% in one particular month alone, a dramaticrise from the 1997 level of 10.3% for the whole year. In response, we adopted a tight monetary policy,and work in a very tight discipline to adhere to the preset targets of monetary aggregates on a day-to-day basis. These efforts, together with the policy actions to secure the supply of basic necessities,have been rewarded. The monthly inflation rate started to decline to a more ‘normal’ level in the lastquarter of 1998. We even recorded a negative inflation rate of 0.3% in October.I should also attribute the increased confidence in Bank Indonesia’s anti-inflation policy to the muchimproved transparency in the conduct of our monetary policy. Beginning the second quarter of 1998we regularly announce, on a weekly basis, the crucial monetary aggregate data and how they compare
BIS Review   34/19992to the preset targets. These data, as well as much other information, are available to everybody toaccess through our website.In June 1998 we recognized the concerns of foreign lenders to the banking system by agreeing toallow these foreign banks the opportunity to exchange loans to Indonesian state and private bankswhich had already matured or were to mature prior to 1999 into new short- and medium-term loansguaranteed by Bank Indonesia. This measure demonstrated immediately to foreign lenders that theguarantee put in place was operative and the Government’s determination to tackle this problem.At the same time, we recognized that the trade finance arrears that had been built up by someIndonesian banks during the currency and financial turmoil were prejudicing current access byIndonesian entities to trade financing across the entire economy. We agreed to settle these arrears andhave paid the due amount. Most recently, in December 1998, we cleared additional arrears. This was,we believe, an important signal to the international banking community. In addition, for those banksthat agreed to maintain their trade financing activities in Indonesia, we agreed to guarantee all newtrade finance facilities for a year after we received confirmation of these banks’ commitment.Turning again briefly to the corporate sector which had been reluctant to enter discussions with itscreditors, we also agreed in June 1998 to set up an agency, the Indonesian Debt Restructuring Agencyor INDRA, to provide foreign exchange protection to those borrowers that had renegotiated theirdebts with their creditors. Strengthening these borrowers by reducing their residual foreign exchangerisk improves their creditworthiness, thereby creating an incentive to complete a restructuring. Theseefforts were followed by the Jakarta Initiative in September 1998 which aimed at setting the rightframework and incentives for bilateral debtor/creditor negotiations.These measures combined, and the real money that has been paid to foreign creditors, in particular byBank Indonesia, show our real determination to resolve the current situation. Indeed our support hasbeen proven with the expenditure of very large sums of our scarce foreign exchange resourcesreflecting the high priority we give this subject. I would urge you, therefore, not to adopt a reflexivereduction in your activities in Indonesia. Instead, please do focus on the systems in place now and theopportunities open to you within our new strengthened framework.Another very important point I would like to mention here is the high levels of capital-backingrequired in some jurisdictions on new lending to Indonesia. We believe these levels of provisions areexcessive and that they constitute a great hindrance to a resumption of activity in our economy.Let me also take this opportunity to share with you some developments in our banking restructuringprogram. It is not a secret that the pre-crisis Indonesian financial system was unhealthily fragile andvulnerable to external shocks. We certainly underestimated the vulnerability of our domestic bankingsystem to a crisis in the corporate sector and its potential to paralyze the banking sector; we alsoprobably underestimated the riskiness of many loans in the banks’ portfolios. For our economy torecover, we had to create a strongly capitalized and well managed banking sector in line withinternational standards. This is our objective. To reach it we have first to address the current situation;that is very low capital base and excessive number of institutions which have not been able to institutethe necessary reforms and improvements to their financial conditions, management and operationalsystems.Clearly, the banking sector has been one of the most seriously affected segments of the economyduring the crisis. The effects were transmitted primarily through the following ways.(i) The sharp depreciation of the rupiah suddenly blew up the rupiah value of banks’ liabilitiesdenominated in foreign currencies and put the banks with short position in serious problems;(ii) The economic crisis put banks’ customers (debtors) in problems which depressed the value ofbanks’ assets; and
3BIS Review   34/1999(iii) The tight monetary policy to stabilize inflation and exchange rates, and the concomitant highinterest rates, resulted in negative spreads for the banks.All the factors I cited earlier imply depletions of banks’ capital base. And the longer the problemsremain, the sharper the depletion of banks’ capital will be. Indeed, the results of the due diligencebeing run on the banks in 1998 show how deep the impact of the crisis on the banking sector has been.We fully realize that: (a) the recapitalization program is likely to be costly; (b) the recovery of theeconomy relies upon the recovery of the banking system, and thus on the recapitalization program;and (c) the failure of the recapitalization program would amount to the very costly delays to economicrecovery; then the recapitalization program would have to be designed and implemented verycarefully to assure its success. It is for this purpose that our bank recapitalization program carries thefollowing characteristics.(i) The estimates of recapitalization needs are done very realistically, or even conservativelythrough the due diligence process conducted by international auditing firms on each and everybank. The conservativeness of the estimate would provide some cushion to the changingenvironment during the process of recapitalization.(ii) The criteria for the banks to be eligible to participate in the Government-supportedrecapitalization program are made very clear and transparent.(iii) The process of eligibility evaluation is conducted by four layers of committees, each layerworks independently of the others, and the meetings of the committees are attended byobservers from international financial institutions. This will assure the intensity of theevaluation and add transparency to the whole process.(iv) Among those to be evaluated by the committees, aside from the workability of the businessplans, the ‘fit and proper’ of the management and the controlling owners of the banks is a veryimportant and determining aspect. This process will leave out bad managers as well as bad andimproper controlling owners from the post-restructuring banking sector of Indonesia.It has been on the basis of the principles I cited earlier that we run our bank recapitalization programto recapitalize those banks that we believe have a viable future together with the decision to liquidatethose banks that were not viable. Following an assessment by international auditors of the bankingsector, we have classified each bank into one of three categories. So-called category A banks have acapital adequacy ratio of 4% or more. Category B banks are those with a capital adequacy ratio of lessthan 4% and more than minus 25%. Category C banks are the residual.On 13 March 1999 the Government took a decisive step towards restructuring the private domesticsystem and bringing it back to financial health: 38 banks – all 17 private category C banks and 21category B banks – have been closed as they were considered deeply insolvent and as having noprospect of regaining financial viability. Seven large category B banks with extensive branchnetworks have been taken over by the Government in the public interest to minimize disruption to thepayments system. These seven banks will be restructured speedily to improve their financialperformance and prepared for later privatization. Nine category B banks have been determined aseligible for recapitalisation by the Government to bring them to the minimum capital requirements.Several committees and international consulting firms have assessed the better financial positions,quality of management and future prospects of these nine banks. Their owners have, however, untilApril 21, 1999 to inject at least 20% of the banks’ capital requirements, the Government providing theremaining capital in the form of bonds. Finally, 73 category A banks have met Bank Indonesia’sminimum capital adequacy standards and can compete without any public financial assistance. Thesecategory A banks will be reviewed regularly to ensure they remain in good financial health andcontinue to observe all rules and regulations, focusing on three main criteria: their business plans, the‘fit and proper’ test of their owners, and the nature of any capital injection.
BIS Review   34/19994With regard to the state banks, all regional development banks will be recapitalized by theGovernment such that they have a capital adequacy ratio of at least 4%. Mergers between the sevenexisting state banks will allow us to create some stronger and healthier banks. For instance, four outof the seven state banks will be merged to create Bank Mandiri, which is expected to comprise 30%of banking system deposits in Indonesia. As the restructuring of the state banks takes place, theGovernment will inject additional capital needed by the banks on a step-by-step basis.The cost of the bank restructuring program will be significant. However, every effort will be taken tominimize this cost and in particular to recover loans from recalcitrant debtors. In terms of the interestcost to the Government in 1999/2000, it is estimated at a total of Rp 34 trillion or Euro 3.5 billion. Ofthis amount we believe around Rp 16 trillion will be recoverable from sales of assets pledged to IBRAby the owners of the banks.I should like to stress that it is not the intention of the Government to stay forever and dominate thebanking sector. The Government’s involvement in the capitalization of the banking sector is onlytemporary to help the sector recover from the deep problems it is currently experiencing. In three tofive years’ time the government’s share in the private banks will be divested, and these banks areexpected to be pure privately owned banks once again. Nor is the intention of the Government to beinvolved in the day-to-day operation of the banks during the three- to five-year period. We only needto make sure that the banks are run properly and efficiently. And the mechanism of therecapitalization program has been designed such as to assure that these ideas are materialized.I can also report to you today that we will continue our efforts in the future to improve the security ofour financial system further. We will implement organizational and cultural change in the way wemanage bank supervision. We will also review the workings of the amended bankruptcy law and makealterations to ensure that the law works as intended to allow both domestic and international creditorsto gain security over the assets of debtors in default. I look forward to reporting our progress in thesematters to you in future meetings.Ladies and gentlemen, I hope that I have given you a balanced picture of the current situation in theIndonesian economy, banking system, and of the treatment of the broader financial obligations of theIndonesian private sector.
1BIS Review   33/1999Mr Brash addresses the question: What can New Zealanders expect of monetary policy inthe long term?Address by Donald T Brash, Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, to the NorthernClub, Auckland on 25 March 1999.IntroductionMr ChairmanToo often, both in the Reserve Bank and, I suspect, in financial markets, we are inclined to losesight of the longer-term, or strategic, issues of relevance to monetary policy. We get preoccupiedwith whether the Official Cash Rate should really have been set at 4.50 per cent rather than at4.25 per cent, as if this detail had any enduring significance for the real economy and the lives ofordinary New Zealanders. I don’t want to imply that the short-term tactics are irrelevant – farfrom it – but they are very much less relevant than the longer-term issues, particularly when theOfficial Cash Rate itself is explicitly up for review on a regular basis.So today I want to address the question, What can New Zealanders expect of monetary policy inthe long term?The monetary policy framework is profoundly democraticThe first point to note in answering that question is that the answer depends on what Parliamentwants monetary policy to deliver. It is sometimes suggested that the Reserve Bank seems to be alaw unto itself, and that Don Brash seems to run the country. Nothing could be further from thetruth. In New Zealand, the Reserve Bank is subject to an Act of Parliament, and Parliament canchange that legislation by simple majority. This is also true in Australia, the United Kingdom, theUnited States and many other countries, of course, but it is not now true in much of Europe(where the European Central Bank is a creature of the Maastricht Treaty) or in those countrieswhere the central bank has been given essentially unlimited independence under the constitution.Moreover, that Act of Parliament requires that, within the general directive prescribed by the Act,the Governor of the Bank must sign a written agreement with the Treasurer setting out quiteexplicitly what the Governor must achieve during his or her term of office, the so-called PolicyTargets Agreement. That Agreement can be changed by mutual agreement at any time during theGovernor’s term of office, and can be overridden by Order-in-Council if the Government wants achange and the Governor does not.So what monetary policy will deliver in the years ahead is essentially a matter for the public,through Parliament, to determine. The Reserve Bank and I as the Bank’s Governor are heldaccountable for our performance in delivering the objectives which Government and Parliamenthave chosen, through a requirement to produce regular Monetary Policy Statements and to appearregularly before the Finance and Expenditure Committee of Parliament.Having said that, as long as the present Act remains in place at least, the Government can notchange the objective laid down for monetary policy without telling the public. In other words, anychange in the objective must be totally transparent and, given that inflation is essentially a form oftheft, that seems entirely appropriate. All this seems profoundly democratic, and makes it clearthat the Reserve Bank and Don Brash are servants of Parliament.Since 1989, the Reserve Bank Act has made it clear that monetary policy must be used to achieveand maintain ‘stability in the general level of prices’, with the meaning of this defined in the
BIS Review   33/19992Policy Targets Agreement. The present Agreement, signed when I was reappointed Governor atthe end of 1997, defines ‘stability in the general level of prices’ as meaning that monetary policyshould be aimed at keeping inflation as measured by the CPI excluding credit charges, or CPIX,between 0 and 3 per cent over each 12-monthly period, though the Agreement also recognisesthat there will be some circumstances where inflation may legitimately be allowed to fall outsidethat range.But what, I am often asked, happens after the election? Fundamentally, that depends on what thenext Parliament decides. It is not inevitable that anything (related to monetary policy) will changeafter the election. Almost all political parties are on record as supporting the present legislation,and indeed supporting the present 0 to 3 per cent target. While the Policy Targets Agreementcould be changed by agreement between Governor and any new Treasurer, there should be nopresumption that that will occur. Consistency and continuity are attractive in monetary policy aselsewhere, and I shall certainly not be promoting a change. It is perhaps worth noting that othercentral banks with a price stability objective and a quantitative inflation target all have targets thatfall within the 0 to 3 per cent range – and to the best of my knowledge, there are none that falloutside it. But, to repeat, it is for Parliament to decide in the final analysis.The present Policy Targets AgreementWhat does the present Policy Targets Agreement imply about the way in which the Reserve Bankwill formulate monetary policy in the years ahead? Without going into great detail, it means thatwe will be aiming to keep CPIX inflation close to the midpoint of the 0 to 3 per cent target one totwo years ahead.We aim close to the midpoint because we recognise that, in an uncertain and fast-changing world,aiming at the midpoint maximises the chance that we will be able to keep inflation in the targetrange. Aiming near either edge of the target would run too high a risk that unexpected shockswould throw us outside the target.And we aim to keep inflation near the midpoint not this quarter or next, but in one to two years’time, because we recognise that monetary policy has most of its impact on trend inflation overthis kind of time horizon.It follows that in implementing policy we would in principle be willing to accept the prospect ofinflation outcomes close to the edges of the target, and conceivably even outside the target, in thenext few quarters if we were reasonably confident that inflation would be back near the centre ofthe target within one to two years. Clearly, we will not lightly sanction breaches of the agreedtarget – indeed, we will do our utmost to avoid such breaches, of either side of the target – but topretend that we can at all times and in all circumstances keep inflation within the target would beto promise more than we can deliver. Indeed, we learnt that in the mid-nineties.As an aside, we are reasonably certain that headline inflation, the CPI including interest rates, willfall below zero for several quarters this year. In the 12 months to December 1998, headlineinflation was only 0.4 per cent, the lowest level for several decades. We expect the 12 months‘increase’ to be negative very shortly.But it is important that nobody misunderstands the significance of this. Having the headlineinflation figure go below zero is not a breach of the Policy Targets Agreement, any more than itwas a breach when the headline figure rose to 4.6 per cent in mid-1995. The inflation target in thePolicy Targets Agreement is explicitly defined in terms of the CPI excluding interest rates, for thevery good reason that an interest-inclusive CPI target would quickly have the Reserve Bankchasing its own tail, tightening monetary policy (increasing interest rates) in response to an
3BIS Review   33/1999increase in measured inflation which was itself caused by increasing interest rates earlier in theyear, and vice versa. Both the negative headline inflation figure we now project and the highfigure experienced in the mid-nineties are simply the result of the inclusion in New Zealand’sheadline inflation figure of interest rates.Most economists are agreed that interest rates should not be in the inflation figure and manymajor countries already exclude them. The Government Statistician has agreed to remove themfrom the official CPI from later this year. Thankfully, this will end the potential for publicconfusion inherent in the present situation. But in the meantime we ignore the interest-inclusiveheadline figure, as we have done all decade. Of course, we could prevent the headline inflationfigure turning negative very easily – by aggressively increasing interest rates! I don’t thinkanybody is strongly arguing for this!Growth and inflationWhy not add a growth objective for monetary policy? Surely, the most important objective for alleconomic policy must be to encourage growth, so why isn’t the same true for monetary policy? Ina fundamental sense, it is. It’s just that we now realise that the most constructive thing thatmonetary policy can do to encourage growth is to deliver price stability, so that businessesplanning what products to produce can distinguish relative price movements from the noise ofgeneral inflation, so that savers can sensibly plan how to invest their savings, so that the grossdistortions created by the interaction of inflation and a tax system geared to historical costaccounting can be avoided, and all the rest.We now know that inflation damages economic growth, to say nothing of the social damage italso does through the capricious redistribution of income and wealth which it produces.It is for this reason that the present Policy Targets Agreement makes it clear that the ReserveBank is to deliver price stability ‘so that monetary policy can make its maximum contribution tosustainable economic growth, employment and development opportunities within the NewZealand economy’.In other words, price stability is not simply an end in itself but a means to an end, and that end isbetter growth, better employment, and indeed a more just society.The Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Mr Ian Macfarlane, expressed it well late in 1996when he said that ‘the other way of expressing an inflation target is to say that monetary policy isset in a way which lets the economy grow as fast as possible without breaking the inflationobjective, but no faster.’1The Governor of the Bank of England, Mr Eddie George, also put it very clearly in a speech lastmonth:‘We’re often described as a lot of “inflation nutters”, or even as “pointy-headed industrialhooligans” who don’t care at all about real economic activity or jobs … That view … isprofoundly and fundamentally wrong.‘The implication, of those who take that view, is that they think there is a trade-off betweeninflation and the rate of economic growth; they think that if only we would let up a bit oncontrolling inflation then we could all enjoy higher activity and lower unemployment and rising1Speech by Mr I J Macfarlane, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to the CEDA annual general meetingdinner, Melbourne, 28 November 1996.
BIS Review   33/19994living standards, which are, of course, the really good things of economic life. At the very least,they say, if you were a bit less manic in your pursuit of low inflation, we could avoid some of theworst damage that is currently being inflicted upon agriculture, upon large parts ofmanufacturing, and even some service sectors.‘And that might even be true for a time. The trouble is that, in anything other than the short term,it would be likely to mean more rather than less economic damage, and lower rather than highergrowth and employment …‘We are every bit as concerned with growth and employment as we are about price stability – asanyone in their right mind must be. Permanently low inflation is a necessary means of achievinggrowth and employment sustained into the medium and long term.’2I totally agree.The control of inflation, and output variabilityMost of us now accept that monetary policy can not, by tolerating a little more inflation, buysustainably faster growth. In other words, keeping inflation low is the best contribution whichmonetary policy can make to growth in the longer term.But it is also widely accepted that there may be a trade-off between the variability of inflation andthe variability of output. In other words, it may be that attempting to keep inflation at precisely1.5 per cent at all times might lead the Bank to throw interest and exchange rates around quitevigorously – and output around quite vigorously as a result.In recent years, the distinction between ‘strict’ inflation targeting and ‘flexible’ inflation targetinghas grown up in the economic literature, with ‘strict’ inflation targeters being those who aim tokeep inflation very close to a narrow target at all times, and ‘flexible’ targeters being those whoare willing to accept a little more variability in inflation outcomes for the sake of reducing thevariability of interest and exchange rates, and of economic output.3 I am not sure that any centralbanks are in fact ‘strict’ inflation targeters, but the distinction is useful in highlighting why allcentral banks are more or less ‘flexible’ inflation targeters.The Reserve Bank of New Zealand has never been a ‘strict’ inflation targeter. From the very firstPolicy Targets Agreement, reasons why actual inflation might legitimately fall outside the targetband – the so-called caveats – were recognised. At no stage have we treated the centre of theinflation target band as a fetish.Early in 1996, after inflation fell outside the then 0 to 2 per cent target by 0.1 per cent in the yearto March 1996, I wrote to the Minister of Finance and explained that, although we were confidentthat inflation would be back within range by the following year, I was not confident that furtherbreaches of the target could be avoided in the immediate future without a very aggressive furthertightening of monetary policy. I noted that under all the circumstances I could not recommendsuch an aggressive further tightening, and indeed noted that tightening to the extent which wouldhave been needed to reduce the risk of further breaches of the top of the inflation target in the2Speech by Mr E A J George, Governor of the Bank of England, at Hertfordshire University, 18 February 1999.3See Lars Svensson, ‘Inflation targeting in an open economy: strict or flexible inflation targeting?’, ReserveBank of New Zealand Discussion Paper, G97/8.
5BIS Review   33/1999immediate future ran the risk of throwing the inflation rate through the bottom of the inflationtarget further into the future.4So there is plenty of evidence that we have been ‘flexible’ inflation targeters from the beginning.But I suspect that we may be even more willing to be ‘flexible’ inflation targeters now than wewere in the late eighties and early nineties, when we were at the beginning of our inflationtargeting experience. This is a direct result of the fact that inflation and inflation expectations arenow much more firmly anchored at a low level than was the case a decade ago. At that time, wewere coming out of a period of nearly two decades of high and variable inflation, a period duringwhich governments had repeatedly promised to reduce inflation and had repeatedly broken thosepromises. It was hardly surprising that, initially at least, the public greeted the news of one moreapproach to delivering low inflation with a high degree of scepticism.Today, by contrast, even those who criticised the commitment to low inflation initially arepersuaded that low inflation is likely to be around for a considerable time to come. Businesses nolonger assume that they will be able to increase prices more or less automatically each year.Consumers no longer assume that they must buy this month because next month prices will behigher. Those negotiating wage and salary increases strike agreements consistent with stableprices. Long-term interest rates are nearly back to their levels in the sixties. Even home-buyersare beginning to realise that house prices go down as well as up. As a consequence of these morefirmly-anchored inflation expectations, the Bank can afford to respond rather more moderately tothe prospect of small changes in the inflation rate, confident that, even if inflation doestemporarily depart from the midpoint of the target, this is not likely to produce any damaginglonger-term changes in pricing and wage-setting behaviour.We live in an uncertain worldThis anchoring of inflation expectations is of considerable assistance in the way monetary policyoperates, and should mean that interest rates may not need to move around as strongly as at timesin the past.But does that mean that the Bank will be able to formulate policy with perfect foresight, andwithout controversy, in the future? Of course not. Inevitably, sometimes things turn outdifferently than expected.For example, 90 day interest rates rose from an average of 4.6 per cent in February 1994 to 9.5per cent in December that year. At the time, that increase in rates seemed to be ample to containinflationary pressures. But with the wisdom of hindsight it is probable that we should havetightened policy earlier and more aggressively than we did; had we done so, we might havenipped inflationary pressures in the bud at an earlier stage, and it may have been possible to easepolicy earlier than was in fact the case. Not many people complained, in 1993, that we were nottightening policy sufficiently quickly.Late in 1995, we thought we could see inflationary pressures abating in 1996, and so advised theGovernment that there seemed no reason from a monetary policy perspective to abandon the taxreductions proposed for mid-1996; in retrospect, we were rather too optimistic, and inflationarypressures continued throughout that year, with the tax cuts and, later, additional governmentspending adding to those pressures. Again, not many people complained at the time.4Letter to the Minister of Finance dated 19 April 1996, published in Monetary Policy Statement, June 1996.
BIS Review   33/19996As President Harry Truman once said, ‘Any schoolboy’s hindsight is better than the President’sforesight.’You would be disappointed if I did not mention the introduction of the Monetary ConditionsIndex with ‘bands’ at the end of June 1997 as another innovation which, with the benefit ofexperience, has proved less useful than we had hoped. In the extreme test provided by the Asiancrisis, we believe that the MCI with ‘bands’ produced unnecessary volatility in short-term interestrates in the 12 months or so after it was first introduced (that volatility began to diminish in thesecond half of 1998 as we more explicitly relaxed the ‘bands’ around desired conditions), so inthat sense we believe that the MCI was not as helpful in the implementation of policy as webelieve the Official Cash Rate will be.But we have not abandoned the MCI as an indicator of monetary conditions, and we intend tocontinue using it to illustrate how we see monetary conditions evolving over the period coveredby our projections.Moreover, we do not accept that the MCI ‘caused’ the brief recession in the first half of 1998.The monetary conditions relevant to the level of activity in the first half of 1998 were those in1996 and early 1997, not those in the second half of 1997. If monetary policy carries any part ofthe blame for that early 1998 recession, it was monetary policy in 1996 and the first part of 1997which was to blame; the MCI was introduced at the end of June 1997. In 1996, notwithstandingthat inflation was slightly above the then 0 to 2 per cent target and notwithstanding the tax cutsand increased government expenditure, we were projecting inflationary pressures to abate over1997 and 1998, with a period of positive but below-trend growth. In other words, we wereprojecting the proverbial soft landing. On this basis, we began easing, in December 1996. Whatturned a soft landing into something much harsher was the Asian crisis and the drought, bothunpredicted and unpredictable in 1996.In fact, judging from the inflation outcomes it is not at all obvious that monetary policy in 1996was too tight. CPIX inflation has been close to the middle of the inflation target since the Junequarter of 1997, and indeed, had it not been for the widening of the target from 0 to 2 per cent to0 to 3 per cent at the very end of 1996, inflation outcomes in much of 1998 would have beenrather uncomfortably close to the top of the band. On this basis, it is certainly hard to argue thatpolicy in 1996 was too tight.But there have been mistakes in the past, as I have indicated. And there will be mistakes in thefuture. Without a crystal ball, this is quite inevitable, given the huge amount of uncertainty whichsurrounds the way in which policy must of necessity be implemented, namely looking forwardone to two years.There is uncertainty about where the economy is when we begin each projection. The projectionwhich we published last week was finalised on 1 March, and yet the latest comprehensive data wehave on economic activity is for a quarter which finished five months earlier, and we know thatdata for that quarter may be revised, and revised again, for many quarters to come. Of course, wetry hard to offset this problem by studying a very large number of more up-to-date statisticalseries, by talking to scores of businesses all over the country, by talking to audiences in manyparts of the country, by assessing the implications of several surveys of business and consumerconfidence, and by asking our seven non-executive Directors for their assessment of the economy.As I remarked on a previous occasion, I sometimes suspect that God made economic forecastersto make weather forecasters look good, but at least weather forecasters can look out the windowand see what the weather is like today! Economic forecasters do not have that luxury.
7BIS Review   33/1999There is also a great deal of uncertainty about ‘how the economy works’, in other words abouthow people and businesses react to circumstances. For example, our latest projections assumethat household expenditure will grow more slowly as the economy grows out of the early 1998recession than it did as we grew out of the recession of 1991/92. We made that assumptionbecause people now carry a great deal more debt, relative to their incomes, than was the case adecade ago. We are assuming that they will take on rather less additional debt over the next fewyears. That seems an entirely reasonable assumption, but of course nobody can know that withcertainty, particularly given that low interest rates of the kind now prevailing have not beenexperienced in New Zealand for many years. There is perhaps even more uncertainty about ‘whatlies around the corner’. Will the US share market continue rising over the next year or two,stabilise at present levels, or fall substantially? The answer to that question, on which we all haveviews no doubt, will almost certainly have a material bearing on the growth of US consumerspending and potentially therefore on world economic growth. But should we formulate monetarypolicy on the basis that the US share market will correct downwards, or will not? Similarly fordevelopments in the Japanese economy. Even within New Zealand, there may be all kinds oftotally unpredictable events. Another drought perhaps? Unlikely surely, but certainly notimpossible.All these sources of uncertainty mean that, when we look back on the way in which monetarypolicy was formulated in March 1999 from the vantage point of, say, 2002, what seemed likewell-founded decisions as we finalised our decision on the Official Cash Rate last week mayseem hard to justify. Because of the delay between monetary policy action and the effects of thataction on the real economy and, through those effects, on inflation, we have no alternative than toformulate policy in full recognition of this inherent uncertainty.This has several implications, and this is not the place to spell out all of them. But one of theways in which we try to reduce the risks associated with the inherent uncertainty of monetarypolicy formulation is by publishing our quarterly projections and the key assumptions on whichthey are based. (Indeed, we have published considerable information about the model on whichour projections are based.) This helps markets to interpret new information as it emerges, and toadjust monetary conditions even before we adjust the Official Cash Rate. Of course this onlyworks because financial market participants understand the objective of monetary policy in NewZealand and, on the basis of our track record over the last decade and more, understand also thatwe are committed to delivering that objective.What this means in practice will no doubt be illustrated tomorrow. In our Monetary PolicyStatement last week, we indicated that when we finalised our projection on 1 March we expectedthat GDP would have increased by 0.6 per cent in the December 1998 quarter (seasonallyadjusted). It is possible that, when the figure for December 1998 quarter GDP is released by theGovernment Statistician tomorrow, it will show growth of exactly 0.6 per cent. Possible, butunlikely. But in an important sense that doesn’t really matter. Not only is there ample time for usto adjust policy long before any mis-assessment has the slightest relevance to inflation in thesecond half of next year, but financial markets themselves may adjust conditions within minutesof the announcement. Thus if the December quarter GDP figure turns out to be appreciablystronger than the Bank projected, and if this is seen by markets as being relevant to the inflationoutlook, monetary conditions might well tighten quickly. And vice versa. This is precisely whathappened, for example, on the announcement of the GDP figures for the March quarter of 1998 atthe end of June, for the June quarter at the end of September, and for the September quarter nearthe end of December. In each case, monetary conditions moved in a broadly appropriate direction.
BIS Review   33/19998ConclusionAt the beginning of my address I asked what New Zealanders can expect of monetary policy inthe long term. I would hope that they can expect monetary policy to become so totally predictableas to be boring – stable average prices year after year after year – because that is the bestenvironment for growth in output and employment.Interest rates will still move up and down to some degree of course, reflecting changes in thebalance between savers and borrowers. But the week-to-week volatility of short-term interestrates should be diminished by our move to implement monetary policy through an Official CashRate, and our progressively longer track record of low inflation should make it unnecessary everto push interest rates to the levels seen in the early stages of disinflation in the mid-eighties.The New Zealand dollar will also fluctuate of course, certainly against individual currencies andeven against the trade-weighted index. As I discussed in a speech to the Canterbury Employers’Chamber of Commerce at the end of January, that appears to be a fact of life which nobody hasyet found a way of avoiding.So I suppose that, with interest rates and the exchange rate still moving up and down, monetarypolicy will never seem totally boring. But with luck monetary policy will at least come to be seenfor what it is when it is formulated with skill, namely a useful contributor to a prosperous society,but not nearly as important as a whole host of other matters – policies on education, policies onthe labour market, policies on taxation, our access to international markets, the quality of ourmanagers, and all the rest. Those are the things which will really determine our longer-termprosperity.
1BIS Review   32/1999Mr McDonough discusses the changing nature of banking, risk and capital regulationSpeech by the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Mr William JMcDonough, at the 29th Annual Banking Symposium, Bank and Financial AnalystsAssociation, New York City, on 17 March 1999.Good afternoon. I am pleased to be here today to discuss the changing nature of banking, riskand capital regulation. With the new millennium on the horizon, it seems a particularly fittingtime to discuss some of the key trends that are affecting the way both bankers and supervisorsthink about these issues. Also, as I’m sure many of you are aware, the Basle Committee onBanking Supervision currently is engaged in a fundamental review of the Accord, which is thecornerstone of existing capital standards. In many ways, the changing nature of banking andits risks have led supervisors to revisit the current capital framework, and so I welcome thisopportunity to provide my perspective on these risks and how they relate to the future ofcapital regulation more generally.In the last several years, we have witnessed an increase in the diversity and complexity ofbusinesses in which banks are engaged. While lending and deposit-taking are still themainstays for a majority of commercial banks, many banks have grown their derivativestrading, securities underwriting and corporate advisory businesses. Some banks haveexpanded their traditional credit product lines to include asset securitizations and creditderivatives. Still other banks have greatly increased their transaction processing, custody orasset management businesses, in the pursuit of fee income.Looking forward to the next century, I believe we will see major strides in the area that Isuggest we call “e-finance”. More banks will venture into the relatively new world of on-linePC banking or will expand electronic bill presentment and paying services. Banks will bemotivated to overcome obstacles such as systems incompatibility and consumer privacyconcerns, to achieve greater operating efficiencies and to protect their valuable paymentsfranchise. Going forward, on-line purchases and sales of securities by individuals also willcontinue to increase, producing a growing source of commissions for financial institutions.For most banks, these developments will mean a further increase in the diversity andcomplexity of risks to which they are exposed, including, but not limited to, credit, market andoperational risks. The challenge for these banks will be to develop risk management systemsthat are rigorous and comprehensive, yet flexible enough to address the newer risks they takeon as they expand into less familiar product areas. Today, I would like to highlight these risksand focus on how important it is for banks to integrate their risk management and capitalplanning processes. Also, I would like to focus on how the changing nature of banking ischallenging supervisors to rethink their approach to capital regulation and supervision.Despite changes in banking over the last few years, many of which already have beendiscussed today, credit risk remains the predominant risk for most banks. However, credit riskclearly extends beyond conventional credit products such as loans and letters of credit. Today,banks are taking on credit risk in the form of margin lending and transactions in the over-the-counter derivatives markets that expose them to large amounts of counterparty risk and can bedifficult to measure. They also may be engaged in taking on credit risk in its more subtleforms. The short-term credit risks in futures brokerage, where the clearing broker standsbetween the customer and the exchange, or the often underestimated, but substantial, credit
BIS Review   32/19992risks that arise in settling foreign exchange contracts, are examples. Credit risk also may existin more complicated, less conventional forms, such as credit derivatives or tranches ofsecuritized assets.Market risk also remains prominent. The upheavals in both global fixed income and equitiesmarkets over the last year led to a great deal of volatility in spreads and asset prices andcaused large swings in bank profitability. These events demonstrate that the world doesn’tnecessarily work the way we thought it did, that there are correlations between markets thatwe had previously thought were unrelated. As banks continue to expand their global tradingoperations, the need to understand the relationships between markets increases. This challengeis amplified by technological advances and financial product innovations that contribute toever-more complex market instruments.But clearly, banks are exposed to more than just credit and market risk. Operational risk alsois a growing concern for the banking industry. The looming issue of Year 2000 remediation isjust one example. With the continuing diversification of banking, the fast pace of financialinnovation and the growing concentration of crucial payments, settlements and custodybusinesses, the importance of operational risk is rising, especially at many larger institutions.These institutions find that the probability of a financial loss resulting from a breakdown ininternal controls or systems is greater than ever. As banks expand into new lines of business,such as electronic banking, this trend is likely to continue. For instance, consider the risk of abreach in electronic security controls that leads to unauthorized access to confidentialcustomer information. Should this breach be severe and pervasive, it could lead toconsiderable legal and reputational problems for a bank. Further, the overall rapid pace oftechnological change in this area means there is a substantial risk of obsolescence.These are just some of the risks that banks must manage, and clearly the list I have set forth isnot exhaustive. In particular, consider banks in emerging market countries that are subject to aunique set of risks as a result of the financing and investment cycles in their countries. Thosebanks that fund their domestic assets with foreign currencies may be particularly susceptibleto liquidity risk when sharp fluctuations in exchange rates and market turbulence make itdifficult to retain sources of financing.While I have presented to you some of the major risks as separate and discrete, we recentlyhave discovered that they are, in fact, inter-related. For instance, we have seen that market riskfrequently drives credit risk. In the second half of last year, we saw turbulence in fixed-income markets produce severe liquidity and solvency risks for hedge fund marketparticipants. Also, we have learned that credit risk may derive from operational risks,embedded in complex systems for managing collateral or intra-day funding, both of whichrequire rigorous internal control environments.Regardless of the nature or form of risk, the best way for all banks to protect themselves is toidentify risk correctly, accurately measure and price it, appropriately control it and maintainhigh levels of reserves and capital, in both good times and bad. However, many banks are notfinding it easy to develop a holistic approach to assessing and managing the many inter-related risks they face. A particular challenge is to relate such risk assessments to appropriatecapital levels, especially given the dynamic nature of their businesses.
3BIS Review   32/1999Before I discuss how some banks are tackling this issue, let me first consider the role ofcapital more generally and how it relates to risk and strategy.Fundamentally, the role of capital is to act as a buffer against unidentified, even relativelyremote losses that a bank may incur in the future. A bank must hold enough capital to cushionboth depositors and senior lenders against losses, while leaving the bank able to meet theneeds of its customers. Banks must maintain capital commensurate with the amount of risksthat they take and hold enough to weather financial storms, which can at times be severe andof considerable duration. Banks with low equity capital ratios and a high variability ofoperating earnings have proven particularly vulnerable to financial distress.However, banks do not just hold capital to overcome distress, but also because it providesthem with financial flexibility. Banks that are strongly capitalized can take advantage ofgrowth opportunities. Also, strongly capitalized banks are better able to promote innovation,whether in the form of new products, new services or new distribution channels. This is notjust a capital resource issue, but a human resource issue. Bank managers who are able to focuson the business of banking, strategy and competition, rather than on financial difficulties, cancreate and innovate and, therefore, add value for shareholders.Banks also hold capital as a sign of strength to their customers. Clearly we know this to betrue with depositors on the retail side, but it is equally true on the wholesale side. When aninstitution or corporation enters into letter of credit guarantees or swap contracts, it needs tobe confident that its bank will be around in three or five years, at the maturity of the contract.A bank that is well capitalized can credibly state to its customers and clients that it can makegood on its promise to pay. More and more, clients recognize this and differentiate amongvarious banks on this basis. As financial services converge and competitive pressuresincrease, banks find that they must vie for capital, not only with their domestic and foreigncounterparts, but also with investment funds, asset management firms, investment banks andinsurance companies.This is equally true for emerging market banks that find they must compete withinternationally active banks in what were previously thought to be solely domestic markets.These banks recognize that an adequately capitalized institution is a necessary, but notsufficient, condition to compete globally and to attract international funds and clients. It willbe a challenge for these banks, and particularly those with high-risk profiles and opaquefinancial statements, to prove to clients, counterparties and stakeholders that they areoperating safely and soundly.In the face of increasing competitive pressures, banks are focusing more of their attention onthe role of capital, capital levels and targets, and how they relate to strategic plans andobjectives. Many banks also are spending more time assessing their own risk profiles andevaluating the amount of capital they need to cope with adverse outcomes in normal times andunder reasonable stress scenarios. The more sophisticated banks are in the process ofdeveloping internal systems and methodologies, including formal analytical models, thatenable them to do this better. Some of these banks rely on capital allocation methodologiestypically used for pricing and performance measurement across business and product lines asa basis for their analysis. These methodologies frequently incorporate different kinds ofvolatility-based measures that include a view of unexpected loss, along with more subjectivemeasures of risk. While many of these systems and methodologies are still in their early stages
BIS Review   32/19994and require refinement, I am encouraged by their development, and hope that the assessmentof capital adequacy will continue to be a primary focus of risk management at bankinginstitutions.The senior management of banks can take this further by evaluating not only the adequacy oftheir current capital levels, but also the appropriateness of their capital structure. Ideally, thisanalysis would lead to a process that integrates decisions about business strategy, risk profileand future capital needs.As banks become better at identifying and quantifying their risks, they should be wellpositioned to enhance risk disclosures and inform investors more fully. While bank investorsultimately bear the risks of the institution, too frequently they are not in a good position tomake knowledgeable business decisions about a bank’s prospects. Certainly, investors are lesswell informed than bank management. In many countries, accounting and disclosure standardsdo not provide users of financial statements with the necessary information to appropriatelyassess risks and determine soundness. A lack of transparency discourages capital fromflowing efficiently and, in effect, reduces or even destroys value.However, on a positive note, I am encouraged by progress in numerous countries to promotedisclosure and transparency, for instance with regard to non-performing loans. The BasleCommittee on Banking Supervision, the Committee on the Global Financial System, theInternational Accounting Standards Committee and other organizations have put forthinitiatives to enhance the relevance, reliability and comparability of information disclosed bythe financial sector. The most important initiatives will be those of national governments toapply these accounting and transparency frameworks, as well as the voluntary disclosures offinancial institutions.Now that I have discussed the changing risk environment and how banks are responding tothat challenge, let me turn to what this means for the current regulatory capital regime.Today, a major challenge for regulators is to develop capital standards that address morecomprehensively the full range of risks to which banking institutions are exposed. Thesestandards must also improve the differentiation among high-risk and low-risk exposures andbetween weak and strong institutions. Additionally, they must be flexible enough toaccommodate the risks of newer and emerging activities, some that I have mentioned today.As you know, the primary tool of capital regulation currently is the set of minimum capitalratios that were devised in 1988 by the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision. They wereset forth in an agreement known as the Basle Accord, and were adopted, among other reasons,to address the slide in international capital levels that was occurring over a decade ago. Whilethese ratios were relatively basic, they have proved very effective at achieving their goal overthe last decade.Over the years, risk management approaches have evolved rapidly, while the Basle Accordhas evolved relatively slowly. As market risk management techniques developed, we wereable to incorporate a state-of-the-art value-at-risk approach, in a 1996 Market RiskAmendment. As credit risk management techniques have advanced, and as a new discipline ofoperational risk has emerged, it has become apparent that the long-run relevance and efficacyof the Basle Accord is waning for the most sophisticated institutions.
5BIS Review   32/1999Supervisors have long known that analyzing simple capital ratios in isolation can lead toincorrect conclusions about the relative strengths of institutions. Thus, they also have relied ona review of banks’ capital plans and on market discipline to assess bank capital adequacy. Aswe go forward, banking supervisors are building a capital framework on these three pillars –capital supervision, capital regulation and market discipline – and we look to strengthen eachof them.Let me start with capital supervision. The cornerstone of supervisory review is the bank’sprocess for assessing its overall capital adequacy in relation to its risk profile and its strategyfor capital level and structure. Supervisors believe they should review and evaluate bank-internal capital adequacy assessments and strategies, in addition to bank compliance withregulatory capital ratios. The better the bank’s own capital adequacy assessment, the better thesupervisor will understand the bank’s capital strategy. Inevitably, this aspect takes on greaterimportance. For one reason, supervisors expect banks to operate above minimum regulatorycapital ratios included in the Basle Accord – and prudent assessments can help to inform byhow much. For another, supervisors seek to intervene early enough to prevent capital fromfalling below prudent levels – and bank assessments can provide another useful tool inidentifying key issues before they become major problems. With these thoughts in mind,supervisors are tackling the challenge of developing a more systematic approach to the reviewof capital adequacy.Supervisors also are discussing ways to enhance market-based discipline. Most agree thereshould be a greater role for private-sector monitoring of banks. Of course, there already existsa fair amount of market-based monitoring; however, the collection and use of these kinds ofinformation usually are not systematic or complete. The first goal is to improve informationavailable to the market. With enhanced risk disclosure, supervisors will be more able to relyon the opinion of market investors. These opinions are reflected quickly in the price of bankdebt and share prices, and the ease with which banks can access capital. By relying more onthese market signals, supervisors will be better able to identify and address waning capitallevels at problem institutions.To the extent banks develop disciplined internal approaches to evaluating capital adequacyand capital plans, and enhance disclosures, supervisors will be able to place greater relianceon all three pillars and meet the challenges of a more complex financial marketplace. Thecommon interest is to keep the Basle standards at a level sufficient to ensure financialsoundness, a minimum above which banks will choose to operate. To achieve this, we mustfashion a set of standards that does not greatly distort incentives.Supervisors acknowledge that the current regulations and ratios need to be updated to be moremeaningful, given the full range of risks banks face today. Supervisors are always challengedto keep pace with financial innovation and improvements in risk management practices, andthis suggests that we will need a frequent monitoring and maintenance program for the presentand future Accord.In closing, I would like to summarize the key supervisory objectives that we are mindful of aswe look to revise the Accord and enhance the overall capital framework. Our first objective,of course, is to promote the safety and soundness of the financial system. Our second is toenhance competitive equality, while allowing for differences among banks based on
BIS Review   32/19996differences in their risk profiles. These were the original goals of the Accord. Our third is todevelop standards that are fundamentally applicable to banks of varying levels of complexityand sophistication, including those in emerging market nations.In developing this capital framework over the next year, we plan to consult closely with thefinancial and supervisory community and communicate openly about our progress. By year-end, we hope to have made great strides in furthering our objectives. Clearly, beyond 2000, asound capital framework will help to ensure that banks are well positioned to face thechallenges and exciting opportunities that the new millennium has to offer.
1BIS Review   31/1999Bank of Japan’s March report of recent economic and financial developments1Bank of Japan, Communication, 16 March 1999.The Bank’s View2Japan’s economy, at present, appears to have stopped deteriorating. With the increase inpublic investment underpinning final demand, inventory adjustment has made further progressand production has stopped decreasing.With regard to final demand, business fixed investment has been declining significantly.Recovery in private consumption continues to be weak on the whole, although partialimprovement in sales of goods has been observed. Housing investment remains at a low levelbut has obviously bottomed out. Net exports (exports minus imports) are leveling off, andpublic investment is growing considerably. Reflecting this development of final demand andfurther progress in inventory adjustment, industrial production has stopped decreasing.However, corporate profits have been declining, and employment and household incomeconditions continue to deteriorate. Although conditions in corporate finance are improving,firms apparently cannot remove their concern about the availability of funds in the future.Consequently, corporate and household sentiment remains cautious.As for the outlook, with the progress in inventory adjustment gradually paving the way for arecovery in production, the government’s economic measures and the monetary easing by theBank would underpin the economy. In addition, measures to restore the stability of theJapanese financial system – especially the injection of public funds into banks – are expectedto exert positive effects on the economy gradually. With respect to corporate activities,however, large firms in particular appear to take steps to full-scale restructuring over fiscal1999, facing the continued decline in profits and the remaining concern about their financing.In the short run, such corporate restructuring may reduce fixed investment and discouragehousehold expenditure through the resulting deterioration in employment and incomeconditions. Under such circumstances, it is still difficult to expect an immediate, self-sustained recovery in private demand. Overall economic developments require carefulmonitoring in consideration of the above points.With regard to prices, reflecting the large output gap, domestic wholesale prices are on adowntrend, and corporate service prices are weakening. Consumer prices basically remainweak. In relation to price developments in the future, distinct narrowing in the output gap isunlikely for the time being even though the economy appears to have stopped deteriorating.Furthermore, the decline in wages and the appreciation of the yen since autumn 1998 arelikely to continue exerting downward pressure on prices. Hence, prices are expected to remainon a downtrend.In the financial markets, the additional monetary easing by the Bank on February 12 haslowered interest rates both on overnight call money and term instruments. In addition, themarkets’ anxiety about liquidity and credit risks of Japanese banks seems to have subsided –                                                     1 This report was written based on data and information available when the Bank of Japan Monetary PolicyMeeting was held on March 12, 1999.2 The Bank’s view on recent economic and financial developments, determined by the Policy Board at theMonetary Policy Meeting held on March 12, as the basis of monetary policy decisions.
BIS Review   31/19992as reflected in a rapid contraction in the Japan premium – partly due to the progress inpreparation for public funds injection.Meanwhile, the amount outstanding of funds in the call money market has decreased, partlybecause some institutional investors have shifted a part of their funds from the market toordinary deposits. The shrinkage of the market has not led to any difficulty in fundssettlement. However, close attention should be paid to developments in the flow of funds asunexpected changes may occur.Long-term interest rates have, amid nervous market sentiment, declined following the fall inshort-term rates. Stock prices have turned to be firm against the background of the recentdepreciation of the yen and the rise in U.S. stock prices.With regard to corporate finance, credit demand for economic activities such as fixedinvestment remains weak. Firms’ moves to increase their on-hand liquidity in the face ofdifficult fund-raising conditions are settling down. Meanwhile, private banks have basicallyretained their cautious lending stance, facing the worsening performance of borrowercompanies. However, severity in their fund-raising conditions has been alleviated, and theirinsufficient capital base is about to be increased. Under these circumstances, banks continueto actively utilize the credit guarantee system.As a result, the previously tightened credit conditions are easing somewhat. Nevertheless, themarket is still cautious of credit risk, and thus firms with relatively low credit ratings seem toremain under severe fund-raising conditions.The situation continues to warrant careful monitoring, particularly with regard to howcorporate finance develops toward the turn of the fiscal year.
1BIS Review   31/1999Mr Stals addresses the subject of inflation targeting as an anchor for monetary policy inSouth AfricaAddress by the Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, Dr Chris Stals, at a breakfastmeeting of the Johannesburg Branch of the Institute of Bankers in South Africa on 17 March1999.1. IntroductionThe debate on whether South Africa should formally introduce an inflation target as an anchorfor monetary policy recently revived again. Such targets were introduced by a number of othercountries over the past twenty years, in most cases with relatively good results. Amongst thesecountries can be mentioned New Zealand, Canada, Australia, Israel, Sweden, the CzechRepublic, Turkey and the United Kingdom. The new European Central Bank recently decidedto follow a more eclectic approach in which both the money supply and inflation will betargeted, with due recognition of an important role for a number of other monetary/financialaggregates in the process of inflation creation.In the case of South Africa, formal targeting of the M3 money supply was introduced in themid-1980’s to serve as an anchor for monetary policy. Like in many other countries, this basefor monetary policy served South Africa well for some years and made an importantcontribution towards the gradual reduction in the level of the rate of inflation from a well-embedded double-digit figure of between 12 and 20 per cent over a twenty-year period from1972 to 1993 to an average of well below 10 per cent over the past five years.  The use of themoney supply as an anchor for monetary policy is based on the assumption that there is somestable relationship over time between changes in the money supply and total spending ongoods and services and prices, that is inflation. Monetary policy is therefore directed towardscontrolling the rate of expansion in the total money supply as an intermediate objective, withthe ultimate goal of protecting the value of the currency. To achieve the intermediateobjective, the central bank uses various operational instruments such as open marketoperations, variable minimum cash reserve requirements and changes in the conditions ofdiscount window facilities to influence the amount of liquidity in the banking sector (supplyof money) and the level of short-term interest rates (demand for money).In this monetary policy model, the central bank therefore has an ultimate objective (to protectthe value of the currency), an intermediate objective (to control the money supply), asupportive objective (to influence the amount of bank credit extension) and a number ofoperational instruments that can be used to achieve the goals of monetary policy. It must bepointed out that, apart from the fairly generally accepted ultimate goal of protecting the valueof the currency, central banks can choose any one of the more important elements of themodel as an intermediate target for guiding their shorter-term decisions on monetary policy.Some central banks may prefer a target for total domestic bank credit extension (DCE); othersmay prefer more direct controls over the amount of liquidity in the banking sector; others mayset a more direct objective for the level of interest rates. Be that as it may, the monetary policymodel as described above is a consistent model in which fairly stable relationships existbetween the various components of the model. Whatever element may be chosen as an anchorfor monetary policy, the other components of the model cannot and should not be ignored.
BIS Review   31/199922. Moving from an intermediate objective to the ultimate objective of monetary policyIn South Africa, like in many other countries with a comparable experience of economicdevelopment, changes in the money supply in recent years lost some of their usefulness as ananchor for monetary policy, and as an intermediate objective for achieving the ultimate goal ofprotecting the value of the currency. This has happened, as in many other countries, mainlybecause of a major liberalisation of the financial markets, a huge increase in the volume oftransactions in the money and capital markets, and an opening-up of the country forinternational participation, not only in respect of trade, but also for the inward and the outwardmovement of capital across international borders.In the process, huge increases in the money supply occurred that were not related directly (orindirectly) to total spending on real goods and services. In technical terms, the additionalmoney supply remained in financial circulation and was reflected in a large decline in theincome velocity of circulation of the money supply. More money became available for everyone unit of goods and services produced in the country. And yet, these increases in the moneysupply did not lead to increases in the rate of inflation. On the contrary, inflation in SouthAfrica remained on a steady downward path, interrupted only by the adverse effects of theexchange rate depreciations of 1996 and 1998.Reserve Bank guidelines for an acceptable rate of increase in the money supply, based on theobjective of a gradual reduction in the rate of inflation and providing for a desirable butrealistic rate of growth in real economic activity, were overshot by a substantial margin duringeach of the past four years. Taking account of developments in the financial markets, and theacknowledgement of a growing need for more money to service the growing volumes offinancial market transactions, the Reserve Bank remained indulgent about these “excessive”increases in the money supply, as long as inflation continued to decline gradually.These developments, however, impinged on the credibility of the continued use of M3 as theintermediate target of monetary policy in South Africa, and opened up the way forunreasonable criticism of monetary policy decisions taken by the Reserve Bank. After morethan four years of a persistent “excessive” growth in M3, with a clear downward trend ininflation at the same time, the question has arisen whether the time has not come for SouthAfrica to follow the example set by many other countries and to switch from a money supplyanchor for monetary policy to a more direct targeting of the ultimate goal, that is, inflation inits own right.In many statements made since 1997, the Reserve Bank has expressed its support forgradually moving towards this new approach. In the annual monetary policy statements issuedby the Bank in March 1998 and again in March 1999, the Bank indeed distinctly movedtowards what it referred to as “informal” inflation targets. The view was expressed that thisnew approach was indeed more clearly linked to the directive contained in the Constitution ofthe Republic of South Africa in terms of which the Reserve Bank has been tasked with theresponsibility of protecting the South African rand in the interest of economic development inthe country.The Bank has always held the view that, in the case of South Africa, it is essential that theGovernment through the Minister of Finance should endorse Reserve Bank targets oralternatively set quantitative inflation targets together with the Reserve Bank for the Bank topursue. Inflation expectations play a major part in the ongoing inflation process, and a
3BIS Review   31/1999commitment by not only the Reserve Bank but also Government to lower inflation will addcredibility to a resolute and collective objective of bringing inflation in South Africa in linewith the relatively low levels that now apply in most other countries of the world.A recent view expressed by the Minister of Finance that South Africa should consider thepossibility of introducing inflation targeting, fuelled renewed speculation on the possibility ofsuch a move in the near future. The ignorance revealed about inflation targeting in thesubsequent public debate exposed once again the need for a better understanding of theintricate process of inflation in a modern economy. It is often overlooked, for example, thatinflationary pressures can be created in many sectors of the economy and, if not depressed atsource, can require draconian monetary policy measures to avoid monetary accommodation,with a continuing process of vicious inflationary circles that can harm the country for a longtime.It is also a fallacy to believe that a switch from money supply to inflation targeting will enableSouth Africa to have lower interest rates almost instantaneously. Taking account once again ofthe intimate relationships that exist between the various components of the monetary policymodel, there is but little difference between inflation targeting and money supply guidelines(or for that matter a DCE, liquidity or interest rate anchor for monetary policy). Interest rateswill only decline to a lower level once inflation has been reduced on a sustainable basis to alower level, and expectations about higher inflation in future have been eliminated withsuccess from the minds of the majority of economic agents.3. Introducing inflation targetsThe introduction of inflation targeting is no easy task. Apart from the question of who shouldbe responsible for the establishment of the target, the following questions must also beanswered:How should inflation be measured?Although it is widely accepted that some form of a cost-of-living index or a consumer priceindex should be used for this purpose, there is no consensus on how exactly inflation shouldbe measured ideally for the purpose of implementing monetary policy. One of the majordeficiencies of any kind of price index for this purpose is that the statistics are based on pastconsumption expenditure, and do not take account of possible future purchases – a deficiencythat does not apply to money supply targeting, where accumulated money balances form partof the base aggregate.At what level or range should the target be set?“The purpose of an inflation target is to provide the central bank with a rule for makingmonetary policy decisions. For that purpose, a target band is not necessary: a single pointtarget is sufficient” (William A. Allen: Inflation Targeting: The British Experience, a Bank ofEngland publication). A fixed point, however, is much more difficult to hit than stayingwithin a range. Moving within a band also leaves some discretion to the central bank and canalso provide more flexibility in the case of unforeseeable future price shocks.What models should be used for forecasting inflation?
BIS Review   31/19994It must be understood that inflation targeting is about the future. Any monetary policydecision implemented today, for example a decision to raise interest rates, will normally onlyaffect actual measured inflation with a time lag of, say, twelve to eighteen months (or evenlonger in some countries). Inflation targets can therefore only be set in a forward-lookingmodel that takes account of long-delayed effects. A reliable system for forecasting futureinflation therefore becomes an essential precondition for any monetary policy model based oninflation targeting.To what extent should inflation targeting be concerned with asset price inflation?It is well-known that the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in the UnitedStates of America is always concerned about the dangers of financial and property asset priceinflation, and of the risk of a “bursting bubble”. The experience of Japan in the late 1980’scan be quoted, where measured consumer price inflation never exceeded 4 per cent perannum, and yet excessive increases in bank credit extension and the money supply createdunrealistic asset prices. Eventually, when the bubble burst, the total Japanese economycollapsed.4. ConclusionIt is mainly for these reasons that many countries still prefer to stick to a more controllableintermediate target such as M3 or DCE, rather than the more complex and difficult inflationtargets. South Africa’s expressed intentions to move towards inflation targeting therefore needcareful preparation. The Reserve Bank is in the process of improving its techniques offorecasting inflation, and continues to analyse the changing relationships that are nowemerging in the new situation between the various components of the monetary policy model.Reference should, in conclusion, be made to a third alternative in addition to intermediatetargets, such as the money supply and inflation targeting, that can also be considered bycountries as an anchor for monetary policy, and that is explicit targeting of the exchange rateof the currency. Countries such as Argentina, Hong Kong and the People’s Republic of Chinahave opted for this alternative with a reasonable measure of success. There are, however,many reasons why this option is not regarded as appropriate for the present South Africansituation. Suffice it to say that, in the macroeconomic monetary policy model used by theReserve Bank, the exchange rate is included as an important element in the comprehensivemodel, but it comes out as a result of the policy process, and not as an independent objective.
1BIS Review   29/1999Mr Schieber looks at the significance of the euro for Germany and the BundesbankSpeech by Mr Helmut Schieber, a Member of the Board of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at theEuro-Forum hosted by the Club de Banqueros, Mexico, on 10 March 1999.- I -The entry of eleven countries into Stage Three of European monetary union on January 1,1999 has introduced a new era of monetary policy in Europe. Germany is one of the initialparticipants and has, since the beginning of the year, subordinated itself – abdicating asovereign right in the process – to the single monetary policy of a supranational central bank.In the following, I will look at the opportunities as well as the problems and risks of monetaryunion from the German point of view, and especially from the point of view of theBundesbank.- II -The decision to participate in European monetary union was especially difficult for Germany.On the one hand, the European unification process has had Germany’s broad political supportsince the end of World War II. The integration successes achieved in Europe since the 1950swere mainly in the economic sector. From the development of the European Coal and SteelCommunity in 1951 to the founding of the European Economic Community and the creationof the single market to the establishment of the European Monetary System and the signing ofthe Maastricht Treaty, Germany has always been a motor of European union.On the other hand, Germany found it very difficult to part with the Deutsche Mark. TheDeutsche Mark was a symbol of the “economic miracle” of the post-war era and of Germany’sself-image as a nation. Germany’s increasing importance in Europe and the world is reflectedin particular by the ascent of the Deutsche Mark to the second most important internationalreserve, transaction and investment currency after the US dollar. This explains the particularlycritical dialogue among politicians, in public as well as in business and finance in Germany,concerning the path to EMU laid down by the EC Treaty. The debate centred around concernsthat monetary stability would be jeopardised. Stability ranks extremely high in Germany’sorder of priorities, with hyperinflation having wiped out the currency twice this century,followed by currency reforms and their horrible political, social and economic consequences.Against this background, the debate on economic and fiscal convergence and the group ofparticipating countries was especially heated in Germany.- III -Now, a good two months after the changeover to the euro, initial experience with the newcurrency in the international financial markets can be evaluated. The changeover to StageThree of EMU, which posed an extraordinary technical and operational challenge to allfinancial market participants, was an unqualified success. Despite the technically complextask at hand, there were no serious malfunctions. Much to the relief of the financial marketparticipants, the convergence of interest and exchange rates took place even before the eurowas launched. The speculative attacks against the euro which many people were afraid would
BIS Review   29/19992happen did not come to pass. The money market rates converged towards the low level of thecore countries, which was set by means of the coordinated interest rate reduction by thecentral banks of the Eurosystem in December 1998. All in all, the smooth transition from thenational currencies to the euro can be regarded as a sign of the high quality of the preparationsmade by the central banks and the private financial market participants – and as publicrecognition of the hitherto successful convergence process of the partner countries.- IV -Confidence in the role and the work of the ECB is rising within the German population. Thedecision to locate the European Central Bank in Frankfurt and the composition of theGoverning Council with Wim Duisenberg as President stand for a tradition of stability-oriented monetary policy. After all, the institutional regulatory system of the Eurosystem wasmodelled on that of the Bundesbank. The establishment of an independent European Systemof Central Banks unmistakably dedicated to the goal of price stability was of the utmostimportance for German residents and politicians. Like the Bundesbank Act, the MaastrichtTreaty only envisages supporting the general economic policy of member states provided thisdoes not prejudice the objective of price stability.The Governing Council of the ECB has thoroughly discussed its monetary policy approachand subsequently presented and explained the results in detail to the public. The ECB hasmade it plain that – in line with its mandate – it shall pursue neither an exchange-rate-orientedmonetary policy nor an anticyclical monetary policy. Exchange rates and the business cyclewill certainly be carefully observed, analysed and taken into consideration in the decision-making process, but they do not determine the general orientation of the ECB’s monetarypolicy. Rather, monetary stability as the primary goal of the ECB shall be ensured byregulating the growth of the money stock, with the aid of interest rate policy, in a way that, onthe one hand, enables the full exploitation of the available scope for growth and, on the other,prevents inflationary developments.Here, it becomes evident that as far as the intention of the ECB is concerned, the strategychosen is similar to that of the Bundesbank. In the light of the uncertainty prevailing in thenew currency area, at least at the beginning, however, the Governing Council of the ECB hasnot set an explicit monetary target, but rather confined itself to determining and releasing asomewhat less binding reference value. Anyway, and as a reassurance to the politiciansworried about the business cycle, this type of monetary policy has an automatic and clearlyanticyclical component.Looking at the Eurosystem’s monetary policy instruments and procedures, there are alsostrong parallels to the instruments of the Bundesbank.All in all, it is apparent that both the institutional and organisational structure of theEurosystem and the choice of the monetary policy strategy and instruments have contributedto achieving continuity in monetary policy. The stock of confidence gained by the ECB hashelped to limit the prevailing fears and doubts concerning EMU, especially in Germany, sothat today more and more residents are regarding the European Central Bank as a worthysuccessor to the Bundesbank.- V -
3BIS Review   29/1999What, then, are Germany’s expectations of the transition to a single currency in Europe?Much has been written and debated about the opportunities and risks of this step: theintroduction of the euro is certainly more than simply exchanging one medium of payment foranother. The euro will no doubt also have real economic consequences, and it constitutes anew element in the international monetary system.European monetary union eliminates exchange rate fluctuations among the currencies of theparticipating countries, thus doing away with a substantial element of volatility anduncertainty. Costly hedging operations against exchange rate fluctuations and high exchangecosts have become obsolete; cross-border trade can expand without being held back bycurrency market uncertainties, therefore stimulating the real economy. Large enterprises andfinancial institutions, in particular, are hoping that the elimination of foreign exchange raterisks and the direct price comparison of input and output factors will present new marketopportunities. This home base free of monetary uncertainties presents great advantages,especially for the German economy, because more than half of all German exports go to ourEuropean neighbours.It is therefore somewhat difficult to understand why a new debate has erupted just now in theeuro area on the fixing of foreign exchange rates between the large currency blocs. Stableexchange rates are the result of a stability-oriented monetary and fiscal policy and cannot beachieved by interventions. If the central banks were assigned an exchange rate target inaddition to the objective of price stability, considerable conflicts could arise between thesetwo objectives, a point that has been proved especially by events in Asia and Latin Americaover the past few years.Of course, this does not imply that exchange rate developments must not be carefullymonitored and taken into consideration while shaping monetary policy. The exchange ratesare an important element of inflation forecasting because they help determine the climate ofstability through the import prices, and the state of business activity through foreign trade.Therefore exchange rates must be taken into account when considering monetary policy(alongside the dominant role of monetary growth), yet must not serve as an end unto itself.- VI -Whether the introduction of the euro will, over the medium term, result in a rearrangement ofthe international currency interrelations depends considerably on whether the euro will be ableto achieve a stronger position in the international monetary system than the sum of the elevenmember currencies. From the present perspective, it is not possible to give a definite answer tothis question. In terms of population, economic performance, and their respective share ofworld trade, the euro area and the US are very similar. Only the use of the euro as atransaction, investment and reserve currency will indicate future developments. This areapresents a large scope for growth for the euro because the previous European currencies wererelatively underrepresented, in comparison to the US dollar, in all of the above uses.The creation of a common European financial market, in particular, promises a huge potentialfor the euro’s growth. Broader and deeper market structures, high levels of liquidity andtransparency and expected increases in efficiency are attracting international investors andissuers. To be sure, the rupturing of monetary segmentations will not automatically create afully harmonised capital market in Europe. There will continue to be differences regarding the
BIS Review   29/19994established structures. However, the innovation process begun in the past few years atfinancial institutions and in the financial markets shows that all parties concerned haverecognised the challenge and are rising to it.- VII -The introduction of the euro alone is no guarantee, however, of the positive developments Ihave described. Rather, this raises the question of what problems and risks monetary unionharbours, seen from the German perspective. Extraordinary developments in economicactivity or structural circumstances such as different cost trends for wages, taxes and socialsecurity contributions, different manufacturing structures, diverging trends in corporatefinancing and differences in the national transmission channels of monetary policy can alterthe effect of monetary policy measures on the real economy. In future, under a commonexchange rate and monetary policy with identical official interest rates and an identicalliquidity supply, these differences among the participating countries can only be countered bymeans of flexible national fiscal, structural and wage policy measures.It is, of course, tempting for the politicians and social partners, caught up in their many dailyconflicts and confrontations, to call for a more expansionary monetary policy, as this willseemingly enable an easier solution of conflicts. Yet monetary stability is – especially fromthe German perspective – precisely the purpose and worth of an independent central bankinsulated from the multitude of political conflicts, as has been so convincingly laid down inthe Maastricht Treaty. Solving problems at the expense of monetary stability is invariably anexercise in self-deception, with many counterproductive results. Inflationary monetary policyexacerbates growth and employment problems instead of solving them, at least over themedium term.The unbearably high unemployment rate in large parts of Europe presents the key economicpolicy problem from the German perspective, too. A full employment equilibrium in theparticipating countries is characterised by varying national labour costs corresponding tonational labour productivity. Thus, a rapid equalisation of the nominal wages in theparticipating countries is not realistic, as the unemployment rate threatens to continue rising incountries which raise the wage level above the level of labour productivity. Increases innegotiated wages and settlements should therefore conform to the national employmentsituation and the growth rate of labour productivity. These considerations lead to theconclusion that it does not make sense to harmonise the pay-rate policies within Europe. Thiswould complicate the necessary variation of wages in the euro area and impair the necessaryflexibility of wage structures.Thus, for the euro to be a success, it is imperative that these inevitable consequences of thesingle currency be understood and accepted by all participating countries and that thenecessary measures be carried out. A single European monetary policy which cannot makeexceptions for special national developments and interests must be accepted and taken intoconsideration in the shaping of national economic and fiscal policy. The implementation of asupranational European monetary policy will be all the easier the more the independence ofthe European Central Bank is respected by the European bodies and especially by the residentsof the euro area. To a very large extent, the basic conditions for a stability-oriented monetarypolicy and an independent central bank in Europe have been fulfilled. It is now up to thosetaking action to determine how this framework is filled out and implemented. There is
5BIS Review   29/1999certainly cause for optimism. The governors of the participating central banks and theMembers of the Board are in accord that they must, from the beginning, operate asrepresentatives of the euro area and its single currency and not as advocates of their nations.- VIII -All in all, the euro has had a relatively smooth and promising start. Despite a trend toweakening on the foreign exchange market – due mainly to an increase in the spread ofinterest rates between Europe and the US – it has increasingly gained acceptance on thefinancial markets, but also among the residents.However, the range of questions and risks presented above shows that European monetaryunion, which does not go hand in hand with an adequate political union, is an unparalleledexperiment. For it to succeed, it will require a high degree of political discipline on the part ofall participants. Only the future can show whether giving up the Deutsche Mark for the eurowas, in the long run, the right decision.
1BIS Review  27/1999Mr McDonough comments on Capital Markets, Securities and Government SponsoredEnterprisesStatement by the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Mr William J.McDonough, before the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, U.S. House ofRepresentatives, Washington, D.C., on 3 March 1999.Good morning Chairmen Leach and Baker and members of the Subcommittee. When Iappeared before the full Committee in October, I spoke about the near-collapse of Long-TermCapital Management and the events leading up to the private-sector recapitalization of itsfund, Long-Term Capital Portfolio. At that time, I promised you that we would take a hardlook at the issues growing out of that experience, particularly as they affect ourresponsibilities as bank supervisors. I am pleased to appear before you today to report on thelessons we have learned and the actions we have taken to reduce the possibility that such anepisode could repeat itself in the future.As I indicated last fall, three issues require particular attention by banks and their supervisorsin the wake of LTCM. These are, first, the adequacy of banks’ credit analysis processes;second, the effectiveness of exposure measurement; and third, the role of stress testing ofcounterparty exposure. In my remarks today I will detail the substantial progress that has beenmade, both domestically and internationally, to address each of these supervisory concerns.But before I get into the details, let me say that I believe the LTCM episode and thesupervisory response to it is fundamentally about two things: leverage and good judgment.Leverage is a fact of life in our financial world, and is a key part of the risk-taking necessaryfor the creation of wealth. But sometimes banks go too far in extending credit to theircustomers and counterparties. That’ s where good judgment comes in. I know - - I’ ve beenthere. I was a commercial banker for 22 years before becoming President of the New YorkFed, and I can tell you that the most important decisions a banker makes are how to lend andto whom. Those decisions are not easy, and often involve many shades of gray. One of ouraims as supervisors should be to see that banks are using the right tools to make thosejudgments.The importance of these issues extends beyond banks and their supervisors. Sound creditpolicies and procedures are essential not only for the stability of individual banks, but also –and more importantly – for the health of the financial system and the economy as a whole.This is because banks play a pivotal role in our economy as providers of credit. If banks makepoor credit decisions with respect to a borrower, including a hedge fund like LTCM, thefinancial system and our economy will suffer.Basle Report FindingsAs you know, I chair the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision, comprised of banksupervisors from the G-10 countries who coordinate supervisory policy for internationallyactive banks. While the Committee does not have formal legal enforcement powers, itsconclusions and recommendations are widely implemented, both in G-10 countries and manyothers. In late January, the Committee issued a report dealing with the relationship between
BIS Review   27/19992banks and highly-leveraged institutions, or “HLIs”. The Committee’ s report provides aframework for addressing the broader issues raised by the LTCM episode, the policyresponses of supervisors, and some key risk management challenges for the banking industrygoing forward.In the United States, the Federal Reserve System, the New York State Banking Department,and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency have conducted target reviews of a numberof large-bank dealings with hedge funds. These reviews contributed to the Committee’ s work,to the Federal Reserve System’ s issuance on February 1 of new guidance to financialexaminers and banks, and to similar guidance from the Comptroller of the Currency issued inJanuary. These new standards emphasize the need for improvements in the credit riskmanagement process at banks. The new standards will likely be complemented by a study ofthe implications of the LTCM episode by the President’ s Working Group on FinancialMarkets.Because the Basle Committee’ s jurisdiction is limited to matters of banking supervision andregulation, its primary emphasis has been on ensuring that the major banks prudently managetheir risk exposures to HLIs. The best way to achieve this is through the adoption of soundpractices by the industry, perhaps supplemented by incentives created through capitalrequirements. While it is primarily the responsibility of each banking organization to manageits risks, sound practice standards give banks and supervisors a tool to measure industryprogress. If banks themselves do not follow sound practices, then supervisors must step in andtake the necessary action.The Committee’ s report revealed a number of deficiencies. In particular, the Committeeobserved an imbalance among the key elements of the credit risk management process, withtoo strong a reliance upon collateral. This undue emphasis, in turn, caused many banks toneglect other critical elements of effective credit risk management, including in-depth creditanalyses of counterparties, effective exposure measurement and management techniques, andthe use of stress testing.Credit Approval ProcessFor a bank to make sound lending decisions, it needs to obtain sufficient information aboutthe borrower. Supervisors routinely stress the need for banks to have an effective creditapproval process consisting of formal policies and procedures, accompanied bydocumentation of actual credit decisions. When dealing with an HLI, a bank also must obtaincomprehensive and timely financial information about that HLI’ s risk profile and creditquality, and it must engage in an ongoing credit analysis of that HLI. In addition, a bank musthave a clear understanding of an HLI’ s operations and risk management capabilities. TheCommittee observed weaknesses in each of these areas. Let me give a few examples.The Committee found that banks did not obtain sufficient financial information to allow for afull assessment of how much and what types of risk had been assumed by large HLIs. Inparticular, banks did not obtain the information needed to measure leverage. They also did nothave sufficient information to understand HLIs’ concentrations in particular markets and riskcategories, or their exposure to broad trading strategies.
3BIS Review   27/1999Similarly, banks generally did not sufficiently understand the ability of HLIs to manage theirrisks. Because risk profiles can change from one day to the next, or even from moment tomoment, it is necessary for a bank to be sure that the HLI can effectively manage its businessoperations and risks on an ongoing basis. In general, we did not find sufficient reviews ofHLIs’ risk management systems and their underlying assumptions, back office systems used tomanage daily operations such as collateral and liquidity, and the major accounting andvaluation policies.Exposure MeasurementThe Committee also thought that banks need to develop better measures for determining thecredit exposure resulting from different types of trading activities. In particular, banks mustdevelop more effective measures of what is called “potential future exposure.” Potential futureexposure measures the credit exposure between a counterparty and a bank, and how thisexposure could change in the future as market prices fluctuate. As we have seen, such pricemovements can be substantial during periods of market stress. The ability of banks to measurepotential future exposure is crucial when dealing with HLIs.Unfortunately, methods for calculating potential future exposure had not kept pace with thegrowth and complexity of HLIs. Banks’ potential future exposure measures have beenparticularly ineffective in measuring exposures not covered by collateral. For example, underhighly volatile market conditions, a bank’ s potential future exposure can grow beyond thevalue of any collateral. We expect the industry to develop more effective ways to measure andlimit potential future exposure, and supervisors will closely monitor progress to ensure thatthis occurs.Stress TestingThe Committee’ s report also shows that banks must develop measures that better account forcredit risk under highly volatile market conditions. This can be achieved through what we call“stress tests”, where a bank conducts “what if” analyses of how credit exposures to a singlecounterparty could grow under extreme market conditions. These might include a large rise orfall in interest rates, a major change in an exchange rate, or a flight to quality by investors. Inthe case of LTCM, stress testing could have given banks at least some warning of the types ofexposures they could have faced last fall. The critical importance of stress testing is notedvery explicitly in our new supervisory guidance.Sound Practice GuidanceThe sound practices document accompanying the Basle report presents an important set ofstandards that will guide both banks and their supervisors. It appears that banks generally havetightened the credit risk management standards for their HLI exposures since the collapse ofLTCM. However, it is important that supervisors try to ensure that progress continues.Memories tend to be short, and we want to make sure that as markets calm down, as they havein the past months, banks do not return to the old ways of doing business.The adoption and rigorous enforcement of enhanced risk management practices shouldcontribute substantially to limiting excessive risk-taking and leverage at HLIs. This is the casebecause HLIs cannot trade without access to financing and liquidity from banks and securities
BIS Review   27/19994firms. If each counterparty manages its risks appropriately, the chance of contagion to otherinstitutions and the financial markets more broadly would be reduced substantially. It is thisrisk of contagion and financial market instability that is the principal concern of central banksand supervisors.Along with other federal banking supervisors, the Federal Reserve has moved quickly toimplement the recommendations of the Basle Committee’ s report. As I mentioned earlier, werecently issued guidance to the institutions we supervise detailing sound risk managementpractices for the credit risk management of trading and derivatives activities. This documentidentifies the areas that our examiners will review during their examination of tradingactivities. It is important to note that the Federal Reserve’ s guidance to banks and examinerscovers not only HLI and hedge fund counterparties, but all other counterparty relationships.We want to ensure that banks carry forward the lessons of the LTCM experience to allpotentially high-risk trading activities.In this regard, our examiners will devote particular attention to the risks associated withrapidly growing, highly profitable and potentially high-risk activities and product lines. Theywill assess the adequacy of banks’ reviews of counterparty creditworthiness, exposuremeasurement and monitoring techniques, stress testing, limit setting, and the appropriate useof collateral and other credit enhancements. Our examiners will also look at internal policiesand the degree to which behavior conforms to stated policies. We have already conductedmeetings with the major banks to reinforce these messages and our examiners will conductfollow-up reviews in the course of this year.Other Possible Policy ResponsesOver the past few months, there has been significant debate about other measures that couldbe taken to limit the potential risks to the financial system arising from the activities of large,highly leveraged, unregulated financial institutions. The Basle Committee carefullyconsidered all the ideas that have surfaced. Our report discusses a variety of options beyondthe implementation of sound practice standards. One possibility is to require higher capitalcharges for bank exposures to HLIs. Indeed, a primary objective of our current review of theBasle Capital Accord is to determine how to align regulatory capital charges better with theeconomic risks of different classes of counterparties.We also recognize the critical need to enhance market transparency for the activities of HLIsand other major market participants. The Committee already is working to enhanceaccounting and disclosure practices at banking institutions worldwide. Extending these effortsto all global players that have the potential to destabilize the financial system, including HLIs,is of particular importance. An international group of central bankers is now studying variousapproaches to strengthening disclosure in this area.The Committee also considered the advantages and disadvantages of imposing directregulation on the HLI industry. There are a number of critical obstacles that would have to beovercome before a direct regulatory approach could be implemented. To be effective, anyregulation would have to extend to jurisdictions around the world where HLIs are chartered,some of which have more highly developed and more stringent supervisory structures thanothers. This would require a high level of coordination involving the political, legislative, andjudicial bodies of many countries. There is also the difficulty of establishing a regulatory
5BIS Review   27/1999regime for HLIs that is not easily circumvented. For these reasons, I believe the most practicalapproach is to focus on financial institutions’ lending activities, because such an approachoffers a near-term and cost-effective remedy to the systemic risks posed by HLIs.Challenges for the Banking IndustryI strongly believe that both the official and private sectors have important roles to play inaddressing the challenges arising from an increasingly complex and dynamic financialservices industry. First and foremost, we hold banks accountable for ensuring that soundcredit risk management standards are upheld and that these keep pace with financial marketinnovation. If competitive pressures lead to bad practices in one bank or the industry as awhole, our job as supervisors is to raise standards and ensure that sound practices are restored.In my remarks today, I highlighted a number of areas where progress has been made. Ofcourse, there is more work to be done by banks and supervisors. High on the agenda should bethe development of more meaningful measurement of risk exposure andthe implementation of effective stress-testing techniques. Another important area that requiresfurther industry attention is the measurement of leverage. Finally, I believe that the industryshould devote more thought to the appropriate valuation of positions during periods of marketstress and illiquidity – which is particularly relevant to the use of collateral to protect againstcredit risk.These are just some of the broader issues arising from the LTCM experience and the marketturbulence last fall. But I believe that we are meeting the challenge and have made quick andsignificant short-term progress.I look forward to your questions.
1BIS Review   26/1999Mr Kelly’s observations on Y2K compliance and the banking systemSpeech by Edward W Kelley, Jr, a member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem, to the Media Studies Center, New York, New York on 10 March 1999Good Morning. My thanks to the Media Studies Center and the Freedom Forum for inviting theFederal Reserve to participate in this meeting and, more important, for the initiative of sponsoring thisgathering to discuss what I believe to be a critically important topic. As you may know, I havedevoted a good deal of time to Y2K preparation over the last two years, and in that process I havetalked to a wide spectrum of people. I have reached the conclusion that, now that the country is at lastaggressively addressing the problem, the most important single element in our successfully navigatingthrough the challenges presented by the ‘millennium bug’ is how the public responds to it. There arevery few places in our national life where the statement that ‘attitude can affect outcomes’ is socompellingly demonstrated as in the banking sector, particularly as we work to address Y2K.You will no doubt agree that the best way to engender a strong and positive public attitude is throughopen and candid discussion, which I would like to encourage by briefly addressing three keyquestions. First, what are the critical components of public confidence in the banking system, and howare the industry, its regulators, and the central bank working to earn public trust in the Y2K context?Second, what are we confident about and what are we concerned about? When the media assesses thefinancial risk element of the Y2K story, these may be appropriate places to start. And finally, what dowe hope the media will do in the coming months?I believe there are four important elements needed for public confidence in banks and the bankingsystem, and each is being addressed as we prepare for potential Y2K problems. Bank customers needto be assured• of ready access to cash and other funds and bank services• that their bank records are secure• that competent and energetic government supervision is being conducted• that deposit insurance is in place and inviolateI want to elaborate on these elements because I believe that public understanding of the bankingindustry’s Y2K preparations will help maintain public confidence.First, cash availability. We do not see any need for a vast surge in demand for cash late this year, butif that should occur, it is the Federal Reserve’s responsibility to have available whatever may berequired, and that responsibility will be met. An array of preparations are being made that will ensurecurrency will be available as needed in Federal Reserve vaults. The biggest challenge we face isgetting it to the right place at the right time, and extensive advance planning is under way for that aswell.Concerning the availability of other funds and bank services, including assurance that customerrecords are secure, the federal bank supervisory authorities – of which the Fed is one – are nowcompleting their second inspection of every bank and thrift, some 10,600 institutions. Any problembanks, and all banks identified as keys to systemic safety, will receive additional scrutiny throughoutthis year. We are inspecting to be certain that precisely those matters I just mentioned are beingaddressed. The overwhelming majority of institutions are reported by our examiners to be doing athorough preparatory job, and they will be fully ready well in advance of December 31, 1999. Acompetent and energetic supervisory presence is at work, providing not only oversight, but assistanceand advice with testing, contingency plans, customer relations, and so forth.Last but not least, the FDIC is fully prepared, and depositors are dependably insured to up to$100,000 per deposit.
BIS Review   26/19992No one can say there won’t be glitches, but all of this gives us a great deal of confidence that thebanking sector will be ready. To repeat, we are confident that the overwhelming majority of banks arecarefully and thoroughly preparing themselves and that, even if problems should arise, they can andwill be readily handled, and that the financial system will not seize up or crash. A guarantee? No. Aneducated confidence? Yes. Our hope is that the media will carefully check out these assertions and, ifthey prove to be reasonable, report the story that way.There are concerns, of course. Even though banks themselves are ready, other essential parts of ourinfrastructure with which banks are interdependent may be less so. The challenges posed by Y2K tothe smooth operation of our computer-driven society are so ubiquitous and interrelated that it is quitepossible that not everything will be fixed that needs to be fixed in advance of December 31. Morethan anything else this is a race with time. There is so much work to do that there may not be enoughtime left for everyone to complete all of the tasks that they well know need to be completed. We don’thave as much information about preparations internationally, and some countries are apparently onlynow beginning to seriously address the issue. We do not believe this will seriously affect worldwidefinancial activity, but it could result in some disruptions abroad.These concerns make contingency planning crucial across all of our economy, but they are all mattersthat we know, at least in the technical sense, how to address. From our vantage point, anotherimportant concern is the possibility of our citizenry becoming so overly worried about what mighthappen that there could be created the very type of problem we are working so hard to prevent.Many people would like to have an ironclad guarantee that there will be no Y2K disruption, but thatguarantee is simply not available. We cannot know in advance exactly how the millennium rolloverwill go. The truth is that no one can guarantee that everything will work perfectly even later thismorning, but we do have every confidence that it will. That should be a message of reassurance, notof concern, and it is a good perspective on Y2K. Public confidence does not require that everyonebelieve that everything will always work perfectly. People know that is not the case. Rather the publicneeds to be confident that the information it is receiving is complete, reliable, and adequate enoughfor them to take actions appropriate to their own circumstances. If given this information, we haveconfidence that the public will keep the Y2K rollover in perspective, realizing it is one morechallenge we as a nation will meet.In closing, let me spend a moment on my thoughts about what the media might consider as this storyis reported over the next 10 months. This is a rapidly evolving situation, and demands of those whocover it an ongoing commitment to staying on top of developments, as facts here have a very shorthalf-life. A given condition of preparedness observed even a few weeks ago is quite likely differenttoday. No one should be a ‘Pollyanna’ about Y2K but, based on the huge amount of work being doneto prepare, it is just not responsible to be a ‘Chicken Little’ either. We do not expect the sky to fall.Let’s not let ‘experts’ make unproved assertions, or offer personal opinions as facts, withoutchallenging the basis for them. And let’s not treat isolated events as if they were a broadly generalreality.There is much work to be done in local communities and we hope the media will be a powerful voicein urging the public to seek legitimate information, maintain perspective, and act with common sense.Suggest calm attentiveness to preparations. Provide ‘how to’ pointers and advice. Focus oncontingency planning. Suggest and highlight sensible actions by small businesses. Encouragecommunity leadership. Promote education about the problem. Hold opinion leaders and publicservices providers accountable for accurate, consistent flows of information. Accept that certainthings are unknowable and do not agonize over that – we deal with uncertainties every day withoutloss of confidence. If glitches occur or problems loom, report fully on them of course, but make sureto place the problem in an appropriate context. Balance and perspective are key.
3BIS Review   26/1999Y2K gives reporters an extraordinary opportunity to do what they do best – learn the facts, weigh theevidence, and inform the public. You have a nation of attentive readers and listeners who very muchtrust your expertise, and who will prepare for the rollover with your perspective in mind. Completeand reliable information is every bit as important to our country’s success in preparing for Y2K as isall of the technical work being done.
1BIS Review   25/1999Mr Duisenberg reports on the latest meeting of the ECB Governing Council on 4 March 1999Introductory statement by the President of the European Central Bank, Mr W F Duisenberg, at thepress conference in Frankfurt/Main on 4/3/99.Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here today to report on the outcome of today’smeetings of the Governing Council and of the General Council of the European Central Bank.Let me start with the Governing Council’s discussion on recent economic developments and thedecisions that the Governing Council has taken today in the field of monetary policy.After a comprehensive and careful examination of recent trends and ongoing evaluations of theeconomic outlook for the euro area economy, there was consensus that some of the risks identifiedearlier, in particular with regard to real GDP growth, had materialised in the fourth quarter of 1998.There was also consensus that the impact of these developments on the balance of risks for pricestability would need to be examined further in the context of the monetary policy strategy adopted bythe Eurosystem. At this juncture, taking into account all the information available, the GoverningCouncil confirmed its earlier assessment of the outlook for price stability. Against this background itdecided that for the main refinancing operations to be settled on 10 and 17 March 1999 the sameconditions will apply as for the previous one, i.e. they will be fixed rate tenders conducted at aninterest rate of 3.0%. In addition, the interest rate on the marginal lending facility will continue to be4.5% and the interest rate on the deposit facility will remain 2.0%.Let me report in some more detail on the Governing Council’s deliberations, and thereby provideexplanations for the decisions we took today.Starting with the monetary developments in the euro area at the start of Stage Three of EMU, thebroad monetary aggregate M3 expanded at an annual rate of 5.7% in January 1999, against 4.5% inDecember 1998. This upturn was largely due to an acceleration in overnight deposits. This, in turn,may be explained by the low level of interest rates, which also contributed to credit to the privatesector to accelerate further in January 1999 to 9.4% which is particularly notable as other indicatorsof the economy are signalling a slowdown in activity.Monthly data on monetary aggregates can be volatile. M3 growth is therefore monitored on the basisof three-month moving averages of the 12-month growth rate of M3, which stood at 4.9% in theperiod from November 1998 to January 1999. This was 0.2 percentage point higher than the figurerecorded in the previous three-month period and is 0.4 percentage point above the reference value of4½%. Against this background and in view of the uncertainty relating to special factors pertaining tothe changeover to the Stage Three environment and the introduction of the euro, the GoverningCouncil does not consider the acceleration of M3 at the start of Stage Three as a signal of futureinflationary pressures. However, a close monitoring of monetary developments in the coming monthsremains necessary to give more conclusive evidence of the underlying causes and the permanent ortemporary nature of the rise in M3 growth.Turning to financial indicators, euro area capital markets underwent a correction in February, whichwas mainly linked to spillovers from the United States and Japan. This followed a decline in long-term interest rates in January which had brought bond yields in the euro area to the lowest levels seensince the late 1940s. The euro area yield curve shifted upwards across the entire maturity spectrumduring February. Let me also point out that the nominal effective exchange rate of the euro area inearly March stood around 1% below its level on 1 February and around 4% below its starting level on4 January 1999.At the same time, recent developments appear to have led to a reduction in some of the uncertaintiessurrounding the evolution of the world economy in 1999. This mainly relates to the strong
BIS Review   25/19992performance of the US economy, but may also be due to signs of improvement in the real economiesof some Asian countries. Nevertheless, in the view of the Governing Council, it is too early for a trulyfavourable assessment of the external environment for the euro area. Risks pertaining to externalimbalances, continuing risk aversion and the corresponding weakness of private long-term capitalflows and real investment to emerging market economies will need to be examined closely.In the euro area the latest indicators confirm that those risks which were identified earlier have nowmaterialised to some extent. According to preliminary and incomplete data from national sources, realGDP growth in the euro area weakened in the fourth quarter of 1998 when compared with theprevious quarter. While more precise estimates will soon become available from Eurostat, theevidence available suggests that activity in the euro area has been slowing down in recent months.This is particularly apparent in the production of the manufacturing sector, where output in the fourthquarter of 1998 fell by almost 1% compared with the previous quarter. These developments broadlyconfirm the pattern observed earlier in industrial confidence, which was on a declining trend in thesecond half of 1998. The latest data on industrial confidence in the euro area, i.e. those released bythe European Commission today, indicate that industrial confidence has weakened further. Somerecent wage developments in the euro area might have contributed to that. The level of unemploymenthas remained more or less unchanged over the past four months. Finally, consumer confidence in theeuro area has remained unchanged from the high levels seen at the beginning of the year. With regardto capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector, which fell further in the fourth quarter of 1998, andretail sales, which up to November 1998 pointed towards broadly sustained growth, no new data areyet available.Overall, with regard to the cyclical situation, recent data confirm our earlier expectations that thereare still downside risks for output growth. The Governing Council will continue its thorough analysisand very close monitoring of underlying trends and review its broad outlook for the euro areaaccordingly on an ongoing basis, taking into account in a forward-looking manner the impact of bothdomestic and external developments.With regard to the latest data on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), the annualincrease for January 1999 was 0.8%, which is unchanged compared with the previous two months(taking account of the most recent revisions). Looking at a breakdown of the HICP, a slight decline inthe rate of increase in service prices (from 1.9% in December 1998 to 1.8% in January 1999) wasoffset by a slight increase in goods prices (from 0.1% to 0.2%). The fall in the rate of change inservices prices was mainly due to lower price increases for transport and communications; this mayhave been a reflection of increased competition in these sectors. On the other hand, downwardpressure from energy prices on goods prices diminished somewhat.On balance, the current data continue to suggest that there are no significant upward or downwardpressures on prices in the short term. The pattern of risks to price stability has also remained broadlyunchanged on balance. On the upward side, wage developments are a matter of concern, as would beany loosening of fiscal policies and the implications of this for achieving the objectives laid down inthe Stability and Growth Pact. In addition, recent exchange rate trends need to be monitored closelyalso in terms of their impact on prices. Concerning downward risks, in particular the slowdown in theeuro area economy is a cause for concern. In conclusion, taking the latest available evidence intoaccount, at today’s meeting the Governing Council confirmed its assessment regarding the outlook forprice developments. The Governing Council therefore decided to keep ECB interest rates unchangedat the levels currently prevailing.I should now like to inform you about some other matters considered today.The auction technique for the longer-term refinancing operations was reviewed by the GoverningCouncil today. In its first two longer-term refinancing operations (settled on 14 January and 25February 1999), which are as a rule conducted by means of variable rate tenders, the Eurosystem
3BIS Review   25/1999applied the single rate (“Dutch”) method of allotment. The single rate method was chosen in order toencourage less experienced counterparties to participate in the tender. The Governing Council takesthe view that all interested counterparties should by now be sufficiently accustomed to the longer-term refinancing operation also to be in a position to participate in this type of operation under themore market-oriented multiple rate (“American”) method of allotment. Against this background, theGoverning Council has decided that the multiple rate method of allotment will be applied startingfrom the next longer-term refinancing operation (to be settled on 25 March 1999), until otherwiseindicated.Finally, let me inform you that the General Council today discussed the monetary policies of thecentral banks of the non-participating Member States against the background of the monetary policyset by the Eurosystem. As you will know, the General Council has taken over those tasks of theEuropean Monetary Institute (EMI) which still have to be performed during Stage Three because ofthe derogations of some Member States. One of these tasks relates to strengthening the co-ordinationof the monetary policies in the Community with the aim of ensuring price stability. The GeneralCouncil intends to conduct these co-ordination exercises biannually in future.
1BIS Review   23/1999Mr Bäckström looks at the Riksbank and financial system stability and comments onthe LTCM caseSpeech by Mr Urban Bäckström, Governor of Sveriges Riksbank, to the Swedish EconomicsAssociation in Stockholm on 25/2/99.Financial stability is a topical subject in the light of events in the past year(cid:190)a year that sawcontinued financial problems in Asia, the devaluation of the rouble and suspended paymentsin Russia, considerable turbulence in western financial markets and financial unrest in Brazil.What happened last autumn, when it was considered that problems for a single player(cid:190)thehedge fund Long Term Capital Management(cid:190)might create grave difficulties for the financialsystem in the United States, highlighted risks of a new type. The LTCM case can be seen bothas an extreme example of what could happen in Sweden’s financial markets and as a seriousreminder that the continuous development of financial markets is liable to give rise to newrisks. The suspension of payments in Russia and its consequences should likewise lead us toreflect on the risks in the system.Today I shall be discussing the problems behind last autumn’s events in the U.S. market andthe fact that a systemic crisis was judged to be imminent. First, however, I shall briefly sketchthe background and explain stability’s central importance for the Riksbank.BackgroundThere is nothing new about financial crises. Over the centuries they have repeatedly hitfinancial systems in the industrialised world, as well as in less developed countries.A classic example is the tulipmania in the Netherlands, which ended in 1636 with the collapseof the market for tulip options. From the tulip crisis it is also clear that derivative instrumentsare not a recent innovation in financial markets. The world also saw numerous financial crisesin the nineteenth century. As for the present century, what first comes to mind is the crisis inthe wake of the stock-market crash in New York in 1929, with effects that left their mark onthe global economy in the 1930s. There are various explanations for the Great Depression butit clearly involved widespread financial turbulence and the failure of many banks. In Sweden,too, there were serious bank crises in the early 1920s and ’30s; on both occasions they wereaccompanied by a deep economic depression and serious deflation. The drop in output and theprice level reached two-digit figures before the problems could be overcome.In recent years the pace of financial market development has been rapid. As a result ofinnovations in communications and information technology, with the new instruments andmethods they provide for risk management, the financial system is now more extensive andglobalised than ever before. The system channels savings more effectively to those activitiesin the global economy that need them most.The rapid pace of financial developments and their internationalisation are a logicalconsequence of arrangements for the production and international exchange of goods andservices in the world economy. To cope with these arrangements, firms and households haverequired new financing facilities. The developments also stem from a deliberate post-wartrend in economic policy(cid:190)trade barriers have been removed and tariffs abolished. There areno grounds for supposing that the benefits from labour specialisation have been exhausted.
BIS Review   23/19992The ongoing globalisation of the production of goods and services, with increasedinternational trade, calls for continued development and internationalisation of the financialsystem.However, just because the financial system channels savings and spreads risks moreefficiently today, it naturally does not follow that it functions sufficiently well in everyrespect. The recurrent financial crises are at least an indication of this. To some extent theproblems may have stemmed from uncertainty about the future price trend in financialmarkets. But political errors or faulty risk assessments among market players may also haveplayed a part.While the crises in recent years have arisen in different ways, they all demonstrate theimportant part that a properly functioning financial system plays for a good real economicdevelopment. There have been some instances where a global increase in financial marketunrest has arisen from a sudden deterioration in the macroeconomic conditions for a particularcountry. Last autumn, however, the causal relationships of the events in financial markets inthe industrialised world were the opposite(cid:190)it was problems in the financial markets thatengendered fears of a serious shock to much of the global economy.The Riksbank and financial stabilityMuch work is being done with a view to avoiding financial crises. The Riksbank is one of theparticipants in these endeavours. Our efforts have included the development of an intellectualframework for contributions to improving the stability of Sweden’s payment system. In recentyears it has become increasingly clear that the Riksbank has a main function that is probablyjust as important as maintaining price stability, namely promoting financial stability.The financial system has a central function in the economy and performs three main tasks:firstly, it handles payments; secondly, it channels savings to investments with a good returnfor future consumption; and thirdly, it spreads and reduces economic risks in relation to theplayers’ required returns.A smooth functioning of all these activities facilitates economic growth in that the productionof goods and services as well as employment are promoted by lower costs and risks. In thisway the financial system contributes to increased prosperity.In view of the financial sector’s central function in the economy, the authorities areparticularly active in monitoring and regulating developments in this sector. In Sweden, thework for financial stability was accentuated by the serious incidents in the early 1990s. Since1989 the Riksbank had been required by law to “promote a safe and efficient paymentsystem”. The problems among Swedish banks naturally strengthened the Riksbank’sdetermination to contribute to the work on stability so that similar events would not occuragain.As virtually all economic transactions involve some form of payment, one of the financialsystem’s principal components is the payment system. This is clearly expressed in a statementin the main report from the Banking Law Committee, to the effect that concern for thepayment system is the primary reason for supervising and controlling financial institutions.
3BIS Review   23/1999In Sweden it is the Riksbank that provides and is accountable for the central payment system.This RIX system handles 1,500 interbank payments a day with a total value of SEK 350billion. While it is often the central bank that is responsible for a country’s payment system,there is nothing to prevent this function being performed by some other player. In countrieswhere that is the case, the payment system is not a central bank concern. Nonetheless, onereason for assigning the task to the central bank is the payment system’s importance for thetransmission of monetary policy. Another reason is that a central bank is in a unique positionto provide the liquidity that the smooth functioning of the system constantly requires. Playersare liable to need a temporary supply of liquidity in order to smooth the flow of payments withother participants.The payment system can be said to consist in turn of two components: the paymentinfrastructure and the financial firms, mainly banks, with access to the system. The stability ofthe system is dependent on the proper functioning of both these components. Theinfrastructure must be constructed so that it does not exacerbate any problems that may arise.It needs to be capable of handling external shocks without any danger of collapsing.However, the severe strains that arise from time to time in the payment system tend to begenerated not so much by hang-ups in technical and administrative systems as by problems forone or several of the participating banks. Problems for one bank quickly spread to the rest ofthe payment system and may generate a systemic risk. This risk arises if problems with creditor liquidity prevent bank A from completing its payments to bank B, which thereby hasdifficulties in paying bank C. Banks B and C are then liable to fail solely because bank Acannot fulfil its commitments. The risk obviously varies with the size of the payments inquestion; the larger these are, the greater is the potential systemic risk.The occurrence of systemic crisis threatens the whole or parts of the payment system, and ifthis ceases to function the entire financial system as well as the real economy will be affected.The crisis in Sweden in the early 1990s was associated with large systemic risks. Last autumnthe U.S. Federal Reserve perceived considerable systemic risks in the domestic financialmarket. In neither of these cases, however, was there a full-blown systemic crisis.In the event of a systemic crisis, the payment system needs a large supply of credit. As a lastresort the law therefore allows the Riksbank to provide financial support for banks that areviable but in temporary difficulties. The provision of credit is a very important instrument inthe management of systemic crises.The Riksbank focuses on the banks, particularly the largest ones, because one of the mainsystemic risks stems from problems with the settlement of large-value payments. It istherefore important that the Riksbank analyses the overall stability of the bank sector in orderto identify banks that may encounter temporary difficulties. In this way, our oversight of thepayment system is extended to include much of the financial system.The continuous analysis of the financial system by the Riksbank currently focuses on threeaspects:1.Each institution’s efficiency and earning capacity, as this is liable to influence theinstitution’s risk behaviour.
BIS Review   23/199942.Credit risks, particularly those connected with the payment system, that is, counterpartyand settlement risks. The analysis of these risks is intended to give the Riksbank a generalpicture of the whole system and enable the timely detection of any problems in some stage ofthe payment process.3.Systemic risks from factors outside the payment system. Problems may be caused byuncertainty and a lack of confidence in the financial system. This involves other playersbesides the banks. Historically, it is macroeconomic imbalances that have caused confidenceto decline in this way. Examples of such imbalances are highly volatile asset prices,fluctuations in the rate of price increases and a growing household debt ratio. Macroeconomicindicators accordingly play an important part not only in the assessment of future inflation butalso in the analysis of payment system stability. Experience has shown that a balancedmacroeconomic policy and stable prices reduce the risk of shocks that threaten financialstability.Analyses of these three aspects are presented twice a year in our Financial Market Report.The Riksbank is accountable for oversight and the Financial Supervisory Authority forsupervision. This means that the Riksbank is primarily concerned with the development of asystem or a market, while the FSA considers the situation in each institution as well as thesystem’s overall stability. But as the dividing line between these two functions is blurred inpractice, it is important that these two authorities cooperate closely. Such cooperation isindeed a hallmark of our interaction, from senior management down to divisional staff.Note, therefore, that while oversight is an important Riksbank function, the direct supervisionof Sweden’s financial system is not our concern. Our legislators have assigned the latter roleto the Financial Supervisory Authority, which accordingly has the possibility of directlypointing to shortcomings in particular institutions.The Riksbank may nonetheless detect problems at an early stage because they are likely toleave their mark on the payment system, which is the Riksbank’s concern. Our chances ofinfluencing the course of events then lie in contacting the bank’s executives and informing theFinancial Supervisory Authority. Our Financial Market Report can no doubt also play animportant part in exerting a more continuous influence. In the longer run, the Riksbank canalso contribute to stability through international collaboration, as well as by participating inSweden in legislative work and the structural adjustment of various systems.Undervalued credit risks—a recurrent phenomenonOne aspect of the Riksbank’s oversight of financial stability in Sweden has been the analysisof the run-up to the bank crisis here and the possible causes of crises in other parts of theworld.The causes and course of the various crises have differed in some respects but they do presentmany similarities. Many of them were preceded by a period of rapidly rising asset prices and astrong expansion of credit. This period ended with an abrupt reassessment—a jolt that alteredrisk assessments and led to heavy losses for those involved. Signs of economic problemsmeant that the supply of credit virtually ceased. It seems that the stronger the credit supply inthe first period, the more serious were the effects in the second phase, with decreasedproduction and rising unemployment.
5BIS Review   23/1999Another factor in many cases has been that the country had a fixed, but adjustable, exchangerate regime that lacked credibility. With such a regime, the central bank seemingly absorbsexchange risks, which gives private investors an incentive to utilise the interest ratedifferential with the rest of the world that characterises a situation where domestic inflationexpectations are higher than in other countries. Loans were therefore obtained in foreigncurrency for investment in domestic assets. The maturities of the financing instruments oftendiffered from those of the investments—the funds were borrowed short and invested long.When the exchange rate ceased to be perceived as sustainable and the risk of an adjustmentgrew, the earlier capital inflows turned into massive outflows. This accentuated the pressureon the exchange rate and created an acute currency crisis. If the capital inflow had beenchannelled through the banking system, the lack of confidence during the acute phase of thecrisis often led to severe repercussions on the financial system.The course of events of this type is essentially dependent on the supply of credit. The problemhas lain in widespread lending losses and it seems that the banks have repeatedly made muchthe same mistakes. This applies to their generosity in financing asset investment by privateplayers as well as to the willingness of international banks to supply foreign currency todomestic counterparties. Situations of this type often involve a high concentration of creditsand the credit risk assessments appear to have been rather superficial.What are the reasons for this? One is probably the difficulty, for banks as well as supervisors,in assessing the risks in loan portfolios. The management of credit risks is cumbersome andneither is it easy to obtain a good picture of the players’ portfolios. Genuine difficulties inmaking assessments are thus one explanation; another is that in certain cases the banks seemto have hunted with the pack instead of making independent risk assessments.Undervalued credit risks accordingly seem to be a recurrent theme in these crises. It istherefore essentially the banks that must construct sounder credit policies in their institutions.These policies must include the scrutiny of everything from the work of the individual creditofficer up to the more general strategies of the executive management and board of directors.A great deal of international work has also been done to rectify these problems. Authoritiesand financial agents are working together on the formulation and introduction of internationalprinciples—core principles—for the proper functioning of banking systems and supervision.One aspect of these efforts is the construction of capital adequacy rules that are more suited tothe banking system’s present situation—the current rules were formulated in the light of thefinancial situation in 1988. Efforts are also being made to achieve a higher degree oftransparency and clearer accountancy.The recurrent crises in financial markets unmistakably show that the work of reinforcing thesystem is a continuous process that must not be neglected. Developments last autumn made itclear that the work the banks had already initiated to improve risk management did not sufficeto prevent renewed financial turbulence. The pattern of risks differed somewhat from earlierperiods with problems. Instead of the familiar difficulties with the banks’ loan portfolios, inlarge measure it was a matter of risks that certain highly leveraged players would generateproblems through large positions in the repo market, for example.A drastic example—LTCM
BIS Review   23/19996The problems in the U.S. hedge fund Long Term Capital Management can be seen as a drasticexample of how systemic risks can arise if the banks’ counterparty risks and concentrationrisks become unduly large. A single player, seemingly far removed from the payment system,threatened to generate a systemic crisis in the U.S. financial system, with the risks ofcontagion that this might involve.LTCM, which had been operating since 1994, based its strategy on the use of statistical andmathematical models to identify temporary price differentials between similar financialmarket assets. This involved speculating, for example, in narrowing interest rate spreads in theU.S. bond market. In simple terms, a limited capital input was used to combine forwardpurchases of U.S. corporate bonds with forward sales of U.S. federal bonds. The combinationof countervailing positions meant that the outcome would not be affected by the generaldevelopment of interest rates. It was only the relative paths of the two asset categories thatmattered—a narrowing interest rate spread would result in a profit.Similarly, the fund took large countervailing positions between different asset markets as wellas between markets in different geographical regions. To begin with the strategy was notablysuccessful; high profits were obtained with a low capital input. In 1995 and 1996 the annualprofit was over 40 per cent. This performance and the confidence that the fund managementenjoyed made many banks willing to provide loans or invest in the fund.In time, however, the financial markets moved in the opposite direction to what LTCM—andothers—had expected. Russia’s debt moratorium on 17 August was followed by markedlyincreased financial turbulence as investors became more nervous and withdrew from othermarkets that could be perceived as risky. A uniform tendency developed, with falling shareprices, widening interest rate spreads, growing unrest and decreased liquidity. There was aflight to quality of a kind that had not been observed before in the financial markets. Insteadof narrowing, interest rate differentials became markedly wider. The diversity of risks onwhich LTCM had relied ceased to provide protection. The market movements were such that,if anything, it was a source of increased losses.The rumours of problems in LTCM contributed in turn to even greater turbulence in thefinancial markets. In that market prices would be depressed by a winding-up of positions,investors tried to close positions in those markets where they feared that LTCM was alsoinvolved. It can be mentioned, for example, that Risk Magazine estimated that LTCM’spositions in the interest swap market totalled 5 per cent of the global market, which sayssomething about the size of the fund’s positions. The flood of closures, almost amounting to apanic, caused a further widening of interest rate spreads.LTCM’s situation deteriorated rapidly; by the end of September the fund had lost almost 90per cent of its capital in the course of nine months. The U.S. Federal Reserve had initiated ameeting with some of LTCM’s counterparties and on 23 September fourteen banks withclaims on the fund agreed to take over LTCM as a joint venture and try to wind up thepositions in a more orderly manner.The Federal Reserve’s motivation for initiating a solution to the problem was not the sizeablelosses that might have been incurred by many of the banks concerned. Its concern instead wasthe financial system in general. If the banks that had provided loans were to close their largepositions spontaneously in a market that was already illiquid and turbulent, other agents whowere not directly involved would be hit. The steep price fall would probably have paralysed
7BIS Review   23/1999the financial markets for a time and this might have triggered a vicious circle of decliningconfidence and further closures—the Fed perceived a large systemic risk. The ultimateconsideration was, of course, the potential hazard for the global economy.It is difficult to say what might have happened if the Federal Reserve had not acted. The banksthat were involved had a strong interest in achieving a controlled settlement of theircommitments and would probably have acted at some stage. In such a crisis, however, promptaction is vitally important. The central bank initiative contributed to this.LessonsSwedish banks were never directly involved in these problems, though they did feel certaineffects of the developments in U.S. financial markets. Even the Swedish market became lessliquid.However, the involvement of Swedish banks might have been greater and that is why theRiksbank needs to analyse the origins of such problems. Our function of promoting a safe andefficient payment system cannot be performed properly without a good capability foranalysing and understanding the implications of the crises that occur around the world. Theresults can lead to conclusions that underpin the stability of Sweden’s financial system. TheRiksbank has in fact been working on these matters for a long time; risks of the type thatcaused problems last autumn were considered in the Financial Market Report that waspublished in November.In the case of LTCM, the threat of a systemic crisis came from the combination of extensivecounterparty risks and a high risk concentration. Counterparty risks occur when there isuncertainty about the ability of counterparties to meet their commitments.One of the problems was the large number of banks that had provided loans to LTCM. Thisgave a concentration of risks to a particular counterparty, which had large positions of its own.Such a concentration can have several causes. The high profits—probably also the reputablestatus of executives—no doubt made the fund attractive as a counterparty. Banks weretherefore willing to approve credits in order to establish a relationship with such a profitablecustomer as LTCM. At the same time, the fund’s reticence about its risk profile made itdifficult for creditors to form an accurate picture of the total risks. The banks were evidentlyunaware of the size of the credits that other players had provided, which by itself isremarkable. Neither did they fully appreciate what the large positions might have forconsequences if the collateral had to be called. In other words, the banks ought not to haverelied to such an extent on the collateral, in the form of securities, they had accepted for theirloans. Lending of this type requires that even the banks obtain a picture of the borrower’s totalsituation. Had they done so in the case of LTCM, the outcome would certainly have beendifferent.The problems last autumn also revealed shortcomings in current risk models and themanagement of certain types of risk. The banks must pay more attention to how the modelswork in the event of a pronounced change in market conditions. The markets moved to suchan extent that historical estimates of co-variations ceased to apply.The crisis accordingly offers several lessons:
BIS Review   23/19998• In the light of what happened in international financial markets last autumn, allparticipants in the financial system must improve their credit policies.• Relying solely on securities as collateral is not enough; a picture must also be obtained ofthe borrower’s total commitments.• The LTCM crisis demonstrates that credit assessments must include a larger element ofreadiness for extreme events. Models based on historical events were incapable offoreseeing the debt moratorium in Russia and the resultant slump in virtually everymarket. Neither could they envisage that market liquidity would dry up to such an extentthat the banks would not be able to dispose of their loan collateral without eliciting a verysteep price fall. The banks need to augment their risk models with stress tests—assessments of the direct and indirect effects that unusual market developments wouldhave on their current positions.• Banks must improve their risk management and knowledge of different forms of risk butso must the supervisory authorities.• A further question concerns the adequacy of existing laws and regulations. Are therethings we have missed? As I mentioned earlier, intensive efforts are being made toimprove the rules.Having said all this, we must also recognise that the extensive work that is continuously beingdone to strengthen the financial system does not mean that the system will be madecompletely immune to crises. The work must focus on mitigating the effects and trying toensure that crises which do occur are less extensive and socially costly than those we haveexperienced in recent years.The competent parties must endeavour to find solutions that combine the necessary marketregulation and supervision with the advantages inherent in capital mobility. A completelyregulated market reduces capital flows and generates large fluctuations in market prices,leading in turn to welfare losses. But neither is a market without any common rules andsupervision an ideal remedy. Operations in financial markets need some degree of supervisionbut this must not paralyse the potential for developments that can contribute to higherprosperity in the global economy.
1BIS Review   20/1999Mr Gjedrem reports on economic perspectives in NorwayAnnual address by the Governor of the Central Bank of Norway, Mr Svein Gjedrem, at the meeting ofthe Supervisory Council of Norges Bank on 18/02/99.BackgroundTwenty-two years ago, in 1977, the Norwegian economy witnessed the onset of a deep crisis. Aneconomic recession in industrial countries, high price and wage inflation in Norway and theexpansion of public welfare services resulted in large current account deficits. Thirteen years ago, in1986, the Norwegian economy was also in a difficult situation. A debt-financed upswing inconsumption and investment, a fall in oil prices and a reduction in working hours gave rise to majorimbalances in the Norwegian economy.In 1998 clouds again gathered over the economic horizon. Costs rose to a high level in Norwaycompared with other countries, oil prices fell, and the current account balance deteriorated sharply.This signalled a period of sluggish growth following six years of a strong upswing in economicgrowth and employment. The krone depreciated and interest rates were raised.There are many features that distinguish the three turning points in economic developments. However,one common denominator is the sudden shift in the assessment of future oil revenues. Fluctuations inpetroleum revenues have proved to be a source of instability in the mainland economy.Following the last two turning points, the Norwegian economy went through a period of majorrestructuring, particularly at the end of the 1980s. Today the situation in the Norwegian economy isdifferent. However, this time there is also reason to ask whether we are sufficiently prepared. Is oureconomy sufficiently robust?The fall in oil prices was triggered by an international financial crisis and slower growth in the worldeconomy. The Norwegian economy is highly exposed to international fluctuations. Is our ownfinancial system and business sector strong enough to cope with this situation? How should monetaryand fiscal policy be formulated in such an exposed and oil-dependent economy? These are the issues Iwould like to address this evening.A turbulent worldEven before oil prices started to fall, the warning signals were flashing for everyone to see. TheNorwegian economy was overheating in an environment of global economic distress. The signalsfrom Asia were clear.
BIS Review   20/19992The problems first appeared in Thailand a little more than 18 months ago, but spread quickly toMalaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia and South Korea. In most of these countries, a sharp upturn hadbeen stimulated by low interest rates and financed through a considerable accumulation of debt in thebusiness sector. Borrowers became increasingly nervous and withdrew capital. Capital inflows fromindustrial countries were suddenly reversed to massive capital outflows.Equity and property prices fell sharply and currencies came under pressure. The contagion effect ledto a sharp downturn in production and employment. Large population groups that had recentlyexperienced a pronounced increase in living standards slid back into poverty.The crisis in Asia spread to Russia, where the decline in commodity prices led to an even furtherdeterioration in government finances. The announcement that Russia could no longer service its debtwas met with strong reactions in global financial markets in August and September. There weregrowing fears that the world economy would be caught in a financial crash. Many investors withdrewfrom small and risky markets, particularly in Latin America. The Brazilian currency came underpressure. It was difficult to raise loan capital even in the most advanced markets. As financialinstitutions throughout the world experienced growing losses, fears of a world economic depressionintensified.Reductions in interest rates in the US and Europe facilitated access to credit and prevented a marketcollapse. Measures perceived as credible were finally implemented to resolve the Japanese bankingcrisis. Additional capital was allocated to the International Monetary Fund.There are still many challenges ahead. Brazil and Russia are running government budget deficits andare having problems establishing a credible monetary policy. China is bearing substantial costs as aresult of the crisis in surrounding countries and may experience difficulties of its own. Othercountries may also feel the contagion effect. However, even though the outlook points to lowergrowth in the global economy this year than forecast earlier, fears of a worldwide depression havereceded.This is by no means the first time we have experienced an international financial crisis. In this decadealone we have seen a currency crisis in Europe in 1992–1993 and the Mexican crisis in 1994–1995. Anumber of the countries affected were suffering from major economic imbalances, which triggeredcurrency outflows and capital flight. These crises also revealed fundamental shortcomings in thefunctioning of the international financial system.
3BIS Review   20/1999In principle, access to efficient international capital markets is an advantage for a country, not adisadvantage. Norway used international capital to finance the development of its oil sector andsizeable current account deficits in the 1970s and 1980s. Norwegian enterprises have access to creditthat would be very expensive in periods if we were to rely solely on domestic financing. The centralgovernment invests the capital in the Petroleum Fund in foreign markets because this is expected togenerate high returns.In the long term there is hardly any better alternative than to improve the functioning of capitalmarkets. This is in the interest of Norway and other industrial countries, particularly countries thathave a surplus of saving that must be invested abroad. This is also in the interest of many developingcountries that sorely need international capital to develop their economies.One solution that is not effective is the reimposition of direct capital controls, given the vast increasein technological capabilities to evade them. The business sector is already international. Capitalcontrols are disadvantageous to the business sector in the countries that introduce them. Nor are taxeson capital movements or currency trading a realistic or effective alternative. Taxes will not preventsubstantial short-term speculative waves. A tax system would have to have broad internationalsupport, because without it currency trading would only shift to countries without taxes. The benefitof remaining outside would increase with the number of countries that participate.What can be done to improve a system that is functioning poorly? If a country is to benefit from a freecapital market, it must draw up legislation providing for regulations and supervision that ensurestability. Countries with poorly developed capital markets may benefit from some limitations. Theyshould exercise some caution in opening these markets too suddenly. The flow of capital is likeelectricity. Adequate insulation should be in place before turning it on.When the Nordic countries liberalised credit markets in the 1980s, we experienced considerableproblems because supervision and rules were not adequate. The same has been witnessed in the crisisin Asia and Russia. Inadequate and ineffective legislation and supervision resulted in weak control offinancial sectors in the beleaguered countries.The crisis is not only due to an unsuccessful policy in the countries concerned. Banks and funds inindustrial countries accounted for the sharp growth in capital inflows to emerging market economiesin the years prior to the crisis. Those who invested in these countries based their decisions oninsufficient and, in part, misleading information. With hindsight, we may ask why so much capitalwas lent to countries about which lenders knew very little.An additional problem is moral hazard: lenders may have assumed that the authorities or internationalorganisations would bail them out if borrowers experienced payment problems. As a last resort, theymay have expected the IMF to back the national authorities, which again are expected to support theirbanking systems. Lenders can thereby neglect to make a thorough evaluation of credit risk.The liberalisation of the capital market within a country requires national regulations and supervision.The liberalisation of capital movements across national borders requires coordination and regulationsat an international level.Countries on the European continent have a regional approach to this. They have drawn up a set oflaws and rules that govern a common European market, the single market. Norway also participates inthis market by virtue of the EEA Agreement. From 1 January 1999, 11 EU countries introduced thesingle currency, thereby implementing one of the greatest monetary reforms of this century.Moreover, European monetary union effectively eliminates the opportunity to speculate betweencountries’ currencies, thereby enhancing the stability of the financial system in Europe.
BIS Review   20/19994International rules for economic relations with other countries are important, particularly for smallcountries. Cooperation within the framework of the WTO and GATT agreement on trade in goods andservices is an example. The OECD Capital Code, which provides a framework for member countries’laws and regulations on capital movements, is another example.Initiatives have been taken by both the International Monetary Fund and the Bank for InternationalSettlements to create a new international regulatory framework and system. This work is aimed atreducing the risk and effects of severe financial crises, and is so far-reaching that it has also beenreferred to as a new ‘architecture’ for the global financial system. Norway should support theseendeavours.First, the new architecture must improve surveillance systems and promote greater openness andtransparency in the finances and practices of government and enterprises. Necessary measures includemore uniform accounting procedures and the development of international statistical standards. Moremodern company, bankruptcy and securities legislation must be drawn up in many emerging marketeconomies. Second, private investors must to a greater extent bear the costs of their ill-advisedinvestments. The IMF must impose requirements on banks in industrial countries so that theycontribute to resolving the crisis they have contributed to creating. This will deter banks fromassuming excessive risk. Third, supervision of the financial sector must be tightened. Capitalrequirements that are more closely linked to financial institutions’ exposure to risk are among themeasures under consideration. In addition, it is important to enhance crisis management systemsbecause, irrespective of what we do on the preventive level, we will probably never be able toeradicate financial bubbles that escalate into financial crises.The work on a new international financial architecture is a demanding and long-term process. Thiswork nevertheless offers hope of achieving international agreement on some effective measures. Overtime, it should also reduce the risk of local and regional crises and their contagion effect on the rest ofthe world.There is still a long way to go. As far as Norway is concerned, we must act on the assumption that wewill continue to live in an unstable world. The financial crises have shown that a small country isvulnerable to international turbulence. The Norwegian economy is fragile and vulnerable.Stability and buffer against financial shocksNorway has also experienced a banking crisis. If nothing else, we learned from it. Laws, regulationsand supervision have been tightened. Financial institutions place greater emphasis on riskmanagement. The debt burden of households is lower than in the 1980s, and for a long period thebusiness sector was also more cautious about incurring new debt.
5BIS Review   20/1999Losses at Norwegian financial institutions have been low since the banking crisis. There is greateruncertainty now as the economy is approaching a turning point. The sharp growth in fixed incomebusiness has led to a substantial increase in corporate debt, which has been reflected in the high levelof credit growth in recent years.The rise in interest rates has made it more demanding for households and enterprises to service theirdebt in the short term, but has had a restraining effect on credit growth. If interest rates had not movedup, the business sector could have continued to build up debt for a somewhat longer period, whichwould hardly have promoted long-term stability. Somewhat higher losses on corporate lending arenow expected, although there is hardly any imminent risk to the financial strength of the bankingsystem.However, there is cause for concern about the evolution of the structure of the Norwegian financialindustry in the longer term.The free flow of capital in Europe paves the way for structural changes in the European financialindustry. These changes will be prompted by the increased use of fund-based pension systems and theever wider application of technology in the euro area. Banks in Europe will become larger, moreefficient and more competitive, and securities markets will be larger and more liquid.Structural changes are also taking place in the financial industry in the Nordic countries. Nordicfinancial institutions are adjusting capacity, enhancing efficiency and realising economies of scale.The largest banks are developing their activities, with the Nordic area as their home market, bybuilding up their branch networks or through acquisitions. Not many Norwegian financial institutionshave found it profitable to participate in this process.The government’s ownership in the banking sector was expanded as part of the solution to theNorwegian banking crisis. It was not necessary to allow ownership to be permanent. Currently, thegovernment owns the state banks, Postbanken and more than 50% of Norway’s two largestcommercial banks. The government therefore controls banks that account for about 50% of banklending in Norway. The stake in the two largest commercial banks is to be reduced to a third.State ownership of banks constitutes, in my opinion, a structural weakness in the Norwegian financialsystem.There is a risk that the ownership function is not exercised actively enough. A lack of control on thepart of active owners may give the board and management excessive influence in these banks. In thelong run this could lead to less efficient operations and lower profitability. Private owners with lowercapital stakes may also wield a disproportionately high level of influence if the state as owner is toopassive.The political parties widely disagree on the issue of government bank ownership. This may be adisadvantage when decisions on mergers and other structural measures are to be taken. When there isa profitable basis for growth, which requires increases in capital, the state-owned banks must pose thefollowing question: is it possible to gain political support? They cannot merely ask: will investors findthis profitable?It is important to reach political consensus on the question of state ownership. One example of a casewhere the political parties reached agreement on structure and ownership in the 1980s is thepetroleum sector. The oil companies have therefore enjoyed stable operating parameters over the last15 years, although this sector is also faced with the challenge of finding new solutions in response tothe sharp shifts in market conditions that we have witnessed recently. This will once again requireforward-looking strategies and willingness to compromise.
BIS Review   20/19996The government’s supervisory tasks are substantial. Confidence in the banking system in criticalsituations may also be contingent on the government’s willingness to provide financial backing. Thereis a fundamental conflict between these two roles and the government’s role as bank owner. Peoplemust be confident that the government does not conceal its own mistakes when intervening in the faceof a crisis in the banking system should this again prove necessary. It is virtually impossible toestablish such confidence if the government is also responsible for the crisis through its ownership.State ownership in the banking industry has been maintained with a view to ensuring stable nationalownership. It seems that, in practice, most comparable countries attach importance to having largefinancial institutions with a national anchor, but most of them avoid state ownership and theassociated conflicts of interest. We should also be able to do this.However, I would like to stress that a greater number of foreign financial institutions could also beadvantageous. Foreign institutions will normally be larger and more diversified than Norwegianinstitutions. This could generate better and cheaper services in the Norwegian market. Moreover,these institutions might be in a stronger position to cope with a cyclical downturn in Norway or acrisis situation than banks concentrated in Norway.At the beginning of the recession at the end of the 1980s, the Norwegian financial system plunged intoa deep crisis. The debt consolidation that was necessary in the business and household sectorscontributed to a sharp and prolonged downturn.In the long term our financial system may, in my opinion, suffer in the absence of restructuring andgrowth capabilities. However, the overall picture is that we are better prepared this time. Householdsare not grappling with the same debt burden and our financial industry is in better balance.An oil-dependent economyThe fall in oil prices has resulted in a substantial loss of revenues in Norway. Since 1997 this hasresulted in a decline in export earnings corresponding to about 5.5% of total national income. Thisrepresents the same decline in our disposable income as between 1985 and 1986, when oil prices fellby close to 50% over a few months. This time, however, the current account balance has deterioratedby a smaller margin. Growth in imports has been slower than 12 years ago. The value of non-oilexports has increased this time, while it fell in 1986. But the effect on the external account has beensubstantial this time as well.
7BIS Review   20/1999The fall in oil prices has weakened Norway’s terms of trade. The terms of trade measure the price ofimported goods in relation to exported goods. When oil prices decline and import prices remainsteady, we must export more in order to buy the same quantity of imports.This is not the first time that we have experienced substantial changes in our terms of trade. The mostpronounced variations – in 1986 and 1998 – were due to the sharp drop in oil prices. Variations inDenmark’s terms of trade are negligible compared with Norway.In this sense, the Norwegian economy has more in common with countries like New Zealand andAustralia, which are also large exporters of commodities. A substantial change in the terms of trade
BIS Review   20/19998translates into considerable changes in these countries’ earnings and balance of payments. Over theyears this has resulted in sizeable exchange rate fluctuations.The exchange rate is a buffer against changes in the terms of trade. While a country like Denmark hasalso managed to maintain a stable exchange rate, commodity-producing countries typically experiencefluctuations in the exchange rate in tandem with changes in the terms of trade.In New Zealand, Australia and many other countries, monetary policy is oriented directly towardsprice stability, and these countries permit short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate. This meansthat monetary policy bears the primary responsibility for price stability, whereas fiscal policy is to agreater extent oriented towards long-term stability in government finances.Norway has established the Government Petroleum Fund in order to promote long-term stability ingovernment finances and ensure fiscal leeway in the long term. The Government Petroleum Fund alsoacts as a buffer against fluctuations in petroleum revenues. Swings in oil prices lead to changes inallocations to the Fund. As a large share of petroleum revenues accrues to the state, smaller variationsin these revenues will only have a limited effect on the wider economy. This makes the Norwegianeconomy more robust and in the short term less dependent on oil, at least as long as the governmentbudget is running a substantial surplus. This is part of the reason why Norway seeks to maintainexchange rate stability rather than orienting monetary policy directly towards the objective of pricestability.Many countries are struggling with government finances. After several years of large governmentbudget deficits, interest expenditure is laying claim to a considerable portion of tax revenues andthereby limiting the government’s scope for carrying out its tasks. The main challenge to fiscal policyis to eliminate these deficits and reduce government debt and interest expenditure.Norway has had greater fiscal scope for manoeuvre, although this has not solely been used to promotelong-term balance. Therefore, Norway established a different division of responsibility in economicpolicy. As the objective of monetary policy is to maintain a stable exchange rate, fiscal policy has animportant responsibility for stabilising the economy.
9BIS Review   20/1999Division of responsibility failsStabilisation policy is a very demanding task in an economy like Norway, with occasional majorexogenous shocks. The question that must now be asked is how our system functions when exposed topressure.Oil prices were high in 1996, 1997 and into 1998, which resulted in large surpluses on the currentaccount and the government budget. Domestic activity was also rising, with strong growth inemployment. Deliveries to the petroleum sector generated a strong and uncontrolled growth impetusto the mainland economy. During the budget deliberations in the Storting (Norwegian parliament),major changes were made. Compared with the large surpluses generated by petroleum revenues, thechanges to the budget may have seemed small, but these changes were important for economicdevelopments.I will illustrate this by means of an example. Assume that the oil price temporarily increases by NOK10 per barrel, or a little less than USD 1.50 per barrel. This is a small change in the oil price, wellwithin normal variations from one year to the next. Government revenues – and thereby the budgetsurplus – would then increase by about NOK 9 billion in the first year and NOK 11–12 billion thenext year. This corresponds to about 1% of Norway’s GDP. The assumption is that all the revenuesfrom such a minor increase in oil prices will be transferred to the Government Petroleum Fund andthat fiscal policy will remain firm. In this case, the additional revenues will not influence theeconomy, but be invested abroad via the Government Petroleum Fund.On the other hand, if the additional revenues are absorbed in the domestic economy through increasedgovernment budget expenditure, total domestic demand is influenced. Increased expenditure requiresan increase in the public sector’s use of resources, primarily labour. In this case, 1% of GDP issubstantial. If such an increase in oil revenues is used domestically, it corresponds, for example, toaround half of average annual growth in the economy. If the private sector of the economy alsoexpands while the economy is nearing capacity limits, such a policy will heighten the pressures onresources in the economy, which in turn fuels inflationary pressures.Unfortunately there was a clear tendency of such a policy in 1996, 1997 and 1998. The non-oilgovernment budget deficit was indeed reduced, but the division of responsibility in economic policyrequired a more active tightening. Rather than conducting a tight policy and countering the higher
BIS Review   20/199910growth in the business sector, the increase in budget expenditure entailed that the public sector alsocontributed to fuelling pressures in the labour market. As a result, a small change in oil prices had theeffect it was not intended to have: it was accompanied by an increase in public sector demand.Foreign exchange market participants observed that economic policy was not oriented towardscontaining pressures in the labour market. In a different situation such a policy could haveundermined confidence, leading to a depreciation of the krone and higher interest rates. Owing to highoil prices, however, the krone was very strong in 1996 and 1997. It may be that the foreign exchangemarket accepted that Norway was in a situation – with large government budget and current accountsurpluses – where the country both could and should have transferred resources from the businesssector to the public sector. It could be that market participants believed that this transfer of resourceswould occur with the help of a strong krone exchange rate, which reduces profitability in the businesssector.Appreciation pressures mounted and culminated in a reduction in interest rates by Norges Bank inJanuary 1997 in order to counter the sharp strengthening of the krone.If the central bank had not acted, the krone might have appreciated by an even greater margin. Thiscould have given a strong signal to the business sector to move out of Norway. However, in asituation where fiscal policy was not sufficiently tight, the reduction in interest rates increased the riskof an acceleration in price and cost inflation.Then came the fall in oil prices, with an associated erosion of the external account. Income growth forliberal professions had been substantial, wage growth for salaried employees accelerated and thewage and income settlement in 1998 was very generous. This eliminated the basis for the strongkrone. In late summer the international financial crisis escalated and the krone depreciated.High wage growth cannot be attributed to flaws in wage and income determination. On the contrary,the flexible wage and income system can probably be cited as the main factor behind the high level ofemployment and low unemployment in Norway. In periods of strong labour market pressures,particularly in 1974–1976, 1986–1987 and last year, wage growth accelerates sharply. Such periodsare normally followed by a slacker labour market and higher unemployment. The positive feature ofincome determination in Norway has been that wage growth returns to normal relatively quickly,
11BIS Review   20/1999which has allowed Norway to avoid the persistently high levels of unemployment experienced bymost West European countries. Even though some increase in unemployment must be expected, weshould be able to avoid a rise in unemployment to European levels or to the level prevailing in theperiod 1989–1992 if wage and cost inflation is rapidly reduced also during this business cycle.Fiscal policy failed in 1996, 1997 and 1998. Developments illustrate that budget discipline must beexercised down to the last billion.The economy overheated because fiscal policy was not sufficiently tight when the economy wasfaring well. This brought the krone under pressure and external conditions intensified this pressure,making it impossible to keep the krone on track. It is only this year that fiscal policy is again welladapted to the economic situation.If fiscal policy is systematically too expansionary during booms and when petroleum revenues arehigher than expected, Norway will in periods experience pressures in the economy and rising priceand cost inflation. This will often give rise to situations where the krone depreciates, therebyundermining the credibility of our monetary policy. There is a price to be paid for this. Marketparticipants will lose confidence in the krone and demand a higher interest rate for maintaining kronepositions rather than switching to other currencies. The result is a permanently higher interest ratelevel in Norway compared with other countries.Intricate relationshipsEarlier, monetary policy was based on extensive use of interventions – in other words, purchases andsales of foreign exchange in order to defend the krone exchange rate. Denmark has used thisinstrument with positive results. There are probably many reasons for this in addition to its stableterms of trade. For instance, fiscal policy in Denmark has on numerous occasions made a substantialcontribution to exchange rate stability.Over time our experience of large-scale and persistent interventions has been mixed. When the centralbank intervenes heavily to defend the krone, market participants may easily move into a gamesituation and perceive central bank intervention as an interesting opportunity to make a profit. Marketoperators know that a situation in which the krone is being propped up only because Norges Bank isbuying kroner cannot continue. It is then tempting to take reverse positions in the foreign exchangemarket in relation to the central bank. This means that heavy and prolonged interventions mayintensify the pressure on the krone over time, steadily increasing the necessary volume of interventionpurchases. The foremost example of such a game situation in Norway’s exchange rate policy historywas Friday 20 November 1992, when Norges Bank made intervention purchases for NOK 37 billionfrom the time the market opened until the time it closed. Intervention purchases amounting toNOK 14 billion were also made the previous day after Sweden allowed its currency to float. NorgesBank had thereby depleted its foreign exchange reserves by more than NOK 50 billion in the courseof six trading hours over two days.Norges Bank does not want to intervene in such a way that this type of game situation arises. Nor canwe expect other central banks to help us to an extent that makes a decisive contribution to ourresistance. However, the Bank may use interventions to a limited extent if the krone movessubstantially out of line with what we consider to be reasonable based on fundamentals or in the eventof exceptional short-term volatility in thin markets. In such situations, we must assume that the risk ofending up in a game situation against exchange market players is marginal.The instrument available to Norges Bank for influencing economic fundamentals is the interest rate. Ifthe exchange rate comes under pressure, Norges Bank can counter this over time by adjusting interestrates. However, we must take into account that in the long run the krone exchange rate cannot deviatesubstantially from the level implied by economic fundamentals. We must therefore to some extentexpect a change in the krone exchange rate in response to major changes in our terms of trade.
BIS Review   20/199912Norges Bank’s mandate has been formulated in the light of the experience of a fixed exchange ratepolicy earlier in the 1990s. This experience does not imply that the central bank is to conduct atraditional fixed exchange rate regime, with established fluctuation margins and the obligation tointervene, as reflected in the mandate. Norges Bank will orient monetary policy ‘towards maintaininga stable krone exchange rate against European currencies’. However, it is taken into account that thekrone exchange rate will vary. The Exchange Rate Regulation therefore states that ‘in the event ofsignificant changes in the exchange rate, monetary policy instruments shall be oriented with a view toreturning the exchange rate over time to its initial range’.We must learn from the situation that arose in the autumn of 1996 and winter of 1997 when strongappreciation pressures prompted Norges Bank to reduce its key rates.Norges Bank’s first response to such appreciation pressures is to provide advice concerning changesin the budget.Norges Bank will orient its instruments towards maintaining a stable krone exchange rate. We mustnot allow ourselves to be blinded by daily exchange rate quotations. The experience of recent yearsshows that Norges Bank must take into account the fundamental conditions for exchange rate stabilityover time.The krone is influenced by unrest in international financial markets, changes in oil prices,inappropriate fiscal policy responses and high cost increases peculiar to Norway. Norges Bank cannotfine-tune exchange rate movements through exchange market interventions. This means that the kroneexchange rate will fluctuate. It is up to Norges Bank to evaluate the best means of returning the kroneto its initial range. This also means that the Bank must exercise a large degree of discretion whenusing the Bank’s instruments, essentially the interest rate. In exercising its discretion, Norges Bankemphasises the fundamental conditions for exchange rate stability.There are two fundamental conditions necessary for achieving stability against European currencies.
13BIS Review   20/1999First, price and cost inflation must fall to the level aimed at by euro area countries. A high rise inprices and costs will in itself fuel depreciation expectations. Monetary policy must therefore beoriented with a view to bringing price and cost inflation in Norway down to the inflation target inEurope. As illustrated in the chart, price inflation in Norway has been about 1% higher than in euroarea countries over the last two years. Wage growth differentials are even wider. In this situation,pressures in the economy require a relatively tight monetary policy, as is the case today.Second, interest rates must not be set at such high levels that monetary policy contributes to economicdownturns that undermine confidence in the krone. If unemployment rises sharply, market operatorsmay perceive the exchange rate as being overvalued and that employment can be boosted byimproving business sector competitiveness. This would tend to fuel depreciation expectations. Atightening of monetary policy in such a situation would not be credible, and might trigger renewedspeculation against the krone. This mechanism came into evidence during the currency crisis in theautumn of 1992.When both fiscal policy and monetary policy are oriented with a view to influencing the domesticeconomy, it is important that the two components of economic policy are complementary. However,there is a risk that a situation may arise where Norges Bank maintains a high interest rate level basedon its evaluation of the economic outlook, while the government authorities increase spending inorder to stimulate employment. This is a genuine dilemma.In view of its mandate and responsibilities, the best way for Norges Bank to address this challenge isprobably to promote transparency in its analyses and reaction patterns so that the governmentauthorities can take into account the implications for Norges Bank’s setting of interest rates whendecisions concerning the government budget are taken. The objective of monetary policy and NorgesBank’s remit are drawn up by the political authorities.For monetary policy to be successful, it is vital that fiscal policy plays an effective role.In the short term monetary policy can influence developments in the real economy. Norges Bank cando this through two channels. First, Norges Bank will proceed gradually when the krone’s valuemoves outside the initial range and instruments are oriented to returning it to this range. We seek toavoid a situation whereby monetary policy contributes to abrupt shifts in the economy. Second,
BIS Review   20/199914developments in the labour market and product markets influence wage growth and inflation, andthereby the krone exchange rate. Norges Bank takes this into account when evaluating economicdevelopments and when setting interest rates.However, monetary policy is not a suitable instrument for influencing production and employment inthe long term. Nor can it be used to influence the size of the internationally exposed sector over time.It is primarily wage and income determination, the use of oil revenues over the government budget,and the adaptability and efficiency of the economy that determines this.Nor is monetary policy an effective tool of incomes policy. Interest rates cannot be used to influencethe negotiating climate of the income settlements. This could act as a highly negative constraint on thefreedom of manoeuvre.Long-term fiscal policy challengesThe fall in oil prices has obvious and immediate implications for monetary policy. But what aboutlong-term balance in the Norwegian economy? What if oil revenues remain low in the longer term aswell?Norway’s government finances are sound thanks to the large surpluses of recent years. A countrynormally seeks to achieve balanced public sector budgets over the business cycle. Norway is in aspecial situation, however, because of its petroleum activities. Revenues fluctuate sharply in pacewith the oil price and domestic business cycles. Oil and gas production will peak a few years into thenext century. It is therefore important to achieve a substantial surplus now, and accumulate financialwealth that can be used to finance the welfare system when oil revenues taper off. Otherwise, welfareschemes may have to be scaled back considerably when these revenues fall.The Petroleum Fund consists of the accumulated surpluses of government finances. Capital was firstallocated to the Fund in 1995. At the end of 1998 the market value of the Fund’s capital wasapproximately NOK 170 billion.National insurance scheme expenditure will increase in the future. In 1999 expenditure on retirementand disability pensions is expected to amount to NOK 91 billion. This corresponds to about 8% ofNorway’s GDP. The percentage will probably double over the next 30 years, and this will happenafter Norwegian oil production has peaked. The challenge to the real economy is that the workingpopulation will decline sharply, while the proportion receiving income from the public sector willrise.Projections for government oil revenues have been based on an oil price in the order of NOK 100 toNOK 120 per barrel. This will generate substantial government surpluses in the years ahead, and aseemingly steady accumulation of capital in the Petroleum Fund. The 1999 national budget estimatesthat in 20 years the central government’s net wealth will have risen to 120–130% of GDP.Financially, the state will thus be well equipped to cope with the higher expenditure associated withan ageing population.So far this year, the oil price has averaged slightly more than NOK 80 per barrel. The chart showsallocations to the Petroleum Fund with oil prices of NOK 110 and NOK 90 per barrel in the yearsahead. An oil price of NOK 90 will alone result in a substantially smaller surplus than previouslyanticipated. In this scenario, the Petroleum Fund will peak at 75% of GDP in 2015.The bottom line in the chart shows a different scenario. We are still assuming an oil price of NOK 90per barrel – in other words, one that is not especially low under present circumstances. In addition, wehave assumed a further reduction in the budget surplus, equivalent to 0.5% of GDP, each year for thenext 10 years. The combined effect is that after 10 years the budget surplus will have declined byabout 5% of GDP compared with the other calculations.
15BIS Review   20/1999This may seem substantial, but is no greater than the changes in the budget balance that we have seenpreviously. In the previous downturn, the government reduced its surplus by slightly more than 5% bymeans of an active countercyclical policy – and that was only during a five-year period. Thetightening so far in the 1990s has been of roughly the same magnitude. By contrast, we are nowlooking at a permanent change in the government surplus.This scenario is not entirely improbable. A pause in growth lies ahead for the Norwegian economy,and we must expect some increase in unemployment. This will quickly translate into demands forexpanded public sector activity. The government has some room for manoeuvre to address thischallenge by boosting public expenditure or cutting taxes.However, our calculations show that in the course of a few years an expansionary fiscal policy couldlead to a substantial reduction in the government’s scope for manoeuvre.What I want to demonstrate is that pursuing such a policy now – assuming that the oil price remainslow – would have a major impact on the ability of the government to finance the welfare society. Aswe see, it would not result in any increase in the budget surplus in the next few years. On the contrary,the surplus would gradually be reduced, and in about 10 years the budget would begin to show adeficit.The Petroleum Fund would suffer a sad fate and would be depleted in 18 years.This is just an illustration, however. Developments would compel a shift in fiscal policy long beforethe Petroleum Fund is depleted. But that in turn would mean that the state would not have the scopefor manoeuvre to stimulate total employment. It would not be easy to reduce the central governmentdeficit in a situation with declining oil revenues.We might, of course, be fortunate enough to experience a rise in oil prices again, so that we do nothave to deal with this problem. Perhaps the oil price is abnormally low at present. But it is importantto be aware that the government, in expanding welfare programmes and public sector activities, hasnot taken due account of the possibility that oil prices will remain low over a longer period.
BIS Review   20/199916We have already witnessed a depreciation of the krone in response to the deterioration in Norway’sterms of trade. This may reflect expectations of continued low oil prices and lower revenues in thelong term. This also compromises confidence in the government’s long-term financial position. It isrisky to increase expenditure and reduce taxes when there is doubt regarding the long-term balance ofthe economy. An expansionary fiscal policy could increase uncertainty and the fluctuations in theexchange rate, and reduce Norges Bank’s freedom of manoeuvre. On the contrary, fiscal policyshould be oriented to provide room for lower interest rates that can counter a cyclical downturn in anenvironment of stable wage and price inflation.The authorities must be very cautious about further embedding fixed long-term priorities in the centralgovernment budget. If oil prices remain low, it may quickly become necessary to take a critical look atthe scale of welfare schemes and public sector services, and it may also be necessary to increasetaxes. If, later in the business cycle, measures are called for to curb unemployment, they should bedesigned to be readily reversible and in such a way that they do not erode government finances in thelong term.ConclusionBy way of introduction, I posed the following question: is our economy sufficiently robust to copewith the fall in oil prices without a new round of major structural adjustments?Our financial system is in a stronger position to cope with a new downturn than it was in the 1980s.We have avoided a debt bubble of the scale we witnessed last time. However, I am in doubt as to thefinancial industry’s long-term restructuring capacity.Norway must endorse the development of a new architecture for the global financial system. This is ademanding and long-term process, and we cannot expect all the problems to be solved over night. Onthe other hand, if we are to have any hope of a more stable and predictable world economy, the onlyreal alternative is to enhance international codes for financial markets.We have observed that confidence in the krone is fragile. In order to restore confidence and maintaina stable exchange rate, monetary policy must be a credible anchor for expectations of continued lowprice inflation. Monetary and fiscal policy must be complementary in order to curb cyclicalfluctuations.
17BIS Review   20/1999Fiscal policy must be credible in the long term. The welfare society is dependent on solid governmentfinances. The authorities must exercise caution in establishing fixed long-term priorities in thegovernment budget. Measures aimed at countering an increase in unemployment must not beirreversible and undermine long-term credibility.The conditions for addressing the challenges are favourable. Employment is high and the populationis well educated. However, our economy is also exposed and vulnerable.In recent years fiscal policy has been too expansionary. This year the fiscal stance is appropriate. Acontinued tight fiscal policy can contribute to restoring credibility and confidence so that interest ratescan gradually be reduced. Let this be my hope for future developments.
1BIS Review   21/1999Mr Tietmeyer reports on international cooperation and coordination in the area of financialmarket supervision and surveillanceReport by the President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, Prof Hans Tietmeyer, on 11/02/99.1.Mandate issued by the G-7 Finance Ministers and Central Bank GovernorsIn considering ways of strengthening the international financial system, the Finance Ministersand Central Bank Governors of the G-7 countries asked me at their meeting in Washington onOctober 3, 1998“... to consult with other appropriate bodies and to consider with them thearrangements for cooperation and coordination between the various internationalfinancial regulatory and supervisory bodies and the international financialinstitutions interested in such matters, and to put to us expeditiouslyrecommendations for any new structures and arrangements that may be required”.This mandate was restated and extended in the declaration by the G-7 Finance Ministers andCentral Bank Governors on October 30, 1998:“We agree that better processes are needed for monitoring and promoting stability inthe international financial system and for the International Financial Institutions,working closely with the international supervisory and regulatory bodies, to conductsurveillance of national financial sectors and their regulatory and supervisoryregimes with all relevant information accessible to them.We agree therefore that we will:(i)support the establishment of a process for strengthened financial sector surveillanceusing national and international regulatory and supervisory expertise, includingthrough a process of peer review, and the IMF’s regular surveillance of its membercountries under Article IV;(ii)to this end bring together the key international institutions and key nationalauthorities involved in financial sector stability better to co-operate and toco-ordinate their activities in the management and development of policies to fosterstability and reduce systemic risk in the international financial system and toexchange information more systematically on risks in the international financialsystem.(...) we asked Dr Tietmeyer to consult the relevant international bodies on these reforms ...”In order to fulfil this mandate, I have held thorough consultations with representatives of allthe G-7 countries, the international financial institutions, and various international bodies.These consultations were helpful in identifying key areas in the international financial systemwhere improvements are essential in order to safeguard the proper functioning of the markets.A broad consensus emerged during this consultation process and is reflected in this report.This report first describes the current international arrangements for promoting the stability ofthe financial system. It then sets out the areas in which improvements are needed and whereaction appears necessary to strengthen the sustainable functioning of the markets. The finalsection sets out a proposal for improved international cooperation and coordination in the areaof financial market supervision and surveillance.2.Current arrangements for the supervision and surveillance of the international financialsystem
BIS Review   21/19992There are various international organisations which share responsibility for the currentarrangements concerning the supervision and surveillance of the international financialsystem.The International Financial Institutions (IFIs) contribute in various ways to strengthening theglobal financial system:- the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has responsibility under its Articles forsurveillance of all member countries, and monitors developments in the global economyand financial markets;- the IBRD (World Bank) under its mandate uses its expertise to assist countries in thedesign and implementation of reforms to strengthen financial systems, including banking,capital markets and market infrastructure.In addition,- the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) provides analytical, statistical and secretariatsupport for various official groupings working to strengthen the global financial system;and- the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) participates in theprocess of macroeconomic and financial surveillance and formulates guidelines forevaluating and improving the framework for corporate governance.The cooperation and coordination of supervisory practices are effected by various sector-specific international groupings of regulators and supervisors. In particular, these are- the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), as an important rule-setting body inthe field of banking supervision;- the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), which providesmutual assistance in order to promote the integrity of securities and futures marketsworldwide; and- the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS), which cooperates withsupervisors in promoting high standards in the field of insurance supervision.Moreover, there are groupings of central bank experts concerned with market infrastructureand functioning. In particular, these are- the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS), which analyses paymentsystems and makes recommendations with the aim of reducing the risks arising in this area,and- the Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS; formerly the Euro-currencyStanding Committee), which analyses global financial system conditions and makesrecommendations for improving market functioning.Current arrangements have made a significant contribution to raising standards of soundnessand risk awareness in financial systems. These are remarkable achievements even though theyare sector-specific in their approach. However, the pace of change in markets and financialintermediaries brought about by the process of global financial integration has increasinglyexposed the limitations of such an approach. The establishment of the Joint Forum onFinancial Conglomerates represented an initial response to the dichotomy of fragmentedsupervisory structures and increasingly integrated markets. The rationale behind such anapproach now has to be applied in a comprehensive manner.There are three aspects to this: firstly, overcoming the separate treatment of micro-prudentialand macro-prudential issues; secondly, bringing together the major international institutions
3BIS Review   21/1999and key national authorities involved in financial sector stability; and thirdly, integratingemerging markets more closely in this process.Ultimately, the process of strengthening cooperation should make a significant contribution toa better functioning of the financial markets. This will make possible a full utilisation of theconsiderable benefits which free capital movements provide to all participants in the globalfinancial system.3.Areas in which improvement is neededRecent events in international financial markets have highlighted three areas in whichimprovement is needed.Firstly, strengthened efforts are necessary to help identify incipient vulnerabilities in nationaland international financial systems and concerted procedures are needed for a betterunderstanding of the sources of systemic risk and to formulate effective financial, regulatoryand supervisory policies to mitigate them.Secondly, more effective procedures are required to ensure that international rules andstandards of best practice are developed and implemented, and that gaps in such standards areeffectively identified and filled.Thirdly, improved arrangements are necessary to ensure that consistent international rules andarrangements apply across all types of significant financial institutions, and that proceduresexist for the continuous flow of information among authorities having responsibility forfinancial stability.Some elaboration of each of these areas follows.3.1Identification of incipient vulnerabilities and concerted efforts to mitigate systemic riskRecent events have underscored the importance of assessing domestic vulnerabilities in thelight of evolving global conditions and vice versa, and of relaying such assessments torelevant parties to forestall delays in the correction of inadequate structures and ofdestabilising trends.While the national authorities, the IFIs, the international regulatory bodies and the centralbank groupings each gather and assess data on segments or the whole of the internationalfinancial system, and regularly monitor aspects of financial system stability, none has thebreadth of information or the capacity to formulate a complete assessment of evolving risks.In view of the many sources from which systemic risk can arise, better procedures are neededfor systematically pooling and efficiently using the information available to these bodies intheir assessment of domestic financial vulnerabilities and global conditions.Recent events have also illustrated the potential risks to the world economy arising fromfinancial market problems, and the threat of chain reactions in the financial sector. This hasdemonstrated the paramount importance of mitigating systemic risk by better understandingand alleviating the factors that bear on it. Disabling shocks to the global financial system canarise from a variety of factors and circumstances, including macroeconomic weaknesses, thecollapse of major individual institutions, and weaknesses in the infrastructure that underpinsand connects financial systems. That requires transparency, close monitoring and, ifnecessary, coherent and appropriate action to forestall accelerating developments.The various regulatory groupings deal predominantly with micro-prudential issues pertainingto the stability of the individual institutions within their purview. However, the greaterimportance of financial markets for channelling funds from surplus to deficit sectors and formanaging a wide variety of different risks has made it increasingly important to focus on thesustainable functioning of markets, which includes the health and operation of individualinstitutions. This implies a greater need to consider micro-prudential policies in a wider
BIS Review   21/19994setting, including the ways in which such policies could be blunted or sharpened by marketpractices and disciplines, or have unintended aggregation effects. Greater efforts are alsoneeded to foster improvements in the functioning of markets, including systematicallyoverseeing the processes by which markets and market participants are adequately informed.Systemic threats can also arise from unsupervised financial service providers, notably majorhighly leveraged institutions (as has been underlined in a recent report by the BCBS entitled“Sound Practices for Banks’ Interactions with Highly Leveraged Institutions”). Additionally,spill-over effects could arise from difficulties at non-bank financial institutions and largeinsurance companies. Developing an appropriate response will require the involvement of thevarious regulatory groupings and the national authorities of the markets in which theseentities are domiciled and operate.3.2Developing and implementing standards and codes of conductStrengthening financial systems will demand a systematic approach to ensuring that gaps ininternational standards or codes of conduct are identified and effectively filled. This calls forintensified cooperation and coordination between the national authorities, internationalregulatory bodies and the IFIs charged with monitoring and fostering implementation. Inparticular, national authorities and the regulatory groupings need to ensure that the process ofdeveloping standards benefits from the wide-ranging information obtained by the IFIs in theirsurveillance and assistance activities in individual countries. Greater involvement in theseprocesses of the emerging market economies to which those standards would apply is neededto augment their commitment to implementing them.A significant challenge for the international community in the years ahead will be to fosterand monitor the worldwide implementation of accepted best practices and, in particular,compliance with the Core Principles issued by both the BCBS and IOSCO, and those beingdeveloped by other international groupings. The IFIs, using their established procedures forconsultations, will need to assist countries in strengthening their financial systems. Theinformation and expertise available to national authorities and international supervisorygroupings can enhance the effectiveness of the IFIs in these tasks and vice versa.National and international regulatory authorities must also develop procedures to ensure thatmarket participants pay heed to the standards that have been developed in managing andpricing the risks they incur with respect to their counterparties. Strengthened procedures willbe needed to coordinate and promote efficiency in this effort, as well as to avoid overlapsbetween the IFIs, and also with the rule-making capacities of the international supervisorybodies.3.3Improvements in cross-sector financial supervisionThe international regulatory groupings have made considerable progress in harmonising andstrengthening national financial regulation and supervision. Minimum standards have raisedlevels of soundness and helped to create a more level playing field, and the continuingissuance of risk-management guidance improves defences at individual institutions. Theseefforts, including the work of the Joint Forum, should be sustained. At the same time, furtherefforts are required to address issues raised by the blurring of distinctions between differenttypes of financial operations and institutions. Advances on issues such as consistent rules forthe treatment of risk, arrangements for the pooling of information, and closer cooperationbetween different supervisory authorities continue to be hampered by the fact that countrieshave different financial and supervisory systems.The functional bodies also need to take account of the work being done by private sectorgroupings and to assess, in cooperation with national authorities, the question of theappropriate prudential and regulatory response to significant players operating outside
5BIS Review   21/1999existing regulatory arrangements, including the adjustment of prudential policies governingthose within their purview.3.4Specific issues to be addressedFrom the current standpoint, action is required in the following areas:- improving arrangements for the surveillance of global vulnerabilities, including thepooling of information available to the IFIs and the international regulatory groupings, thedevelopment and assessment of macro early warning indicators, and the creation ofprocedures to ensure that information reaches the relevant parties; –creating procedures for coordinating the work of national and international regulatorygroupings, and for the exchange and pooling of information among them;- assessing the need for the regulation of non-regulated entities;- strengthening and, where appropriate, encouraging the development and implementation ofinternational best practices and standards, including fostering improved in-house riskmanagement at financial institutions in the wake of recent market events, and promotingappropriate transparency and disclosure rules for all market participants.4.Proposal for improved cooperation in the area of international financial marketsurveillance and supervision: convening a Financial Stability ForumThe previous sections set out a number of specific areas in which existing arrangements forthe supervision and surveillance of the international financial system could be strengthened.Sweeping institutional changes are not needed to realise these improvements. Instead, aprocess in line with the mandate should be set in motion to ensure that national andinternational authorities and groupings can coordinate efforts to promote the stability of theinternational financial system and to improve the functioning of the markets in order to reducesystemic risk.The following approach would appear to be suitable:The G-7 should take the initiative in convening a Financial Stability Forum. Such a Forumshould meet regularly to assess issues and vulnerabilities affecting the global financial systemand to identify and oversee the actions needed to address them. The Forum would report tothe G-7 Ministers and Central Bank Governors. It would replace the series of ad hoc groupsthat have been convened by the G-7 over the past few years with a view to strengthening theinternational financial system.The Forum should be limited to a size that permits an effective exchange of views and theachievement of action-oriented results within a reasonable time frame. In developingobjectives, priorities and programmes for action, the Forum would work through its members,taking into account their comparative advantages.The members of the Forum would be representatives of national and international authoritiesresponsible for questions of international financial stability. It would comprise the ministriesof finance, central banks and senior supervisory authorities – initially of the G-7 countries. Inaddition, the IFIs and key international regulatory groupings would participate.Representation should be at a high level (i.e. Deputy Ministers and Deputy Governors,Deputy Heads of the IFIs, Chairs and appointed members of international groupings).Given the need for the Forum to have a manageable size, national representation would belimited to three members; the IFIs (IMF and IBRD) would be represented by two participantseach, the other international organisations (BIS and OECD) by one member each; theinternational regulatory groupings (BCBS, IOSCO and IAIS) would be represented by twomembers each, and the CGFS and CPSS by one each. Participation could over time be
BIS Review   21/19996extended to include representatives from a small number of additional (i.e. non G-7) nationalauthorities that could contribute substantially to the process, or to invite them to attendmeetings as guests.The chairperson should be appointed in a personal capacity for a period of time which isadequate to ensure continuity in the work of the Forum. Experience would seem to indicate aterm of not less than three years.I would like to suggest the appointment of Mr Andrew Crockett, General Manager of the BIS,for a term of three years.The Forum would meet as often as needed to achieve its objectives. Initially two meetings ayear could be envisaged. The first meeting of the Forum could be held in spring 1999.The Forum could ask members to form working groups in order to facilitate its work oraddress specific ad hoc issues. A permanent “Chairman’s Group” composed of therepresentatives of the IFIs and the international regulatory groupings and, if necessary, ofnational supervisors directly involved in specific issues could meet around or between theForum’s meetings to coordinate follow-up activities to the Forum’s outcome.Support for the Forum would be provided by a small secretariat located at the BIS in Basle.Members of the secretariat could be drawn from the BIS and from the participatinginternational financial institutions. Staff from the IFIs would not be expected to move toBasle; if appropriate, they could remain based in Washington, working closely with theircolleagues in Basle.This BIS Review is available on the BIS website at www.bis.org.
1BIS Review   18/1999Mr Heikensten looks at the current economic situation in SwedenSpeech by the First Deputy Governor of Sveriges Riksbank, the Swedish central bank,Mr Lars Heikensten, to Forum ’99, the Swedish Federation of Rental Property Owners, inStockholm on 15/02/99.I should like to begin with a word of thanks for the invitation to talk here today abouteconomic developments, inflation and the interest rate.Before taking a look at the current economic situation and saying something about ourdeliberations in the Riksbank, however, I feel there may be grounds for adopting a somewhatbroader perspective and even for striking a slightly optimistic note. Sweden certainly haseconomic problems; further measures are needed, not least to improve the conditions forgrowth. But at times it may also be fitting to recall the things that have turned out well.Swedish economic policy was realigned in the early 1990s with the aim of establishing aregime of low inflation. Previously, Sweden had had a long tradition in this respect but in the1970s and 80s the accepted truths were discarded, including the idea that low inflationprovides a good foundation for growth and employment. Following the collapse of the BrettonWoods system, stabilisation policy no longer offered any hard and fast rules. Sweden’sexternal debt – both government debt and the total stock – was allowed to grow at a dramaticrate, accompanied by spiralling prices and wages.Today, Sweden is in the sixth successive year of good economic growth. Growth since 1993has averaged almost 3 per cent a year. The deep recession and good investment activity sincethen have meant that in this period there has been a supply of unutilised resources. As a result,inflation has remained low even though growth may have been somewhat above the level thatcan be regarded as sustainable. Moreover, Sweden has begun to repay external debt andgovernment finances have recovered after the crisis in the wake of the 1980s bubble. In recentyears household earned income has been able to grow strongly in real terms, partly thanks tothe low inflation.Altered monetary policy processThe laws that regulate the Riksbank were amended with effect from the beginning of this year.Monetary policy’s objective is now explicitly stated to be to maintain price stability. TheRiksbank has a new Executive Board, consisting of six full-time members, that independentlydecides monetary policy issues.The new Executive Board entails some changes in the work on monetary policy. The centre ofattention is the Board’s specific monetary policy meetings, which it is envisaged will be heldeight to 10 times a year. Decisions about the repo rate, for example, will normally be taken atthose meetings. A brief account of the Board’s decisions is to be presented in a communiquéthe day after the meeting; a more detailed picture of the discussions will be available in theminutes of the meetings, which will be published with a time lag of six to eight weeks. Asbefore, the Riksbank will be publishing an inflation report four times a year, with a morecomprehensive survey of inflationary pressure in the Swedish economy in the coming 24months.
BIS Review   18/19992The Executive Board held its first monetary policy meeting last Thursday and discussedinflation prospects. The Board then decided to lower the repo rate 0.25 percentage point andalso lowered the corridor in which the repo rate lies by 0.5 percentage point. The Board’sdecisions and the arguments behind them were published in a communiqué on Friday.Another feature of the new Riksbank organisation is that each member of the Executive Boardhas an individual mandate and one vote. All the members are in a position to make speechesand give interviews on monetary policy in which they express their own view of the situation.It follows that the members can hold different opinions and may also express themselvessomewhat differently about joint positions.Today I shall base my remarks on the picture that was used for last week’s Executive Boarddiscussion and summarised in the communiqué. When I elaborate on the communiqué it is mypersonal opinion I am expressing, though that does not mean that other Board members werenot of broadly the same mind.Poorer international prospectsIn the course of last year, international economic prospects became a good deal worse. At thebeginning of 1998 it was assumed that a weaker international trend could be offset by otherfactors, of which one was the good domestic demand. At an early stage, actually when theRiksbank raised the interest rate in the late autumn of 1997, it was pointed out, however, thatthe international trend could be weaker than assumed in our main scenario and that the crisiscould lead to a slowdown in Sweden as well.The signals of an international slowdown that would also affect growth in Sweden becameincreasingly clear. The Riksbank therefore successively revised its forecasts in a downwarddirection and eased the monetary stance in June. This follows from our policy framework,which calls for a lower repo rate when inflation in the forecast period is expected to be belowthe target and vice versa. The repo rate was cut in two more steps in November, from 4.10 to3.60 per cent, followed by a further reduction to 3.40 per cent in December when the forecastwas revised downwards again.Even after the series of downward revisions during the autumn, the December assessment stillcarried a downside risk of the international slowdown being even more pronounced andprolonged than expected.The uncertainty about international economic prospects has been accentuated somewhat bythe economic problems in Brazil and the real’s depreciation since the turn of the year. Theworld economy may be affected contagiously, either via real mechanisms or via increasedfinancial market turbulence. Under normal circumstances, the real economic effects in theindustrialised world from decreased trade with Brazil should be relatively limited. There is arisk, however, of the crisis also becoming more profound among Brazil’s neighbours, leadingin time to somewhat larger repercussions in the industrialised countries as well. The effectsvia financial markets could be greater in the short run but developments to date in this respecthave been better than many feared.The picture in other parts of the world economy at the end of 1998 is somewhat varied.Growth in the U.S. economy is still good, whereas the slowdown in the euro area has become
3BIS Review   18/1999slightly more marked than many observers counted on and we have yet to see an economicrecovery in Japan.The sustained strength of the U.S. economy is mainly due to the unbroken growth of privateconsumption – the slowdown that was foreseen in our December Inflation Report has still tomaterialise. The stock exchange has recovered from last autumn’s fall and even reached newall-time highs. Together with a positive development of employment, this has helped improvethe confidence of American consumers.In time, however, a slowdown in the U.S. economy still seems probable; but the course to datedoes suggest that it will not occur as soon as the Riksbank expected earlier, in which case thetrend in 1999 may be stronger. A more dramatic downturn could occur if the U.S. stockmarkets were to fall markedly. Even without this, economic activity could slacken inconnection with decreased investment on account of falling demand and lower profits, as wellas with a lower consumption propensity among households whose debt burden is already veryhigh.In the euro area the available statistics indicate that the slackening of activity in the lateautumn and winter was more marked than expected, mainly on account of weaker exports.Manufacturers and households differ in their assessments of the future; the former count on aturn for the worst, whereas consumer confidence has continued to improve. The direction inwhich confidence moves for these two groups will be crucial for prospects in the euro area.The optimistic trend among households has so far helped to mitigate the consequences ofdecreased external demand. The question is whether this will continue to be the case ifindustrial activity does not take a turn for the better.The Japanese economy has not shown any clear signs of recovering, though in some respectsit does seem to have stabilised. The future path here is still highly uncertain.All in all, the statistics point to an international trend in the next two years that is weaker thatin the Riksbank’s main scenario last autumn, though the differences should not beexaggerated. Together with lower commodity prices, the weaker international activity shouldresult in lower external price pressure.The outlook in 2000 and beyond is, however, very difficult to foresee. One uncertainty is theendurance of U.S. economic growth. Will it be possible to maintain the high growth and lowinflation despite the high level of share prices and the low saving ratio? Another questionconcerns Europe: will any slowdown in the United States be offset by a stable recovery inEurope, underpinned by private consumption? Finally, can the Japanese economy finallyshake off the profound crisis? A clearly positive outcome in any of these respects wouldprovide conditions for a trend that is stronger than the main scenario’s.Sweden’s currency and interest rateThe lower inflationary pressure that was indicated by international developments last autumnwas accompanied by a weakening of the Swedish krona that could result in higher inflation. Amore permanently weak krona can lead to higher inflation as a result of higher resourceutilisation as well as higher import prices.
BIS Review   18/19994In the December forecast the Riksbank envisaged that the krona would appreciate in thecoming two years. Since then, however, the krona has strengthened more markedly than weexpected: to date in 1999 the exchange rate has appreciated almost 5 per cent in terms of theTCW index and a little more than 6 per cent against the euro.A considerable part of the krona’s appreciation and stabilisation should be seen as a return toa more normal situation after the financial markets’ very turbulent and volatile autumn. At theheight of the unrest, investors sold certain currencies in favour of the safety of largercurrencies. Currencies of countries which, like Sweden, have a high foreign debt were mostexposed. The currencies of Australia and Canada, which, like Sweden, target inflation with aflexible exchange rate, depreciated markedly last autumn; in the calmer situation since theturn of the year, these currencies have also strengthened and become more stable.Another factor in the krona’s case is that higher expectations of Sweden joining the euro areahave helped push our currency closer to the value implied by economic fundamentals. In therun up to Stage Three there was also some apprehension about how the krona might beaffected; after the event, this unrest tended to subside.The Riksbank’s forecast has thus proved to be on the cautious side to date. Nonetheless, I donot consider that developments warrant a revision of our long-term assessment last December,namely a gradual appreciation in terms of the TCW index to about 118 by the end of 2000.Since the publication of the December Inflation Report, interest rates in Sweden have fallen,by almost 0.15 percentage point in the case of the three-month rate and 0.4 percentage pointfor 10-year bonds.In that inflation expectations have not moved down as much as the nominal interest rates, thereal level of interest rates has also fallen and is now historically low. The pronounceddownward movement may turn out to have included some overshoot in the market, to befollowed by an upward adjustment of market rates. Signs of this have been discernible inrecent weeks. Even so, the real level of interest rates is expected to remain low and should actas a stimulus to the Swedish economy, above all in the somewhat longer run.The domestic economyIn our December Inflation Report, the GDP growth rate was assumed to be between 2.5 and 3per cent in 1998, between 2 and 2.5 per cent in 1999 and around 2.5 per cent in 2000. Theavailable statistics suggest that our forecast for 1998 is probably correct. For 1999 and 2000,however, we consider that the December forecasts are somewhat too optimistic.One of the items we believe may be weaker is foreign trade. With the poorer outlook for theinternational economy, net exports could be lower in the years ahead. Industrial activity maythen also continue to slacken. The expectations of Swedish firms are low, above all inmanufacturing, and this could have a downward effect on investment.On the other hand, the statistics show that private consumption is still strong, with a 1998third-quarter increase that exceeded expectations. House prices and the number of new carsregistered are continuing to rise and retail turnover is also moving upwards. Other signs areincreased lending to households and the growth of the money supply. Households areoptimistic about their own economic situation, one reason being the growth of real disposable
5BIS Review   18/1999wage income; a marked increase in 1999 is implied by the low level of inflation and the taxcuts. Another contributory factor is probably the fall in interest expenditure. The mood amonghouseholds will be crucial for private consumption’s future path.As I see it, however, there are certain grounds for fearing that even consumption will besomewhat weaker than we counted on in December, when our forecast includedcomparatively strong consumption activity in the coming years. While households areoptimistic about their own economic situation, the view of Sweden’s economy andemployment’s future development is more dismal. Poorer international economic prospectsand the more pessimistic expectations of firms are liable to dampen the optimism ofhouseholds and thereby private consumption.The statistics on industrial capacity utilisation continue to present a varied picture. At totallevel, however, we consider that in the coming two years the Swedish economy will still havesome surplus capacity and this is expected to be somewhat larger than we envisaged inDecember. The crucial question here is the future development of households’ expectations.Continued optimism could result in sustained domestic demand that tends to offset the moresubdued international trend and the weaker investment activity.Construction and property marketFor this Forum it may also be appropriate to say something about the situation in theconstruction sector. Construction activity shows a cyclical pattern, with strongly rising costsin upward phases. An upswing here may therefore entail risks of inflation.In a historical perspective, the level of construction activity in Sweden in recent years hasbeen very low. As a result, smaller firms have had to close and construction labour has movedabroad or gone to other domestic sectors. There are now many indications that constructionactivity is picking up again, though the rate of the recovery is difficult to assess. But housingdemand has grown and there is a large need for new housing as well as for renovation. TheRiksbank does not produce independent estimates; the available figures suggest, however, thatin the coming decade between 20,000 and 45,000 new dwelling units need to be built eachyear and between 30,000 and 40,000 units a year need to be renovated. Activity may thengrow rapidly in certain regions.Now that construction is recovering, the increased concentration among constructioncompanies and producers of construction materials, as well as the shortages in certaincategories of skilled labour, are liable to push costs and wages up. Certain problems withbottlenecks are already discernible; in the business tendency surveys from the NationalInstitute of Economic Research, labour shortages are reported by 7 per cent of constructionfirms as against 2 per cent in March 1998. These shortages are accompanied by a high overalllevel of unemployment among construction workers; part of the explanation is thatunemployment is high in certain regions and those who are unemployed there are reluctant tomove a long way to regions where labour demand is stronger.Bottleneck problems in the construction industry are being studied on behalf of theGovernment by industry representatives. This Construction Sector Group has found thatapproximately one-third of unemployed construction workers lack occupational experienceand around 6 per cent also lack formal training. In that the average age of constructionworkers is rising and young people do not find construction work attractive, the bottleneck
BIS Review   18/19996problems may become even greater in the future. In order to prevent this from leading tosizeable problems, proposals have been put forward for increased mobility, improvedcompetence and marketing of construction courses, for example.Construction costs are measured by the factor price index (FPI); the largest item is wage costs.The price of completed dwellings, on the other hand, is measured by the building price index(BPI), which also includes the construction companies’ productivity and profit margins. Theseindexes do show relatively large price increases but there are no actual signs of any directrisks of an inflationary development in Sweden in the coming years, provided that thebottleneck problems do not increase.The rising costs associated with earlier upswings in activity have been connected with thecontemporary subsidy systems as well as the high degree of concentration in the constructionmarket. The revised system for financing residential construction has appreciably reduced oneof these problems: construction companies as well as consumers are exposed more directly toproduction costs. But the problem of concentration in the construction market still remainsand may be a future cause for concern.Future monetary policyIn the main scenario in the December Inflation Report, the 12-month change in the CPI wasprojected to be 1.2 per cent in December 1999 and 1.4 per cent in December 2000. Inflation’sunderlying rate in those months was expected to be 1.7 and 1.8 per cent, respectively. TheRiksbank also noted that as the slowdown in international activity could prove to be moremarked and more prolonged, the downside risk in the assessment was greater than the upsiderisk. In recent months the international picture has tended to shift in that direction.Immediate inflationary pressure in Sweden has been lower than the Riksbank counted on inDecember. The outturn for inflation in December 1998 was 0.3 percentage point below thefigure in the Report’s main scenario; around 0.1 percentage point of the difference can beattributed to lower interest expenditure and approximately 0.1 percentage point to lower worldmarket prices for oil. Moreover, underlying inflation has been somewhat weaker thanexpected.As I mentioned earlier, the Executive Board considered that the prospects for internationaleconomic activity and inflation are somewhat more subdued than they were in December andthis will probably lead to economic activity and inflation in Sweden being slightly weaker inthe next two years than the Riksbank counted on earlier.CPI inflation is accordingly expected to be below the 2 per cent target in one to two years’time. To some extent this is a consequence of transitory factors that are judged to have nopermanent effect on either inflation or the inflation process and should therefore not influencethe formulation of monetary policy. These transitory factors – altered indirect taxes andsubsidies as well as lower interest expenditure – are projected to lower the CPI by between 0.5and 1 percentage point in the coming two years. But even excluding the transitory factors, it isconsidered that inflation will be below the target in 1999 and 2000.In the light of its assessment, last Thursday the Executive Board decided to ease the monetarystance. The future formulation of policy is something that will also be discussed in theInflation Report, which will be published on March 25th.
BIS Review   17/1999Mr Reddy discusses issues in fixed income marketsInaugural address by Dr Y V Reddy, a Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the seminaron fixed income markets, organised by the National Stock Exchange and ISMA in Mumbai on11/02/99. (Dr Reddy expresses his gratitude to Dr A Prasad for his valuable assistance.)I am happy to be with you today at this seminar organised by the National Stock Exchange (NSE)and the International Securities Market Association (ISMA). The NSE needs no introduction to thisaudience. Mr Patil has been, at our request, working closely with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) onvarious issues and we value his advice. The NSE also has representatives on a number of committeeslooking into different aspects of the market.ISMA has been performing the role of an effective self regulatory organisation (SRO) and the rulesframed by ISMA have become a benchmark for the fixed income securities market. Hence, theexpertise and experience that ISMA has gained over the years would be valuable to us in RBI also aswe continue to develop our markets.The objective of this seminar is to assess recent changes in the Indian fixed income market, reviewthe international experience in the development of this segment of financial markets and flag theagenda for future action.Major reform measures in the financial sector have been undertaken by the Reserve Bank of Indiasince the beginning of the 1990s. Reform in the government securities market is important in view ofits role in setting benchmarks in the rest of the financial markets. It is also crucial for bringing aboutan effective and reliable transmission channel for the use of indirect instruments of monetary control.A notable change was the switch from administered low coupon government borrowings to auctionsin government securities at market related rates. Introduction of primary dealers has to some extentimproved the liquidity in the secondary market. Innovative financial instruments were introduced,such as zero coupon bonds, floating rate bonds, capital indexed bonds, securities on which paymentis made in instalments, etc. In addition, 14, 91 and 364-day T-bills presented investment avenues fordeployment of short-term funds to investors. Counterparty risk in securities settlement has beeneliminated with the introduction of Delivery versus Payment system (DVP).I had, in an earlier speech a couple of months ago on debt markets, presented an agenda for furtheraction, which covered, among others, technology, regulatory and legal issues, and the need forstandardisation of practices in the debt markets. In fact, only a couple of weeks ago, I spoke at lengthon reforms in the money market also. So, perhaps there is no need to go into the details of eitherreform measures or agenda for action in these markets today.I observe that today’s seminar is structured in three sessions: transparency in fixed income markets,regulation in repo markets and regulation issues in an integrated market environment. These issuesare of critical importance in the development of the debt markets and it may be useful to quicklyreview what we have achieved so far and what needs to be done. I will therefore address only thoseissues that are receiving specific attention in the seminar today.Transparency in fixed income marketsIt is widely recognised that weaknesses in the provision and use of information played a major partin the development and spread of recent international financial crises. A number of internationalgroups have since been examining issues relating to the stability of the financial system. One suchworking group of The Willard Group examined transparency and accountability issues. This grouphas defined transparency as a process by which information about existing conditions, decisions andactions is made accessible, visible and understandable. Undeniably, transparency contributes to theefficient allocation of resources by ensuring that market participants have sufficient information.
– 2 –BIS Review   17/1999This information is meant to enable them to identify risks and to distinguish one firm’scircumstances from another’s. Moreover, transparency helps inform market expectations. In turn,this helps stabilise markets during periods of uncertainty and also contributes to the effectiveness ofannounced policies. However, admittedly, there are limits to transparency. Some categories ofinformation are costly to compile. In such cases, infrequent disclosure may be justified. Further,confidentiality may be warranted in some circumstances.In determining the appropriate degree of transparency, the benefits must be balanced against costs.Transparency should not mean that there will be a one-size-fits-all code on this. Of course, in thefinal analysis, transparency will be with reference to factors considered relevant, which itselfdepends on the model for analysis that is considered useful. Also, transparency gives facts, butinference is a different matter and a judgment based on such inference is yet another matter.Personally, I believe that transparency is primarily the best test of our good intentions.Hence, the Reserve Bank of India is disseminating exhaustive information relating to activities, bothin the primary and secondary markets, especially the government securities market. For instance,detailed results of auctions of T-bills and dated governments securities including weighted averageprice, devolvement on primary dealers and RBI, and information on fixed rate repos are issuedthrough regular press statements. The RBI also issues a daily press release giving details ofsecondary market transactions in the government securities markets. In addition to information on T-bills and dated government securities, the monthly RBI Bulletin and the Weekly StatisticalSupplement to the RBI Bulletin contain information relating to open market operations and repotransactions of the RBI. The RBI website, which has been appreciated by many, as emulatinginternational standards in excellence, also contains up-to-date information on financial markets.Until 1994, the debt market was purely a telephone market meaning that all trades were negotiatedand concluded directly by investors. The NSE introduced a screen-based trading system with theobjective of increasing transparency in the market. But the general experience is that while actualtrade is still negotiated over the counter, mere reporting is done through such a system. However,greater use of the online trading system is required rather than a mere reporting of trades in order toenhance transparency. Success will depend mainly on an increase in the number of transactions. Alarge number of transactions would result in a successful continuous order book for matching thetrades. If the negotiated telephone deals are moved to a screen-based system, full information aboutvolume and price of transacted security would be available online. This would result in better pricediscovery and promote transparency and efficiency in the market.Currently, the daily available information to the market regarding secondary market trades is basedon actual settlement through Subsidiary General Ledger on a particular date. This may notnecessarily reflect a deal concluded on the same date as the SGL transfer form has to be lodgedwithin 24 hours of the contract but not necessarily on the date of actual deal. Thus, an informationgap exists between the deal date, contract date and actual settlement date. Screen-based tradingwould obviate this shortcoming.The RBI is actively coordinating with the Primary Dealers Association in developing an ElectronicDealing System to facilitate dealing in money market, government securities and other debtinstruments. This will lend transparency and efficiency to market operations. It will also enable theRBI to monitor developments in the market online.The RBI has embarked on computerisation of its Public Debt Offices. This would link Public DebtOffices in the RBI with banks’ treasury offices. Hopefully, primary dealers/satellite dealers, otherSGL account holders and stock exchanges will also be linked.
– 3 –BIS Review   17/1999There is enormous advantage in providing member terminals to SGL account holders as this willenable them to view RBI announcements regarding fresh auction, floatation of issue, conversion ofloans, repo auctions, interest rate resets for floating bonds and other such information. Marketparticipants will also be able to tender bids in auctions of dated government securities, T-bills andrepos from all centres. The entire auction process, including allotment, determining andcommunicating payment amount, and advising successful and rejected bids to bidders, will beonline. The list of successful bidders and the consideration amount payable would form the input tothe settlement and servicing system.While the link-up has advantages, it can be made operational only through electronic SGL forms.Early enactment of the new Government Securities Act replacing the Public Debt Act 1944 isessential since it will provide the RBI with substantive powers to design and introduce electronicSGL transfer forms.Regulation in the repo marketIn our market, interbank repos are permitted under regulated conditions. After the irregularities insecurities transactions in 1992, eligible participants and instruments have generally been restrictedbut subsequently liberalised in a gradual manner. Now, all government securities have been madeeligible for repo. Besides banks, primary dealers are allowed to undertake repo/reverse repotransactions. Nonbank participants have also recently been allowed to lend money through reverserepo to other eligible participants. In terms of instruments, repos have also been permitted in PSUbonds and private and corporate debt securities, provided they are held in dematerialised form in adepository and the transactions are done through a recognised stock exchange. However, this can beoperationalised after the government issues a clarification regarding applicability of stamp duties ontransactions in dematerialised instruments.Admittedly, the interbank repo market in India needs to be made more transparent and betterstandardised. I have, time and again, been encouraging market participants to evolve code of bestpractices in the repo market through the Primary Dealers Association or FIMMDAI. The RBI hasalso been actively pursuing this issue in the Advisory Committee on Government Securities marketand the Standing Committee on Money Market. Issues relating to evolving a code of best practicesuch as eligibility of participants and their requirements, eligibility of instruments for repo, generalstandards, systems and documentation, legal agreement, margin, deal confirmations, and defaultscenario were discussed in the recent meeting of the Standing Committee on Money Market held onFebruary 3, 1999. In fact, pursuant to the discussions on the same subject in the meeting ofTechnical Advisory Committee on Government Securities Market held in November 1998, aninternal subgroup of that committee is already looking into various aspects of repo marketexpansion, including issues comprising legal status, regulatory framework, standardisation of repocontracts and accounting system and introduction of tripartite repos. The subgroup is expected tocomplete its report by mid-March 1999. We expect that a standard repo agreement will emerge verysoon from the subgroup’s recommendations. We also expect the participants to adopt them once it isconsidered appropriate by the RBI.In this connection, I wish to recall that the RBI announced in the October 1998 review of monetarypolicy that call/notice/term money market should purely be an interbank market with additionalaccess only to primary dealers. This implies that nonbank players have to be encouraged to deploytheir short-term surpluses in other money market instruments. For instance, they can be allowed toborrow and lend freely through repos in both government and non-government securities. Thus,development of repo market assumes increased significance in the interest of further reforms in thefinancial markets.
– 4 –BIS Review   17/1999Issues in regulation under an integrated market environmentIn an integrated market, the regulatory framework should ensure that there are no regulatory overlapsor regulatory gaps in the financial system. The Deshpande Committee highlighted these gaps andoverlaps and recommended amendment to Section 29A of the Securities Contract (Regulation) Act1956 to enable the government to provide jurisdiction to the RBI also in regulation over money anddebt markets. With this, the respective regulatory roles of the RBI and SEBI in the debt market willbe formalised. The proposed change in the SCRA is bound to pave way for a much more active repomarket.In the PSU and corporate bond market, an important issue relates to large resources raised throughprivate placement. No doubt, private placements offer a number of advantages. However, this marketremains largely unregulated. Healthy development of the private placement market calls for moretransparency, better disclosure and protection of investor interests.A liberalised and integrated market environment also means that risks get transmitted from onesegment of the market to another more rapidly. Market participants have to ensure that proper riskmanagement systems are in place. In India, banks are the major players in the financial markets. TheRBI has already circulated draft guidelines for ALM for banks, which indicate prudential limits forcall borrowings. These guidelines will be operative from April 1, 1999.ConclusionAs I mentioned at the beginning, I have flagged some issues that are currently engaging our attentionin the fixed income market. I trust that these and other issues would be deliberated upon later duringthe day. I would be happy to have feedback from the organisers about the outcome of the seminar.* * *
BIS Review   17/1999Mr George’s closing speech at the Euromoney International Bond CongressSpeech by the Governor of the Bank of England, Mr E A J George, at the Euromoney InternationalBond Congress in London on 10/02/99.Thank you, Padraic. I wasn’t quite sure what you had in mind when you asked me to wind up thisCongress once again this year. I couldn’t remember what I’d done to wind you all up last year! But Iam happy to join you anyway at what has become – in five short years – an unmissable event in thecalendar for anyone with an interest in the international bond markets.And what an extraordinary year it’s been since we all last met here. Despite all the upsets –beginning in Asia, then Russia and most recently Brazil – which had everyone scrambling forliquidity and desperate to reduce risk, it proved, on IFR’s figures, to be a record year forinternational bond issues, with total issuance rising by some 17% to over a trillion dollars equivalent.That can’t have been bad for fees! And altogether it suggests you had a pretty good year – apart fromthose of you who chose to go on holiday in August leaving someone else to look after your longpositions in Russian bonds.Inevitably issuance by emerging market economies fell away, but issuance by supranational andsovereign borrowers in aggregate still accounted for some 30% of total issuance.At the same time, higher rated corporate borrowers took advantage of lower yields to strengthentheir balance sheets, accounting for 45% of total issuance. This was despite a general widening ofcredit spreads – which though they have come back some way from the peak levels of the autumnare – and are likely to remain – substantially wider than before the emerging markets crisis,reflecting a more sober assessment of relative credit risk. Against that, the bond markets generallybenefited substantially from continuing low inflation and a further decline in inflationaryexpectations, so that yields have declined in virtually all the main currency sectors. In terms ofgovernment bonds they have come down by 100 basis points in the US, by 150 basis points in bunds,by close to 200 basis points in the sterling gilt market, and even by over 100 basis points in Japanbefore yields there began to back up late last year. Borrowers have been attracted by lower nominalborrowing costs; and investors in the market have been attracted by the prospect of rising values asyields have declined. Significantly, the decline in yields in the underlying government bond marketshas typically more than offset the widening in spreads faced by lesser credits. In the US corporatebond market, for example, BBB spreads widened over the year from around 75 basis points toaround 140 basis points, but because of the underlying fall in yields, yields paid by BBB borrowersactually fell from around 6½% to 6%. Similarly, in the sterling market here, lower grade spreadswidened from around 80 basis points to over 150 basis points but yields paid fell from just over 7%to around 6%. The result has been a notably effective contribution by the bond market to meeting thefinancing needs of the corporate sector.The past year has, also, in a real sense been the year of Europe. In any event, the prospect thenadvent of the euro was undoubtedly a major factor driving the increase in bond market activity.Issues by European borrowers accounted for some 25% of the total, and issues in Europeancurrencies rose to nearly 30%. Many issuers took the opportunity to issue tributary or parallel bondswhich were fungible with the launch of the euro. Others offered large benchmark issues withprovision for redenomination into the euro. In parallel, 1998 saw a further rapid expansion in thevolume of equity issuance by European names, fed partly by privatisation sales, but reflecting alsoincreased corporate use of the equity market to finance expansion and acquisitions. Even moreremarkably, merger and acquisition transactions in Europe rose nearly 50% in 1998, continuing atrend which has seen this area of activity increase by around 35% a year over the past five years.
– 2 –BIS Review   17/1999Moreover, January 1999 has by all accounts started the New Year in an even more active vein, witha very high volume of bonds issued, and with the euro accounting for over a third of the total. In part,this no doubt reflects the fact that the euro is, for the moment, the new kid on the block whicheveryone wants to meet. But more fundamentally it is a clear vote of confidence in the new currencythat such international interest should already be apparent in borrowing and investing in the euro,and in adapting and rebalancing portfolios to take account of this major change in the structure of thecapital markets.A hugely important contribution to this process has, of course, been the vast exercise to prepareconventions, processes and systems for the euro, both within firms and in the shared marketinfrastructure. The scale of work undertaken in all centres – but notably in London, because ofLondon’s pre-eminent position as the international centre for the bond markets – has been immenseand I want to pay tribute to the high professionalism with which the preparations and the conversionitself were conducted. People commented on how empty the bars and restaurants were in the City ofLondon over conversion weekend – which is remarkable in itself; but inside and indoors, 30,000 ormore people achieved a remarkable feat of engineering, all within the space of a three-day holidayweekend. It may not have been everyone’s preferred way of spending New Year’s Eve, but it wascertainly a very productive one. The good news is that everyone can come back and do it again thisyear for Y2K!So there is a lot you can feel positive about in the past year’s achievements and in the start you havemade to 1999. But, looking ahead, the world prospect remains uncertain. Notably, the emergingmarkets crisis has had an immense impact on international financial flows, and the economicadjustments that those shifts will bring in their wake are likely to have important impacts on thebond markets and on your business activity.As a measure of the impact of the emerging markets turbulence, the Institute of International Financerecently published data which show that total net private capital flows to the emerging markets(broadly defined) fell from some $325 billion in 1996 to around $150 billion last year. Within this,nonbank lending and portfolio equity inflows also fell back by around $60 billion (to around $50billion). Although direct investment in the emerging market countries held up pretty well (at around$100 billion), and despite a big increase of nearly $50 billion in official lending, there was a suddenhuge decline in the overall availability of finance to the emerging market economies. And that leftmany of them with sharply weakening exchange rates, and little choice but to contract their domesticeconomies.The immediate international priority last year was to contain the financial contagion – and there wassome progress in this direction following the initial shocks in Asia. But after the series of newshocks during last summer – Russia, LTCM, the deepening recession in Japan and the worseningposition in Brazil – the prospects, at around the time of the IMF meetings in Washington lastautumn, were looking pretty bleak.Now I would completely destroy my reputation as a central banker if I were to suggest that we areout of the woods. But the darkest financial storm clouds have lifted a little since the Fund meetings.The US Congress finally approved more resources for the IMF, the threat of a credit crunchextending to the industrial economies in the wake of LTCM receded, helped also by an easing ofmonetary policy in Europe as well as in the United States. In Asia, Japan took more determinedpolicy action to address the fragility of the banking system and to stimulate domestic demand; theyen strengthened; China and Hong Kong both remained admirably resolute; and there have evenbeen some encouraging signs of renewed capital inflows to some of the Asian countries. The floatingof the exchange rate in Brazil last month inevitably increased concerns about emerging marketinstability, but it is encouraging that adverse effects on other markets have so far been limited.
– 3 –BIS Review   17/1999There may be further particular setbacks, as far as the overall financial situation is concerned, but Ithink I can confidently say that if it doesn’t get any worse it is likely to get better. Risk aversion is allvery well for a time, but it doesn’t pay the rent!What we are now having to cope with are the economic consequences of the earlier financialdisturbances. The inevitable counterpart of recession in much of the rest of the world is a sharpslowdown of net external demand – particularly for manufactures – in the industrial world. That hasbeen reflected in growing weakness and falling business confidence in large parts of themanufacturing sector in both the United States and Europe. The prospective growth in worldeconomic activity has already roughly halved – from its trend rate of about 4%. Unless this fall in netexternal demand is offset by sustained domestic demand growth in the industrial countries – unless,in other words, the industrial economies collectively accommodate the necessary improvement in theexternal current account position of the emerging countries, through a deterioration in their owncurrent account positions – the prospects for world economic activity would be dismal.Happily, we start from a position of relatively low inflation throughout the industrial world and,faced with weakening external demand, we can afford to see higher offsetting domestic demandgrowth without jeopardising price stability. Indeed we need to see higher domestic demand growththan we otherwise would if overall demand is not to fall short of underlying supply capacity, and weneed it, too, to offset the effects of weak world prices and of lower exchange rates in many emergingmarket producers on our own domestic price level.These considerations largely explain the easing of monetary policy in the US and in Europe sincelast autumn. The fact that we reduced interest rates by different amounts, and that they remain atdifferent levels, is explained by differing assessments of the prospective impact on the pressure ofoverall demand, taking account of our own particular starting points. But the general nature of theresponse was driven by essentially similar considerations.Managing this global imbalance will be a considerable challenge for policymakers over the next fewyears; and helping to finance it – including helping to finance re-emerging markets – will be aconsiderable challenge for international bond markets. The fact that you are all here – and inevidently good form – after the past remarkable year suggests that you have strong nerves. You maywell need them again in the period ahead. But think of it this way. By the time we meet again for thisgreat Congress next year, Y2K will be behind you – and if you have survived that, you can surviveanything! I wish you all possible success.* * *
BIS Review   16/1999Mr Sabirin looks at how to create value with macroeconomic adjustmentsKeynote address by the Governor of the Bank of Indonesia, Dr Syahril Sabirin, at the PresidentsForum Dinner organized by Business Week in Singapore on 4/2/99.Ladies and GentlemenIt is both a pleasure and a great honor for me to be here to speak at this important forum. Let meextend my gratitude to the organizer and express my warm welcome to all participants in thisgathering this evening.The economic crisis that swept this region since almost two years ago has resulted in apreviously-unimaginable loss to the economies in the region: the loss of confidence from within andwithout, the loss of the value of assets, the loss of employment opportunities, and more importantlythe loss of opportunity to continue the high growth performance that the region had enjoyed formany years. But there are two aspects that I hope, and I believe, have not been lost, namely: (one)the pride that once these economies were called the Asian Tigers and that the performance of theseeconomies was named the East Asian Miracle, and (two) the confidence and the enthusiasm thatthese economies can become high performers once again.The value and everything else that were lost have to be regained. I do believe that the foundationsthat once transformed these regional economies into an economic growth area were not easily sweptaway. This region still possesses many ingredients for growth. It is endowed with a large industriouslabor force, the basic economic machinery is well developed, some of the economies are rich innatural resources, and – very importantly - the economies have the ability to adopt and implementthe necessary economic adjustment measures. It is the economic adjustment measures, ormacroeconomic policies in general, that I would like to focus on this evening, and what kind of valuethey have created for the economies.In a market oriented economy, the aim of macroeconomic policies can be summarized, in my view,in a simple phrase, namely to establish a conducive environment for economic activities to takeplace and for businesses to grow. Such an environment must consist of a number of things,including price stability, exchange rate stability, a well-functioning credit and payment system,efficient public administration, a just and well-functioning legal system, and well-developedinfrastructures. It is such an environment that the crisis-affected countries would need to rebuild.And it is such an environment that the policy makers in this region have been struggling toredevelop.As it is often true in many cases, problems and crises also bring with them opportunities. Among theopportunities associated with the economic crisis in Asia is the opportunity to look back andexamine very closely what is lacking and what needs to be done to strengthen the foundations forgrowth.The policy makers in this region have made use of the opportunities to restructure the bankingsystem, to introduce or revise the bankruptcy law as well as the law on competition, to trim andprivatize state-owned enterprises, to redefine the role of the central bank, and many other things. Allthese together should constitute a more solid foundation for future growth.The policy makers in this region have gone a long way. The monetary policies, and macroeconomicpolicies in general, have shown very encouraging results in terms of price and exchange ratestability. Interest rates, which had to be kept high during the stabilization period, have come down tomore affordable levels. Economic activities have shown some pick-up. And, it is quite possible inmy view that this region can become a growth center once again.
– 2 –BIS Review   16/1999However, we need to remain cautious given the uncertainties that linger in the world economy today.Recent devaluation of the Brazilian real, followed by the change in the exchange rate system, is justanother illustration of how high the uncertainty is. Therefore, in formulating future strategicdirections, in my view, we need to be optimistic, but cautiously optimistic.At the same time, the world is ever-changing. Quite a number of new developments have taken placein recent years, which directly or indirectly shaped the environment we are operating in. This yearwe also witnessed the launching of the euro. Although it still remains to be seen, I hope the euro willcontribute substantially to a greater stability in the currency markets, something we need badlytoday. In the technology sector, we are witnessing an extraordinary growth of the internet industries,which to some extent can be illustrated by skyrocketing prices of internet stocks in United States.Following this trend, we are also witnessing efforts by many enterprises to make a foray intoe-commerce. This phenomenon most likely will change the way we do trade and business in thefuture.Although at this juncture it is still hard to predict the impact of these structural changes on ourenvironment, at least there are some obvious elements influencing the direction. Those are factorssuch as innovations, strategic alignments at the micro level and economic integration,macroeconomic adjustments, liberalization and direction towards market economy at the macrolevel. No less important is our expectation in the future and forward looking strategies which most ofthe time play an important role in driving economic activities.With those new forces driving our world economy towards a new direction, the pace differs acrosscountries. For crisis impacted countries in this region, the opportunities will be dependent upon thespeed of recovery of those economies which are also affected by the degree of success ofmacroeconomic adjustments. In fact, macroeconomic adjustments have been typically one keystrategy in this region. For the case of Indonesia, high growth in the past was substantially facilitatedby many adjustment measures in our economy, particularly in the financial sector.Therefore, in responding to the current crisis, it is important for the authorities in this region toreinvent this key element and incorporate it into the changing environment. Just as on the microlevel we need to understand our strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and our key competence, thesimilar approach to some degree may be used in the macro level. Macroeconomic adjustmentsshould adapt to the changing environment and I think elements of this approach can be found in theefforts of regional authorities to respond the current crisis. Combined with those current drivingfactors I have mentioned, and positive elements that still exist in this region, I believe the valuecreated will be more significantly measured by better resource allocation in every element of theeconomy and more synergies obtained. If any single entity of the economy can generate maximumvalue from its business, aided among other things by conducive macroeconomic situation, theeconomy as a whole will create substantial value as well.Ladies and gentlemen,As you are evaluating business strategic directions in this region, allow me to update you with somerecent developments in Indonesia, which I hope may be taken into account in weighing risks andopportunities. Although the crisis has severely impacted our economy, bringing around a 14%contraction, not all of the economic sectors were affected. Agriculture, which traditionally has beenour backbone in securing food supplies and mass employment, was less affected by the crisis andstill recorded positive growth. Food production, plantation and forestry have recorded substantialgrowth relative to the impact of crisis. Indeed, disturbance to the agriculture sector was moreattributed to natural causes such as El Niño. In some provinces many farmers are even enjoyingwindfall profits from the large depreciation of the rupiah.
– 3 –BIS Review  16/1999This fact shows that during the crisis economic activities shift somewhat to resource based sectors.For Indonesia this shift is natural considering the abundant resources available in the country. Forthis crisis period, this development is heartening since securing food prices is very important in ourefforts to control inflation, especially that of basic necessities, and to arrest pressures from socialunrest and income disparities. In this respect, we are quite happy that our inflation was slightlybelow our target of 80% last year, thanks to improved distribution of food and other basicnecessities. More importantly, the rate has sharply decelerated in the past few months. In fact inOctober the rate was negative, in November it was close to zero, although the months of Decemberand January again recorded positive rates due to holiday times. In 1999 as a whole we expectinflation to be below 20%, and with this expectation interest rates can be expected to decline duringthe remaining months so as to stimulate economic recovery.As compared to a level of around 71% in August last year, interest rates now are much lower ataround 37%. In the coming weeks and months, we will monitor the monetary situation very closelyand run our monetary policy very cautiously. Although we believe that the current interest rate is stilltoo high in real terms, our monetary stance will be relaxed to make interest rate decline only whenwe are convinced that such a stance would not create any jitters in the exchange market.Ladies and gentlemen,When we look back just to a few months ago, that is to the month of May 1998 when the currentgovernment was installed, we have accomplished quite a lot in such a short period of time.Politically, a very drastic reform to democracy has taken place. With the approval by Parliament ofthe basic political laws and with a clear agenda for a general election in June and presidentialelection in October or November, a solid foundation for democracy is already established. We areconfident that by the end of the year, if not already now, we will be the third largest democracy inthe world. We also have accomplished quite a lot in improving our legal system. Among other things, a newbankruptcy law has been enacted and a special bankruptcy court is already in place. And the law oncompetition is about to be completed by Parliament, and a new draft law on central bank, whichstresses the independence of the central bank, has been submitted to Parliament. On the economicfront, a lot more has been done. The last important piece we are currently working on is therestructuring and recapitalization of the banking system. The sharp economic decline during thecrisis has reduced the value of banks’ assets quite significantly, leaving many of the banks withnegative net worth. Without sufficient recapitalization of the banking system, economic recoverycannot take place. We have practically completed the preparation process for recapitalization,including due diligence by international auditing firms, preparation and examination of businessplans, and tight fit and proper tests for the management and the banks. The actual recapitalizationprocess will take place shortly.Along with banks’ restructuring, companies’ restructuring should also take place at the same time. Anumber of actions in synergy are being conducted for this purpose. Aside from the INDRA(Indonesian Debt Restructuring Agency) scheme, the Jakarta Initiative was established to helpfacilitate the meetings between debtors and creditors, and a special task force to help banksrestructure their assets was also set up. We should expect that the restructuring of companies willtake place along with the restructuring of the banks, and they should be strengthening each other’sprogress.
– 4 –BIS Review   16/1999Ladies and Gentlemen,With all of those ongoing readjustments in our economic landscape today, we believe that oureconomy is heading for a new and structurally more sound economy supported by sound pillars of amodern economy. We are promoting more competition, eliminating monopolies, dismantling tradebarriers, and eliminating inefficiencies as well as implementing more market mechanisms. To someextent, this crisis has taught us valuable lessons on how to improve our economy’s efficiency in thefuture.Looking at its elements, our economic reform comprises the most comprehensive and fundamentaladjustments covering many important ingredients for a more sustainable open and market driveneconomy. Those agendas perhaps were not even imagined a few years ago when our economy wasrunning high, which unfortunately also tended to mask some weaknesses in our economic structure.We are committed to fix all of the weaknesses while maintaining much of what we have achieved inthe past. In this regard we are bound not to deviate from many important underlying principles thathave driven our economic growth in last three decades. Indonesia is still an open economy based onmarket mechanisms.As my final remarks, I would like to illustrate the attitude of many Indonesians in observing manychanges in our society today. Many of us like to explore philosophical understandings among thesechanges. Many believe that those changes, although this may be painful, are necessary in achievingbetter condition. There are always lessons and insightful meaning for those who understand, mostlythose who possess positive minds and forward looking orientation. With this positivism we willfinally see light at the end of the dark tunnel.Our economic activities will continue to develop and will be driven by adjustments in our economyand by those who can see opportunities amidst the changes taking place in Indonesia today. And Iam sure there are ample business enterprises keen to benefit from the opportunities in Indonesia.This is particularly true for those who take a long-run view on Indonesia. Although in the short runsome some still perceive Indonesia as a relatively high risk country, the rewards for doing businessin or with Indonesia now, I believe, should also be high.I am aware that you are here to weigh risk and reward to evaluate your business directions. By sodoing you are aiming to increase the value of your business and your shareholders. As a monetaryauthority in Indonesia, we do similar things to create value by committing to our macroeconomicadjustments, reducing uncertainties and focusing on the directions we have established. This synergyis of a greater value for our stakeholders, namely the people at large.* * *
BIS Review   15/1999Mr Meister reviews the subject of bank insolvencies and moral hazardStatement by Mr. Edgar Meister, a member of the Directorate of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at asymposium hosted by the University of Frankfurt on 1/2/99.One of the pillars of our market economy is the fact that entrepreneurs are personally responsiblefor their business activities. Generally, this principle also applies to banks. However, banks, asfinancial intermediaries and providers of financial services, play a special role in an economy. Acrisis of one major bank, let alone the whole banking system, would have a serious impact oneconomic activity, and this also goes for the real sector. But then again, the special role of banksmust not be interpreted to mean that bank boards can count on government support inemergencies. If they could, the risk of a precarious situation in the banking sector would increaseeven more. This would create a “moral hazard”, which would result in banks taking excessiverisks in order to obtain higher returns, in the confidence that they could rely on governmentsupport in the event of a failure.Banking supervisors must try to prevent both scenarios — serious external effects of bankinsolvencies, for one thing, and moral hazard, for another — from happening. The crisis inSouth-East Asia has shown that government guarantees and expectations of internationalassistance — which were met in the end — can lead to serious misalignments in a crisis situation(To quote Tietmeyer: “Do not display too much money in the shop windows”).Avoiding crises must be the prime concern. Efficient banking supervision can make an essentialcontribution to this objective. Supervisors should be guided by the principle: “As muchentrepreneurial leeway as possible, yet as much state supervision as required”. There have beensome recent proposals to confer more supervisory tasks to the private sector (G30). In principle,increased mutual monitoring among the banks, and hence a strengthening of market discipline, isa welcome idea. Nevertheless, conceptual and practical problems should not be overlooked. Forinstance, more self-regulation by the market participants implies a transfer of legislative powers,but it does not mean that responsibility for resolving systemic crises would also shift to theprivate sector.State supervision will remain necessary as long as systemic risks exist which cannot be limitedsufficiently through preventive measures or eliminated within the context of market control.Besides, the self-regulation model, inter alia, assumes that the financial sector is highlytransparent for the market, e. g. regarding in-house procedures, which is hardly feasible.Allow me to briefly outline the German prudential approach:• Banking supervision is guided by the principle that a bank's management is responsible for itsbusiness decisions. Therefore, banking supervision in Germany does not actively intervene inbanking activities, i. e. by making specific recommendations.• From the central bank's perspective, I would like to stress that it cannot be the task of a centralbank to bail out insolvent credit institutions. The Ministry of Finance would be responsible forthat, if tax revenue were required for assistance measures. But even cases such as financiallysound institutions merely having liquidity problems should, if possible, be resolved with thehelp of private or semi-private lenders before reaching the gates of the central bank. TheLiquidity Consortium Bank in Germany is such a “lender of penultimate resort”. In addition tothe three categories of credit institutions, the Bundesbank also has a stake in this ConsortiumBank, and it provides refinancing against collateral. Apart from that, the Bundesbank has notcommitted itself in a binding manner to take action in the event of a crisis. It would also be
– 2 –BIS Review   15/1999desirable if a liquidity consortium bank or comparable institutions were established in otherEuropean countries.• If it were not possible for the creditworthiness of an institution to be restored either by otherinstitutions or with the help of the deposit guarantee scheme, having that institution exit themarket would, in general, be a feasible consequence. However, if such a step posed a seriousthreat to the stability of the banking system, i. e. if the institution in question were “too big tofail”, a joint solution would have to be found by all the private market players and publicbodies concerned. Already the number of institutions we must consider to be “too big to fail”has risen in the recent past, and further mergers will cause this number to keep rising. Mergersof global players do not only raise new questions in banking supervision. They also pose therisk that size leads to moral hazard effects. For precisely this reason, each crisis must beassessed individually. The key principle is that the government's response must not bepredictable and that private market players should be involved in potential rescue operationsto the greatest possible extent.• The recent financial crises have been increasingly drawing attention to international crisismanagement. In my opinion, the aforementioned principles should be applied in this context,too: there should be no explicit or implicit government guarantees regarding the solvency ofthe respective banking system; temporary liquidity crises should be resolved, whereverpossible, before government intervention becomes necessary; the private sector should becomprehensively involved both in crisis management and in loss-sharing.• International support measures must always remain an exception and never become the rule.Under no circumstances should private investors be able to rely on public bodies to assumetheir losses in the end. Instead, I believe it would be desirable to create an internationalliquidity safeguarding fund made up of the major global players, which would also have themost to gain from a largely deregulated and sound financial system. This will not be an easyundertaking, since there seem to be few incentives for a bank to assume other institutions'risks. Nevertheless this road should be taken in order to strengthen market discipline. I believethat membership in a club comprising the major global players would be a special qualitywhich could actually become attractive for those institutions. Besides, it seems quiteconceivable that banking supervision might be willing to grant those institutions more self-regulatory powers.The case of the Hedge Funds LTCM proves that the private sector can find solutions  withouthaving recourse to public funds. At that time, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was onlyacting as an intermediary to bring national and international financial institutions together, whichthen provided the necessary funds.The same principle applies both nationally and internationally: moral hazard problems can onlybe prevented by emphasising and requiring that responsibility be taken by financial marketparticipants, and by limiting the intervention of public bodies. Avoiding moral hazard will alsoincrease the stability of the system and improve crisis management.* * *
BIS Review   15/1999Mr. Duisenberg reports on the latest meeting of the ECB Governing CouncilIntroductory statement by the President of the European Central Bank, Mr W F Duisenberg, atthe press conference in Frankfurt 4/2/99.Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here today to report on the outcome oftoday’s meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank.Let me start with the Governing Council’s discussion on recent economic developments and thedecisions that the Governing Council has taken today in the field of monetary policy.At today’s meeting the Governing Council reviewed the latest monetary, financial and economicdevelopments. After a careful examination of recent trends, in the context of its monetary policystrategy, it confirmed its earlier assessment that the outlook for price stability remainsfavourable. Therefore, it decided that for the main refinancing operations to be settled on 10 and17 February 1999 the same conditions will apply as for the first such operations settled earlierthis year, i.e. they will be fixed rate tenders conducted at an interest rate of 3.0%. In addition, theinterest rate on the marginal lending facility continues to be 4.5% and the interest rate on thedeposit facility remains 2.0%.Let me report in more detail on the Governing Council’s deliberations and thereby provide theexplanations for the decisions which were taken today.On 1 February 1999 we released the latest data on monetary developments in the euro area.These data confirmed the continuation of a favourable outlook for price stability in the euro area.The latest three-month moving average of annual M3 growth rates (covering the period fromOctober to December 1998) was 4.7%. This result was unchanged from the average over theperiod from September to November 1998 and remained very close to the reference value forbroad money growth of 4½% set by the Governing Council.Developments in the narrow aggregate M1 have been more buoyant recently. Similarly, thegrowth of credit to the private sector continued to be high in December 1998. Thesedevelopments seem to reflect, in particular, the current low levels of interest rates in the euroarea. Although they are not considered by the Governing Council to imply inflationary risks atthis juncture, in particular the developments in credit growth will need to be carefully monitoredin the coming months.With regard to the broadly based outlook for price developments and risks to price stability in theeuro area, financial market indicators suggest that market participants continue to expect lowinflation. Since early January, euro area long-term interest rates have continued to decline andthe yield curve has shifted downwards.At the same time, the latest developments are giving mixed signals as to the evolution of theworld economy in 1999. On the one hand, recent events in Brazil have highlighted the fragility ofthe current situation in emerging markets, while on the other, output growth in the United Stateswas much stronger in the last quarter of 1998 than expected. In the euro area too, availableindicators continue to suggest a mixed picture. According to revised Eurostat estimates, realGDP growth remained broadly robust in the third quarter of 1998, while in more recent monthsactivity may have slowed down. Such a slowdown is apparent in industrial production growth upto November 1998, in particular in the intermediate goods sector, which is particularly sensitiveto any deterioration in the external environment. However, at the same time, production ofcapital goods and consumer durables has continued to expand rather strongly. A similar patterncan be observed in the decline in industrial confidence that has been apparent in the second half
– 2 –BIS Review   15/1999of 1998 in the euro area, while, however, stabilising in January 1999. On the other hand,consumer confidence in the euro area continued to increase in December and in January; it hasnow exceeded the peak level reached in 1990, with retail sales up to November showingcontinued solid growth and car sales growing strongly during the last months of 1998. Finally,the mixed picture is confirmed by other data. Order books, which overall declined slightly furtherin December, apparently increased again in January, particularly with respect to export orders.Capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector, which started to decrease in the third quarterrecovered again thereafter, while December data on unemployment appear to suggest that thedecline in unemployment rates stalled around year-end.Therefore, with regard to the cyclical situation, recent data seem to confirm our earlierassessment that there are downside risks for output growth and that production may have sloweddown around the turn of the year. Nonetheless, in the opinion of the Governing Council there arealso no clear signals as yet of a stronger than expected weakening in output growth. Given themixed picture outlined above, the Governing Council emphasised that further thorough analysisand very close monitoring of underlying trends are needed before any conclusions can be drawnconcerning the broad outlook for 1999 and 2000.With regard to the latest data on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, the annual increasefor December 1998 showed a further slowdown to 0.8%, compared with 0.9% in November and1.0% in October. This development was in line with previous trends; i.e. it was due mainly to afurther reduction in energy prices and also, in December, to a decline in the price increases innon-energy industrial goods. Taking a forward-looking perspective, the general environmentcontinues to suggest that there are no significant upward or downward pressures on prices in theshort term. Furthermore, the pattern of risks to price stability has remained broadly unchanged.On the one hand, downward risks could materialise if import or producer prices were to fallfurther. On the other, given current wage demands, wage developments, especially whenmeasured in real terms, could become a matter of concern and fiscal policies would also pose athreat to the favourable outlook for prices and growth and employment prospects, if thecredibility of the Stability and Growth Pact were undermined. In addition, exchange rate trendsneed to be monitored closely given their importance for domestic price developments.In conclusion, taking into account the latest evidence available, the Governing Council has notaltered its assessment of the outlook for price developments. The Governing Council thereforedecided to keep ECB interest rates unchanged at the levels currently prevailing.I should like to take this opportunity to recall that real three-month interest rates, if measured asnominal rates corrected for current HICP inflation (as a very incomplete proxy), stood at a levelof 2.3% in January; this is approximately 80 basis points lower than the level one year ago. Atthe same time, real long-term interest rates, measured on a similar basis, have reached a level of3.0%, which is around 110 basis points lower than in early 1998. These levels are very low, bothin comparison with other countries and with historical data for the euro area. Monetary andfinancial conditions therefore support continued economic growth in the euro area in line withprice stability.I should now like to inform you about some other matters considered by the Governing Council.The end-of-day procedures relating to TARGET and access to the Eurosystem’s standingfacilities were reviewed by Governing Council today. The Governing Council agreed that fromtomorrow on the deadline for requesting access to the marginal lending facility will coincide withthe deadline for access to the deposit facility, i.e. 30 minutes after the actual closing time ofTARGET. Furthermore, the deadlines for requesting access to the Eurosystem’s standing
– 3 –BIS Review   15/1999facilities will be postponed by an additional 30 minutes on the last Eurosystem business day of aminimum reserve maintenance period.As a final point, I should like to inform you that the ECB is planning an information campaignwith regard to the launch of the euro banknotes on 1 January 2002. One of our aims inundertaking such an exercise will be to ensure that, by the time the euro banknotes becomeavailable, every person using and handling them will be fully acquainted with their features tothe extent that everyone will be able to identify the banknotes as being genuine. In this respect,the ECB will be co-operating with the European Commission and the Member States to ensurethat there will be no duplication of effort.* * *
1BIS Review   35/1999Mr Yam focuses on international capital flows and free marketsSpeech by the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Mr Joseph Yam, JP, atthe Crédit Suisse First Boston Asian Investment Conference on 26 March 1999.Introduction1. I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak at this year’s Asian Investment Conferenceorganised by Crédit Suisse First Boston. It is particularly gratifying to be able to speak to sucha large and diverse gathering in Hong Kong itself. Many of you, I know, are old friends ofHong Kong, and to those among you who might be visiting this city for the first time I extenda warm welcome. Your presence here happily relieves me of the need to set the scene or toexplain in detail how Hong Kong has been grappling with regional financial crisis andeconomic slowdown. You will have been able to see and hear for yourselves that, despite thedifficulties of the last year or two, Hong Kong is still very much alive and well, and that itremains one of the most open, most welcoming, and freest markets in the world. Internationalopinion continues to echo this conclusion, so these are not empty boasts: within the pastcouple of weeks, for example, two reputable regional surveys have found the banking systemof Hong Kong to be the best and the soundest in Asia. We continue to develop our servicesand infrastructure in a way that will help business make the most out of changingopportunities and challenges. Recent initiatives include plans announced by the FinancialSecretary earlier this month for a cyberport that will be able to offer the most advancedinformation technologies to a whole range of businesses and industries. Within the HKMA,we have, in the last few months, seen the completion of a major strategic consultancy studythat will help to guide the broad development of our banking sector into the next century.2. I single out these initiatives – and I could mention many others – for two main reasons.First, one of their aims is to help Hong Kong get the best advantage out of three closely linkedand irresistible trends: the globalisation of markets, the liberalisation of trade and finance, andthe rapid advance of information technology. Secondly, while we need to grasp theopportunities produced by globalisation, liberalisation and technological advance, we alsohave to manage the risks that they bring with them in ways that strengthen, rather thanundermine, our economic fundamentals. Along with many other economies in this region, wehave, over the last year or two, been grappling with this challenge in a very practical way at atime of crisis and uncertainty. The Asian financial crisis is the cumulative result of manycomplex causes coming together at roughly the same time. But if we were to find a singlefactor that has brought the crisis to a head and magnified its damaging effects, we should belooking, not to ‘crony capitalism’ or ‘Asian values’, but to a more specific and more universalphenomenon: the swift flow of large amounts of heavily leveraged capital into and out of theregion through an international financial system that is globalised, liberalised, technologicallyadvanced, but, from an international point of view, largely unmanaged and unregulated.3. The freedom of capital flows is, of course, essential to effective financial intermediation inthe international dimension, which has played a vital role in promoting economicdevelopment in this region. But, as the current crisis has shown, it also has the potential todistort, disrupt or even destabilise domestic financial markets: this applies not just to ailingeconomies, but also to sound ones. Being small and open, with predictable policy responses,their markets are susceptible to manipulation. As you know, last summer Hong Kong wasexposed to this problem in an extreme form, and we took radical and controversial measuresto address it. We remain convinced not only that what we did preserved our financial system
BIS Review   35/19992from a serious threat to its stability at a time of stress and uncertainty, but also that our actionswere entirely consistent with our responsibilities as a government mandated by law tosafeguard the free operation of financial business and the free flow of capital within, into andout of Hong Kong. I shall come to this episode later on. But first I should like to go a littlemore deeply into the characteristics of international capital flows. I shall then discuss theimplications, practical and philosophical, that they have for free and open markets, whichcollectively make up an increasingly seamless international financial system, but whichcontinue to rely largely on their own limited resources when they encounter the problems thatthis system throws up.International capital flows4. Like wind currents and weather patterns, international capital flows carry with them amixture of benefits and risks. Let me try briefly to pin down what makes them so powerfuland so protean in their effects on the international financial landscape. I find it helpful, as amnemonic, to think of their main characteristics in terms of what I shall refer to as the six‘V’s: Virtue, Volume, Variety, Velocity, Volatility, and Viciousness.5. By Virtue, I mean simply that international capital flows, by promoting an efficient andbalanced use of financial resources, bring enormous benefits throughout the world. Over thepast few decades they have been of crucial importance in developing new economies andrevitalising old ones. When they work smoothly, international capital flows help to relieveshortages of capital in previously segmented markets. They provide a competitiveenvironment that encourages innovation. And, by affording better returns to investors, theyhelp to put spare capital to the best possible use. We have seen the value of this in our ownregion in the 1980s and early ’90s, and, when discussing the problems created by capitalflows, we should never forget that they have specific and beneficial functions.6. The second characteristic is the sheer Volume of capital movements around the world. InApril 1995 the global value of foreign exchange transactions taking place on an average daywas US$1.2 trillion. In April 1998 this figure increased to US$1.5 trillion, or, to put it in moremeaningful terms, to around 48 times the daily value of world trade. It is also worth stressingthat these are largely private capital flows. In 1997, for example, the amount of private capitalflowing into developing economies was estimated by the World Bank to be five times the sizeof official flows.7. Within these private flows there is considerable Variety and fluctuation in the nature andorganisation of capital. With financial liberalisation and the globalisation of financial markets,portfolio capital flows are of increasing importance compared with the more traditionalforeign direct investment and commercial bank lending as a source of international capitalflows. An aspect of this Variety is the growing number of complex investment tools, anddifferent orders of derivatives therefrom, involving different degrees of leverage, available formoving money around the world, or indeed enabling investments to be made in marketswithout having actually to move money around.8. The variety and volume of capital flows are made even more potent by the Velocity withwhich capital moves around the world. The advance of telecommunications and informationtechnology now means that distance and national boundaries are no longer importantrestraints. Two consequences follow from this. First, huge amounts of money can be movedinto an economy in a very short space of time, and can be moved out just as quickly. In 1996,
3BIS Review   35/1999for example, capital was flowing into the emerging economies of Asia at the rate of aboutUS$100 billion. By the second half of 1997 it was flowing out of the region at about half thatspeed. Secondly, with the negation of distance and boundaries, events in one particular marketcan have immediate, dramatic, but often quite unpredicted effects on other markets on theother side of the world. Last year, for example, the debt default in Russia affected mortgage-backed securities as far away as the US and Brazil. Earlier this year, the devaluation of theBrazilian real raised expectations – unfounded, as it turned out – that the ripples from thatcrisis would destabilise the renminbi.9. During periods of instability or uncertainty, the volume, variety and velocity ofinternational capital flows can, in an increasingly liberalised and globalised financialenvironment, often add up to the fifth ‘V’: Volatility. Indeed, the behaviour patterns of capitalflows can magnify minor local uncertainties into extensive, prolonged and highly destabilisingcrises. While other factors were also at play, it is clear that something of this kind took placein the spate of local troubles that snowballed into what we now call the Asian crisis. Privatecapital inflows, attracted by high short-term returns, fuelled Asia’s economic boom. The Thaibaht crisis of July 1997, which many initially dismissed as a local blip, snowballed into aregional crisis when a sudden reversal of these flows took place following a rapid andwholesale reassessment of emerging market risk. In one way or another, the crisis has affectednearly every emerging market and has slowed growth throughout the world. Stampedes of thiskind take little account of the economic fundamentals behind the markets: there were ongoingproblems in many Asian economies, but there was no macroeconomic reason why thereshould have been such a sudden and wholesale withdrawal of funds at this particular time. Toquote the US Deputy Treasury Secretary, Lawrence Summers: ‘Financial crises have elementsof a self-fulfilling prophecy, like bank runs. Everyone expects failure or everyone expectseveryone else to expect failure, leading to a rush to be the first one out and thus causingfailure.’ The Asian financial crisis, in which untold and unnecessary damage has been causedby such behaviour, is a classic illustration of this.10. Widespread volatility resulting from financial panic and herd behaviour is one of the moreworrying aspects of international capital flows because small fires can spark off majorconflagrations. This volatility becomes Vicious when market participants with extensivecontrol or influence over capital flows line themselves up, manipulate the prevailing negativeand disturbed public mood, and exploit the discrepancies and vulnerabilities that inevitablyarise in a global financial system that is held together by localised jurisdictions. The mostvulnerable of these jurisdictions are often those which are held up as models of free-marketeconomics: the small or medium open markets with few or no controls on capital movementsand with transparent financial systems that operate according to simple and precise principles.11. In Hong Kong last summer we found ourselves in exactly this situation. We were a choicetarget because our options were limited. We are prohibited by law from imposing exchangecontrols, and, even if we were not, it would be an act of lunacy for Hong Kong, with its highlyexternally oriented economy, even to consider them. The cornerstone of our financial systemis the linked exchange rate between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar. This link ismaintained by a classic currency board system so transparent and predictable in its responsesto market conditions that it was, at least at that turbulent time, vulnerable in one of its centralfeatures. Under the currency board’s autopilot mechanism, any expansion in the monetarybase causes interest rates to fall, while a contraction causes them to rise. The crucial part ofthe monetary base influencing this rise and fall is the aggregate balance that banks maintain in
BIS Review   35/19994their clearing accounts held with the currency board: it is extremely small, and, at the time,made the monetary system susceptible to speculative attack.12. In their attempts to destabilise the Hong Kong dollar in late 1997 and early 1998,speculators found that, although breaking the link was impossible, driving up interest rates byputting pressure on the Hong Kong dollar was not so difficult a matter. Late in the summer of1998 they developed their strategy into a pre-concerted, heavily leveraged cross-marketassault, which sought to play off the currency board system against the stock and futuresmarkets: according to this strategy, extreme conditions created by a large-scale dumping ofHong Kong dollars would cause the stock market to plummet to a level that would allow themto make large profits from the futures contracts they had taken out.13. We prevented them from reaping these profits – and in fact caused many of them to incura loss – by investing a small part of Hong Kong’s official reserves in Hang Seng Indexconstituent stocks and futures contracts in sufficient quantities to ensure that the strategyfailed. We followed this up with technical changes to the currency board system to make itless susceptible to manipulation. The results of our market operation in August and ourtechnical measures in September have been stable interest rates and financial markets thathave been free of the manipulation that posed such a threat to stability and confidence over thesummer. For an economy that is still working its way through its worst recession in more thana generation this is good news. Many critics, however, were shocked by what they saw as agross violation of free-market principles in a city that had been held up as one of the world’sgreat models of free-market economics. We did not, and do not, see it in this way. And, sixmonths or so after the event, now is perhaps an appropriate time to place the events of lastsummer in some perspective.Free markets14. What, then, is a free market? It might be helpful to go back to basic economics to set out afew simple principles. In bald terms, a free market is a market in which buyers and sellers arefree to trade on whatever terms they wish without government interference. The great writerson free markets, from Adam Smith to Milton Friedman, argue that free markets and freeenterprise, rather than governments or monopolies, are the most efficient means of producingand distributing wealth and, as a consequence, the soundest basis for a just and prosperoussociety. In Adam Smith’s conception, it is the ‘invisible hand’ of the free market thatorganises the seemingly chaotic and self-interested activities of human beings into abeneficent and productive social order. For Milton Friedman, ‘the organisation of the bulk ofeconomic activity through private enterprise operating in a free market’ is ‘a necessarycondition for political freedom.’15. In its daily operation, a free market serves three main purposes. It manages resourceallocation by supplying answers for buyers and sellers to the basic economic questions ofwhat, how, and for whom goods and services are to be produced. It provides price discoveryby channelling competition and adjusting prices to reflect changes in supply and demand fordifferent commodities. And specifically in terms of money, it arranges financialintermediation by matching the needs of ultimate lenders – or those in possession of surplusloanable funds – with those of ultimate borrowers – or those in need of liquid funds: interestrates, which are determined by the supply and demand of liquidity in the loanable fundmarket, play a crucial role in this process.
5BIS Review   35/199916. The philosophers are agreed that, in general, the less a government has to do with thesevarious functions, the more efficiently the market can do its job: centralised, directiveauthorities, or ‘big government’, are anathema to true economic freedom; governmentsshould, at most, play a minimal, instrumental role in fostering the conditions in which eachindividual has the freedom to make his or her own economic choices. But this does not meanno government. In a free market, a government has a number of specific and limited functionsto address well-known areas where the unregulated functioning of markets can result inoutcomes that are undesirable from the perspective of society as a whole. In general, theseareas involve some form of what economists call ‘externalities’ – spillover effects of oneperson’s behaviour on others that are not incorporated in the market prices that people pay andreceive. Public goods are an example, where the benefits to society as a whole of, say, policeprotection are not easily captured by unconstrained market forces. Protection againstmonopoly practices is another – situations in which individual market participants can takeprices away from levels consistent with free competition. All countries are involved incorrecting instances of market failure in one form or another: indeed, from a philosophicalperspective, it would not be too strong to say that that is what governments are all about.Many countries, of course, have become involved in the economy in ways that go well beyondsuch cases of market failure. In general, the experience has been unsatisfactory, and there is aworldwide trend towards limiting government involvement in the economy.17. Here it may be helpful to turn from theory to practice, and to our experience in HongKong as an economy long acknowledged to have one of the freest markets in the world. InHong Kong, government is probably as small as it can get in the modern world. Governmentexpenditure as a percentage of GDP, although now at a historical high, is only about 20%. Yetthe Government is involved in supporting the free market in a number of limited but keyareas. First, it provides infrastructure and facilitation to enable markets to thrive and progress:these range from highly visible projects, such as the new airport and its associated facilities, tothe HKMA’s own quiet successes over the last few years in developing an advanced androbust interbank payment and settlement system or in stimulating the development of a localdebt market. The Hong Kong method is for such projects to be done, where possible, aspartnerships between government and private sector, with a heavy emphasis on private sectorinvolvement. Nevertheless, the role of government is essential in getting them off the groundand in mobilising resources that cannot always be easily provided by the private sector.18. Secondly, the Government provides regulation and protection. This ranges from the highlyvisible, and currently much debated, rule of law, which is the ultimate guarantee of contractsbetween individuals, to the day-to-day regulation of the markets themselves. Much of theactivity in this area is also left to the private sector: only a small proportion of contracts areever disputed in the public courts, and a large part of the regulation of the markets and theprofessions is self-regulation. Once again, however, government involvement is of keyimportance. The Government is there in the background as the last resort when conflicts arise,and, in consultation with market practitioners, it takes the initiative to reform regulatorysystems when new conditions require it: the far-reaching reforms proposed for Hong Kong’ssecurities and futures markets in the recent budget are a good example of this.19. Finally, the Government is prepared to intervene in isolated, clearly identified cases wheremarkets appear to be malfunctioning. In this respect, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority hasa special role to play within the financial sphere. One of its primary tasks is to promote thestability and integrity of Hong Kong’s financial system, and one of its tools – in addition to
BIS Review   35/19996the linked exchange rate, banking regulation, and the financial infrastructure – is theExchange Fund, our official reserves. The Exchange Fund, among other things, is available tobe drawn on to maintain the stability and the integrity of the monetary and financial systemsof Hong Kong. This is done rarely and sparingly, but it is necessary to have this provision forreasons that should be readily apparent. In addition to being a free market, Hong Kong is alsoan open market. This gives it one of its main strengths as an economy, for our links withoverseas markets are a vital part of our success as a financial and commercial centre. But italso renders Hong Kong exposed, and therefore vulnerable, to economic and other forces thatare entirely beyond its control. We would not have it any other way, because the advantages ofopenness far outweigh the disadvantages. But the risks involved in this exposure were broughthome to us by the Asian financial crisis.20. For Hong Kong, the consequences of that crisis have been first a sharp recession, andsecondly the series of attacks on our currency which I have already described. At the height ofthese attacks, during the summer of 1998, there was clear evidence that the free market inHong Kong was in danger of failing to fulfil its functions. Specifically, the currency, securitiesand futures markets were being distorted to the point where efficient resource allocation hadgiven way to manipulative speculation; where prices in the markets were no longer beingdetermined by changes in underlying supply and demand; and where interest rates, instead ofreflecting the supply and demand of liquidity, were being hijacked for the purpose ofengineering dramatic changes in the markets. Strong evidence suggests that at the time a verysmall group of players were responsible for a preponderant proportion of the short futurescontracts open at that time. We also estimate that currency borrowings to the tune of HK$30billion, arranged in advance to avoid the expected interest rate volatility they were hoping togenerate in Hong Kong, had been made by a similarly small group of players to be quicklydumped at a time when the markets were most vulnerable. In short, we were far from themodel of ‘atomistic competition’ among small individual actors envisaged by thinkers such asAdam Smith. The invisible hand of the market had been replaced by a very visible club beingwielded by a concentrated group of speculators.21. In many other jurisdictions, this cornering of the markets would have been subject toinvestigation under anti-trust legislation: the Salomon Brothers scandal in the US in the early1990s, which many of you will recall, is a parallel that springs to mind. In Hong Kong wehave no such laws: it is probably time that we thought out the cases for and against havingthem. We should also look at safeguards against market concentration. As things stood inAugust last year, we were watching (in a loosely worked metaphor that might appeal to thoseof you who will be attending the Rugby Sevens this weekend) a playing field that had becomeso badly slanted that ordinary players could barely stand up, and a game that was about to becornered by a highly oversized and unsportsmanlike team with steroid-enhanced musclesplaying by its own rules. As a referee with limited powers, but with responsibility forpreserving the basic integrity of the game, we intervened using the quickest, most efficientand fairest methods that we had at our disposal. Stability on the playing field was restored,and Hong Kong remains an open market, and, we believe, like the Rugby Sevens, attractive toparticipants from all over the world who are keen to play a fair game.22. We have been taking another look at the rules of the market to ensure that its freeworkings receive the best safeguards possible. The reforms include the currency boardmeasures, now in place, and the proposed reorganisation of the securities and futures marketsthat I have already mentioned. It has to be stressed, however, that there is a limit to what can
7BIS Review   35/1999be done locally in an international financial system that still lacks international forms ofregulation. There is consensus that some international action is now needed to build a globalfinancial architecture that can cope with volatile fund flows more effectively than canindividual jurisdictions on their own. Various international agencies and forums have beengrappling over the last six months with this issue, and Hong Kong, with its direct experienceof speculative attacks, has been pushing as hard as it can for an internationally backed andnon-intrusive system of disclosure and indirect regulation of cross-border fund flows. Whilesome progress has been made in working out what the problems that need to be addressedconsist of, we are still a long way from seeing results, and with the absence of majorspeculative attacks in the last few months, we are in danger of being lulled into a false senseof security.Conclusion23. To summarise, the problem to be tackled is essentially this: capital flows are movingthrough a financial system that is now to a large extent global and borderless. Marketliberalisation and advances in information technology mean that the system will continue todevelop in this direction. Yet the machinery that regulates this system is still largely operatedby individual governments. There is much that governments can do, and are doing, on theirown to help ensure that markets can channel the benefits that capital flows bring whileminimising the risks. But managing these risks – which lie mainly in volatilities exacerbatedby high volume and high velocity, and occasionally by deliberate viciousness – may ultimatelybe beyond the capacities of individual jurisdictions. Crisis management and rescue packagesare expensive and disruptive methods of clearing away the damage and picking up the pieces.The only effective long-term solution lies in prevention through collective action to reform theinternational financial architecture and ensure that free markets continue to be able to functionas they should. Given what we have been through in Hong Kong and in this region in the lasttwenty months, we are eager that the momentum on this issue should not be lost, and that itshould not require the disruptions and dislocations of another major financial crisis for theimportance of preventive action to be driven home.
1BIS Review   34/1999Mr Kelley remarks on the challenges of the Year 2000 computer problemRemarks by Mr Edward W Kelley, Jr, member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem, Owens Distinguished Lecture Series, Owens Graduate School of Management, VanderbiltUniversity on 25 March 1999Thinking about Y2KI am delighted to be back on this campus again at the invitation of my old friend, Dr Dewey Daane,who served before me as a governor of the Federal Reserve. These are challenging times for economicpolicymakers, and there are many issues currently facing our nation’s central bank. But at the top ofthe list as a first priority is the Year 2000 computer problem, and that is our subject for today.Recently this topic has been receiving a great deal of attention and I’m sure that everyone here isfamiliar with the basic issue – specifically, that information generated by computers may beinaccurate, or that computers and electronic systems may malfunction because they cannot correctlyprocess Year 2000 dates. With that stipulation, I will dwell no further on the nature of the problemitself, but rather attempt to focus on its likely economic impact. The economic stakes here arepotentially very large and the spectrum of possible outcomes potentially very broad, ranging fromminimal to very serious. For the truth of the matter is that this episode is unique: We really have hadno previous experience with a challenge of this sort to give us reliable guideposts.Although the lack of a precedent may be unnerving, that certainly does not free us from the obligationto attempt to analyze how the millennium bug is affecting and will affect the economy. This economicpuzzle has many complex pieces – some of them I fear quite inscrutable before the event – and mytask today is to assemble for you as coherent as possible a picture of where the Y2K problem appearslikely to take us. Please be forewarned that an assessment of this situation has a very short half-life, asconditions are evolving rapidly. The good news is that they are evolving favorably, the bad news isthat the time remaining before the rollover date is passing by rapidly.Let me first turn to the reasons why Y2K has been so challenging. Then I shall discuss the actions thatare being taken by both the public and private sectors to deal with the millennium bug and the effectsthese measures are having on economic activity at the present time. Finally, I shall turn – not withoutsome trepidation, I might add – to an assessment of the spectrum of plausible outcomes for themillennium rollover as I see them. As you will shortly hear, I believe the Y2K alarmists have not fullyrecognized the attention that is being given to this challenge and to the significant progress that isbeing made towards meeting it. Given what we know today, I am cautiously but increasinglyoptimistic that the millennium bug will not cause major economic disruptions when it bites. And I amquite confident that the financial system will be well prepared.Why was it so difficult for so long for people to come to terms with the Year 2000 problem? At themost basic level of any organization – be it public or private, large or small – the Y2K problem wasall too easy to ignore. It is a hidden threat, cloaked in the arcane language of computer programs andin embedded microchips. As such, it was difficult at first for senior management in both the privateand public sectors to recognize the serious nature of the problem. This was compounded by the factthat the costs and benefits of the solution for an individual operation were neither very easilyquantified nor very attractive. But after an initial period of denial, organization leaders in the UnitedStates have now recognized the problem and are taking aggressive action to correct it. Nonetheless,given the pervasiveness of the problems involved, I suspect that even the most thoroughly preparedorganizations are concerned that something significant might be missed. Consequently, responsibleand careful organizations are developing extensive contingency plans to work around any emergingproblems as insurance against Y2K disruptions. Thus, insecurity about the comprehensiveness ofY2K remediation efforts is affecting corporate investment and production plans now and will do sointo next year.
BIS Review   34/19992The second feature of the millennium bug that makes it so difficult to analyze is the interrelatedcharacter of many computer systems. An individual company may be satisfied that it has done all itcan to fix its own systems, but it may still feel vulnerable to the actions taken by its suppliers andcustomers. For example, what good would it do you to be perfectly ready if your electricity is off? Orif the train bringing in tomorrow’s production materials is delayed? In an environment where ‘just-in-time’ inventory systems and electronic data interchanges have linked economic activities very closelytogether, one firm’s failure has the potential to ripple through significant segments of the chain ofproduction, services, and distribution. Thus, coordination of Y2K remediation activities would havebenefits for everyone.Of course, it is clearly impossible to coordinate the Y2K activities of millions of individualestablishments. To help fill this void, numerous organizations have emerged as clearinghouses ofinformation, and other institutions and consortiums are functioning as vehicles for system testing. TheFederal Reserve, for instance, has established an extensive, separate and dedicated computerenvironment for the purpose of testing with its depository institution customers, and as we speak thesecurities industry is undergoing a five-week long series of tests to assess its ability to conductbusiness through its network of institutions. Bank supervisors, including the Federal Reserve, areholding their banks accountable for the effectiveness of their Y2K efforts, and I can assure you thatthere will be regulatory consequences for banks that do not fulfill their obligations. But many otherorganizations are on their own to test their critical systems with their key suppliers and customers.Because this situation is ubiquitous, complex, and fragmented, it is a very difficult task to quantify theaggregate costs of Y2K remediation. Similarly and perhaps more importantly, we also have nonational scorecard on how effective our economy is being in our remediation efforts, and until quiterecently very little national preparedness information at all. Under these circumstances, it is not hardto understand why the millennium bug is viewed as such as unpredictable phenomenon, and why ithas attracted so much gloom and doom commentary.So, what is being done? The short answer is a great deal is being done. In January the President’sCommission on the Year 2000 issued the first of its promised quarterly assessments of the state ofpreparation in our country and internationally. More recently we have had helpful assessments fromthe Congress and various security analysts. From these and other sources, let me review for you ourunderstanding of the status of efforts by the private sector, government entities, and the worldcommunity to deal with the Year 2000 problem. As far as the private sector is concerned, efforts todeal with the millennium bug have been steadily intensifying and are now proceeding very rapidly. Ithink it is a good sign that in the last few days articles have been appearing in the business press thatthe numerous Y2K remediation boutiques which sprang up over the past two years are beginning toexperience a slowdown in activity and are starting to look for other things to do. In Congressionaltestimony last spring, I suggested that the private sector might spend approximately $50 billionbetween 1998 and 2000 to tackle the Y2K problem. This figure was based on research done by Fedeconomists and while our estimate of a ‘$50 billion bug’ still seems to be reasonable, I do expect thisfigure to move upward as we learn more throughout the year.I also perceive that the tools available to companies to address Y2K issues have increasedsubstantially. Over the past months, most major computer hardware and software companies havereleased documentation of the Y2K readiness of their products on their websites. Similarly, most ofthe major computer publications now have elaborate ‘how-to’ guides on their web pages that will aidconsumers and small businesses in their efforts to make their systems compliant. Commercialsoftware producers have also been busy, and new software products are available to aid programmersin repairing code. I hope and believe people are availing themselves of these new resources.As far as depository institutions are concerned, I am encouraged by the progress that has been madeover the past year, and there is every reason to be confident that our banking system will be ready.Based on ongoing reviews of all depository institutions as completed by federal banking regulatory
3BIS Review   34/1999agencies, the vast majority is making satisfactory progress in their Y2K planning and readinessefforts. Only a small percentage has been rated ‘needs improvement’ and well under 1% have beenrated ‘unsatisfactory’. In these cases, the agencies have initiated intensive supervisory follow-up,including restrictions on expansionary activities by deficient organizations. For the rest of this yearthe agencies will be continually revisiting any institutions identified as having problems, as well as allthose identified as being key to systemic health. While we can be confident institutions are addressingthe problem, it is important to recognize that regulators cannot be responsible for ensuring orguaranteeing the Y2K readiness and viability of the banking organizations they supervise. Rather, theboard of directors and senior management of banks and other financial institutions must beresponsible for ensuring the institutions they manage are able to provide high quality and continuousservice in January 2000. They have every motivation to do so – their survival is at stake.The Federal Reserve System has itself made great progress on Y2K issues, meeting the goals we setfor ourselves. In addition to completing two rounds of reviews of the Y2K readiness of all bankssubject to our supervisory authority, we have renovated and tested virtually all our own applications.As mentioned, we have opened our mission-critical systems to customers for testing with us and haveprogressed significantly in our contingency planning efforts. For the balance of this year, we will befocusing intensely on contingency planning, as we believe that is the best way to be ready to deal withany possible surprises.As in the private sector, activity to fix computer systems maintained by the federal government hasbeen intensifying. Substantial progress has been made in many areas, but the President’s Commissionagrees that much more work still needs to be done. Its reviews of federal Y2K programs havehighlighted needed areas of improvement, as well as many other areas getting their preparation undergood control. The Commission’s evaluation of every agency and department is publicly available inits quarterly summary, so I will not attempt to go through it chapter and verse. The current estimate offederal spending for all preparation is $6.8 billion. Last fall, legislation was enacted that facilitates thesharing of Y2K information among businesses and clarifies the legal liability of reporting it. All ofthese are positive developments.Far less is known about the effectiveness of the Y2K preparations by state and local governments. Atthe state level, a survey of web pages indicates that most states have extensive and impressiveprograms under way, but by recent count several states had no reference to Y2K preparedness at alland others were quite vague about what was going on under their control. We can identify $3.4 billionearmarked by states, but I am confident that number is low. While attention is often focused on high-profile systems such as the nation’s air traffic control systems and its electric power grid, there aremany smaller, yet quite critical, electronically driven systems maintained by counties andmunicipalities that are also vulnerable. This would include such services as water, police, trafficcontrol, and health and welfare activities. And as any Washington or Nashville commuter knows, oneor two malfunctioning traffic signals can cause serious congestion, confusion, and delay, and thebreakdown of traffic management systems could cause near total gridlock. I hope that local media inevery area will increasingly focus attention on Y2K preparation and hold local leaders accountable forpreparations to the infrastructure in their areas of responsibility.On the international level, there is both good news and bad. The governments of variousindustrialized nations have stepped up their own internal Y2K programs over recent months, andinternational cooperation is intensifying through efforts such as the Joint Year 2000 Council, chairedby my colleague Federal Reserve Governor Roger Ferguson. Most large multinational corporationsreport that they are well along in their own preparations worldwide and many of them are pushingtheir numerous local suppliers to be prepared to maintain the flow of materials and services. That is asignificant positive step. The recent conversion to the euro was very smooth, thus proving that a jobsimilar to the one we have at hand can be successfully accomplished. But that intense focus inEurope, along with other world financial troubles, has obviously been deflecting all too muchattention away from Y2K issues. I worry that time will simply run out for some activities in some
BIS Review   34/19994countries, particularly in the developing economies, and as a result risks exist for some level ofdisruption in various locales around the world.All of this has been affecting our economy in a variety of ways. On the positive side an importantelement in some Y2K programs is the accelerated replacement of aging computer systems withmodern, state-of-the-art hardware and software. Such capital expenditures should raise the level ofproductivity in those enterprises, and addressing Y2K has increased the awareness of many seniorexecutives of the complexity and importance of carefully managing their corporate informationtechnology resources. The increased replacement demand also has contributed to the spectacularrecent growth in this country’s computer hardware and software industries. A reverse effect, which Ibelieve will shortly become visible, is that many institutions will ‘freeze’ their remediated and testedsystems for the remainder of this year, effectively foregoing the installation of major new hardwareand software systems. This moves some spending on technology forward from 1999 into 2000. So,ultimately, we are largely shifting the timing of these investment expenditures, rather than changingtheir total amounts very much.Another area in which uncertainty about Y2K readiness is likely to have noticeable effects in 1999 isin the management of inventories. As the millennium approaches, I expect businesses will want tohold larger inventories of goods as insurance against Y2K-related supply disruptions. Such a shiftfrom ‘just-in-time’ inventory management to a ‘just-in-case’ posture is likely to prompt an increase inorders and production during late 1999, with these stocks subsequently being run off in the first halfof 2000. We at the Fed, for example, will do precisely that in our management of the production ofnew currency.While Year 2000 preparation efforts may give a temporary boost to economic activity in some sectors,the probable net effect on the aggregate economy is slightly negative. Other than the obviously veryvaluable ability to maintain operations across the millennium, few quantifiable benefits accrue tomost firms for their extensive remedial work. It is fair to think of Y2K as a huge one-timemaintenance project, which is costly on balance and produces no additional product. Our estimates ofthe net effect of Y2K remediation efforts, on both our nation’s overall labor productivity and on realgross domestic product, are that it will likely shave one or two tenths of a percentage point off ourgrowth rate, but a more substantial effect is possible if some of the larger estimates of Y2K costs turnout to be accurate.Let’s move on to the bottom line. Will every organization and everybody everywhere be fullyprepared, so that everything will go off without a hitch? I seriously doubt it. As we have discussed, agreat deal of work is already completed or planned to deal with the problem, but what if somethingdoes slip through the cracks, and we experience the failure of ‘mission-critical’ systems? How woulda computer failure in one area of the economy affect the ability of others to continue to operatesmoothly? How severe could be the consequences of Y2K problems emanating from abroad? Thenumber of possible scenarios of this type is endless, and today no one can say with absoluteconfidence how severe any Y2K disruptions could be, or how a failure in one sector would influenceoperations in others. That said, let me now turn to a discussion of the spectrum of plausible outcomesfor economic activity in 2000.What will happen as the millennium rolls over? A few economists are suggesting that Y2K-relateddisruptions will induce a deep recession. That probably is a stretch, but it is unlikely we will escapeunaffected. I anticipate that there will be isolated production problems and disruptions to commerce,and perhaps some public services, that could reduce the pace of economic activity early in 2000. Asmentioned above, at least a mild inventory cycle seems very likely to develop. But, just like theshocks to our nation’s physical infrastructure that occur periodically, I would expect the Y2K impactto our information and electronic control infrastructure is most likely to be short-lived and fullyreversed.
5BIS Review   34/1999Most of us have experienced examples of how economic activity has been affected by disruptions tothe physical infrastructure of some part of our country. Although the Y2K problem is clearly unique,and therefore the usefulness of any analogy is limited, analyzing some of these disruptions to ourphysical infrastructure may be useful in organizing our thinking about the consequences of short-livedinterruptions in our information infrastructure. Many of us have experienced major bad weatherepisodes: a severe snow or ice storm, a flood, a tornado, or perhaps a hurricane. Commerce may grindto a halt for up to a week or so in an area, but activity bounces back rapidly once things are cleanedup. Although individual firms and households can be adversely affected by these disruptions, in theaggregate, the economy quickly recovers most of the output lost due to such storms. In theseinstances, the shock to our economic infrastructure is transitory in nature, and, critically, the recoveryprocess is under way before any adverse ‘feedback’ effects are produced. Another similar examplemight be the strike not long ago by workers at United Parcel Service. UPS is a major player in thepackage delivery industry in this country, and the strike disrupted the shipping patterns of manybusinesses. Some sales were indeed lost but – and this is critical here – in most instances, alternateshipping services were found for high priority packages. Some businesses were hurt by the strike, butits effect on economic activity was small in the aggregate. In fairness it must be said that ifdisruptions that occur are not isolated events as I have assumed, but rather spread across key sectorsof the economy by interacting with each other, then there could indeed be a more significant effect onaggregate activity in the first quarter of 2000.The more dire of the Y2K scenarios would involve, among other things, a perpetuation andintensification of these interactive effects and their subsequent feedback. Should this occur,production disruptions could turn out to be a national or international phenomenon and could spreadfrom one industry to another. Under these circumstances, the decline in economic activity wouldprove to be longer lasting, and a recession could conceivably ensue. But let me quickly stress that I donot think that this recession scenario has a very high probability. It is possible, but a lot of things haveto go wrong for it to occur, and much is being done to prevent its occurrence.Now you might appropriately ask a Fed representative what monetary policy can do to offset any Y2Kdisruption. The truthful short answer is ‘not much’. We can’t plow the streets or deliver packages andwe would be unable to reprogram the nation’s computers for 2000. The Y2K problem is primarily anissue affecting the aggregate supply side of the economy, whereas the Federal Reserve’s monetarypolicy works mainly on aggregate demand. We all understand how creating more money, andlowering the level of short-term interest rates, gives a boost to interest-sensitive sectors, such ashomebuilding, but these tools are unlikely to be very effective in generating more Y2K remediationefforts or accelerating the recovery process if someone experiences some type of disruption. We will,of course, be ready if people want to hold more cash on New Year’s Eve 1999, and we will beprepared to lend whatever sums may be needed to financial institutions through the discount windowor to provide needed reserves to the banking system’s open market operation. And, in the unlikelyevent a serious Y2K disruption should have significant feedback effects on aggregate demand, such asI outlined earlier, there obviously would be a role for the Federal Reserve to play in countering adownturn. But there is nothing monetary policy can do to offset the direct effects of a Y2K disruption.In summary, as I stated at the outset of my remarks, I am cautiously but increasingly optimistic thatthe United States will weather this storm without major disruptions to economic activity. Some of themore frightening scenarios are not without a certain plausibility, if this challenge were being ignored.But it is not being ignored, as indeed this meeting today clearly illustrates. An enormous amount ofwork is being done in anticipation of the rollover of the millennium. As the world’s largest economy,the heaviest burden of preparation falls on the US. But it is truly a worldwide issue, and to the extentsome are not adequately prepared and experience breakdowns of unforeseeable dimension, we couldall be affected accordingly. We at the Federal Reserve intend to do our utmost, and we hope and trustothers will do likewise.
1BIS Review   34/1999Mr Thiessen reports on the future of the Canadian financial sector, the economy and monetarypolicyRemarks by Mr Gordon Thiessen, Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the Mennonite Savings andCredit Union Kitchener, Ontario 22 March 1999.I am delighted to be with you this evening to celebrate the 35th annual meeting of the MennoniteSavings and Credit Union. On this occasion, I propose to speak about the Canadian economy andmonetary policy. But given this audience, I thought I might start with some remarks on the future ofthe Canadian financial sector – a subject that has certainly grabbed its share of headlines over the pastyear!In December 1996 the Minister of Finance appointed a Task Force to assess the current situation andthe future prospects of the Canadian financial services sector, and to make recommendations forchange. In early 1998, while this inquiry was still on, four of Canada’s six largest banks announcedplans to merge. The Task Force submitted its report (the MacKay Report) last September. InDecember 1998 the Minister of Finance, having taken into account that report as well as assessmentsof the proposed mergers by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions and theCompetition Bureau, decided not to allow the mergers. The Government is now examining the issuesfacing the financial services sector and, in the course of 1999, it intends to present its proposals formodifying the relevant regulatory framework.The Bank of Canada is one of several agencies in Ottawa that provide advice to the Minister ofFinance on the appropriate legislative framework for the financial industry. Because of this, I am notin a position to comment on specific proposals for change. But what I can do is offer some generalcomments on the broad issues involved in ensuring an efficient and sound financial industry inCanada as we strive to adapt to ongoing worldwide changes in the provision of financial services.Potential reforms of the Canadian financial systemCanadian financial institutions are among the best providers of financial services in the world. Thesedays, they are operating in an intensely competitive global marketplace, teeming with change spawnedby rapid advances in technology and innovative new financial products. These powerful forces havetransformed the way financial institutions around the world operate and the way they market anddeliver their services.Globalization creates both opportunities and challenges. We must make sure that Canadian financialinstitutions can compete effectively in both domestic and international markets, and that they canoffer Canadians innovative, world-class financial services. The MacKay Task Force says this meanswe should enhance competition in the financial services industry. How? Primarily by reducingrestrictions on existing providers of those services and by encouraging new players to enter the field.Members of this audience know that one of the proposals for strengthening the position of existingparticipants is to give credit unions the option to form cooperative banks. More generally, providedprudential concerns can be resolved, the Task Force suggests that the regulation of credit unions bere-examined to encourage them to become more active, dynamic competitors within the financialindustry.We would all agree that consumers of financial services are best served when there is effectivecompetition among financial institutions. A strongly competitive financial industry will providecustomers with the best deals for loans, deposits, insurance, and so on. Such an industry would also bemore innovative and should provide a wider range of services.But the appropriate legislative framework for financial services cannot be one that simply maximizescompetition without regard for the safety and soundness of the industry.
BIS Review   34/19992Why all this concern about safety? And why do we regulate this particular industry more closely thanvirtually all others?There are two main reasons. First, the financial industry is the repository for the wealth of a largenumber of small savers. For most of these savers, it is very difficult and costly to make a personaljudgment of the risks involved in doing business with a particular bank, credit union, or insurancecompany.The second reason has to do with what we call systemic risk, or contagion. This refers to the risk thatproblems in one particular financial institution will be transmitted to others. Contagion can occurwhen depositor nervousness about one institution spreads to others. As well, since the paymentssystem links financial institutions closely together, the failure of one institution can potentially lead toserious losses for others.Governments have addressed safety concerns by imposing capital requirements on financialinstitutions, restricting their ability to engage in risky activities, supervising their adherence to risk-reducing practices, and setting up deposit insurance. To limit contagion, central banks have the powerto make liquidity loans to financial institutions in the payments system. And most central banks inindustrial countries have been involved in initiatives to minimize the potential for systemic risk intheir payments systems.1When depositors feel ‘protected’, however, they are less inclined to monitor the riskiness of financialinstitutions. Thus, governments feel a greater need to regulate to reduce the risks of institutionalfailure. This tends to have side effects which could potentially restrict competition.What then is the scope of increasing competition, by encouraging new players and by reducingrestrictions on existing ones, without undermining the safety and stability of the system? Clearly,there can be a tension between the goals of fostering greater competition within the financial sectorand of preserving safety and stability. To find a balance between the twin objectives of efficiency andsafety has always been a challenge for governments when they examine proposals to change theregulatory framework for the financial system.I do not mean to make this sound like an impossible task. There are bound to be some changes thatcan help promote competition without adding substantial risk to the system. More generally, though, Ibelieve that we need to examine ways that could ease the tension between efficiency and safety. Forexample, if we are to encourage the entry of new financial institutions as a means of promotinggreater competition, perhaps we should also consider a more formal, explicit policy of ‘early exit’when an institution runs into trouble.One possible approach would be that when institutions reach some minimum level of capital, theywould be required to recapitalize themselves or find a merger partner within a short period of time.Otherwise, and well before they became insolvent, they would be sold or wound up by the regulatoryauthorities. Such an approach might help reduce risks to depositors, to the deposit insurance system,and to other creditors of financial institutions. This is not a new idea. The United States has alreadymoved in that direction and so have we in Canada, to a certain extent. But there may be room to movefurther down this path and, in so doing, to provide managers of financial institutions with strongerincentives to avoid getting into financial difficulties.To summarize, I agree with the MacKay Task Force that encouraging new participants and reducingrestrictions on existing players in the financial industry would benefit customers through improvedservice and lower costs. But this may have the potential to increase risks for the financial system. Sowe need to look at ways to avoid having these risks add to the costs of deposit insurance and to the1In Canada, under the Payment Clearing and Settlement Act, the Bank of Canada has been given formaloversight responsibility for ensuring that appropriate arrangements are in place to manage and control systemicrisk in major clearing and settlement systems.
3BIS Review   34/1999costs for other users of financial services. One approach, as I mentioned, is to move further towards‘early exit’ arrangements for troubled financial institutions. Such arrangements might not be easy toimplement. But if we could move in this direction, there might be more scope to benefit fromenhanced competition without exposing users of financial services to unacceptable risks orcompromising the stability of the system.I would now like to turn to our economic situation and monetary policy.The state of our economyThe past year has been a trying one, both for the world economy and for Canada. Still, considering theseriousness of the global difficulties we have been facing, the Canadian economy has coped muchbetter than expected, and certainly better than in the past. This is because it is in sounder shape nowthan it has been for many years. Canadian businesses have been investing in new technology toincrease productivity and efficiency. Governments are no longer draining national savings to financehuge budget deficits. And with the Bank of Canada’s commitment to inflation control targets,inflation is low and stable.But what about our economic prospects as we look ahead?Let me start with the financial climate. Global financial markets have been calmer recently comparedwith the turbulence last autumn after Russia declared a debt moratorium. Cuts in official interest ratesaround the world since then, and the success of some emerging market economies in addressing theirproblems, have clearly helped. International investors’ fears have abated, and markets seem to haveregained a sense of their ability to assess risks and discriminate among borrowers.When it comes to the world economic environment, there is still uncertainty out there. But there arealso positive elements in the picture.One area of uncertainty is the financial problems in Brazil and the extent of related economicweakness in Latin America more generally. If the Brazilians follow through on their fiscal adjustmentprogram and limit the inflationary fallout from the depreciation of their currency, financial marketpressures should ease, and growth in Brazil should resume next year.But the foremost uncertainty in the outlook continues to centre on Japan, where the economy remainsin a slump. Nevertheless, if present efforts at bank reform continue, and if stimulative macroeconomicinitiatives are pursued systematically, the Japanese economy should begin a gradual recovery, perhapsby late 1999.The economic expansion in the other industrial countries, which together account for about half ofworld output, should remain relatively well sustained. In Europe, economic activity has softened, butinterest rate cuts since the autumn and the easing of global financial strains should help supportconfidence and domestic spending in coming months.The most positive element, certainly from a Canadian perspective, has been the remarkableperformance of the United States. That economy ended 1998 on a much stronger note than had beenexpected, growing at an annual rate of 6% in the fourth quarter of 1998. Thus, its underlyingmomentum going into 1999 is much greater than most had supposed. This is confirmed by some of theadvance data for early 1999. So even if growth slows, as expected, the US economy should continueto operate at high levels.There are also signs that the sharp economic downturns in some of the Asian countries most affectedby the financial crisis are bottoming out. The economy of South Korea has started to expand, and inThailand economic activity seems to have stabilized. However, a broad-based recovery in the regionhas yet to take hold and will depend, to an important degree, on economic conditions in Japan.
BIS Review   34/19994Here in Canada, the impact of the global turbulence since the summer of 1997 was felt mainlythrough the lower demand for the key primary commodities we produce and the 20% decline in theirprices between mid-1997 and end-1998. But consumer and business confidence were also affected,and that dampened domestic spending. Consequently, the Canadian economy expanded by just under3% through 1998 (fourth quarter over fourth quarter) compared with over 4% in 1997.However, after some weakness through last summer and early autumn, our economy showed renewedstrength recently. Helped by buoyant US demand, easing global financial strains, and the reboundfrom major labour disruptions, economic activity grew at an annual rate of 4.6% in the final quarter of1998. And this was accompanied by robust, broad-based employment gains through the closingmonths of 1998 and into early 1999.With world economic and financial conditions still fragile and the timing of a firm recovery inprimary commodity prices uncertain, projections for 1999 remain tentative. But with recent healthyemployment growth, domestic spending should continue to contribute to an expanding economy. Andsustained US demand, coupled with our improved competitiveness, should continue to bolster ourexports. Altogether, we are looking at a somewhat more positive scenario than seemed possible lastautumn.The response of monetary policy to international turbulenceLet me now say a few words about how the Bank responded to the exceptional global events of thepast couple of years.As commodity prices tumbled, we became less well-off as a nation. Distressing as that is, it is a realityCanada had to face. And our currency moved downwards, reflecting – not causing – the drop in oureconomic prosperity and the need to adjust.When shocks like this hit us from time to time, movements in the external value of the Canadiandollar help ‘buffer’ the shock and smooth the process of adjustment. If the currency is not allowed tomove, the adjustment will drag out and cost more in terms of losses in output and employment.However, the relatively orderly depreciation of our currency through to July 1998 acceleratedfollowing the Russian crisis last August. And Canadian longer-term interest rates rose sharply at atime when comparable US rates were falling. To us at the Bank, this signalled a potential loss ofconfidence in Canadian dollar assets, which we moved to head off by raising the Bank Rate by 100basis points. In so doing, we sought to limit the harmful effects of financial volatility on confidenceby temporarily placing particular emphasis on calming markets.The situation has improved since then. Interest rates have been cut in all major industrial countries,and a measure of stability has returned to world financial markets. With this, concerns in Canadianmarkets have diminished, allowing us to unwind three-quarters of last August’s increase in the BankRate. Calmer financial markets should now make it possible for the Bank to refocus attention on itsmedium-term policy objective of keeping the underlying trend of inflation inside the target range of1% to 3%.In conclusion, let me say that, given the financial market volatility and the global economic slowdownof the past couple of years, our economy has coped relatively well. And we begin 1999 on a positivenote. This is testament to Canada’s improved basic economic foundation these days. And it gives mereason to remain positive about our future despite lingering international uncertainties.
1BIS Review   33/1999Mr Duisenberg considers the euro, the dollar and national economic policies: what room formanoeuvre?Speech by Dr Willem F Duisenberg, the President of the European Central Bank, at the Euro,J+80 Conference in Paris on 25 March 1999.The euro made its debut on the international financial markets at the start of this year. Itssuccessful launch in the 11 countries which form the so-called euro area constitutes a milestone inthe process of European integration. The introduction of the euro has created a single currencyarea which approximately matches the United States in terms of economic size, is the world’slargest with respect to its share in total world exports and ranks second in terms of the size of itscapital markets. Thus, the euro has had and will continue to have in the years to come a profoundimpact upon both the euro area and the world economy.The launch of the euro has raised questions concerning the relationship between the exchangerate, the monetary policy of the ECB and the room for manoeuvre of national policy. For thepurpose of today’s discussion I would propose to break down this rather complex issue into threeaspects: namely, the role of the exchange rate of the euro in the Eurosystem’s monetary policystrategy, the ECB’s view of recent developments of the euro exchange rate vis-à-vis the USdollar, and the relationship between the single currency in the euro area and the flexibility ofmacroeconomic and structural policies in euro area countries.The role of the exchange rate in the monetary policy of the EurosystemThe introduction of the euro implies a change in the role and the importance of the exchange ratein Europe. Considered individually, most euro area countries are exceptionally open economies.In 1997 the sum of their exports plus imports as a share of their combined GDP was 53%. Bycontrast, for the euro area as a whole, trade in goods, measured as exports and imports combined,is around 26% of GDP and thus only somewhat higher than that of the United States and Japan.Hence the importance of a certain movement in the euro exchange rate for domestic economicdevelopments has become less compared with the same movement of the exchange rate of anational currency in the past. Nevertheless, through its effect on economic activity and prices, theexchange rate affects the outlook for price stability and thus still undoubtedly plays an importantrole in the monetary policy of the Eurosystem. Let me therefore elaborate on this role in somemore detail.The primary objective of the single monetary policy is the maintenance of price stability.Monetary policy will always be geared to this objective. Consequently, the monetary policystrategy of the Eurosystem does not embody an implicit or explicit exchange rate target orobjective, since gearing monetary policy decisions to maintaining such an exchange rate targetmay, at times, conflict with the goal of price stability.Consequently, the ECB subscribes to the view that the exchange rates are primarily the outcomeof current and expected monetary, fiscal and structural policies as well as cyclical and othereconomic developments, rather than an objective or target of monetary policy. Exchange ratemisalignments and excessive volatility often reflect macroeconomic imbalances and/or marketuncertainties. Accordingly, stability-oriented macroeconomic policies pursued in a transparentmanner are the best contribution that can be made by policymakers to fostering exchange ratestability. In other words, misalignments and excessive volatility should be contained byaddressing their underlying causes. The Eurosystem’s stability-oriented monetary policy strategyensures that the single monetary policy makes the best possible contribution in this regard. Bycontrast, attempts to suppress exchange rate movements through direct targeting do not address,
BIS Review   33/19992by themselves, the underlying causes of misalignment. Monetary policy in particular cannotcorrect misalignments caused by structural or fiscal policies. They need to be addressed via otherpolicy actions.Moreover, in a world characterised by integrated and highly liquid international financialmarkets, there is serious doubt as to whether pegging or targeting exchange rates is feasible. Thesophistication, depth and liquidity of today’s financial markets make it increasingly difficult for acentral bank to defend an exchange rate for a prolonged period. In addition, the experience withexchange rate coordination among the G7 countries shows that it has always been very difficult toagree on a common objective. Obstacles to exchange rate coordination were also experienced bysome ERM member states. When during the late 1980s and early 1990s economic developmentsin some member states of the ERM diverged, their bilateral exchange rates came under pressure,and eventually the exchange rate bands had to be widened to ensure two-way risk for speculators.Some currencies were even forced to abandon the ERM. These experiences are now reflected inERM II. ERM II has relatively wide standard fluctuation bands and the ECB has the possibility ofsuspending intervention and financing if these could impinge on its primary objective ofmaintaining price stability. ERM II is explicitly designed to foster convergence to the euro area ofcountries that have not yet adopted the euro.For all these reasons, stable exchange rates of the euro are best served by stability-orientedpolicies that are consistent with economic fundamentals. In particular, exchange rate targets orobjectives would be neither a substitute for a credible and stability-oriented macroeconomicpolicy stance nor a surrogate for a flexible response on the part of domestic markets.Nevertheless, exchange rates affect the maintenance of price stability as they influence importprices and activity, and thereby consumer prices, in the euro area. Moreover, they reflect marketexpectations about future economic developments and policies. Furthermore, due considerationhas to be given to the exchange rate of the euro against the background of the importance of theeuro area in the international monetary and financial system.Therefore, the ECB monitors exchange rate movements on an ongoing basis within its broadlybased assessment of the outlook for price developments. The euro exchange rate is an integralpart of the broad range of variables used by the Eurosystem to take its monetary policy decisions.The exchange rate is also monitored as it may be a channel for monetary policy transmission.Clear exchange rate misalignments, although difficult to identify, would be a cause of concern forthe Eurosystem. If prolonged, they might affect inflation expectations and distort economicactivity as well as hamper the efficient allocation of financial resources. Although in the euro areathese negative effects will be mitigated, as a result of the low degree of openness of the economy,they cannot be ignored altogether.According to the Maastricht Treaty, the ECOFIN Council may formulate so-called generalorientations for exchange rate policy. These orientations – and this is consistent with the above –shall be without prejudice to the primary objective of the Eurosystem of maintaining pricestability. Therefore, the EU finance ministers, who are ultimately responsible for the exchangerate policy of the euro, agreed in December 1997 that they would only issue these generalorientations for the euro exchange rate in exceptional circumstances, such as in the case of clearand persistent misalignments of the euro. Successful and credible stability-oriented policiesshould help prevent the emergence of misalignments in the future.
3BIS Review   33/1999The ECB’s view on the dollar exchange rateLet me now share with you our views on the exchange rate of the euro against the dollar. Theweakening of the euro vis-à-vis the dollar during January and February was mainly attributable toa series of economic data releases over this period, which were mostly relatively favourable as faras the US economy was concerned. The US economy surprised commentators with very positivedata on employment and output. Over the same period data releases for the euro area were moremuted.It appears, therefore, that the recent developments of the euro exchange rate primarily reflect thepreviously unexpected strength of the US economy.Therefore, the recent fluctuations of the euro exchange rate should not be considered overlydramatic. The exchange rate of the euro against the dollar is now comparable with the level atwhich the so-called synthetic euro was quoted against the dollar prior to September 1998.Moreover, long-term government bond yields of euro area member states continue to be lowerthan in the United States, also suggesting that investors believe in the stability of the euro.The current euro exchange rate, therefore, does not hint at a misalignment or at a structuralweakness of the euro. Moreover, there is no indication that financial markets doubt the credibilityof the monetary policy of the Eurosystem. Nevertheless, we should keep in mind that thecredibility of a currency is a precious but likewise fragile asset. The possibility cannot beexcluded that increased uncertainty about the political support for a stability-oriented monetaryand fiscal policy has contributed to the weakening of the euro. Through pursuing a stability-oriented monetary policy, the Eurosystem underscores the confidence that the world has in thisyoung currency, the euro.What flexibility is left to national governments?I now turn to the final part of my talk. It is clear that euro area governments will continue to needflexibility in national policies to address country-specific developments. For example, they willneed to be able to respond to asymmetric shocks, that by their nature do not affect all euro areacountries equally, and to more deep-seated economic problems related to the structure of theireconomies. Clearly, following the introduction of the euro, the instruments of monetary policyand the exchange rate are no longer available to national governments for addressing country-specific developments. Therefore the need for flexibility in other policies at the national level iseven more apparent than before. Such national flexibility will be necessary both to address short-term imbalances in demand and to deepen structural reform efforts with a view to improving thesupply-side conditions of the individual euro area economies. National governments retain theprincipal ability to address both objectives as they retain control of fiscal policy and the capacityto undertake structural reform.Responding to short-term imbalances in demandLet us first consider the role that national governments continue to play in responding to short-term imbalances in patterns of demand. It is sometimes argued that the requirements of theStability and Growth Pact will prevent national governments from using fiscal policy to addressthese imbalances. However, if implemented correctly and without undue delay, the contrary istrue, as compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact provisions will allow sufficient room formanoeuvre. The centrepiece of the budgetary provisions to be respected by member states is themedium-term objective of a budgetary position close to balance or in surplus. Sound governmentfinances are important to strengthen the conditions for price stability and for the strong andsustainable growth necessary to support employment growth. Moreover, if governments achieve
BIS Review   33/19994balanced budgets in normal periods of the cycle, they create a safety margin, sufficient to allowthe operation of automatic stabilisers in the event of a slowdown, or in the face of unexpectedshocks, without risking excessive deficits.The problem at the moment is that in the euro area as a whole we are still far from reaching thetarget of balanced budgets in normal cyclical conditions. Substantial structural imbalancescontinue to restrict the flexibility of public sector budgets. In a number of countries, deficit-to-GDP ratios remain close to the 3% value set in the Treaty as a reference for excessive deficits,rather than the medium-term balanced or surplus position envisaged in the Stability and GrowthPact. Recent fiscal consolidation has been rather disappointing. A significant increase in overalldeficits, for instance as a response to a decline in real GDP growth rates, could reverse theprogress we have seen in recent years in reducing deficit-to-GDP ratios across the euro area.Moreover, in the case of a prolonged growth slowdown, it is quite possible that deficits willquickly reach excessive levels.So it is clear that it is of the utmost importance that governments make structural improvementsto their fiscal positions, as this would allow them to regain sufficient flexibility in their budgetsand, most importantly, could effectively contribute to supporting stability and growth in the euroarea. However, despite the desirability of achieving this room for manoeuvre swiftly, onlymoderate fiscal consolidation is currently envisaged for the medium term. A number of stabilityprogrammes are aimed at attaining the necessary flexibility only at a relatively late date, and thisis on the assumption of sustained economic growth and low interest rates. It is important that wesee a commitment from policymakers to ensuring the swift achievement of this aim or to goingbeyond the aims envisaged in these programmes once economic growth has picked up.The role of longer-term structural reformsThe most important area where there is national flexibility is in relation to structural policies.Indeed it is arguable that many of the important challenges which face euro area countries canonly be addressed through national policies in this area. As the March 1998 Convergence Reportof the European Monetary Institute already identified, there is an urgent need for lasting policyadjustments arising from:• high and persistent unemployment which is largely of a structural nature;• demographic trends which are expected to place a heavy burden on future publicexpenditure; and• the high levels of public debt, which will weigh on the current budgets of many memberstates until debt levels are reduced.To start with the first long-term economic issue, I now turn my attention to the contribution thatstructural reforms to euro area labour markets can make to reducing the very high level ofEuropean unemployment. As I have done in my comparison of the euro with the dollar, let usagain contrast the developments in Europe with those of the United States. In 1970unemployment in the United States, at around 4%, was actually significantly higher than in mostEuropean economies. Since then, although there has been a marked variation in the USunemployment rate during the course of each economic cycle, there has been no apparent long-term trend, as the unemployment rate stood at 4.4% in January 1999. In contrast, averageEuropean unemployment has been on a steadily rising path. The unemployment rates in theUnited States and Europe appeared to have broadly converged by the early 1980s, and since thattime the unemployment rate in the United States has been below the EU average. Even though theeuro area unemployment rate fell last year, the January 1999 figure of 10.6% was more thandouble the corresponding US rate.
5BIS Review   33/1999Looking at the latest unemployment rates around the euro area – which range from 2.8% inLuxembourg (January 1999) and 3.6% in the Netherlands (December 1998) to 17.8% in Spain(January 1999) – suggests that policies must be developed at the national level. What is neededappears to be national structural reforms to make sustainable reductions in unemployment ratherthan a boost to euro area aggregate demand. Moreover, making labour markets more flexible canalso make it easier to cope with short-term imbalances in demand.However, the situation in euro area labour markets is not uniformly bad. Some countries,particularly those with more flexible labour markets, more moderate wage increases and lessdiscouraging tax and social security policies, have managed to avoid the trend of ever-risingunemployment. For example, the Netherlands, Ireland, Portugal, Austria and Luxembourg allcurrently show unemployment rates well below the euro area average. There are also examples ofother countries with higher unemployment rates, such as Spain, that have begun to take steps toreform their labour markets and are now beginning to see tangible results. We can also look atsome of the non-participating member states, such as Denmark and the United Kingdom, to seethat high unemployment can be reduced through structural reforms.The need for structural reform is widely recognised, for instance in the OECD Jobs Study and atthe November 1997 Luxembourg European Council meeting, and some progress with new policymeasures is already being made. First, there are ‘active labour market measures’ to provideeducation, training and work experience – particularly targeted at the long-term unemployed.Second, there are reforms to ensure that tax and social security systems make people significantlybetter off in work than out of it. Third, there are measures to ensure that low-productivity workersare not forced out of the labour market. These include reducing the burden of taxes and non-wagelabour costs and making sure that minimum wage schemes and collectively bargained wageagreements take account of the need to preserve such jobs. I would also wish to add that, contraryto some suggestions, such policies do not amount to ‘competitive devaluations’, and structuralreforms and wage moderation are no ‘zero sum game’. They can help generate net increases inaverage employment and should not be criticised as ‘wage or social dumping’.The second long-term economic issue I should like to address today is the need to prepare for thesubstantial financial consequences of the ageing of European populations. On the basis of currenttrends in birth rates and life expectancy, unfunded public pension and healthcare schemesgenerate very high implicit government liabilities in most euro area countries. Indeed, in manycases these implicit liabilities appear to be of such magnitude that they dwarf even the largeofficial government debt levels. Unless action is taken quickly, these financial burdens will fallon future generations of taxpayers and may also threaten the soundness of government finances.Therefore, to prepare for the ageing of the population, substantial savings need to be made.The third key issue is the need to make progress in reducing the high government debt-to-GDPratios that have substantially increased over the past two decades. Whilst there was someimprovement in the run-up to the start of EMU, the recent progress has been disappointing as theaverage debt-to-GDP ratio for the euro area fell only slightly to 73.8% in 1998, compared with74.6% in 1997. Such imbalances are undesirable and can also have wider implications for theconduct of monetary policy. If there are any doubts about the soundness of fiscal policies, this caninfluence the effectiveness of monetary policy instruments, and undermine the credibility ofmonetary policy.In addition to the long-term economic issues mentioned so far, I should also like to emphasisethat the structural reform agenda available to national governments to promote economicdevelopment extends well beyond the reform of labour markets and public finances. For example,national governments can take steps to promote entrepreneurship and make it easier for people to
BIS Review   33/19996start and run businesses and thus create new jobs. This could involve encouraging competitionthrough measures to promote the entry of new firms, such as reducing the administrative burdensthey face, making markets more competitive and facilitating access to venture capital.Governments can also liberalise previously highly regulated sectors, such as utilities, to increaseefficiency and reduce prices to the benefit of industrial and household users of these services.National governments may also wish to take steps to raise productive investment in research anddevelopment to increase growth in expanding high-tech industries.The introduction of the euro and a common monetary policy has certainly not renderednational governments impotent. With the ability to vary fiscal policy and undertake structuralreforms, national governments retain the key powers to address the real needs of theireconomies. If the terms of the Stability and Growth Pact are adhered to, then there is sufficientflexibility to allow automatic stabilisers to work in the event of a slowdown. Structuralreforms provide the only means of achieving lasting reductions in unemployment, preparingfor the ageing of the population and reducing the burden of government debt. Nationalgovernments would be well advised to press ahead with such reforms. Apart from having theirown merits, such policies would also support the ECB in maintaining price stability in theeuro area.
1BIS Review   32/1999Mr Greenspan discusses financial derivatives and the risks they entailSpeech by the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, AlanGreenspan, before the Futures Industry Association, Boca Raton, Florida, on 19 March 1999.By far the most significant event in finance during the past decade has been the extraordinarydevelopment and expansion of financial derivatives. This morning I should like to evaluatethe scope of these markets, the nature of the risks they entail and some of the difficulties weencounter in managing those risks.At year-end, U.S. commercial banks, the leading players in global derivatives markets,reported outstanding derivatives contracts with a notional value of $33 trillion, a measure thathas been growing at a compound annual rate of around 20 percent since 1990.Of the $33 trillion outstanding at year-end, only $4 trillion were exchange-traded derivatives;the remainder were off-exchange or over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. The greater use ofOTC derivatives doubtless reflects the attractiveness of customized over standardizedproducts. But regulation is also a factor; the largest banks, in particular, seem to regard theregulation of exchange-traded derivatives, especially in the United States, as creating moreburdens than benefits. As I have noted previously, the fact that the OTC markets functionquite effectively without the benefits of the Commodity Exchange Act provides a strongargument for development of a less burdensome regime for exchange-traded financialderivatives.Of course, notional values are not meaningful measures of the risks associated withderivatives. Indeed, it makes no sense to talk about the market risk of derivatives; such riskcan be measured meaningfully only on an overall portfolio basis, taking into account bothderivatives and cash market positions, and the offsets between them.Clearly, the degree of counterparty credit risk on derivatives depends critically on the extent towhich netting and margining procedures are employed to mitigate the risks. In the case ofexchange-traded contracts, of course, daily variation settlements by clearing houses strictlylimit, if not totally eliminate, such counterparty risks.In the case of OTC derivatives, counterparty credit exposures are far larger, though still a verysmall fraction of the notional amounts. On a loan equivalent basis, a reasonably good measureof such credit exposures, U.S. banks’ counterparty exposures on such contracts are estimatedto have totaled about $325 billion last December. This amounted to less than 6 percent ofbanks’ total assets. Still, these credit exposures have been growing rapidly, more or less inline with the growth of the notional amounts.The leading role played by U.S. commercial and investment banks in the global OTCderivatives markets is documented in a Bank for International Settlements survey of last June.This survey estimated the size of the global OTC market at an aggregate notional value of $70trillion, a figure that doubtless is closer to $80 trillion today. Once allowance is made for thedouble-counting of transactions between dealers, U.S. commercial banks’ share of this globalmarket was about 25 percent, and U.S. investment banks accounted for another 15 percent.While U.S. firms’ 40 percent share exceeded that of dealers from any other country, the OTC
BIS Review   32/19992markets are truly global markets, with significant market shares held by dealers in Canada,France, Germany, Japan, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.Despite the world financial trauma of the past eighteen months, there is as yet no evidence ofan overall slowdown in the pre-crisis derivative growth rates, either on or off exchanges.Indeed, the notional value of derivatives contracts outstanding at U.S. commercial banks grewmore than 30 percent last year, the most rapid annual growth since 1994. Although episodesof extreme volatility have produced declines in the most highly leveraged contracts, thegrowth of the more “plain vanilla” products has continued apace or even accelerated.The reason that growth has continued despite adversity, or perhaps because of it, is that thesenew financial instruments are an increasingly important vehicle for unbundling risks. Theseinstruments enhance the ability to differentiate risk and allocate it to those investors most ableand willing to take it. This unbundling improves the ability of the market to engender a set ofproduct and asset prices far more calibrated to the value preferences of consumers than waspossible before derivative markets were developed. The product and asset price signals enableentrepreneurs to finely allocate real capital facilities to produce those goods and services mostvalued by consumers, a process that has undoubtedly improved national productivity growthand standards of living.Nonbank, as well as bank, users of these new financial instruments have increasinglyembraced them as an integral part of their capital risk allocation and profit maximization. Itshould come as no surprise that the profitability of derivative products has been a major factorin the dramatic rise in large banks’ non-interest earnings and doubtless is a factor in thesignificant gain in the overall finance industry’s share of American corporate output duringthe past decade. In short, the value added of derivatives themselves derives from their abilityto enhance the process of wealth creation.While the value of risk unbundling has been known for decades, the ability to createsophisticated instruments that could be effective in a dynamic market had to await the lastdecade’s development of computer and telecommunications technologies. The ability to createand employ sophisticated financial products also galvanized the academic community todevelop increasingly complex models of risk management. While recent history suggests thatsuch models are useful, they are doubtless in need of much improvement – an issue to which Iwill return shortly.Yet beneath all of the evidence of the value of derivatives to a market economy, there remainsa deep-seated fear that while individual risks seem clearly to have been reduced throughderivative-facilitated diversification, systemic risk has become enlarged, as a consequence.Without question, derivatives facilitate the implementation of leveraged trading strategies,though the very technology that has made derivatives feasible has also improved the ability toleverage without derivatives. Nonetheless, the possibility of increased systemic risk doesappear to be an issue that requires fuller understanding.We should point out, first, the obvious. Overall, derivatives are mainly a zero sum game: onecounterparty’s market loss is the other counterparty’s market gain. Counterparty creditexposures on OTC derivatives are a different issue and the source of much of the systemicconcerns. Such losses rose to record levels in the third quarter of 1998. Nonetheless, the rateof loss remained well below that on banks’ loan portfolios. Moreover, the counterparty credit
3BIS Review   32/1999losses in the third quarter can be traced primarily to the extraordinary events in Russia, whichproduced many defaults on ruble forward contracts. In the fourth quarter such losses droppedsharply, albeit not to the very low pre-crisis rate.The bulk of the losses reported by the major derivative houses for the financially turbulentthird quarter of last year reflected declines in the market values of their underlying tradingpositions, especially in equities, commodities and emerging market debt. Derivativeinstruments were bystanders. They may well have intensified the losses in underlying markets,but they were scarcely the major players.Yet, through the past decades’ phenomenal growth of the derivative market, there has notbeen a significant downturn in the economy overall that has tested the resilience of derivativemarkets. (I operate on the premise that neither human nature nor the business cycle has beenrendered obsolete.)While nothing short of a major economic adjustment is likely to test the underlying robustnessof the derivative markets, there are reasons to believe that there are some fundamentalstrengths in these markets. First, despite the growing use of more exotic over-the-counterinstruments, the vast majority of trades are relatively straightforward interest rate and currencyswaps. The market risk on such swaps is presumably less daunting to individualcounterparties than their underlying exposures, or presumably the swaps would never havebeen initiated. Moreover, the credit risks are increasingly subject to comprehensive nettingand margin requirements that, although they do not fully remove the risk, significantlyameliorate it. And so far as banks are concerned, capital requirements are applied to such risksas they are to loans that create credit risks quite similar to those of derivatives.Hence, although one may harbor concerns about the overall capital adequacy of banks andtheir degree of leverage, there is little to distinguish such concerns between risk-adjusted on-and off-balance sheet claims.The one area of risk that needs more thought is so-called potential future exposure. At anyparticular point in time only a small fraction of the notional value of derivative contracts arein the money – that is, have a positive market value. Because prices will doubtless change inthe future, those contracts with negative or even positive values have the potential of largerpositive values and, hence, a potential credit loss on default.That future potential for loss upon counterparty default will differ by the nature of thecontract. For purposes of supervisory risk-based capital requirements, potential futureexposure (over and above the current market value of derivatives, if positive) is currentlyestimated by separating derivatives into categories based on the underlying instrument(interest rate, exchange rate, commodity, equity, etc.) and the remaining maturity. The capitalrequirement is then derived by applying fixed factors to each category that reflect differencesin the price volatilities of the instruments and the structure of the contracts. Interest rate swaps(70 percent of the notional value of OTC derivatives) have limited long-term loss potential,primarily because the contracts do not provide for an exchange of principal and the exposureis effectively amortized as interest payments are exchanged over the life of the contract.Foreign exchange, commodity and equity derivatives, of course, entail far greater exposures,either because principal amounts are exchanged or because the underlying’s price is morevolatile.
BIS Review   32/19994This approach to regulatory capital requirements is not altogether satisfactory. The mostsophisticated derivative dealers parse their derivatives book in more detail. And certainly asingle point estimate cannot capture the range of losses that might reasonably be experienced.Hence, in evaluating derivatives risk, far more stress testing of the lower probability outcomesis a necessity. Even a one in 500 occurrence does happen once every 500 times, and if thatoccurrence could threaten the franchise value of the derivatives counterparty it is an importantconcern for risk aversion.But we have to be careful of how we view these ostensibly low-probability events. They arelow-probability only if we presume that the reality from which these events derive is bestrepresented by a single bell-shaped probability distribution, be it a normal distribution or evena fat-tailed one.Modern quantitative approaches to risk measurement and risk management take as theirstarting-point historical experience with market price fluctuations, which is statisticallysummarized in probability distributions. We live in what is mostly a stable economic systemin which market imbalances give rise to continuous and inevitable moves toward equilibriumresolutions. However, the violence of the responses to what seemed to be relatively mildimbalances in southeast Asia in 1997 and throughout the global economy in August andSeptember of 1998 have raised the possibility of a discontinuous adjustment process.Almost all the time investors adopt strategies that seek profit only in a relatively long-termcontext, fostering the propensity for convergence toward equilibrium that ordinarilycharacterizes financial markets. But from time to time (and quite possibly with increasingfrequency) the resulting propensity toward convergent equilibrium has given way as investorssuffer an abrupt collapse of comprehension of, and confidence in, future economic events.Risk aversion accordingly rises dramatically and deliberative trading strategies are replaced byrising fear-induced disengagement. Yield spreads on relatively risky assets widendramatically. In the more extreme manifestation, the inability to differentiate among degreesof risk drives trading strategies to ever more liquid instruments. Strategies become so tentativethat traders want the capacity to reverse decisions at minimum cost. As a consequence, evenamong riskless assets, illiquidity premiums rise dramatically as investors seek the heavilytraded “on-the-run” issues.History tells us that sharp reversals in confidence happen abruptly, most often with littleadvance notice. They are self-reinforcing processes that can compress into a very short timeperiod. Panic market reactions are characterized by a dramatic shift to maximize short-termvalue, and are an extension of human behavior that manifests itself in all forms of humaninteraction – a set of responses that does not seem to have changed over the generations. Idefy anyone to distinguish a speculative price pattern for 1999 from one for 1899 if the chartsspecify neither the dates nor the levels of the prices.If this paradigm turns out to be the appropriate representation of the way our economy and ourfinancial markets will work in the future, it has significant implications for risk management.Probability distributions estimated largely, or exclusively, over cycles excluding periods ofpanic will underestimate the probability of extreme price movements because they fail tocapture a secondary peak at the extreme negative tail that reflects the probability of occurrenceof a panic. Furthermore, joint distributions estimated over panicless periods will
5BIS Review   32/1999underestimate the degree of correlation between asset returns during panics when fear anddisengagement by investors result in simultaneous declines (or, in rare instances, increases) invalues as investors no longer adequately differentiate among degrees of risk and liquidity.Consequently, the benefits of portfolio diversification will tend to be significantlyoverestimated by current models.Such a view of the world would also have important implications for approaches to theprudential oversight of capital adequacy for banks and other financial institutions. Regulatoryminimum capital requirements for banks’ trading portfolios are now based on the banks’ owninternal risk measurement models. Furthermore, regulators are exploring the potential forusing an internal models approach to credit risk in the banking book.Some may now argue that the periodic emergence of financial panics implies a need toabandon models-based approaches to regulatory capital and to return to traditional approachesbased on regulatory risk measurement schemes. In my view, however, this would be a majormistake. Regulatory risk measurement schemes are simpler and much less accurate thanbanks’ risk measurement models. Consequently, they provide banks with the motive and theopportunity to engage in regulatory arbitrage that seriously undermines the regulatory standardand frustrates the underlying safety and soundness objective. Specifically, they induce banksto reduce holdings of assets where risks and regulatory capital are overestimated by regulatorsand increase holdings of assets where risks are underestimated by regulators.It would be far better to provide incentives for banks to enhance their risk modelingprocedures by taking account of the potential existence and implications of discontinuousepisodes. Scenario analysis can highlight vulnerabilities to the kind of flights to quality andflights to liquidity that seem increasingly frequent. Stress testing of correlation assumptionscan reveal the disappearance of apparent diversification benefits in such scenarios.Stress testing requirements already are part of the internal models approach to capitalrequirements for market risks in bank trading accounts. Stress testing of estimates ofcounterparty credit risks should also be required. The logic is the same as for market risk. Thefactors that are used to determine supervisory capital requirements for counterparty creditexposures are based on statistical analyses of non-panic periods. Moreover, during panicperiods the usual assumption that potential future exposures are uncorrelated with defaultprobabilities becomes invalid. For example, the collapse of emerging market currencies cangreatly increase the probability of defaults by residents of those countries at the same time thatexposures on swaps in which those residents are obligated to pay foreign currency areincreasing dramatically.Supervisors should avoid any temptation to increase the supervisory factors for potentialfuture exposure to address these crisis scenarios, which have vastly different implications fordifferent combinations of contracts and counterparties. But they can and should review therequirements relating to the scenarios to be simulated by the bank and the incorporation ofstress test results into the policies and limits set by the bank’s management and board ofdirectors.As we approach the twenty-first century, both banks and nonbanks will need to continuallyreassess whether their risk management practices have kept pace with their own evolvingactivities and with changes in financial market dynamics and readjust accordingly. Should
BIS Review   32/19996they succeed I am quite confident that market participants will continue to increase theirreliance on derivatives to unbundle risks and thereby enhance the process of wealth creation.
1BIS Review   31/1999Mr Erçel talks about the Turkish banking systemSpeech by the Governor of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, Mr Gazi Erçel, on theoccasion of the American Turkish Council meeting in Ankara on 18 March 1999.First, I would like to thank the ATC arranging this gathering in Ankara. I am very pleased tobe here today, and I would like to talk about the Turkish banking system.Let me begin by recalling that banks are important and serious institutions. They depend ontrust. They borrow money from the public and use it. They also perform the function ofintermediation of funds. For many centuries they have been institutions that contributed toeconomic development.There are a number of generally accepted, long-standing principles that apply to theseinstitutions. The most important are:- Providing effective supervision over these institutions.- Maintaining an environment in which they can function efficiently.- Making risk-taking measures adaptable and applicable.- Helping to improve the culture of credit.Most of these responsibilities are assigned to public authorities, although some of them arethe responsibility of the banks.During the last two decades, however, financial developments taking place all over the worldhave brought many changes in the practice of banking. Innovations in informationtechnology, the liberalization process of financial markets and a rapid increase in the sheernumber of financial transactions have also affected banking. Competition in banking andother sectors has increased. The number of kinds of risk has grown, and the varieties ofnon-financial institutions have multiplied.All these changes together call for a sounder banking system. They remind us of the fact thatsound banking is a continuous process. The importance of risk management in various kindsof situations is well understood. In today’s environment, our understanding that a sound andefficiently functioning banking system is a fundamental necessity is once again reinforced.So what have we in Turkey done to meet these exigencies? The Turkish banking system isnot a recently established one. Turkey has a deep-rooted banking tradition that goes back tothe 19th century. During the last two or three decades, the banking sector has played aprominent role in the Turkish financial system, and has made considerable progress, aided tosome extent by structural changes, towards making the Turkish economy more financiallyliberalized. In response to the restructuring of the Turkish economy and to the need tointegrate Turkey into the modern world of finance, Turkish banks have made major changesboth in their institutional structures and in the quality of services and products they offer. Asa result of the greater freedom that comes with market-oriented policies and a liberalizedfinancial environment, many entrepreneurs, foreign as well as domestic, have been attractedby the potentially profitable Turkish banking system.
BIS Review   31/19992During the last two decades, the number of banks active in the banking sector has grown from43 to 74. During the same period, the number of foreign banks with subsidiaries or branchesin Turkey increased from four to 20. As of November 1998, 60 banks out of 74 areuniversally commercial banks and the remaining 14 are development and investment banks.Thirty-six of these banks are commercial banks whose majority shares are privately owned;20 are foreign banks established in Turkey or having branch offices in Turkey; and 14, asnoted above, are development and investment banks. As of November 1998, Turkish banksnow operate though their 7,062 local branches. More than 165,000 persons are employed inthe banking sector. In addition, the Turkish banking system is aggressively modern, adoptingevery banking innovation rapidly.Turkish banks, operating in parallel with the process of internationalization andglobalization, have gone one step further by starting to invest in foreign financialestablishments as well. Turkish banks are now able to form joint ventures with foreign banksto open financial subsidiaries and branches abroad. As of November 1998, Turkish banks had63 financial subsidiaries in 19 different countries, and 26 branches in 10 different countries.As of November 1998, the size of the consolidated balance sheet of the banking sector was$114 billion. According to our peer group classification by ownership, public and privatebanks both have significant shares in the sector. As of November 1998, state-ownedcommercial banks account for 35 percent of the banks in the consolidated balance sheet ofthe sector, worth $40 billion, and private banks account for 54 percent of the balance sheet,totalling $62 billion. Meanwhile, the share of foreign banks, with assets of $7 billion, hasheld steady at around 6 percent.Despite the recent privatization of two state-owned commercial banks, this class of banks hasretained its prominent role in the banking sector. But the influence of Turkey’s state-ownedbanks in the banking sector is less significant compared with the influence of state-ownedbanks in some EU and OECD countries.As of November 1998, five major banks, including two of the four state-owned commercialbanks, held 44 percent of the total assets of the banking sector. These five banks held 51percent of total deposits and accounted for 42 percent of total credit extended in the sector.Total equities of these five banks comprised 48 percent of the total equity of the sector. If wesay that these banks also own almost half of the total branch network of the sector, we couldunderstand this concentration. However, the total share of the five major banks representingthe concentration in the Turkish banking system is smaller than the share representing theconcentration in most OECD countries. Again according to 1995 figures, concentration inSweden’s banking system is 86 percent, in Holland 81 percent, in Finland 74 percent, inBelgium 59 percent, in England 57 percent and in Spain 49 percent. In Turkey the figure is 52percent, and is slowly but steadily declining.If we look at the concentration issue from another standpoint, using the data for November1998 and taking into account the total assets of the sector, 65 percent of the Turkish bankingsystem belongs to the top 10 major banks. If we include the 20 foreign banks and brancheshaving a share of 6 percent, and the 14 development and investment banks having a share of 5percent, it can be seen that 76 percent of the banking system is consistent with 10 big banks,foreign and investment banks. The remaining 24 percent of the sector belongs to 30 banks.Among these banks, there are banks that are leaders in the sector, functioning properly andeffectively. However, a limited number of banks have practical problems which are well
3BIS Review   31/1999known to us. We know all their problems. We monitor them. The existing banking laws andother elements of the legal framework do not give us full authority to address them activelyand efficiently. The problem of the state owned banks is occasioned by the state budget, andits solution involves different issues.Now let me talk about risk management in the Turkish banking sector. From the standpointof risk management, we do have well-developed methods of risk management and forsupervising the risks that we undertake.As I pointed out in my brief remarks on the financial standing of the banking sector, Turkishbanks have reached a level of financial and institutional development that should not beunderestimated. But despite all the aforementioned positive aspects, there are also variousthreats to the wellbeing of the Turkish banking sector which I believe are worth mentioning.Turkish banks, like all the other banks in the world, are exposed to credit risk, liquidity risk,interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. This is true even in the absence of anenvironment of global crisis and macroeconomic risks stemming from political uncertainties.These are other issues that merit separate consideration.I will turn now to financial risks. The most important of these is credit risk,  which Turkishbanks pay the most attention to managing. The Turkish banking sector has become used toaccepting and managing credit risk over the years. A credit culture has been developed inwhich firms, sectors, regions and individuals participate. Increased competition in the sectorclearly has implications for the risk-taking process, which requires that the banks restudytheir credit strategy.An overall examination of credit risk showed that the banking sector has been able to manageits credit risks by keeping the level of non-performing loans low in spite of an environmentof shrinking international financing.As to liquidity risk, the fact that depositors prefer shorter terms, while investors, driven byexpectations of high inflation and uncertainty, prefer longer terms, has caused a mismatchingof the maturity structures of the assets and liabilities of the banking sector.As a result, banks become more vulnerable to liquidity risk. Financial distress and globalfinancial crisis were the main ingredients of the conjuncture of 1998. Following scatteredfailures in the emerging financial environment, almost all emerging economies began to betreated as risky, due to growing uncertainty about the near-term outlook for the financialmarkets. In this situation, international investors became more cautious about investing in theemerging markets and became reluctant to provide them with credit. Turkish banks slowedtheir disbursements of credit, preferring to be liquid in the marketplace. We also checkedusing different ratios for the liquidity in the system.Interest rate risk is another important form of systemic risk. Since the maturity structure ofinterest-sensitive liabilities in the Turkish banking system tends to favor the relatively shortermaturity segments, external funds are repriced at shorter intervals than assets. This mismatchin the pricing structure at various periods increases the sensitivity of assets and liabilities tochanges in interest rates. Banks manage the degree of interest rate risk to which they areexposed during times of rising interest rates by converting their low interest bearingsecurities into high interest bearing securities by means of repurchase transactions. Interestrate swaps and some other derivative instruments are also used to hedge interest rate risk.
BIS Review   31/19994As to foreign exchange risk, the difference between the Turkish lira interest rate and thenominal depreciation of the Turkish lira is the major reason why the banks place foreigncurrency funds in Turkish lira funds or other alternative investment opportunities. InTurkey’s case, the practice of taking short positions for foreign exchange started in 1985.After facing several difficulties and losses, the Turkish banking system has become very wellinformed about foreign exchange risk. Furthermore, we, the Turkish authorities, havereduced the risk by means of a number of regulations.I can say that all these kinds of risk have been thoroughly monitored by the supervisoryauthorities, and preventive measures have been put in place before the effects of anyproblems could damage financial stability. All banks operating in Turkey are subject to theBanking Law, and to Decrees and Communiqués concerning the law. This Law authorizesthe Treasury and Central Bank to supervise and regulate banks. Under this regulatoryframework, banks must submit yearly, quarterly and even daily compilations of financial datato the Central Bank and the Treasury. In addition to frequent financial evaluations of banksby off-site examiners, on-site examinations are carried out to confirm the reliability andaccuracy of the reported data, and clarify any special issues arising during off-siteexaminations. The increased volume of foreign exchange transactions, the process ofinternationalization and market-determined prices have all increased the market risk that thebanks are exposed to, and this, in turn, has increased the need to introduce risk measuresaimed at protecting banks’ capital. For this purpose, regulatory studies are jointly conductedby the Central Bank and the Treasury, and commonly accepted risk measures, such as limitson net open foreign exchange positions, and capital adequacy ratios, have been introduced inaddition to credit limits and other measures consistent with EU standards. Another practicefollowed to make supervision more effective and obtain better evaluations of banks’ realfinancial standing is consolidated supervision.Authorized independent bank auditors play an important role in the bank supervision process.Each bank in the sector must obtain an independent audit report every year. These reports areprepared by authorized independent auditing firms operating in accordance with thecommonly accepted international accounting and auditing principles.Another important feature of the Turkish banking system, and not a new one, is its depositinsurance scheme. It was first introduced in 1933 and redesigned in 1983 with theestablishment of the Savings Deposit Insurance Fund. This Fund’s main source of income isa premium paid by banks, equal to a certain percentage of their savings deposits. In 1994 anew Decree came into effect and all banks’ deposits, whether denominated in Turkish lira orforeign currencies, were fully insured by the Fund. This step was necessary at this time tostop the turmoil in Turkey’s financial markets and calm depositors’ nerves.Now, as we all know, the 100 percent coverage may subject both bankers and depositors tomoral hazard in the form of willingness to take greater risks to earn higher returns. Depositorsmay encounter moral hazard when they ignore greater risks associated with their choice of adepository institution which offers them higher rates for their deposits. But even though allthe drawbacks of the present system of deposit protection are well known, current conditionsin the world financial environment and their effects on the Turkish financial system haveprevented us from making the necessary changes in the existing deposit insurance schemejust now. Once we manage to stabilise the macroeconomic environment, we will be able toreduce the 100 percent coverage to internationally acceptable levels.
5BIS Review   31/1999How a powerful and effective supervision could be implemented for the Turkish bankingsystem was foreseen many years ago. The system in effect during the 1930s had revealed itsinadequacies, but the first step was not taken until 1959 with the establishment of the Boardof Sworn Bank Auditors. The system was first applied to the Turkish economy under thedirection of the Ministry of Finance. The Board recruited many valuable employees, trainedthem, and gained the power to supervise the system.But as I mentioned earlier in connection with the need for additional principles to preservethe soundness of the system, the rapid changes of recent years, their consequences and eventsoccurring in the international environment have underlined the importance of effectivesupervision.In 1997, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) enumerated the 25 Core Principles tobe used for banking supervision. The need for such principals was well understood after thefinancial crises in Asia and Russia.I may say that, during these events, which have been going on for several years, the majorityof the Turkish banking system has gained great advantages from adopting these changes.These banks have succeeded in keeping pace with the era, especially with respect totechnological innovations, strategies for risk-taking and management techniques.Besides these advances, there were some factors that damaged the system. These are:1) High inflation.2) High public sector borrowing requirement.3) The lack of an efficient legal framework.In addition, the style of banks’ operations and strategies are somewhat different in a highinflation, as opposed to a normal, environment. On the one hand, banks try to sidestep theharmful effects of inflation. On the other hand, they revise their methods of overcominguncertainty and taking risks. And more important, as the public persists in continuing toborrow, which leads eventually to crowding-out, the banks turn to the public sector as asimple method of investment. This causes them to turn away from their basic function ofintermediation, so essential for the efficient allocation of resources. A system that financesthe public sector loses its power. On the other hand, in an environment like that justdescribed and an economy where capital movements have been liberalized, the soundness ofbanks is especially important.How, then, can banking system soundness be attained? There are four means to this end:1) A more efficient and independent supervision system.2)Embracing internationally accepted auditing principles.3)Improving methods for reducing the financial risks taken by the banks.4)The most important is reducing the internal and external imbalances and preservingmarket stability by creating a sound macroeconomic environment.
BIS Review   31/19996Thus, the most important task for the system belongs to the public. The public authoritieshave an obligation to prepare the necessary legal regulations immediately and pass themthrough Parliament. Regulations that are inadequate or not updated only cause problems toaccumulate.For these reasons the new banking law has been prepared and submitted to Parliament. Theaims of the Draft Law are basically to strengthen supervision and make it more efficient, andto make sure supervision standards remain in line with international standards. The DraftLaw was prepared on the basis of the laws and regulations of the European Union and otheraccepted international practices, and the “25 Core Principles for Effective BankingSupervision” promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements. I hope that after theforthcoming election, the new government will be able to pass this law through Parliament.Now I must state clearly that I do not believe there are serious problems in the Turkishbanking system. There are not many that interfere with the system. We, the public authorities,evaluate the real financial standing of banks. We know the reality well. If we find a problemin the system, we can take the necessary actions within the framework of the law. We havethe necessary tools to do this.The Turkish banking sector has existed for 130 years and knows how to manage risks. It hascredibility in the international arena. It is sounder than many of the world’s national bankingsectors. It is dynamic. Its human resources are well trained. Supervision and auditing requiresseveral years of experience. A correct judgment of the system cannot be obtained by focusingon a couple of difficulties in isolation. These facts should not be overlooked.
1BIS Review   30/1999Mr Thiessen discusses the change in views on the role of monetary policy since thePorter CommissionText of the Tony Hampson Memorial Lecture by Gordon G Thiessen, Governor of the Bankof Canada, at the C D Howe Institute, Toronto, Ontario, on 11 March 1999.A. TONY HAMPSON AND THE PORTER COMMISSIONTony Hampson made a number of outstanding contributions to Canadian public life as well ashaving a successful business career. Many in this audience will be familiar with the fact thatfor a number of years he was Chairman of the C.D. Howe Institute’s Policy AnalysisCommittee. Early in his career, he worked on the Royal Commission on Canada’s EconomicProspects (the Gordon Commission) and, most prominently, served as secretary of the RoyalCommission on Banking and Finance (the Porter Commission).His colleagues, on these Commissions as elsewhere, remember an engaging personality, anambitious and demanding manager, a clear-headed analyst, and a thorough and helpful editor.He was also a superb communicator and writer. Let me quote the acknowledgement in thePorter Report: “Our greatest debt has been to Mr. H. A. Hampson, the Secretary of theCommission. His intellect, organizing ability and energy proved invaluable in the planning ofour work, the development of our views and the drafting of our entire report.”1The hearings and analysis undertaken in the early 1960s by the Porter Commission, togetherwith its Report and the discussions it generated, were events of major importance for theCanadian financial system and for the Bank of Canada. Indeed, I will suggest in this lecturethat the Porter Report contained the seeds of a major reorientation of thinking about financialstructure and monetary policy. Its emphasis on competition, and on the use of marketmechanisms in the implementation of monetary policy, clearly showed the way ahead. It alsoforesaw many of the subsequent changes in financial institutions and markets. Moreover, theCommission underlined the necessity for inflation control at a time when the view thatinflation could be traded off for lower unemployment was gaining in popularity.The Commissioners themselves, chaired by Chief Justice of Ontario Dana Porter, were peopleof experience and insight. They assembled an extraordinarily talented young research staff,and Tony Hampson proved to be an admirable team leader.The Commission believed in markets. This was not such a popular stance at the time.Extensive government controls, a legacy of the post-World War Two period, were still inplace in many advanced economies, and they were widely thought to be necessary, if notdesirable. In contrast, the Porter Commission felt that the somewhat more liberal financialregime in Canada was by and large working effectively. The financial system had played acentral role in the post-war expansion, especially in the smooth financing of the tremendouswave of investment in the 1950s. Moreover, at the time it was undergoing considerablechange, in response to the evolving demands in the financial markets of households, firms andgovernments. On the basis of this encouraging experience, the Porter Report came outstrongly in favour of increased competition and deregulation. It was aware that this mightentail some risks, but thought they were worth taking.                                                     1Porter Commission Report, p. 572.
BIS Review   30/19992This advice was followed in the revisions to federal financial legislation of 1967, notably inthe following measures:2 removal of the 6 per cent ceiling on bank loan rates; permission forbanks to enter conventional (i.e. non-government-insured) mortgage lending; prohibition ofinterbank agreements on interest rates and of interlocking directorates; and the reduction ofthe burden of cash reserve requirements on chartered bank deposits.These measures have stood the test of time and have served Canada well. For example, theliberalization of interest rates allowed financial institutions to adapt appropriately to therequirements of the more volatile financial environment of the decades that followed. Canadawas spared the systemic weaknesses caused elsewhere by ceilings on administered interestrates. In the United States, for example, such ceilings were a major factor encouraging theunbalanced portfolios of the thrift institutions, which in the 1980s would be revealed as a fatalflaw.In more philosophical terms, Porter’s arguments on financial liberalization and competitionwere ahead of their time, and still read very well today.I cite all this to underline that the Porter Commission made an important difference to ourfinancial landscape. But financial reform, important and topical though it may be, is not thecentral theme of my lecture. Instead, I will focus on the Commission’s work on the conduct ofmonetary policy. First, I will set out a broad characterization of the view of monetary policy inthe Porter Report. I have not tried to provide a thorough description of the Commission’sanalysis of monetary policy. Rather, I have focused on a few general policy issues that strikeme as important. Next, I will present the general approach to policy that is taken today.Comparison of the two, you will see, reveals some striking differences, but also somecommon themes. These themes lead me to the view that the Porter Commission Report andthe surrounding debate were a key step in the evolution towards the current monetary policyframework in Canada.3B. THE PORTER COMMISSION VIEW OF MONETARY POLICY1. The basic frameworkThe Porter Report in most respects adopted a standard 1960s view of monetary policy. It wasthe heyday of Keynesianism, in official circles as well as in the universities. Although MiltonFriedman and his collaborators had begun their restoration of the quantity theory with some                                                     2 The main revisions were to the Bank Act and the Bank of Canada Act. While the Commission hadrecommended a comprehensive definition of banking, the legislation did not go so far as to eliminatedistinctions between different kinds of financial institutions. Moreover, the Commission was againstgovernment-backed deposit insurance, which was nevertheless enacted in 1967, following a run on atrust company.3 The Commission also dealt with the issue of central bank governance. It recommended formalizing theagreement on dual government-Bank of Canada responsibility that Louis Rasminsky had drawn upbefore accepting his appointment as governor. In consequence, the Bank of Canada Act was amended in1967 to provide the Minister of Finance with the right to issue a directive to the Bank if the governmentdisapproved of the Bank’s policy. Thus, the government is ultimately responsible for monetary policy,but if no directive is issued the Bank has full responsibility for designing and implementing monetarypolicy.
3BIS Review   30/1999impressive, if controversial, empirical work,4 theirs was very much a minority view in theearly 1960s.There were four key tenets in the standard view of monetary policy at the time.5First, monetary policy was seen as just one element of macroeconomic policy, which in itsentirety has multiple objectives (high employment and output, low inflation, rapid economicgrowth, external balance, etc). And it was argued that monetary, fiscal and debt managementpolicies should be coordinated in pursuit of these objectives. These propositions reflected astrong focus on the short run. While there is no doubt that monetary policy and fiscal policyboth affect real variables in the short run, it was less clear at the time that the effects ofmonetary policy on the demand for goods and services did not extend into the longer run.Given its short time horizon, it was not surprising that macroeconomic analysis in the 1960sfocused on stabilizing output and employment.Second, monetary policy on its own was viewed as not very effective. Large movements incredit conditions or interest rates might in theory have a large economic impact, but they hadto be avoided because of harmful side effects (instrument instability, financial instability,balance of payments repercussions, etc.). The changes in credit conditions that were feasiblehad a comparatively limited effect.Third, the credit channel was thought to be the main source of impact of monetary policy onthe economy. Conventional monetary policy instruments (open market operations, bankreserve management, and Bank Rate changes) were said to affect credit flows by changing theliquidity positions of financial institutions. This credit channel embodied the effects of boththe availability and the cost of borrowing. However, its overall influence was complex andtypically slow; and the impact of an easing of credit was considered to be especially weak –“you can’t push on a string.”6Fourth, a need was seen for moral suasion or formal controls on lending in difficult short-runsituations, such as balance of payments crises. The Commission recognized the defects ofsuch measures: arbitrary discrimination, economic distortions, and eroding effectiveness overtime. However, the general view at the time was that such controls were helpful when quickeffects were urgently needed.2. The relationship between inflation and economic activityIn 1958, A.W. Phillips published the analysis of the relationship between wage increases andunemployment in the United Kingdom that now bears his name, and researchers in the UnitedStates soon found a similar relationship.7 By the early 1960s macroeconomists were regarding                                                     4See, for example, Friedman (1956).5 These ideas were also to be found in similar inquiries of that time in the United Kingdom (the RadcliffeReport) and in the United States (the Commission on Money and Credit). However, there were somedifferences in the argumentation of the three reports. For example, Radcliffe was most interventionistwhile Porter was the strongest advocate of market mechanisms.6Porter Commission Report, p. 434.7Phillips (1958), Samuelson and Solow (1960).
BIS Review   30/19994the Phillips curve as a description of a policy trade-off between inflation and unemployment.By accepting more inflation, it seemed possible to reach a higher level of output. A seminalstudy of the policy implications of the Phillips curve was in a Royal Commission WorkingPaper by Grant Reuber.8 The Porter Commission accepted this line of reasoning and arguedthat a balance had to be struck between the goals of price stability and maximizing output, andthat neither should be pursued to the exclusion of the other.At the same time, however, the Commission was aware that inflation could have verynegative longer-run consequences for the economy. “The objective of stable prices..., whiledesirable for its own sake, is also important as a means to a wider end.... rising prices canweaken real economic growth by undermining the system of fixed value contracts on whichefficient business is founded, by generating a fear of long-term saving and lendingcommitments, and by diverting real resources into unproductive and inefficient channels ....”9In a similar vein, the Report rejected the argument for mild inflation to lubricate real wageadjustment, after noting that productivity was increasing at 2 per cent a year, so that aconsiderable degree of adjustment was possible without real wage declines, and that measuresto increase market flexibility were a better solution. The Report also described inflation asacting “like a drug whose dose must be continually increased to get the same effect: if theauthorities permitted the economy to become addicted, the inevitable return to reality wouldbring about very painful withdrawal adjustments.”10These passages were prescient in the light of what was to happen over the next 20 years.However, the Report struggled to reconcile its advocacy of multiple targets with its vividwarnings about inflation. The tension between the two, we can now see, stemmed largelyfrom a lack of clarity about relevant time horizons. The multiple targets approach to monetarypolicy focused on the short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment. It did notrecognize that this trade-off disappears over time as inflation expectations adjust to changes inthe rate of inflation. The idea of a vertical long-run Phillips curve, which was implied by theadjustment of inflation expectations, was developed only later in the decade.11 At the sametime, the Report did recognize the likely damage that inflation could cause in the longer run tothe productive capacity of the economy.In the end, the Report did not recommend the firm guideline for monetary policy that itsspirited advocacy of price stability would, in retrospect, seem to have justified.12 Despite thisambivalence, the Commission was more far-sighted in its concerns about inflation than the                                                     8See Reuber (1962, 1964).9Porter Commission Report, pp. 399-400.10Porter Commission Report, p. 419.11The main authors were Milton Friedman (1968) and Edmund Phelps (1967).12 The Submissions of the Bank of Canada also pointed to the importance of restraining inflation (II,paragraph 59): “Central banks feel a particular obligation for seeing that in the consideration given tothe proper ‘mix’ of public policies adequate emphasis is at all times placed on price stability... being in aposition to exercise an influence on the volume of money, they must inevitably be concerned with itsvalue.”
5BIS Review   30/1999consensus of economists of the day, which was that the Bank of Canada had been investingtoo much in fighting inflation.133. The scope for monetary policy under a fixed exchange rateCanada had been on a floating exchange rate regime when the Porter Commission wasappointed in October 1961, but the government adopted a fixed exchange rate in May 1962.Given the degree of asset substitutability between Canada and the United States, Canadianinterest rates were thereafter tightly constrained by the objective of maintaining the dollar atthe parity of 92.5 U.S. cents.14With respect to longer-run policy objectives, as we know today, the fixed exchange rateimplied that monetary policy in Canada would be mainly determined in the United States.However, the prevailing opinion among economists, reflected in the Porter Report, was thatCanadian monetary policy could nevertheless serve a constructive short-run purpose withrespect to the range of macroeconomic policy objectives, as long as the currency was fixed ata reasonable value and the government had an adequate reserve of foreign exchange.At the time, most policy-oriented economists did not draw the sharp distinction we now dobetween fixed and floating exchange rate regimes. To understand this, we have to recognizethree factors. First, under Canada’s floating exchange rate regime of the 1950s – which wasthe only post-war experience in the industrialized world to go by – variations in the exchangerate had been quite modest, as had the movements in Canada-U.S. interest rate differentials.That is, in practice, the float did not appear to be very different from a fixed rate regime.Second, with their focus on short-run output and employment, policy-makers tended toneglect the possible inconsistency between the objective for domestic inflation and the fixedexchange rate. Third, the theory of monetary policy in an open economy was in a fairlyrudimentary state.15 The severe constraints that a fixed exchange rate imposes even on short-run monetary policy choices in a world of high asset substitutability were not fully appreciatedat the time.In the case where a conflict might materialize between domestic objectives and the fixedexchange rate for the dollar, the Commission recommended that domestic considerationsshould prevail, and that the exchange rate parity be allowed to change. But it did not reopenthe debate over the exchange rate, which had been a topic of heated political controversyearlier in the decade. By 1964, at the time the Report was published, the view of the Canadianauthorities was very much that the fixed exchange rate system was appropriate, and that theexisting parity was in the right range.                                                     13In part these views stemmed from theories of inflation that emphasized non-monetary factors, e.g. costpush, union or seller power, demand shift, struggle for income, and so on.14Exchange controls had been eliminated in the early 1950s. The Canadian dollar would remain fixeduntil June 1970.15Robert Mundell was at that very time making the contributions that would form the standard modernmodel for open-economy policy analysis. See Mundell (1961, 1962, and 1963).
BIS Review   30/199964. Monetary policy instruments and the transmission mechanismBoth the Porter Commission and the Bank in its submissions described the transmission ofmonetary policy actions in terms of their effects on credit conditions. By credit conditionsthey meant “the whole range of terms and conditions affecting borrowing and lending and thepurchase and sale of financial assets.”16 This would include, most importantly, interest rates,but also standards of creditworthiness, collateral, repayment periods, and other terms andconditions.In general, whereas the Bank of Canada17 stressed the importance of availability effects, thePorter Report was more inclined to give a central place to interest rates. One of the reasonswhy the Bank of Canada put so much emphasis on credit availability at that time was because,even apart from the 6 per cent bank loan rate ceiling, it believed that wide fluctuations ininterest rates were not feasible. Indeed, historical experience was of a quite narrow range ofinterest rate movements. For example, the prime lending rate of the chartered banks, a key ratein the transmission mechanism, had never been lower than 4.5 per cent, while the maximumlegal rate was 6 per cent – a range of 150 basis points. There simply had not been much scopefor borrowing costs to vary.As outlined by the Commission and the Bank, there were a number of possible reasons for thisbelief that wider movements in interest rates were not feasible: the possibility of instrumentinstability (with interest rates swinging abruptly), the potential effect of sharp changes insecurity prices on the stability of financial institutions, adverse public opinion, and theexternal constraint posed by the fixed exchange rate. While the Commission agreed with someof these concerns, it nonetheless argued that such considerations should not stand in the wayof a vigorous monetary policy.The Porter Report accepted, however, the description put forward by the Bank of Canada ofthe way that monetary policy affected the operation of chartered banks. The provision of cashreserves by the Bank of Canada would bring about changes in chartered bank holdings ofliquid assets, which over time would affect the banks’ willingness to make loans. However,when quick results were deemed necessary, the Bank felt that resort to direct limits on banklending would be justified. On the several occasions that moral suasion had been employed inthe 1950s, it had seemed to work. The Commission showed little enthusiasm for suchintervention. It argued that controls impaired market efficiency, were discriminatory, and wereof diminishing effectiveness over time. There was also a concern about their clumsiness,especially the delays in making instructions effective in bank branches across the country, andpossible misinterpretation of their eventual withdrawal.Despite all that was said and done about the credit conditions approach to monetary policy,empirically any significant effects seem to have been confined to a few brief periods of moralsuasion and the impact on residential construction of the lags in changing the administeredNHA mortgage rate and the interaction between this rate and the 6 per cent bank lending rateceiling. The available empirical evidence did not indicate that changes in credit conditionssystematically had much effect on aggregate demand. Econometric tests reported in theCommission’s Working Papers show no significant effects on consumption and investment                                                     16Bank of Canada Submissions, II, para. 11.17Bank of Canada Submissions, II, paras. 13 and 14.
7BIS Review   30/1999spending from interest rate or credit variables.18 This seems to have been because monetarypolicy actions had not been very aggressive.These results confirmed the conventional belief that ordinary monetary policy actions werenot very effective. And this was a major reason for the insistence on policy packages with theright mix of fiscal and monetary policy, plus coordinated debt management policy, and on thepossible need for moral suasion and/or some sort of direct controls on bank lending.5. The role of debt managementI have noted that the package of macroeconomic policies advocated during the 1960s tendedto include debt management policy along with fiscal and monetary policies. Certainly, centralbankers of the day regarded debt management policy as an integral part of macroeconomicpolicy. The Porter Report had some sympathy with this notion. There were three discerniblelines of thinking here.First, monetary policy is itself a kind of debt management with an open market operationswitching one public sector liability (central bank deposits) for another (e.g. treasury bills).Second, changes in relative supplies of debt could affect the liquidity of the banks and hencetheir willingness to lend. Third, debt management might directly alter the term structure ofinterest rates.These notions may have had greater plausibility at the time, when there were some indicationsof segmented markets. But over time, market segmentation diminished in importance as bothlenders and borrowers became increasingly willing to adjust the maturity of theircommitments in response to interest rate differences across the term structure. Moreover, inthe years following the publication of the Porter Report, evidence accumulated supporting theexpectations theory of the term structure of interest rates. According to this theory, long-termrates are the average expected value of future short-term rates, plus a liquidity risk premium.Although in principle the latter could vary systematically as the composition of debt changes,in practice such effects, if they exist at all, are of too short duration to have anymacroeconomic impact.C. THE CANADIAN POLICY FRAMEWORK IN THE 1990s1. The basic propositionsBetween the 1960s and the 1990s, informed opinion about the appropriate role of centralbanks shifted radically. The current mainstream view can be briefly summarized in thefollowing four propositions.First, the main objective of monetary policy is to preserve the value of money, in other wordsto achieve a very low rate of inflation over the long run. Other economic objectives are notignored, however, because price stability is the best contribution that monetary policy canmake towards high employment and, more generally, towards a prosperous, growingeconomy. Second, an independent monetary policy, or, more precisely, a domestically setobjective for inflation, logically requires a floating exchange rate. Third, markets, and pricemechanisms, work efficiently and thus provide effective channels for the transmission of                                                     18Johnson and Winder (1962) and Reuber (1962).
BIS Review   30/19998monetary policy through short-term interest rates and the exchange rate. Fourth, short-terminterest rates must be adjusted as much as required to meet the monetary policy objective.Most of the present policy framework is, I hope, reasonably familiar to you. So I will spareyou further detail. Instead, I would like to underline the magnitude of the revision that hastaken place in accepted thinking about monetary policy since the Porter Commission, and tospeculate on the reasons for the shift.2. Contrasts in views about policy objectivesThe sharpest apparent contrasts between the ideas and practices I have sketched for the twoperiods concern the objectives of monetary policy. Nowadays we focus the job of the centralbank squarely on the single objective of price stability. In the 1960s, that would have beenlooked upon by most observers as an extreme and partial view of the role of monetarypolicy.19What has been learned from the experience over the years is that high and variable inflationcan be very costly for the economy and that aiming at low and stable inflation is the bestcontribution that monetary policy can make to achieving, over time, the multiple economicobjectives espoused by Porter. Desirable economic outcomes can never be guaranteed, butchances of achieving them are best when inflation is low and stable. That is, low inflation isan indispensable asset for the achievement of the other economic goals.20Consider, for example, the accepted view during the 1960s that there was an exploitable trade-off between inflation and unemployment. Along with the short-term perspective of policy-makers, this view led to excessively easy monetary and fiscal policies in most industrialcountries. In Canada, we found ourselves confronted by an enormous and destructiveinflation, with peaks in the mid-1970s and the beginning of the 1980s, and another bout ofupward pressure in the late 1980s. Moreover, the high rates of inflation were accompanied byan economic slowdown in the 1970s (reflected in the coining of the term “stagflation”) andwere followed by unusually sharp economic recessions in the early 1980s and early 1990s.The idea of an exploitable long-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment waseffectively demolished by this experience. And the lesson was reinforced by the success of thefirm stance in favour of price stability taken by the German and Japanese central banks in thelate 1970s.                                                     19The Bank has long had a concern about restraining inflation. What was lacking in the past was thesupport from theory and experience to make that focus more precise and explicit. Public milestones inthe evolution of the Bank’s views were three lectures by my predecessors: the 1966 Per JacobssonLecture by Louis Rasminsky on the objectives of monetary policy and the mechanisms through which itoperates; the 1982 Per Jacobsson Lecture by Gerald Bouey, which highlighted the need for a “place tostand” or, in other words, for a “nominal anchor”; and the 1988 Hanson Lecture of John Crow, whichsingled out price stability as the objective of monetary policy in Canada. Also, I would draw attention toGerald Bouey’s final Annual Report, for 1986, which emphasized the costs of inflation and the difficultyof reducing it once entrenched.20For a fuller explanation of the relation between price stability and other economic objectives, seeThiessen (1998-1999).
9BIS Review   30/1999The inflation of the 1970s and early 1980s demonstrated just how costly inflation was andhow difficult it was to eradicate once rooted in expectations. These experiences were keyfactors underlying the shift in views about monetary policy. They also were central to theacceptance of the expectations-augmented Phillips curve in place of the simple Phillips curveas part of the analytic framework underlying monetary policy.This is not just theory or central bank ideology. As we look around the world and over history,we see that countries that achieve high standards of living and sustained strong output growthhave also maintained low rates of inflation.3. Understanding the role of the exchange rate in monetary policyAs I explained earlier in this lecture, when the Commission was preparing its Report, neitherthe then current economic theory nor the Canadian experience of the 1950s provided strongevidence for the crucial role that exchange rate flexibility plays in the operation of monetarypolicy in an open economy like Canada’s. When we floated our exchange rate in 1950 andagain in 1970, it was because we were pushed off our pegged rate by the pressures of risingcommodity prices and associated strong inflows of capital. The notion of a national monetarypolicy with an independent inflation target did not feature in these decisions.As we now see it, a floating exchange rate plays two key roles. In the first place, in the longrun a floating currency allows the central bank to pursue a national inflation target, regardlessof the behaviour of foreign inflation. In the second place, variations in the currency allow thereal exchange rate, and hence the economy, to adjust more smoothly to international shocks torelative prices.It was only after currency and capital controls began to be removed (or were increasinglybypassed) in the post-war period, and domestic financial markets became more deregulated ina number of countries, that economists came to appreciate fully the interaction of domesticinterest rates and exchange rates. In open economies with unhindered capital flows, it is onlywhen the real exchange rate moves to levels where it is widely expected to appreciate ordepreciate that domestic real interest rates can temporarily move away from their internationalcounterparts.Furthermore, what we understand much more clearly these days is that movements in the realexchange rate are a major part of the process whereby an economy returns to a sustainablegrowth path after being hit by a shock. For example, it is well known that a drop in worldcommodity prices reduces the real equilibrium value of the Canadian dollar. If this is broughtabout by currency depreciation, the overall domestic price level need not deviate from itstarget path. In contrast, with a fixed exchange rate, domestic prices would have to fall belowthat path, and perhaps fall absolutely, to bring about the required decline in the real exchangerate. It is clear that real exchange rate adjustment works much more smoothly when thenominal exchange rate can adjust. However, for the benefits of exchange rate flexibility to berealized, expectations about nominal exchange rates must be anchored by a monetary policythat is focused on maintaining low and stable inflation over the medium term.4. Increased confidence in the resilience and efficiency of marketsIt would have been unthinkable in the 1960s to have suggested that the central bank’sinfluence over interest rates was, in and of itself, enough to enable it to keep the rate of
BIS Review   30/199910inflation low and stable. The view at the time was that there were narrow bounds on how farinterest rates could be moved, and that these severely limited what the central bank couldaccomplish by varying them. As a result, moral suasion to affect bank lending policies ordirect controls were seen as important additional instruments for central banks.A key reason for the change in attitude today is an increased confidence in markets. Certainly,at central banks, we are more confident than we were in the 1960s of the ability of financialmarkets to absorb changes in interest rates. At the same time, we have accumulated strongevidence to support the view that market mechanisms transmit monetary policy actionseffectively.In the 1960s the Porter Commission was ahead of the Bank, and of conventional wisdom, inthis. It envisaged a monetary system that in key respects would function much as it does today– driven by market forces, flexible, and frequently undergoing rapid change. In itsrecommendations for reform, the Commission was looking forward to a world in whichmonetary policy would be increasingly reliant for its effectiveness on appropriate movementsin financial market prices.In line with this view, the Porter Report maintained that institutions and markets were wellable to withstand substantial shocks and warned against letting the conduct of monetary policybe excessively influenced by an undue concern for the stability of asset values. It saw that theaversion to significant interest rate movements expressed at the time by the Bank of Canadaput at risk its ability to achieve its macroeconomic objectives. In one of its more colourfulphrases, the Report warned that “the authorities must not be restrained by excessivetenderness.”21However, the present confidence in markets is not just a question of philosophy. Since the1960s, a variety of legislative and structural changes have made the financial sector still moreresilient and flexible. This has made the transmission of monetary policy more efficient andhas eliminated residual concerns about the inability of the markets to cope with the effects ofcentral bank actions.D. CONCLUDING REMARKSEven though the Porter Commission had some remarkable insights, there is no doubt thatthere has been a major change in views since the 1960s with respect to the objective ofmonetary policy and the mechanisms through which policy works. Two factors stand out intrying to understand the change. The first is the simple accumulation of experience that hasexposed some of the shortcomings in earlier thinking about macroeconomic policy. Thesecond is the advances in the analytic framework available to policy-makers to help themanalyze the workings of the economy and of monetary policy. These are not independentfactors, of course, since economic analysis does change in response to experience. In this case,it was the inability of the previous framework to provide a satisfactory explanation of thedevelopments in the second half of the 1960s and the 1970s that led to changes in theframework for analyzing the macroeconomy.                                                     21 Porter Commission Report, pp. 477-478.
11BIS Review   30/1999Experience of good and bad outcomes has thus played a major role in the development ofviews about monetary policy. The theory dominating the views of Tony Hampson and hiscolleagues was developed in response to the Great Depression of the 1930s. However, theviews of my generation of central bankers have been coloured by the great inflation thatmarked our professional years. This brought back to the fore the fundamental truth aboutinflation being a monetary phenomenon that had become temporarily obscured in the 1950sand 1960s.I want to make sure, however, that I do not leave you with the impression that views onmonetary policy are mere creatures of circumstance. Our belief in the objective of pricestability has a more solid foundation than that. A vast range of historical evidence as well as alarge body of economic theory have long supported this objective as a necessary factor forgood performance with respect to output, employment, and growth.I would like to end this lecture by drawing attention to the area in which central banking hasprobably changed most dramatically quite recently. This is the move, particularly during the1990s, towards much greater transparency and public accountability in monetary policy and inthe operations of central banks generally. Here again, the Commission was insightful but didnot make strong recommendations for greater transparency.22Since 1991, the use of explicit low-inflation targets as the objective of monetary policy hasbeen the most prominent aspect in Canada of this broader development. We now believe thatour actions are likely to be more effective and more credible to the extent that they are moreclearly understood and more predictable. Therefore, today we provide the public with largeamounts of data and commentary on monetary policy, in our regular publications, on theinternet, and in response to specific requests. We also try to give information on the outlookfor the economy and monetary policy in our Monetary Policy Reports, in speeches by Bank ofCanada officials, and in the extensive informal contacts of our regional offices across thecountry. In our Technical Reports and Working Papers and annual economics conferences, theBank makes its latest research available in a timely fashion. This is a two-way street, by theway, since feedback and criticism are essential to good research.There has been a similar move to openness with respect to the process of policyimplementation. Since 1994, the Bank has announced its operating band for the overnightinterest rate, which is now tied to the Bank Rate. And since 1996, press releases providing anexplanation of the Bank’s actions have accompanied each change in the Bank Rate.23Much of this is quite a break from the past, since traditionally central banks liked to retain astrong element of mystery about their conduct of policy and at times liked to have the capacityto surprise the market with shifts in the supply of reserves to move the overnight rate.                                                     22“Mystery leads to misinformation, and monetary policy needs informed public opinion to functioneffectively and acceptably. As the Governor pointed out, much of this information must be backward-looking, but we believe it need not all be.” Porter Commission Report, p. 555.23For a detailed discussion of the movement to greater transparency, see Thiessen (1995).
BIS Review   30/199912Public opinion has been an underlying driving force in this movement towards transparency.People expect much more than they used to with respect to the accountability of publicinstitutions. The great expansion in higher education over the past 40 years, and with it therise in sophistication about financial and economic matters, mean that the public is more aptto raise questions about economic policies. The amount and the quality of the information thatwe provide has had to keep in step.Also, the great inflation, which has had a lasting effect on perceptions about the value ofmoney, has led to a heightened interest in the conduct of monetary policy. Expectations arenot held as firmly as they were in the 1950s and early 1960s. People have had to be convincedin recent years that price stability is a credible objective. They still do not take the present lowinflation completely for granted. Each action of the central bank is liable to be scrutinized forany sign of backsliding. For example, the volatility of bond and foreign exchange markets,which persists despite almost a decade of low inflation, can partly be attributed to lingeringuncertainties with respect to future price movements. At the Bank of Canada, we have takenthe position that these concerns are best confronted by making clear statements about theobjective and strategy of monetary policy, by releasing our economic analysis to outsideexamination, and by publishing all relevant data.It is possible that some future governor of the Bank of Canada will want to give a lecturelooking back at monetary policy in the 1990s. I believe that this future governor will beparticularly impressed by the influence that demands for transparency and publicaccountability have had in shifting the culture of central banks and their approach to monetarypolicy in the 1990s.References – 1999 Hampson LectureBank of Canada. 1962.

1BIS Review   29/1999Mr Duisenberg discusses the Eurosystem’s strategy for the euroSpeech by Dr Willem F Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, at a conferenceorganised by “The Economist” in Rome on 12 March 1999.I should like to start by thanking you for the invitation to speak here on the occasion of thisconference. It is only a little more than two months since the euro was launched. Today Ishould like to discuss the main challenges for monetary policy at the start of Monetary Union.Clearly, keeping the internal value of the euro stable is the overriding task ahead of us. Withthis in mind I shall begin by broadly outlining the objectives and main elements of themonetary policy strategy of the Eurosystem. I shall then turn my attention to the role that canbe played by fiscal policy and structural reforms in supporting the stability of the euro andreducing unemployment. Finally, I should like to say a few words about the distribution ofresponsibilities at different levels of economic policy-making with a view to maintainingstability and growth in the euro area.Monetary policy: objectives and strategyLet me turn to the monetary policy strategy of the Eurosystem. The Treaty establishing theEuropean Community assigns the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) the primaryobjective of maintaining price stability in the euro area. In order to guide expectations offuture price developments and to facilitate the public’s assessment of the success of the singlemonetary policy, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) has announceda quantitative definition of its primary objective. This clarifies how the Treaty’s mandate isinterpreted by the Eurosystem, that is, by the ECB and the 11 participating national centralbanks (NCBs).Price stability has been defined as a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index ofConsumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%. Price stability is to be maintainedover the medium term. According to the most recent available data, the annual rate of inflationof 0.8%, measured on this harmonised basis, is consistent with this definition of pricestability.The Treaty states that the ESCB shall support the general economic policies in the EuropeanCommunity only if it can do so without prejudice to the objective of price stability. The logicof the Treaty seems clear. It is acknowledged that the best contribution monetary policy canmake to high employment and economic growth is to maintain price stability. In this context,it is difficult to see how certain proposals made in the ongoing public debate, which mightsuggest that the focus of monetary policy should be shifted towards short-term growth oremployment objectives, can be fulfilled without violating the primary objective of maintainingprice stability, thus ultimately producing an overall deterioration in prospects for economicgrowth and employment.Monetary policy needs a forward-looking, medium-term orientation. It would beoverambitious and therefore risky to steer the economy in the short term. Fine-tuning wouldmore likely lead to instability than stability. A medium-term orientation takes into account thefact that monetary policy affects the price level only with variable, usually long andunpredictable time lags. For example, a large proportion of the substantial reduction ininterest rates during the second half of last year will still have an impact on the euro areaeconomy. To maintain price stability, we have chosen a distinct monetary policy strategy, one
BIS Review   29/19992that reflects the special circumstances that exist at present as well as those likely to prevail inthe foreseeable future. It ensures as much continuity as possible with the strategies previouslypursued by the NCBs. At the same time, it gives due consideration to the unique situationwhich will prevail in the early years of Monetary Union. This strategy rests on two “pillars”: aprominent role for money as expressed by the announcement of a reference value for theannual growth of M3 and a broadly based assessment of the outlook for price developments,and the risks to price stability in the euro area as a whole.Monetary developments can provide useful information about future price developments andthereby act as an important compass for the conduct of monetary policy. There is broadconsensus that, in the medium to long term, the development of the price level is a monetaryphenomenon. Consequently, the Governing Council of the ECB has announced a quantitativereference value for M3 growth, which has been set at an annual rate of 4½%. Under normalcircumstances, substantial deviations from the reference value would tend to indicate futurerisks to price stability. However, monetary policy does not react to deviations of monetarygrowth from the reference value in a “mechanistic” way. In the first instance, such deviationswill be thoroughly analysed to infer any signals which they may send about the prospects forprice developments. If this analysis points to a threat to price stability, monetary policy willreact in a manner appropriate to counter this threat, rather than attempt to eliminate thedeviation of monetary growth from the reference value in the short term.Although monetary data contain information which is vital for monetary policy decision-making, monetary developments alone will clearly not constitute a complete summary of allthe economic information necessary to enable appropriate policy decisions to be taken. TheGoverning Council recognises that it is important, in parallel with the assessment of monetarygrowth, to look at a wide range of financial and other economic indicators, includingeconomic forecasts. This systematic analysis of all other relevant information about economicand financial conditions will ensure that the Governing Council is as well informed aspossible when taking monetary policy decisions.This broadly based assessment takes into account, inter alia, the information content of wagedevelopments, exchange rates, fiscal indicators, real activity, assets and commodity prices.Internal forecasts of economic activity and prices in the euro area can also contribute to thesuccess of an appropriately forward-looking monetary policy. Monitoring monetary, financialand economic developments also helps to identify the nature of shocks hitting the economy. Itthereby contributes to the assessment of overall economic developments. On the basis of thisthorough analysis, the interest rate will be set in a way that best serves the maintenance ofprice stability.The contribution of fiscal policy to a stable euroWith regard to fiscal policies, I should like to stress the following main points of interest withregard to a stable euro:• A sound conduct of fiscal policies is important for the stability of the euro.• In particular, strict implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact by each MemberState is vital.
3BIS Review   29/1999• The targets envisaged in the current stability programmes to bring down governmentdeficits and debt levels represent a minimum requirement for most Member States ratherthan a final aim.Budgetary positions in the euro area as a whole have not yet been consolidated sufficiently.Government debt as a percentage of GDP remains far too high on average and has only starteddeclining hesitantly in the recent past. Deficit-to-GDP ratios in a number of countries are stillcloser to the 3% value set in the Treaty as a reference for excessive deficits than to themedium-term balanced or surplus position envisaged in the Stability and Growth Pact. In caseof a prolonged growth slowdown we might therefore easily see deficits reaching excessivelevels. In addition, deficits fell very slowly in 1998, this reduction in fiscal imbalances beingthe result of strong economic growth and falling interest payments rather than of genuinefiscal consolidation measures. Structural and primary balances have even deteriorated. Inaddition, the progress in structural fiscal consolidation envisaged for the medium term appearsto be only moderate.Why should monetary policy-makers be bothered by such unbalanced budgetary positions?Institutional arrangements for Monetary Union and the Eurosystem have been fully andspecifically developed so as to prevent any direct link between an increase in public sectordeficits and a monetary expansion, and thereby inflation. This is ensured by (a) assigning tothe Eurosystem the primary objective of price stability, (b) banning the direct financing ofgovernment deficits by central banks, and (c) precluding any influence by governments orother institutions on monetary policy decisions. However, even in this setting, the conduct offiscal policies has a clear bearing on the objective of price stability. In particular, doubts aboutthe soundness of fiscal policy can influence the effectiveness of monetary policy instrumentsand can undermine the credibility of monetary policy.For decades – and until very recently – fiscal policies have followed a trend of ever-growingpublic sector and government debt levels. In Monetary Union, without binding fiscal rules,countries might have even less incentive to pursue prudent fiscal policies. The main reasonsare, first, that risk premia offsetting inflation and exchange rate expectations disappear on acountry-specific basis and may not be fully outweighed by default risk premia, and, second,that in Monetary Union fiscal consolidation and its effects on financial stability partly take onthe role of a public good, the benefits of which in terms of lower interest rates can be enjoyedby individual countries even if they have not contributed to its supply. Hence, the Treatyestablishing the European Community contains, for good reasons, a number of provisions onthe conduct of fiscal policies, which have been further clarified by the Stability and GrowthPact. However, I must admit that the current position with regard to the implementation ofthese provisions in the stability programmes submitted to the European Commission by anumber of Member States is less than fully satisfactory.The centrepiece of the budgetary provisions to be respected by Member States is the medium-term objective of a budgetary position close to balance or in surplus. Safeguarding soundgovernment finances is a means of reinforcing the conditions for price stability and ofpromoting strong sustainable growth which is conducive to employment creation. In addition,by achieving at least balanced budgets in normal periods of the cycle, governments wouldcreate a sufficient safety margin to allow full operation of automatic stabilisers in the event ofa slowdown in growth without inflating deficits to excessive levels. In the euro area as awhole we are still far from reaching this target. Substantial structural imbalances continue to
BIS Review   29/19994restrict the flexibility of public sector budgets. Any significant increase in overall deficits –for instance, as a response to a decline in real GDP growth rates – could reverse the limitedprogress we have seen in recent years in reducing debt ratios across the euro area. This wouldimply the risk of initiating detrimental debt dynamics. Hence, governments could contributemost effectively to supporting stability and growth in the euro area by regaining sufficientflexibility in their budgets as soon as possible. However, despite the desirability of achievingthis room for manoeuvre swiftly, a number of stability programmes only aim to attain thisflexibility at a relatively late date and on the assumption that economic growth will besustained and interest rates low.Apart from showing slow progress in restoring budgetary flexibility for the purposes ofautomatic stabilisation, governments have paid insufficient attention to other considerationsthat are also of major importance in setting the appropriate medium-term objectives whichrespect the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact. This is the case with regard to theneed to ensure a rapid decline in high debt ratios and the need to cater for the costs associatedwith the ageing of the population. In particular, additional budgetary room for manoeuvre willsoon be required in order to address the substantial financial consequences of ageingpopulations. According to long-term projections and estimates, current trends in birth ratesand life expectancy, together with unfunded public pension and health care schemes, result invery high implicit government liabilities in most euro area countries. In many cases theseimplicit liabilities appear to be far in excess of official government debt levels. Preventingthese financial burdens from being shifted onto future generations of taxpayers and therebysafeguarding sound government finances would require substantial surpluses to be built upover the medium term.The contribution to lower unemployment made by structural reforms of the labourmarketsI now turn my attention to the contribution that structural reforms, particularly of euro arealabour markets, can play in reducing unemployment and in supporting the stability of the euro.The high level of European unemployment is quite rightly a source of deep concern. It is ofthe utmost importance to implement policies than can bring about a lasting reduction inunemployment. Clearly, the approaches that are most likely to have a lasting effect are thosethat address the root cause of the problem, not just the symptoms. The root causes of highunemployment in the European Union are structural rigidities in the labour market as well astax and public transfer policies. This view is supported by a wide body of academic literatureand was also a key finding of the OECD Jobs Study. It is obvious that structural problemsrequire structural solutions. Implementing an inflationary monetary policy will not makelasting reductions in unemployment, but will actually serve to exacerbate the problem over themedium term. As we know, inflation distorts saving and investment decisions, raises the riskpremium in long-term interest rates and undermines the allocative efficiency of the pricemechanism. In addition, it is particularly detrimental from the perspective of social justice.The underlying structural nature of the European unemployment problem can be seen moststrikingly if one compares developments in Europe with those in the United States over thelast three decades. In 1970 the unemployment rate in the United States, at around 4%, was atleast twice as large as that prevailing in most European economies. Since 1970 there has beensignificant cyclical variation in the unemployment rate in the United States but no upwardtrend. At 4.4% in January 1999, the unemployment rate in the United States is almost thesame as it was in 1970. In contrast, average European unemployment appears to have risen
5BIS Review   29/1999with each passing economic cycle. By the early 1980s the unemployment rates in the UnitedStates and Europe had broadly converged. Since then the unemployment rate in the UnitedStates has been below the average for the European Union. Despite recording a measure ofdecline last year, the euro area unemployment rate remained at 10.8% in December, more thandouble the corresponding rate in the United States. However, some European countries,particularly those with more flexible labour markets, have managed to avoid the trend of ever-rising unemployment. For example, the Netherlands, Ireland, Portugal, Austria andLuxembourg at present have unemployment rates well below the euro area average.If one examines the duration of unemployment, it is immediately apparent that Europe’sproblem is principally one of long-term unemployment. According to OECD figures, aroundhalf of the unemployed of the European Union have been out of work for at least a year, whilein the United States under 10% of the unemployed have been without work for this long. Thissuggests that in Europe there is an urgent need to improve incentives aimed at getting thelong-term unemployed back to work. It also suggests that there is little scope for a stimulus toincrease demand, but rather that structural measures should be implemented.It has been suggested that the Eurosystem focuses too exclusively on supply, almost forgettingdemand. This is a misunderstanding. The truth is this, and I repeat: we are convinced that alasting cure for European unemployment can only be found by applying measures affectingsupply. It is not true, however, that our monetary policy strategy neglects the demand side ofthe economy. On the contrary, our monetary policy takes into account all monetary andeconomic developments, including demand shocks, when decisions are taken on the monetarystance which best serves the maintenance of price stability. One might rightly argue that inthis way we do not actively respond to short-term changes in GDP. There is a good reason forthis: it would be overambitious. We cannot steer demand precisely, especially in the shortterm. Therefore, we focus on creating the appropriate conditions for non-inflationary growthof demand in the medium term. With money supply growing at almost 5% and with realinterest rates well below historical averages, monetary policy is delivering in practice what Ihave just explained in theory. It goes without saying that we will continue to monitor alldevelopments to determine the appropriate policy stance in the meetings of the GoverningCouncil.There are many good examples of what can be done – and is currently being done in someeuro area countries – in terms of structural reforms. First, there are “active labour marketmeasures” which provide programmes of education, training and work experience targeted atthe long-term unemployed; second, reforms to the tax and benefit systems which ensure thatpeople are significantly better off in work than out of it; and third, there are measures toensure that low-productivity workers are not forced out of the labour market. To this end, theburden of taxes and non-wage labour costs could be reduced for low-paid workers. Inaddition, minimum wage schemes and wage agreements reached by collective bargaining needto take account of the need to preserve jobs for low-productivity workers by reducing labourcosts.The need for structural reform of the European labour markets is widely recognised and someprogress is already being made. At the meeting of the European Council held in Luxembourgin November 1997 it was decided to adopt “guidelines for employment” at the EU level everyyear. Each Member State has undertaken to draw up a national action plan for employmentbased on these EU guidelines. Although of themselves guidelines will not reduceunemployment, if one looks at the national action plans for 1998 one can find many good
BIS Review   29/19996examples of policy measures that are aimed at increasing labour market flexibility. However,progress appears rather slow and uneven across Europe and it is important that we redoubleour efforts in this area.I recognise that structural reforms are not always easy to implement. The benefits are oftenenjoyed in the medium term, while short-term costs for some groups may mean that reformsare vigorously opposed by interest groups. Although there is a common objective of reducingunemployment, there is no common programme of reforms that will work in all countries.While it is possible to learn from the experience of others, each Member State will wish todevelop workable policies that reflect its own particular circumstances. Although the path ofstructural reform is not always an easy one, it is the only way in which we can achieve thelasting reductions in unemployment that are so urgently required. I should wish to add that,contrary to competitive devaluations, such reforms, as well as wage moderation, are no zero-sum game. They contribute to net increases in average employment in an internationalperspective. They should thus not be criticised as “wage or social dumping”.Monetary policy and other policy areasIn line with its clear mandate enshrined in the Treaty establishing the European Community,and for sound economic reasons, the ECB has to decide which monetary stance best serves themaintenance of price stability over the medium term and then act accordingly. At the sametime, the Treaty also emphasises the need for sound fiscal policies. This clear separation ofresponsibilities is both efficient and transparent. It takes account of the substantial empiricalevidence and practical experience, according to which monetary policy makes its best possiblecontribution to the achievement of other goals by focusing on the primary objective ofmaintaining price stability over the medium term. This clear division of responsibilities is asound basis for the exchange of views and information about monetary, financial andeconomic matters between various political authorities in the euro area and the Eurosystem.The Eurosystem’s monetary policy strategy does not foresee any mechanistic reaction tospecific variables, indices or forecasts. This also applies to fiscal developments, regardless ofwhether they are actual, planned or promised. Clearly, we will always have to analysethoroughly whether fiscal developments have any impact on the outlook for price stability.However, as already emphasised, we will also assess the information provided by the broadmonetary aggregate and all other indicators relevant for price stability.The clear distribution of responsibilities between monetary and government authoritiesenhances the credibility of monetary and economic policies in Europe. The “policy mix”resulting from monetary and fiscal policies will be an outcome of these policies rather thanour initial objective. This assignment of responsibilities increases transparency and facilitatesaccountability. Under normal circumstances the joint interaction of all policies would beoptimal provided that the basic allocation of instruments and objectives is respected and thatpolicy-makers focus on their main objective. The Eurosystem is always ready to engage in anopen exchange of views and information with policy-makers. Moreover, the public andgovernments are kept well informed about the ECB’s objective and strategy.Monetary policy alone – however well designed and implemented – cannot solve Europe’seconomic problems. National fiscal authorities can make a significant contribution to theestablishment of favourable conditions for sustained economic growth and high employmentin the medium to long term by conducting sound budgetary policies. Appropriate structural
7BIS Review   29/1999reforms implemented by national governments that improve the flexibility and efficiency oflabour and goods markets are of utmost importance. An increase in the flexibility of labourand goods markets would certainly also help to lessen the impact of shocks, regardless of theirnature. Moreover, continued wage moderation in both the public and private sectors wouldcontribute to the reduction of the unacceptably high level of unemployment in many parts ofthe euro area.If policy-makers take their responsibilities seriously and respect the assignment of instrumentsand objectives as laid down in the Treaty establishing the European Community, this will bethe best contribution that they can make to establishing a solid foundation for sustainedstability and growth in the euro area.
1BIS Review   26/1999Mr Noyer looks at some initial experiences with the euroSpeech by Christian Noyer, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, at the conference organisedby the ‘Gesprächskreis Nord’ of the Friedrich-Ebert Foundation, in Hamburg on 8 March 1999Thank you for the invitation to speak here on the occasion of this conference organised by the‘Gesprächskreis Nord’ of the Friedrich-Ebert Foundation. It is only two months since the euro waslaunched. The introduction of the euro has been accomplished successfully and the enormoustechnical and logistical challenges arising during the early days of monetary union have beensurmounted.The start of monetary union proved to be a formidable operation. In spite of the operationaldifficulties and risks involved, the changeover passed without any serious incidents affecting theorderly conditions in the monetary system. The operations of the Eurosystem relating to theconversion of former national currencies into the euro went smoothly. There was no need to invokeany contingency measure, whether ‘ordinary’ or ‘extraordinary’. The first main refinancing operationsof the Eurosystem and the first regular longer-term refinancing operations were also settledsuccessfully.The introduction of the euro is unprecedented in European history. Although not yet embodied in thephysical form of new banknotes and coins, there is no doubt that the new currency is set to play animportant role in the euro area and beyond. The euro is present on all major financial markets aroundthe globe. Currency trading is regularly carried out in euro. There are now shares denominated in euroon most European stock exchanges. Moreover, the euro has attracted new international bond issues asthe currency of denomination. In some ways, the introduction of the euro may justify expectations oflarge efficiency gains in the international financial system. For EU citizens, two obvious gains will be,on the one hand, the reduction of transaction costs and, on the other, increased transparency, whichfacilitates price comparisons between different goods.Monetary union offers a unique opportunity to establish and maintain price stability within the euroarea. It promises a credible and lasting environment of price stability for almost 300 million people.Price stability is at the core of the ‘stability culture’ that we are seeking to establish throughoutEurope. The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) is in charge of monetary policydecisions for the euro area. However, their implementation rests with the Eurosystem – that is theECB and the 11 participating national central banks (NCBs). The Eurosystem has had the goodfortune to assume authority over monetary policy in the euro area in an environment of price stability,owing to the successful process of disinflation and convergence within Europe over the past decade.The Eurosystem’s monetary policy strategy and the TreatyThe Treaty on European Union, commonly referred to as the Maastricht Treaty, assigns the EuropeanSystem of Central Banks (ESCB) the primary objective of maintaining price stability in the euro area.In order to give clear guidance for expectations of future price developments, the Governing Councilhas announced a quantitative definition of its primary objective. This clarifies how the Treaty’smandate is interpreted by the Governing Council and gives the public and the European Parliamentclear guidance concerning its assessment of the success of the single monetary policy.Price stability is to be maintained over the medium term. It has been defined as a year-on-yearincrease in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%. As theword ‘increase’ makes clear, deflation – that is, a persistent fall in the price level – would not beconsistent with price stability. The annual rate of inflation, according to the most recent availabledata, of 0.8%, measured on this harmonised basis, is consistent with the definition of price stability. Itshould also be emphasised once again that the monetary policy is a single one and therefore
BIS Review   26/19992indivisible – by definition. Monetary policy decisions must be based on euro area-wideconsiderations, rather than national considerations. As simple as it may sound, those commentating onour monetary policy do not always appear to grasp this principle.Monetary policy needs a forward-looking, medium-term orientation. Monetary policy should not andshall not react to every change in all the information that is produced on an almost daily basis. Itwould be over-ambitious and therefore risky to try to steer the economy in the short term. Fine-tuningwould be more likely to lead to instability than stability. To maintain price stability, we have chosen adistinct monetary policy strategy, one that reflects the special circumstances that exist at present aswell as those likely to prevail in the foreseeable future. The Eurosystem’s stability-oriented monetarypolicy strategy ensures as much continuity as possible with the former strategies of the NCBs. At thesame time, it gives due consideration to the unique situation which will prevail in the early years ofmonetary union. This strategy rests on two pillars. First, broad money is assigned a prominent role inthe strategy. This is deemed to be important on account of the essentially monetary origins of inflationover the longer term. Second, a broadly based assessment of the outlook for price developments andthe risks to price stability in the euro area as a whole is carried out.Monetary developments can reveal useful information about future price developments and therebyoffer an important compass for the conduct of monetary policy. There is broad consensus that thedevelopment of the price level is a monetary phenomenon in the medium to long term. This takes intoaccount the fact that monetary policy affects the price level only with variable, usually long andunpredictable time lags. It is not able to control all short-term movements in the price level.Furthermore, the historical experience of central banks in Europe and beyond demonstrates that it isimportant for the success of monetary policy to carry out a thorough analysis of monetary aggregatesand the information they contain.The Governing Council of the ECB has announced a quantitative reference value for the annualgrowth of the broad monetary aggregate M3. Substantial or prolonged deviations of current monetarygrowth from the reference value should, under normal circumstances, signal risks to price stability inthe medium term. The choice of M3 as an aggregate is supported by empirical evidence regarding thelong-run stability and leading indicator properties of this aggregate. Moreover, conceptual argumentspointed to the importance of including in the monetary aggregate those assets which have a highdegree of substitutability with narrower definitions of money. Monitoring monetary developmentsalso helps identify the nature of shocks hitting the economy. It thereby contributes to the assessmentof overall economic developments.Monetary policy does not react to deviations of monetary growth from the reference value in a‘mechanistic’ way. In the first instance, such deviations will be thoroughly analysed to infer anysignals which they may offer about the prospects for price developments. If the deviation points to athreat to price stability, monetary policy will react in a manner appropriate to counter this threat,rather than attempting to eliminate the deviation of monetary growth from the reference value in theshort term.The first reference value for M3 growth has been set at an annual rate of 4½%. This reference value isconsistent with the maintenance of price stability over the medium term, while allowing forsustainable output growth and the trend decline in the velocity of circulation of M3. It will bereviewed in December 1999.Although monetary data contain information which is important for monetary policy decision-making,monetary developments alone will clearly not constitute a complete summary of all the economicinformation necessary to take appropriate policy decisions. The Governing Council recognises that itis important, in parallel with the assessment of monetary growth, to look at a wide range of financialand other economic indicators, including economic forecasts. This systematic analysis of all other
3BIS Review   26/1999relevant information about economic and financial conditions will ensure that the Governing Councilis as well informed as possible when taking monetary policy decisions.By fulfilling the unequivocal commitment of the Governing Council of the ECB to maintaining pricestability in the euro area, we shall ensure that the single monetary policy contributes as much aspossible to economic welfare in the broadest sense. At the same time, national fiscal authorities andgeneral economic policies also have to demonstrate their commitment to the maintenance of pricestability in the euro area over the medium term. In this context, the Stability and Growth Pact is acrucial element. Its aim is to encourage the pursuit of disciplined and sustainable fiscal policies in theeuro area. In so doing, it can make a significant contribution to the establishment of favourableconditions for sustained economic growth and high employment in the medium to long term. It wouldbe counterproductive if national fiscal policymakers did not continue their efforts in the light of theachievement of monetary union and the currently positive price outlook. I am not fully convinced thatconsolidation efforts are currently being undertaken with sufficient determination in all participatingmember states. The ECB cannot commit itself to take into account, in its overall assessment, anyannounced, but as yet uncertain, fiscal consolidation in some of the member states.In line with its clear mandate, enshrined in the Treaty, and for sound economic reasons, the ECB hasto decide which monetary stance best serves the maintenance of price stability over the medium termand then act accordingly. At the same time, the Treaty also emphasises the need for sound fiscalpolicies. This clear separation of responsibilities is both efficient and transparent. Monetary policyalone – even if it is well designed and fully successful in monitoring price stability – cannot solveEurope’s economic problems. Appropriate structural reforms implemented by national governmentsare of the utmost importance. Much progress is required in this broad area. Moreover, responsiblewage settlements in both the public and private sectors are necessary to reduce the unacceptably highlevel of unemployment in many parts of the euro area. Recent wage agreements in some parts of theeuro area do not appear to be in the interest of higher employment.Unemployment in the euro area is largely structural in origin. Implementing a monetary policy stancewhich is more lax than is justified by the monetary, financial and economic conditions will not solvethis problem. Instead it will exacerbate it over the medium term, as inflation distorts investment andsavings decisions, raises the risk premium in long-term interest rates and undermines the allocativeefficiency of the price mechanism. Only effective structural policies that improve the flexibility andefficiency of labour and goods markets can reduce unemployment in a successful and lasting manner.I appreciate that such reforms are not always easy, not least because the benefits which they yieldoccur mainly in the medium to long term. However, they are essential. In those euro area memberstates that have taken up the challenge of structural reform, unemployment has fallen significantly.Other euro area member states are called upon to follow these examples: structural reform throughoutthe euro area is fundamental to the success of monetary union and to improving Europe’s economicperformance. In this respect, we may also be able to learn something by looking at the reasons behindstrong employment growth and low unemployment in some of the member states of the EuropeanUnion and in the United States, in particular regarding the flexibility of labour markets and incentivesto create and accept new jobs.Monetary policy decisions and the outlook for price stabilitySince the start of this year the Governing Council has taken the following main monetary policydecisions. In December 1998 the Governing Council of the ECB announced that the level of intereston the main refinancing operation would be 3%. Since then, the Governing Council has kept this rateunchanged, as it has judged that doing so was serving best the maintenance of price stability.The 12-month growth rate of the broad monetary aggregate M3 increased to 5.7% in January 1999from 4.5% in December 1998. This increase is mainly due to rapidly growing overnight deposits,which account for around one-third of M3. The three-month moving average of M3 (for the period
BIS Review   26/19994from November 1998 to January 1999) increased to 4.9%, that is, slightly above the announcedreference value of 4½% per annum. In view of the uncertainty relating to special factors pertaining tothe changeover to the stage three environment and the introduction of the euro, the Governing Councildoes not view the recent acceleration in M3 as a signal of future inflationary pressures. However,monetary developments need to be monitored closely in the coming months.With regard to the broadly based outlook for price developments and risks to price stability, newinformation on indicators of future price developments and economic activity in the euro areacontinue to provide mixed signals. Financial indicators such as the yield curve show that the spreadbetween short-term and long-term interest rates has recently widened somewhat. This followed thedecline in long-term interest rates in January to the lowest levels seen since the late 1940s.Nevertheless, conditions for investment at the start of monetary union are favourable. This relates inparticular to the prevailing low interest rate level, which significantly reduces the costs of financingfor investors.Recent developments appear to have led to a reduction in some of the uncertainties surrounding theevolution of the world economy in 1999. This mainly relates to the strong performance of the USeconomy.In the euro area the latest indicators confirm that those risks which were identified earlier havematerialised to some extent. Real GDP growth in the euro area, which weakened in the fourth quarterof 1998 compared with the previous quarter, suggests that activity has been slowing down in recentmonths. This assessment is supported by other indicators, such as decreasing capacity utilisation andindustrial confidence, both of which have been on a declining trend since mid-1998. By contrast,consumer confidence continues to present a favourable picture. The level of unemployment hasremained more or less unchanged over the past few months.Recent price developments are consistent with price stability. The latest data on the HarmonisedIndex of Consumer Prices show that the downward movement of inflation has stopped. The annualincrease for February 1999 was reported to be 0.8%, the same as in the previous month. The currentlow inflation rate is partly due to substantial reductions in energy prices over the past half year, whichhave diminished somewhat very recently. Decreasing unit labour costs have also made a significantcontribution.In summary, the outlook for price stability remains favourable and, until now, we have not identifiedany significant upward or downward pressures on prices in the short term. On the downward side, theslowdown in the euro area economy is a cause for concern. On the upward side, increasing wagepressure and a relaxation of the fiscal stance could adversely affect the prospects for future pricestability. Furthermore, recent exchange rate developments will also need to be monitored closely inview of their impact on prices.In the absence of any strong upward or downward pressure on price developments, maintaining thecurrent stance of monetary policy appeared justified. The Governing Council therefore decided lastweek that for the next two main refinancing operations the same conditions will apply as for the mainrefinancing operations settled earlier this year. This means they will be fixed rate tenders conducted atan interest rate of 3.0%. Interest rates applicable to the deposit facility and the marginal lendingfacility will continue to be 2.0% and 4.5% respectively. Of course, the Governing Council willcontinue to monitor all developments and reassess its monetary policy in its bi-weekly meetings.The international dimension and the exchange rateLet me now turn to the international dimension of the euro. As the representative of a monetary unionwhich is comparable in size and importance with the United States, and as the central bank managinga currency that is likely to play a large and increasingly international role, the ECB will inevitablyserve an important function in the international financial system. The ECB will embrace the implied
5BIS Review   26/1999responsibility but, at the same time, it will have to be modest and realistic in its actions in theinternational arena. The ECB may be expected to contribute to international cooperation by adoptinga positive attitude. The introduction of the euro could potentially simplify the process of internationalpolicy cooperation between the major economies, since the number of key players has been reduced.In particular, it should make this process more efficient by facilitating the exchange of views and theformulation of common understandings on economic and financial issues at the global level.With regard to the Eurosystem’s relationship with European Community institutions, the Treaty statesthat the President of the ECOFIN Council and a member of the European Commission may participatein the meetings of the Governing Council of the ECB, with the right to express their views butwithout voting power. Moreover, the ECB is required to disclose to the European Communityinstitutions (the Council of the European Union, the European Commission and the EuropeanParliament) an annual report on its monetary policy. The President of the ECB shall present thisreport to the ECOFIN Council and the European Parliament and also take part in the subsequentdebate. As announced before, the President will attend the hearings at the European Parliament atleast four times a year to discuss the activities of the Eurosystem. Finally, I should like to mention thatthe President of the ECB is also invited to the newly established informal Euro-11 Council meetings.In the field of the international representation of the ECB, some decisions are still underconsideration. Formal and informal agreements have already been reached with the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF), the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and inthe context of the G7 and the G10. At the end of last year the IMF granted the ECB the status ofobserver. As you will be aware, full membership of the IMF is restricted to individual nations.Nevertheless, this observer status will allow the ECB to participate in the relevant work andassessments by the Fund of economic policies in the euro area and beyond.The ECB stands ready to participate fully in, and contribute to, international policy discussions. Itwill, of course, offer expertise and exchange views when and where appropriate. However, the bestcontribution the ECB can make to a stable international monetary system, including stable exchangerates and smoothly functioning international capital markets, is to maintain price stability within theeuro area. Fulfilling the mandate assigned to it by the Maastricht Treaty will help the ECB shoulderits international responsibilities.The Eurosystem takes a neutral stance with regard to the international role of the euro. It neitherpromotes nor hinders the development of the euro as an international currency. The Eurosystemaccepts the international role of the euro as it develops through market forces. There will be nodeliberate policy of challenging third currencies. As yet it is too early to predict how long it will takefor the euro to emerge as a truly international currency. Generally speaking, the commitment of theECB to successfully fulfilling the mandate of the Treaty, that is to maintaining price stability in theeuro area, will contribute to the international role of the euro.Allow me to say a few words on certain proposals made in the ongoing public debate, which mightsuggest that the focus of monetary policy should be shifted towards objectives other than pricestability. Some suggestions seem to imply that the Eurosystem should react more or less automaticallyto exchange rate movements or other specific variables. Just as a doctor cannot stop a fever byholding the thermometer under cold water without an appropriate therapy, monetary policy cannotstabilise exchange rates if pressure occurs as a result of diverging cyclical positions, marketfundamentals or structural and fiscal policies. Therefore, we deliberately excluded any kind ofexplicit or implicit exchange rate objectives or targets from our monetary policy strategy.Nevertheless, the Eurosystem’s stability-oriented monetary policy strategy takes into account theexternal value of the euro as one, potentially important, determinant of the outlook for price stability.If its development poses a threat to price stability in the euro area, this threat will be assessed.However, all other factors that impart information on price developments will always be taken into
BIS Review   26/19996account before a decision will be taken. Obviously, if a strong and abrupt appreciation of the eurowere to occur, this would lead, all other things being equal, to downward pressures on pricedevelopments. In such a situation, there would be more reason to lower the ECB’s interest rates,which might then, in turn, help counteract part of the prior exchange rate movement.But setting exchange rate targets might, for example, imply that a central bank has to increase itsinterest rates in a situation of weak demand and downward pressures on prices, just because of adepreciation in the exchange rate. I think you will agree with me that this might not be appropriate.According to the Maastricht Treaty, the ECOFIN Council may formulate so-called generalorientations for the exchange rate policy, which shall be without prejudice to the primary objective ofmaintaining price stability. The ECOFIN Council has agreed to issue so-called orientations forexchange rate policy only in exceptional circumstances, such as a clear and sustained misalignment ofthe euro. In addition, we are not currently participating in a formal exchange rate arrangement withthird countries outside the EU, for instance the United States, and we consider it very unlikely thatthis situation will change.Accountability and transparency of the monetary policy of the EurosystemLet me turn to the issues of accountability and transparency. In general, central banks should be open,transparent and accountable, reporting extensively to the public on their activities. The issue of thetransparency of monetary policy is very important, given that the Eurosystem is a new institution andthe public is not accustomed to evaluating its behaviour. Moreover, by communicating clearly withthe public, the Eurosystem reinforces its credibility and signals that its monetary policy isappropriately geared to the maintenance of price stability. In this regard, the Eurosystem’s approachbears comparison with the ‘best practices’ of any other central bank. Accountability is the counterpartto independence. We should also be clear that the independence of the ECB does not exclude adialogue with political authorities.The monetary policy of the Eurosystem will be held accountable for reaching its overriding objectiveof maintaining price stability. The Eurosystem is open, transparent and, above all, accountable for itsperformance. As part of its communication strategy, the Governing Council of the ECB regularlyinforms the public about its assessment of the monetary, economic and financial situation in the euroarea and about specific monetary policy decisions. Moreover, since January 1999 the ECB has beenpublishing a Monthly Bulletin containing additional and detailed analysis of the economic situation inthe euro area.In some areas the Eurosystem has gone beyond the Treaty requirements. The Governing Councilmeets every fortnight. The first meeting in every month is immediately followed by a pressconference, at which the President of the ECB and I explain the decisions taken by the GoverningCouncil. On that occasion, the ‘Introductory Statement of the President’ of the Eurosystem is releasedto the press. This is similar to what other central banks call minutes. We are convinced that this veryprompt delivery of information serves the interests of the public in an optimal way. Few central banksfollow a policy of publishing their minutes almost immediately after the meeting of their governingbody. We are also convinced that it is in the public interest for the view of the Governing Council as awhole to be presented, rather than the views of individual members.Concluding remarksLet me finally urge caution with regard to any excessively high expectations at the start. History alsoshows that the full benefits of changes as substantial as the introduction of the euro may come neitherimmediately nor automatically. It normally takes some time to adapt to a new situation. Mostimportantly, efficiency and welfare gains will require structural reforms of labour and goods marketsto improve flexibility. One can only hope that the euro is working as a catalyst for such change.
1BIS Review   25/1999Mr Ferguson reviews the historical perspective and policy implications of global financialintegrationRemarks by Mr Roger W Ferguson Jr, a member of the Board of Governors of the US FederalReserve System, at the Annual Policy Seminar of the National Association for Business Economics,Washington DC, on 4/3/99.Global Financial Integration: Historical Perspective and Policy ImplicationsThank you very much for inviting me to speak to this distinguished group of business economists andanalysts. As we have discovered over the last eighteen months or so, we live in a rapidly changingglobal economic and financial environment. Today, given the theme of your conference, I would liketo put the events of the last few years into a broader historical context, and ask what are the mostappropriate policy solutions.Yesterday and TodayLet me turn to a previous period of close global linkage in economic and financial markets: the fortyyears or so prior to World War I. Here I will draw on a recent NBER working paper by MichaelBordo, Barry Eichengreen and Jongwoo Kim.1 During this time, capital flowed essentially withoutrestriction, chiefly from developed Western Europe to regions in the then rapidly developingcountries of the Americas and to Australia. Just to put this in perspective, these three economistsreport that at its peak, the outflow from the United Kingdom reached 9 percent of GNP and wasalmost as high in France, Germany and the Netherlands. Much of this capital was invested in bondsthat financed railroads and other infrastructure investments and in long-term government debtinstruments, but there was also significant direct foreign investment.Bordo, Eichengreen and Kim find that one element of the pre-1914 episode of global financialintegration is the size and persistence of the current account deficits of capital importing countries,mainly Australia, Canada, Argentina and the Scandinavian countries. Similarly, the current accountsurpluses of some capital exporters, particularly the United Kingdom, showed considerablepersistence. These economic historians indicate that it was not unusual for these countries toexperience current account imbalances, deficits for the capital importers or surpluses for the capitalexporters, of between 5 percent and 10 percent of GDP lasting for several years.The size and persistence of these capital account imbalances in the pre-1914 period appear to compareroughly with the size of current account imbalances that have existed in the most recent period ofglobal financial integration. Economic historians indicate that during the period from 1971 to 1997,emerging market countries were running, on average, current account deficits of about 4 percent oftheir GDPs. However, according to these historians, capital flows to the emerging market countries oftoday have been somewhat more variable – as measured by the standard deviation of the currentaccount to GDP ratio – than those provided to the “emerging market economies” of the late 1800s andearly 1900s.While the pre-1914 period can be characterized as more stable in some respects, economists haveidentified other important differences between that period of global capital flows and our own. First,gross flows are far greater today. A second difference is in the composition of the investment. Whiledata are not complete, it does appear that the bulk – possibly as much as 85 percent according to                                                     1 Bordo, Eichengreen and Kim, Was There Really an Earlier Period of International FinancialIntegration Comparable to Today? National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper 6738,September 1998.
BIS Review   25/19992estimates reported by Bordo, Eichengreen and Kim – of pre-1914 investments were in governmentand municipal securities, railways, resource-extraction companies and public utilities. Today, it is safeto estimate that a larger proportion of investments are in commercial, industrial and financialconcerns, whose assets are more intangible and whose operations are less transparent. Third, prior to1914, the vast majority of portfolio capital flows took the form of bonds. More recently, portfolioflows have been more evenly split between bonds and stocks.Lessons for PolicymakersPolicymakers need to understand this earlier stage of global capital flows and should attempt to adaptany lessons to today’s world of absolutely large, very liquid, and fundamentally less transparent cross-border capital flows.The core question, obviously, is what factors allowed the apparent persistence and relative stability ofthe pre-1914 era of capital flows? One theory advanced by academics is that capital exports andinvestments went largely to countries linked through shared language, culture, legal systems andaccounting regimes. Another hypothesis may be that, in the period leading up to World War I, thecommitment of policymakers to stable monetary and fiscal policies was highly credible to marketparticipants, perhaps reflecting a shared belief in and commitment to the gold standard.The policymakers’ challenge today is to build strong institutional structures, policy credibility, andprivate sector discipline that are at least as strong as might have existed earlier. However, we must doso against a background of modern, technologically driven, global finance. It is clear that we mustmake the adjustments required because, with the absolute scale of global financial markets increasing,the size of bailout packages needed to fill financing gaps during international crises will getprogressively larger and become less feasible to assemble. In addition, policymakers must always beconcerned about the moral hazard of appearing to stand ready to help private sector debtors andcreditors escape from problems of their making. Finally, I believe that we must achieve these goalswithout attempting to step back to policy regimes of prior periods that are clearly unworkable now orthat undermine the advantages that we know come with a free flow of capital.So what are the policy solutions that meet these criteria? In overview, I would say that there probablyare very few grandiose new solutions that need to be implemented as a policy response to today’sglobal financial turmoil. Rather, I see an emphasis on basic, sound practices.The Need for Sound Institutional UnderpinningsOne lesson suggested by the pre-1914 period of relative stability in capital flows is the importance ofbroadly understood and accepted institutional arrangements. Countries that wish to participate in themodern global financial market need to modernize their institutional underpinnings. Several actionscome to mind. First, the basic underpinnings of private property protection need to be in place. Thelegal system needs to define and support the enforceability of contracts. For example, whileinternational bankruptcy procedures do not seem feasible, the adoption or improvement of nationalbankruptcy systems is essential and should have a high priority. Debtors and creditors alike need tohave an understanding of the rules under which private sector defaults are to be resolved andconfidence that these rules will be consistently applied. I put the highest priority on bankruptcyprocedures because they provide the self-adjusting mechanisms that allow the private sector tocontinue to function even in a world in which financial crises are likely to occur. Various plans toimprove international financial rules will emerge, but they must all, in my judgment, include a focuson national bankruptcy codes.Similarly, accounting standards and private sector disclosure are important areas for improvement.Accounting standards provide the foundation for credible financial statements and other disclosuresthat are key means for communicating a company’s operating results and its overall health, as well as
3BIS Review   25/1999for making more transparent various operating activities. Disclosure of reliable information facilitatesmarket discipline, strengthens confidence, improves decision making and reduces the chance thatrumors and misleading information could cause instability in national and global markets. Also, byfacilitating market discipline, public disclosure helps reinforce supervisory efforts to encourage banksand other companies to maintain sound risk management practices and internal controls. For thesereasons, the Federal Reserve and the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision have stronglysupported initiatives to improve the quality of national and international accounting standards anddisclosure practices.Finally, bank supervision and regulation must be upgraded. Banks are an important mechanism fortransmitting funds both domestically and internationally. However, in societies in which banks areafforded certain benefits and safety nets because banking problems have the potential to disruptfinancial markets, banks can perform their intermediary role best if they are properly supervised. Thissupervision, in turn, should start with oversight by depositors and participants in private debt andequity markets and be reinforced by appropriate supervisory practices and safeguards.Assessing the soundness of banking institutions is difficult, simply because of the nature of thebanking business. Extending credit inherently involves subjective judgments, and standards ofadequate risk measurement and disclosure must continually evolve along with the nature andcomplexity of banking products and the ability of institutions to assimilate information. Bothauthorities and market participants must request and receive sufficiently accurate, timely, and relevantinformation on which to base their decisions. They must also have sufficient insight and expertise toevaluate it properly.No discussion of institutional arrangements in the global economic and financial system will becomplete without a discussion of the IMF, the international financial institution central to resolvingbalance of payments crises. If the IMF did not exist we would probably need to create something likeit. In a world of global finance, it is useful to have a multilateral organization that has someresponsibility for providing liquidity assistance to countries when they do not have access to capitalmarkets and also encouraging countries to undertake prudent fiscal and monetary policies.The IMF has come under some criticism for elements of its policy prescriptions. I am sure thateconomists and policymakers will have opportunities to review and evaluate the performance of theIMF during this period. It might be appropriate to define more clearly the functional roles played bythe IMF and other international financial institutions in order to improve the efficient use of scarceinternational resources. At the present time, however, the IMF is a critical participant in maintaininginternational financial stability.The Need for Credible Economic and Financial PoliciesA second lesson of history and recent experience is that policymakers must follow sound and crediblemacroeconomic, microeconomic and financial policies. In particular, a necessary condition is fiscaland monetary policies that are, and are perceived to be, responsible. As we have seen in some of thecrises that have hit in global financial markets, particularly those that have a public sector origin,heavy short-term borrowing by governments, when coupled with fiscal imbalances, can be a recipe forfinancial market crisis. Credibility comes from monetary policies aimed at achieving price stability,avoiding either general increases or decreases in price levels, and fiscal policies that avoid imbalancesand unsustainable public sector debts or deficits. In short, in the absence of an external control onfiscal and monetary policy, policymakers and politicians must act with a great deal of discipline.However, we also know, particularly from Asia, that fiscal and monetary rectitude is not sufficient.Many of those countries had strong fiscal positions and sound monetary policy, but still suffered frominternational financial uncertainties. Microeconomic and financial policies must also be credible. Thepolicies that are most responsible are those that allow free markets to work without undue
BIS Review   25/19994intervention from governmental authorities. We have learned that governmental influence in privatesector borrowing and investing decisions is to be avoided. This is all the more true because, as theresearch has shown, a larger portion of cross-border investment in the modern era appears to be insectors in which financial performance and the valuation of assets are harder to gauge. In thosecircumstances any hint of governmental support is certainly to be avoided.Recently some have proposed the creation of “target zones” for major currencies, presumably in orderto create, in part, greater stability in global financial markets. I think that these proposals are unlikelyto work. We have seen on several occasions that the scale of resources required for the authorities tomove exchange rates in directions not supported by the fundamentals, or by market perceptions ofthose fundamentals, can be enormous and effects in terms of exchange rate movements relativelysmall and transitory. If monetary policy is used to maintain the exchange rate within a target range,authorities at times may have to choose between maintaining domestic price stability and a currencytarget. Most monetary policy authorities recognize the value of maintaining price stability as one ofthe requirements for creating sound macroeconomic conditions for sustainable domestic growth. Forthe major countries, the benefits of an explicit focus on exchange rate stability, rather than pricestability and sustainable growth, are not clear.I believe that policymakers should support greater transparency in the reporting of their ownoperations, as well as in private sector activities that I discussed above. Better and more timelyinformation promotes better allocation of resources, including the global allocation of capital. Thefinancial crises of the last several years indicate that greater transparency is needed on levels ofexternal debt, including short-term foreign currency debt of the central government, and on levels ofinternational reserves, including financial derivative positions. For transparency standards to be mosteffective, they require as broad a participation by authorities as possible. Further, they must balancethe need for comprehensive and timely disclosure with the need for accurate data. Improvements infinancial data from the private sector, which I have discussed, are crucial, but public sector disclosuremust not await improvements in private sector disclosure.The IMF can contribute to public sector transparency with respect to critical economic variablesthrough implementation of the Special Data Dissemination Standards, or SDDS. Voluntarycompliance with SDDS by all countries will provide some assurance that economic transactions arenot being based on misleading or incomplete information.The Need for Capital MobilityA third lesson suggested by the historical analysis is that the ability to attract foreign exchange is acritical element of a stable global financial system. In the modern context, I believe that this findinghas two corollaries. First, we must avoid blocking capital flows, particularly of long-term funds.There have been policymakers who have advocated capital controls. I do not need to give a group ofbusiness economists a lesson in basic economics, but there are those outside of this room who need tobe reminded of the benefits of free capital flows. Even though current international financial troublesindicate that there are risks from the free flow of capital, the benefits are substantial and contributeimportantly to rising standards of living. As you know, an individual country’s pool of savings doesnot always equal its pool of investment opportunities. If borders were closed to the flow of capital,interest rates would adjust to equilibrate domestic saving and investment, but some investmentopportunities, which might be attractive by international standards, might go unfunded while lessattractive domestic opportunities would be funded. With the free flow of capital, countries that have agreater pool of highly productive investment opportunities will benefit from the inflow of capital andthose that export capital can put their savings to better, more rewarding use. This presumes theinstitutional underpinnings outlined above.Protectionist impulses for measures that impede the flow of goods, services and managerial know-how must also be avoided. While participation in such free exchange across borders creates industries
5BIS Review   25/1999and individuals that are made better off and some that do not fare so well, we know that, on balance,all societies are better off from allowing the free flows of international competition. Given the factthat there are scarce resources globally, it is important that all resources be employed to theircomparative advantage, thereby increasing the stock of goods and services available to us all.ConclusionLet me conclude by saying that while the current era of globalization is quite distinct from the periodprior to World War I, there are important lessons that can be learned from that earlier era. Somehistorians have argued that the pre-1914 era was notable for the size and relative stability of capitalflows. Thus far our era has been notable for the size of international capital flows, but recently not forthe stability. I do not doubt that there is room for improvement in the regimes that determine capitalflows. However, I think that most of the solutions to the challenges that the world has faced requirebuilding institutional mechanisms and policy expertise that allow reliance on the strengths of the freemarket system. Improvements in policy discipline, information sharing, and institutional structureshould all be evaluated by the litmus test of whether they enhance the flow of information to, andreduce bureaucratic interference with, markets and thus provide a safer and more stable globalfinancial and economic environment.
1BIS Review   23/1999Mr Ferguson discusses the evolution of financial institutions and markets: implicationsfor public and private policies and practicesRemarks by Mr Roger W Ferguson Jr, a member of the Board of Governors of the US FederalReserve System, at the Money Marketeers of New York University, New York, on 25/2/99.This evening I would like to spend a few minutes discussing some of the implications of therapid and ongoing evolution of our financial institutions and markets. New financialinstruments, innovations in portfolio management, and the technological capability ofimplementing new risk management strategies offer opportunities to reduce risk and toimprove efficiency by allocating risk to those most willing to accept it. Reductions of tradebarriers and the freer flow of financial capital around the world mean better resourceallocation, improved productivity, and higher standards of living for citizens of the UnitedStates and many other nations.While the current and potential benefits of financial and technological change are real andsubstantial, they do not come without some costs. For example, the rapid pace oftechnological change and the wide array of innovative financing techniques have in someways made it more difficult for outside investors and policymakers to evaluate the risks borneby individual institutions and the broader markets. And, nearly instantaneous communicationsand heightened interdependencies among nations speed the effects of poor investment andpolicy decisions around the globe. Recent experiences in Asia, Russia, Latin America, and athome have taught us a lot about the risks of an increasingly interdependent world linked bycomplex financial relationships.In this rapidly evolving world of inevitable benefits and costs, the key question for bothfinancial policymakers and market participants is: How can we retain the benefits of rapidtechnological and financial innovation and of freer movements of goods and financial capitalacross national borders, while simultaneously protecting our financial institutions and marketsfrom the risks that these changes might bring? This is not a new question, and I am sure thatmost of this audience is well aware that many efforts are under way in both the public andprivate sectors to address the variety of issues that this question evokes. As always, there areno simple answers. But I believe that a number of fundamental principles have emerged thatshould be used to help shape both public and private policies and practices.Private Market Discipline Is the First Line of DefensePerhaps the most fundamental principle that must guide us is that private market participantsare the first line of defense against excessive private and public risk in the financial system.Private borrowers, lenders, investors, institutions, traders, brokers, exchanges, and clearingsystems all have huge stakes in containing their risks as individual agents and risks to thesystem as a whole. Private market participants can discourage excessive risk taking bychoosing to do business with those firms that demonstrate sound risk management systemsand portfolios that balance appropriately risk and expected return.If private markets are going to perform their risk control functions, then market prices mustsend the right signals to all participants about the risks and rewards of a particular transactionor at a given firm. In order to improve the ability of market prices to accurately reflect risksand returns, I believe that we should take action ourselves and encourage action by others in atleast three areas.
BIS Review   23/19992First, we should seek ways of improving the transparency of financial institutions andmarkets. As we all know, full information is a fundamental requirement of free andcompetitive markets. More particularly, financial institutions and individual investors must bewell informed about their own and their counterparties’ exposures, the nature of new financialinstruments, and the extent of overall market liquidity. I believe that banks and other financialinstitutions could significantly improve their disclosures by providing more information to themarket about their risk management policies and practices and about the values of internalrisk measures. At present, the market seems to grant great weight to bank regulatory capitalratios that are only crude indicators of an institution’s risk profile. That attention is driven inlarge part by the fact that these regulatory measures provide a consistent basis for comparison.The regulatory and financial communities should work together to identify more meaningfulstatistics to meet the market’s needs.At the international level much work is being done, and much remains. One of the key lessonsof our most recent financial crises is that international accounting and public disclosurestandards are often inadequate. An important step forward was the publication last Novemberby the international Basle Committee on Banking Supervision of guidelines for enhancingbank transparency. That report provides guidance to banks and banking supervisors aroundthe world on the nature of core disclosures that should be provided to the public. Much more,however, should be done to provide the public and supervisors with the information they needto exert effective market discipline.A second area where we could improve market discipline is in affecting how marketparticipants view what has come to be known as the too-big-to-fail problem. In this regard, Iwould emphasize that the FDIC Improvement Act of 1991, or FDICIA, contains rather toughlanguage about too-big-to-fail – language that I assure you the Board takes very seriously.Perhaps it would be useful to review briefly what the law says. FDICIA requires that,regardless of the size of a bank, the bank resolution method chosen by the FDIC be the leastcostly of all possible methods for meeting the FDIC's obligation to protect insured deposits. Inaddition, FDICIA prohibits the FDIC from assisting uninsured depositors and creditors, orshareholders of an insured depository institution. Add to these FDICIA provisions thedepositor preference provisions in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, and youhave some rather potent reasons for the market to be disciplined in its dealings with insureddepositories.The only exception to these obligations is the so-called “systemic risk exception.” But thesystemic risk exception is quite tough and explicit. It requires concurrence by two-thirds ofthe Federal Reserve Board, two-thirds of the FDIC Board, and the Secretary of Treasury inconsultation with the President that conformance with least-cost resolution would “haveserious adverse effects on economic conditions or financial activity” before the FDIC isallowed to “take other action or provide assistance as necessary to avoid or mitigate sucheffects.” In addition, if the systemic risk exception is used, any insurance fund losses arisingfrom such exceptional actions must be recovered through special assessments on alldepository institutions that are members of the relevant federal deposit insurance fund. Lastly,the Comptroller General must subsequently review the agencies' actions and report itsfindings to Congress. The sum total of these conditions establishes, in my view, a rather highhurdle that must be cleared before the systemic risk exception can be used.
3BIS Review   23/1999The FDICIA and other reforms have, I believe, altered market perceptions of too-big-to-fail.Nonetheless, the obvious need for the central bank and other government agencies to preventa systemic collapse of the banking and financial system, the creation of seemingly ever-largerfinancial organizations, and the inherent uncertainties involved in the management of anycrisis leave room for doubt in some observers’ minds. Perhaps by its very nature this is anissue that can never be fully resolved. But it seems clear to me that any institution, regardlessof size, can fail in the sense that existing stockholders can lose their total investment, existingmanagement can be replaced, and uninsured creditors can suffer losses. In some cases it maybe necessary for an institution to stay in operation and be wound down in an orderly way overa transition period. Ultimately, the institution could be sold in whole or in part. But even insuch cases the expectation of owners, managers, and uninsured creditors should be that realand significant losses will be incurred. In my judgment, if policies consistent with theseprinciples are followed, then we will have eliminated much of the moral hazard associatedwith the federal safety net for depository institutions while simultaneously being able toachieve our goal of preserving financial stability.One way to enhance the ability of market participants to limit risk taking by banks might be torequire at least the largest and most complex banks to issue a minimum amount ofsubordinated debt. Many such proposals have surfaced over the last decade, including somefrom within the Federal Reserve System. And while I think that it is premature to endorse anyone proposal, indeed there are a number of thorny details that would need to be worked out, Iam strongly attracted to the basic concept advanced by proponents of subordinated debt.The fundamental notion behind requiring at least some banks to issue traded subordinateddebt is to create a set of uninsured bank creditors whose risk preferences are similar to thoseof bank supervisors. Because subordinated debt holders have downside risk, but virtually noupside potential, subordinated debt holders tend to be risk averse in much the same way as isthe FDIC. Thus, when a bank sought to issue subordinated debt the price that investors werewilling to pay would bring direct market discipline aimed at controlling excessive risk takingby the bank. A second key objective is to create a set of market instruments that wouldprovide clear, and frequent, signals of the market’s evaluation of a bank’s financial condition.Such signals could act as a deterrent to a bank’s tendency to take excessive risk, and couldperhaps alert bank supervisors to examine, or otherwise intervene in, a bank more quicklythan they otherwise would. Changes in the market prices of traded bank subordinated debt,and perhaps other actions by the owners of this debt, have the potential to provide suchsignals. In this way subordinated debt could be used to bring indirect market discipline on abank.Supervisory Discipline Must Be An Effective and Dynamic Second Line of DefenseWhile market discipline must be our first line of defense for ensuring financial stability, banksupervision also has an important role to play. The very nature of a systemic disruption, whichimposes costs on not only the perpetrators, but also on many and diverse economic agents farremoved from the immediate event, means that market participants find it impossible to fullyincorporate systemic risks into market prices. Indeed, it is this very aspect of systemic risk thatjustifies the existence of a government safety net for depository institutions. The inevitablemoral hazard of the safety net requires that bank supervisors have the ability to exertsupervisory discipline on the riskiness of banks.
BIS Review   23/19994I would like to comment tonight on what I consider two of the most pressing needs in thebank supervisory area: the need to make capital standards more risk sensitive, and the need tofocus supervisory practice more on risk measurement and management.I need not explain to this audience why the maintenance of strong capital positions is criticalto the preservation of a safe and sound banking system. Indeed, ensuring strong capital hasbeen a cornerstone of bank supervision for decades. However, the development by some ofour largest and most complex banks of increasingly sophisticated models for measuring,managing, and pricing risk has called into question the continuing usefulness of the currentcapital standards – the so-called risk-based capital standards – that are part of the BasleAccord. The Basle Accord capital standards were adopted in 1988 by most of the world'sindustrialized nations in an effort to encourage stronger capital at riskier banks, to include off-balance sheet exposures in the assessment of capital adequacy, and to establish moreconsistent capital standards across nations. The Accord was a major advance in 1988, andinitially proved to be very useful in promoting safety and soundness goals. But in recent yearscalls for reform have begun to grow. I will outline briefly one of the key problems we arecurrently facing with the Basle Accord.The Basle Accord divides on- and off-balance sheet assets of banks into four risk buckets, andthen applies a different capital weight to each bucket. The basic idea is that more capitalshould be required to be held against riskier assets. However, the relationship is rough.Perhaps most troublesome, the same risk weight is applied to all loans. Thus, for example, aloan to a very risky “junk bond” company gets the same weight as a loan to a “triple A” ratedfirm.While the Accord has the virtue of being relatively easy to administer, it also clearly givesbanks an incentive to sell or not to originate loans that their internal models say need lesscapital than is required by the Basle Accord. Conversely, banks are encouraged to book loansthat their models say require more capital than does the Basle standard. Not surprisingly, somebanks have devoted substantial resources to attempting to achieve both adjustments to theirportfolios. The resulting “regulatory arbitrage” surely causes some serious problems. For onething, it makes reported capital ratios – a key measure of bank soundness used by supervisorsand investors – less meaningful for government supervisors and private analysts.Efforts are currently under way to redress many of the deficiencies in the current BasleAccord. But many of the issues are complex, and the optimal changes are still unclear. Aconsensus does seem to have developed that the Accord must be more risk sensitive. But howrisk sensitive, and how should that risk sensitivity best be implemented? I foresee a multi-staged process with perhaps some modest and relatively noncontroversial “fixes” beingproposed, possibly in the very near future, and more fundamental reforms being developedand implemented over a period of several years. Given the dynamic nature of change in thefinancial sector, such a phased, or evolutionary, approach to revising the Accord is probablynot just the only practical strategy, but also the most prudent as well.The need for an evolutionary approach can be made with perhaps even more force to othersupervisory policies and procedures. For example, the increasing use and sophistication ofcredit risk models at the largest and most complex domestic and foreign banks has profoundimplications for supervisory activities as well as capital regulation. Understanding andevaluating credit risk models and related risk measurement techniques are quickly becomingrequired skills of bank supervisors. This need is fueled by the ever-growing array of
5BIS Review   23/1999securitizations, credit derivatives, remote originations, financial guarantees, and a seeminglyendless stream of other financial innovations. Add to this the fantastic speed with whichfinancial transactions can now be conducted, and one begins to get a feel for the manychallenges facing bank supervisors.With these realities in mind, supervisory practices at all of the banking agencies are changing.Oversight of banks has become much more continuous and risk-focused than even a few yearsago, especially at the largest and most complex organizations. It is recognized that we can nolonger rely on periodic on-site examinations to ensure that these large institutions areoperating in a safe and sound manner, but rather must be assured that their risk managementpractices and internal controls are sound on an ongoing basis. Still, on-site examinations, inmy judgment, remain critical. However, on-site examinations must evolve to be both aseffective and as unobtrusive as possible. We are devoting substantial efforts to attracting,training, retaining, and using effectively the highly skilled personnel that modern bankexaminations require.The new procedures place greater importance on an institution’s internal managementprocesses, beginning at the top. Consistent with the view that private agents are the first lineof defense against excessive risk, boards of directors are expected to be actively involved inestablishing the overall environment for taking risk, staying informed about the level of risksand how they are managed and controlled, and making sure that senior management is capableand has the resources it needs to be successful. Management is expected to develop andimplement the policies and procedures needed to conduct a banking business in a safe andsound manner. Internal controls, evaluated by an independent internal auditing function, mustbe sound.ConclusionI hope that my brief review of some of the key challenges facing economic policymakers andprivate participants in banking and financial markets has convinced you, if indeed you neededconvincing, that these aspects of the modern world of finance are important, exciting, anddeserve the serious attention of all participants. The rewards, current and potential, of modernbanking and finance are great. But there are also some very real risks that we need to addressin effective, cooperative, and inevitably evolving ways.
1BIS Review   22/1999Monsieur Trichet éclaire les conditions du succès de l’euroDiscours de Jean-Claude Trichet, le Gouverneur de la Banque de France, à la conférence de laBanque Centrale de Hesse tenue à Francfort le 22/2/99.Monsieur le Président, Mesdames et Messieurs, c’est un grand plaisir et un honneur pour moid’intervenir ici, à l’invitation de la Landeszentralbank de Hesse et du Center for Financial Studies del’Université de Francfort, en compagnie de conférenciers aussi remarquables. Aussi je tiens à vousremercier de me donner l’occasion d’évoquer avec vous l’Union monétaire européenne et l’avénementde l’euro.Il y a un peu plus d’un mois, s’est produit un événement unique dans l’histoire de l’Europe. L’euro estné et le caractère irréversible de ce changement a convaincu un nombre croissant d’acteurs de la scènepolitique et économique que le succès de l’euro était une nécessité pour l’Europe et le reste du monde.Il représente la clé de voûte du marché unique européen qui assurera la prospérité en Europe. Mais,pour rendre ce succès durable, nous allons devoir affronter, aujourd’hui et demain, un certain nombrede défis.Les banques centrales sont au cœur du passage à l’euro, à la fois au niveau européen et au sein deleurs économies nationales. C’est pour cette raison que je souhaite attirer en particulier votre attentionsur les trois points suivants :- premièrement, l’Union économique et monétaire repose sur des fondations théoriques etéconomiques solides et profondes  qui ont permis une introduction réussie de l’euro sur les marchésde capitaux ;- deuxièmement, la zone euro devra relever un certain nombre de défis si elle veut rester une zone destabilité monétaire où la croissance est durable ;- troisièmement, le succès de l’euro contribuera largement à l’avènement d’une situation monétaireinternationale plus équilibrée.I. L’UEM REPOSE SUR DES FONDATIONS SOLIDES ET PROFONDES QUI ONTPERMIS, IL Y A UN PEU PLUS D’UN MOIS, UNE INTRODUCTION REUSSIE DE L’EUROSUR LES MARCHES DE CAPITAUXLe 31 décembre 1998, les chefs d’État et de gouvernement ont adopté les taux de conversionirrévocables de l’euro vis-à-vis des monnaies des onze pays qui avaient été qualifiés pour participer àla zone euro. Cette étape historique correspond à l’avènement de l’Union économique et monétaire.Les progrès impressionnants qui ont été réalisés, en matière de convergence économique, dans lesannées qui ont précédé cette décision, ont contribué de façon déterminante à ce processus. Afin dedonner une orientation aux marchés de capitaux, la méthode de détermination des taux de conversionirrévocables de l’euro avait  été décidée à Bruxelles, le 3 mai 1998.Au total, c’est une idée tout à fait fondée qui est à l’origine de la création de l’euro; en outre, cettecréation constitue le couronnement d’un long processus économique et politique (A). Des travauxpréparatoires approfondis ont également contribué au succès de l’introduction de l’euro sur lesmarchés de capitaux (B).A. L’UEM repose sur des fondations solides et profondes1. La création de l’Union monétaire et de la monnaie unique n’est pas un concept récent et abstrait,fruit de l’imagination de quelques uns.
BIS Review   22/19992Le traité de Maastricht est l’aboutissement d’une série d’initiatives importantes qui appartiennent déjàà l’histoire de l’Europe. Le rapport Werner, élaboré au début des années soixante-dix, a introduit leconcept d’Union économique et monétaire. Le traité de Maastricht a été négocié, signé et ratifiéd’abord par les douze premiers pays puis par les quinze pays de l’Union européenne. Je rappelleraique treize pays l’ont approuvé sans aucune réserve.2. Le bien-fondé de l’UEM repose sur les avantages économiques qu’une monnaie unique apporte àl’ensemble de l’Europe.L’Union européenne (pays hors zone euro compris) compte au total 370 millions d’habitants,représente près de 20 % du PIB mondial et 21 % environ du commerce international (échanges intra-européens exclus) contre quelque 17 % pour les États-Unis et 10 % pour le Japon. Les avantagesinhérents à la taille même du marché unique sont évidents. Il permet à l’ensemble du secteur productifde réaliser d’importantes économies d’échelle et d’affecter l’épargne aux investissements les plusrentables. Il renforce également la transparence du marché et il stimule la concurrence dans l’intérêtdes consommateurs.De ce point de vue, la monnaie unique représente le couronnement du marché unique. L’objectif finaldu marché unique ne pouvait être atteint tant que des obstacles monétaires continuaient d’entraver lalibre circulation des biens, des services et des capitaux par le biais de coûts de transaction et derisques de change intrinsèques. Demain, nos concitoyens bénéficieront de tous les avantages liés àl’utilisation d’un même instrument monétaire dans tout le continent européen, comme c’est le casaujourd’hui des Américains sur tout le territoire des États-Unis.Les avantages de la monnaie unique sont nombreux.La monnaie unique réduit l’incertitude et facilite les décisions d’investissement et de production. Ellepermet une juste comparaison des prix à travers l’Europe et réduit les coûts de transaction. La zone dela monnaie unique sera caractérisée par la stabilité des prix et un faible niveau d’inflation. Cesfacteurs, à leur tour, maintiendront et renforceront la confiance tout en procurant à l’économieeuropéenne un environnement financier favorable.La simple existence de la monnaie unique permet d’emprunter davantage de capitaux dans demeilleures conditions, sur des marchés plus larges, plus profonds et plus liquides.3. La mise en place de l’euro couronne parfaitement le processus de l’UEM étant donné qu’elle estfondée sur le respect strict des critères de convergence et sur la stabilité des prix. La convergencedes États membres vers les meilleures performances économiques en est la conséquence.Selon un dicton français, il ne faut pas bâtir sur le sable. C’est pourquoi le traité de Maastricht ainstitué des critères de convergence auxquels les pays doivent se conformer durablement pourparticiper à l’Union monétaire.A cet égard, j’aimerais souligner la performance de la France. La France compte parmi les trois paysqui ont satisfait rigoureusement aux valeurs de référence de tous les critères de Maastricht,notamment celui en matière de dette publique. Notre stabilité des prix et le bas niveau de nos tauxd’intérêt à long terme nous ont placés parmi les trois pays, avec l’Allemagne, ayant présenté lesmeilleurs résultats : conformément au Traité, nos résultats, avec ceux de deux autres économies, ontpar conséquent servi de référence à l’évaluation de ceux de l’ensemble des pays. La Banque de Francea contribué — directement et indirectement — à ces résultats, en mettant en œuvre une politiquemonétaire indépendante et crédible.A ce propos, je souhaite mettre en avant un point très important. En édifiant une union monétaire, lespays européens n’ont pas seulement fusionné leurs agrégats économiques, commerciaux, financiers et
3BIS Review   22/1999monétaires, faisant de la zone euro un partenaire de premier rang en termes de population(290 millions d’habitants), de taille du PIB, de commerce international ou de masse monétaire : ils ontentrepris de créer une zone solide et stable. En fait, l’Union monétaire n’est pas une simpleaddition arithmétique de résultats économiques nationaux. Elle a été créée en prenant commeréférence les performances  réalisées par les pays ayant présenté les meilleurs résultats entermes de stabilité monétaire. L’Union monétaire est donc composée de pays dont les résultatsmonétaires et financiers ont convergé vers  ceux des pays dont les monnaies sont les plus stables et lesplus crédibles.L’objectif des autorités monétaires de la zone euro est la stabilité monétaire. Le Traité de Maastricht aconféré une mission claire au Système européen de banques centrales (SEBC) nouvellement créé,celle de maintenir la stabilité des prix. Le SEBC est totalement indépendant des autorités nationaleset européennes dans la poursuite de cet objectif.En d’autres termes, les banques centrales nationales sont indépendantes et leurs statuts sontcompatibles avec le Traité. Le SEBC a hérité de la crédibilité des banques centrales nationales despays dont les monnaies bénéficient de la meilleure réputation, c’est-à-dire l’Allemagne et la France.Les 13 octobre et 1er décembre 1998, la BCE a présenté la stratégie de politique monétaire qui seramise en œuvre durant la phase III de l’Union monétaire. Cette stratégie assure la continuité avec lespolitiques monétaires des banques centrales nationales participantes :- la stabilité des prix est définie comme une progression sur un an de l’indice des prix à laconsommation harmonisé (IPCH) inférieure à 2 % dans la zone euro. La stabilité des prix doit êtremaintenue à moyen terme. Définir la stabilité des prix permet également de mettre en oeuvre lesprincipes de transparence et de responsabilité.- un rôle de premier plan a été assigné à la monnaie. Ce rôle est souligné par l’annonce d’une valeurde référence quantifiée pour la croissance d’un agrégat monétaire large, à savoir M3. La valeur deréférence pour 1999 a été fixée à un taux annuel de 4,5 %. Il convient de noter que le concept devaleur de référence n’implique pas l’engagement pour le SEBC de corriger de façon automatique lesécarts susceptibles d’apparaître à court terme entre la croissance monétaire et la valeur de référence.Mais la valeur de référence pour M3 est compatible avec le maintien de la stabilité des prix à moyenterme et permettra de réaliser cet objectif.- le second pilier de la stratégie de politique monétaire est une évaluation d’ensemble des perspectivesd’évolution des prix dans la zone euro considérée dans sa totalité. Il est dès lors important de suivreune large gamme de variables économiques et financières comme indicateurs de l’évolution future desprix.La décision coordonnée, prise en décembre, de ramener les taux d’intérêt à 3 % a permis à la BCEd’annoncer que le nouveau niveau des taux d’intérêt prévaudrait “ dans un avenir prévisible ”.La politique monétaire unique ne peut à elle seule assurer la stabilité des prix si elle n’est pasaccompagnée d’une discipline budgétaire appropriée dans l’ensemble de l’Union économique etmonétaire.Pour ma part, je citerais trois justifications économiques aux dispositions du traité qui ont donnénaissance au Pacte de stabilité et de croissance.Premièrement, en coordonnant les politiques budgétaires des États membres de l’Union monétaire, lepacte permet de doser de façon convenable les politiques monétaire et budgétaires (policy mix) au seinde la zone euro. Cet élément est essentiel pour la politique monétaire. Étant donné que l’Europe nedispose pas d’un budget fédéral important, tout comme elle n’est pas dotée d’un gouvernement
BIS Review   22/19994fédéral, la somme des budgets nationaux doit servir de budget global pour l’ensemble de la zone euro.Cette situation rend nécessaire une surveillance mutuelle étroite et la coordination des politiquesbudgétaires au sein de la zone.Deuxièmement, par le biais de l’instauration d’un système de sanctions financières en cas de déficitsexcessifs, le pacte permet d’éviter que les économies bien gérées aient à supporter des primes derisque injustifiées.Troisièmement, le pacte de stabilité nous permet de réfuter l’affirmation selon laquelle la zone eurone dispose pas de stabilisateurs automatiques en cas de chocs asymétriques subis par un État membre.En réalité, en incitant les États à viser à moyen terme une situation budgétaire proche de l’équilibre ouen excédent, le pacte leur permet de laisser s’accroître les déficits budgétaires durant les récessionssans dépasser la valeur de référence de 3 %. Bref, il leur permet de se constituer, durant les périodeséconomiques normales, un volant de sécurité budgétaire auquel ils peuvent recourir pour résister à unchoc asymétrique.B. Les préparatifs techniques approfondis ont permis l’introduction réussie de l’euro sur lesmarchés1. D’un point de vue technique, le passage à l’euro au cours du dernier week-end de 1998 a été uneréussiteAu cours du  week-end de passage à l’euro , le SEBC a suivi le déroulement des opérations deconversion à la BCE, dans les banques centrales nationales participantes et dans les principauxétablissements. Des échanges réguliers d’informations ont eu lieu par l’intermédiaire d’un réseau depoints de communication entre la BCE et les BCN. Il n’a été signalé aucun incident susceptibled’entraver le démarrage sans heurt du système, qui a ainsi pu débuter normalement ses activités le4 janvier, à l’ouverture des marchés.Ces résultats témoignent de la qualité des préparatifs auxquels se sont livrés la communauté desbanques centrales et les opérateurs privés des marchés de capitaux, ces derniers mois et années. Pource qui concerne la communauté bancaire et financière française, la fin de l’année dernière a étéconsacrée à la planification et aux phases de tests en vue d’organiser le basculement des marchésfinanciers au cours du dernier week-end de 1998. C’est grâce à ces préparatifs que le processus deconversion a été un grand succès.2. Ces préparatifs ont permis une introduction réussie de l’euro sur les marchés de capitauxLe 4 janvier, l’introduction de l’euro s’est effectuée avec succès. Depuis ce jour, l’Eurosystème(c’est-à-dire la BCE et les onze banques centrales nationales des États membres de la zone euro)assume la responsabilité de la conduite de la politique monétaire dans la zone euro en ayant commeobjectif principal le maintien de la stabilité des prix.Nous pouvons aujourd’hui exprimer notre satisfaction devant la manière dont s’est réalisée latransition vers un marché monétaire intégré de la zone euro qui s’est mis en place dès les toutpremiers jours.S’agissant de l’évaluation fondée sur une large gamme d’indicateurs des perspectives d’évolution desprix, le Conseil des gouverneurs de la BCE a considéré, lors de sa réunion du 7 janvier, que lesévolutions sur les marchés de capitaux témoignaient d’un accueil favorable des récentes décisions depolitique monétaire de l’Eurosystème, indiquant ainsi que les opérateurs de marché anticipaient lemaintien de l’environnement de stabilité des prix.
5BIS Review   22/1999Pour faciliter l’intégration des marchés de capitaux nationaux, un accord portant sur le calcul et lapublication d’un indice de taux d’intérêt des opérations interbancaires a été conclu ; cet indice,l’Euribor, se substitue aux anciens indices nationaux et couvre la gamme des échéances allant de 1 à12 mois. L’Euribor est rapidement devenu la principale référence de court terme pour les opérationsen euro. Le lancement d’un indice de taux d’intérêt au jour le jour, l’EONIA, a déjà montré toute saportée en donnant une représentation précise des conditions du marché monétaire dans l’ensemble dela zone euro ; il constitue un repère très utile pour les opérateurs de marché et les agents économiquesainsi que pour la BCE qui l’utilise comme référence dans une grande majorité de contrats etd’opérations.II POUR QUE LE SUCCÈS DE L’EURO SOIT COMPLET, IL FAUT RELEVER UNCERTAIN NOMBRE DE DÉFISL’introduction de l’euro constitue en soi une réforme structurelle majeure. Mais elle ne seracouronnée de succès que si un certain nombre de conditions, notamment des réformes structurelles,sont remplies et si l’euro s’incarne dans le comportement des dirigeants du monde politique et desaffaires ainsi que dans celui des entrepreneurs, des consommateurs et, par-dessus tout, de nosconcitoyens.A. Pour assurer le plein succès de l’euro, les pays européens doivent remplir quatre conditionsIl y a quelques années, il a fallu convaincre un grand nombre de sceptiques, tant en Europe que dansle reste du monde, que le projet de l’euro était viable. Nombreux étaient ceux qui en dénonçaient lesprétendues contradictions et incohérences : par exemple, l’impossibilité de doser de manièreconvenable les politiques monétaire et budgétaire en l’absence d’une fédération politique ;l’impossibilité d’éviter des “ chocs asymétriques ” (c’est-à-dire des difficultés frappant l’économied’un pays membre de l’Union et pas les autres) ; l’insuffisance de flexibilité et de mobilité réelle de lamain-d’œuvre dans les pays européens, etc. La conclusion était que l’euro ne se ferait jamais ! Cescritiques ont été démenties par les faits. Mais elles conservent toute leur utilité lorsqu’il s’agit derépondre à la question des conditions à remplir pour une pleine réussite de l’euro. On peut ensouligner quatre :- En premier lieu, celle de la crédibilité de la politique monétaire garantie par l’indépendance de laBanque centrale européenne, scellée dans le traité de Maastricht et fondée sur l’indépendance dechacune des banques centrales nationales. Pour être une monnaie crédible, l’euro doit inspirerconfiance aussi bien aux 290 millions d’Européens de la zone euro qu’aux non-Européens aveclesquels nous faisons des affaires. Cette confiance ne peut être gagnée qu’en résistant à toute forme depression, notamment politique, sur le mode de gestion de la nouvelle monnaie. Le fonctionnementharmonieux de l’équipe monétaire européenne composée de la BCE et des banques centralesnationales des onze pays fondateurs facilitera la réalisation de cette première condition.- En deuxième lieu, le respect des dispositions du Traité et des orientations du Pacte de stabilité et decroissance en matière de politique budgétaire. La coordination étroite des politiques budgétaires et lasurveillance vigilante des “ pairs ” au sein du conseil informel des onze États membres participants — ” l’Euro 11 ” — et du Conseil Ecofin qui réunit les ministres des Finances des 15 sont indispensablespour assurer un “ policy mix ” équilibré dans toute la zone euro. Le respect de l’objectif à moyenterme de “ finances publiques proches de l’équilibre ou en excédent ” — il signifie que nul ne doitcéder à la tentation du déficit budgétaire individuel — est essentiel si l’Union veut pouvoir faire facecollectivement à des périodes de difficultés économiques et si chaque pays veut pouvoir surmonterdes phases de détérioration de la conjoncture qui n’affecteraient que lui.C’est l’attachement de l’ensemble des gouvernements européens au Pacte de stabilité et de croissancequi a permis à la BCE et aux banques centrales nationales de décider récemment de ramener les tauxd’intérêt à 3 % — une baisse des taux qui ne peut manquer de soutenir la croissance.
BIS Review   22/19996- En troisième lieu, tous les pays européens doivent résolument s’engager à entreprendre desréformes structurelles. L’Europe continentale connaît un chômage élevé, même si celui-ci a enregistréune légère décrue dans la plupart des économies concernées. Selon le FMI et l’OCDE, ce chômageest, à concurrence de près 80 %, de nature structurelle, c’est-à-dire qu’il est créé par le poids de nospropres règles et règlements. Le Conseil de la politique monétaire de la Banque de France partagecette analyse. Certains observateurs extérieurs reprochaient à l’Europe, tout récemment encore, de sefocaliser sur l’euro au lieu de se consacrer à la tâche, plus urgente à leurs yeux, de mettre en œuvre lesréformes structurelles indispensables à une création plus dynamique d’emplois.Ces critiques avaient tort sur l’inopportunité de l’euro mais ils avaient raison s’agissant du diagnosticsur les maux qui affligent l’économie européenne. L’euro, loin d’entraver les réformes structurelles,sera complémentaire de celles-ci. La monnaie unique facilitera les mouvements de biens, de serviceset de capitaux au sein de la zone euro, mais elle encouragera également la “ fertilisation croisée ” desmeilleures pratiques grâce au renforcement de la coordination entre les politiques des États membresdans des domaines tels que :  marchés du travail, enseignement et formation, incitations au travail et àla création d’emplois, meilleure efficacité des systèmes de protection sociale etc.- En quatrième lieu, tous les responsables économiques d’Europe doivent être lucides sur la questioncruciale de la compétitivité. La politique économique de la période antérieure à l’introduction del’euro consistait à surveiller la balance commerciale, la balance des paiements, les marchés de changeet de taux. Les gouvernements recevaient ainsi en retour des informations constantes sur lesprincipaux indicateurs de l’évolution de l’économie nationale et pouvaient agir en conséquence. Avecl’avènement de l’euro, ces indicateurs ont pour la plupart disparu au niveau national, mais ilssubsistent naturellement au niveau de la zone euro. D’où l’importance des dispositions du Traité surla coordination des politiques budgétaires et des politiques économiques. Néanmoins, les règles del’économie de marché continuent de s’appliquer à chacune des économies. Les consommateurs créentdes emplois lorsqu’ils choisissent les biens et services qu’ils estiment présenter le meilleur rapportqualité/prix. Les chefs d’entreprise peuvent répartir ces emplois sur différents sites et pays en fonctionde la compétitivité relative de ces sites. Il faut donc que les dirigeants de chaque économie nationalesuivent plus attentivement encore qu’auparavant les indicateurs de compétitivité tels que l’évolutiondes coûts unitaires de production, des dépenses des entreprises, et l’environnement fiscal etréglementaire. Contrairement à la période antérieure à l’euro, toute perte de compétitivité nes’affichera pas rapidement sur les écrans radar que sont les comptes extérieurs et les marchés dechange. Les dirigeants doivent donc redoubler de vigilance sur le suivi des autres indicateurs. Leserreurs de politique économique risquent, en effet, être sanctionnées d’une façon plus lente et plusinsidieuse, par la montée du chômage et le ralentissement de la croissance.B. Les entrepreneurs, les consommateurs et  l’ensemble des citoyens doivent s’approprierl’euro.- Avant toute chose, l’indépendance monétaire, la sagesse budgétaire, les réformes structurelles et lacompétitivité des politiques économiques seront vaines si elles ne se traduisent pas dans lecomportement des agents économiques eux-mêmes, c’est-à-dire nos concitoyens, — ménages etconsommateurs, mais aussi salariés, ingénieurs, entrepreneurs individuels, chefs d’entreprise. C’est,en particulier, la raison pour laquelle la Banque souhaite délivrer aux entreprises un message trèsdirect : “ L’introduction de l’euro n’est pas une question tactique mais une question stratégique ”.Avec le passage à l’euro, il ne s’agit pas seulement de remplacer une expression monétaire par uneautre et de réécrire des programmes informatiques. C’est l’ensemble des fonctions de l’entreprise — industrielle, commerciale, financière, etc. — qu’il convient de réexaminer pour évaluer et mettre enœuvre les changements stratégiques nécessaires.Les sociétés françaises font preuve d’un intérêt croissant pour le basculement à l’euro, créant desforums de discussion avec la collaboration du ministère des Finances. Des recommandations ont étépubliées concernant les comptes, les relations avec les services fiscaux et de sécurité sociale et la
7BIS Review   22/1999conversion du capital. Diverses dispositions législatives  ont été adoptées par le Parlement, en 1998.Elles offrent notamment l’option tout euro, à laquelle les entreprises ont accès depuis le 1er janvier1999.En France, les consommateurs ont été consultés principalement par l’intermédiaire du Conseilnational de la consommation. Ces consultations vont se poursuivre tout au long de la période detransition. Parmi les tâches à accomplir, il reste à prendre des mesures pour venir en aide auxcatégories les plus vulnérables de la population, notamment les personnes âgées et à mener descampagnes d’information en direction des consommateurs. De nouvelles dispositions serontégalement nécessaires pour permettre de suivre l’évolution des prix tant au cours de la période detransition qu’après le 1er janvier 2002, les entreprises devant fournir aux consommateurs desrenseignements complets et transparents afin que ceux-ci disposent de toute l’information nécessaire.Les pouvoirs publics en France sont également pleinement conscients de la nécessité de faireconnaître l’euro aux enfants des écoles, futurs utilisateurs de la monnaie unique.III LE SUCCÈS DE L’EURO APPORTERA UNE CONTRIBUTION MAJEURE ÀL’AMÉLIORATION DE L’ÉQUILIBRE ÉCONOMIQUE ET MONÉTAIRE MONDIALDans la situation économique globale actuelle, le succès de l’euro va beaucoup aider à la foisl’Europe et le reste du monde, qui vont tirer profit de la prospérité et de la croissance européennes,éléments essentiels de la bonne santé de l’économie mondiale.Il est clair que le nouveau cadre monétaire européen a et aura des conséquences de grande portée nonseulement pour l’Europe et sa population, mais aussi pour l’économie mondiale et la communautéinternationale. La contribution de la zone euro à la stabilité internationale peut être appréciée à l’aunedu développement de relations économiques équilibrées au sein de la zone euro et avec les paysextérieurs à la zone euro, et à celle du renforcement de la stabilité monétaire et financièreinternationale.A. L’établissement de relations économiques équilibréesa) Les relations entre l’Union monétaire et les autres États européens seront fondées sur lacoopération.La coopération se traduira principalement par la coordination des politiques économiques des 15États de l’Union européenne. Une telle coordination est requise par le Traité et elle est nécessairepour que l’Union européenne fonctionne de manière satisfaisante au niveau économique. Il estimportant que le dialogue entre tous les États européens se poursuive, même si le passage à l’euromodifiera l’environnement économique traditionnel de l’Union européenne ; c’est la raison pourlaquelle le groupe de l’Euro 11, composé des ministres des Finances de la zone euro, a été constitué ets’est déjà réuni plusieurs fois. Le dialogue entre toutes les parties concernées doit prendre en comptel’indépendance totale de la BCE  et l’objectif de la stabilité des prix qui, en vertu du Traité, doitguider la politique monétaire de la zone euro.En particulier, la coordination entre les 15 pays permettra à ceux qui n’ont pas encore rejoint l’Unionmonétaire de converger vers la zone euro. Le nouveau mécanisme de change qui va lier à l’eurocertaines des monnaies concernées (c’est le cas de la drachme grecque et de la couronne danoisedepuis le 1er janvier 1999) apportera sa contribution à ce processus. En favorisant la stabilité des tauxde change, le nouveau MCE permettra le bon fonctionnement du marché unique et aidera les pays“ out ” à se qualifier pour la monnaie unique.b) L’Union monétaire aura aussi des relations étroites avec des pays extérieurs à l’Unioneuropéenne.
BIS Review   22/19998Premièrement, l’Union monétaire et l’Union européenne constituent un pôle attrayant pour nosvoisins de l’Europe centrale. Les résultats atteints par certains d’entre eux au cours de ces dernièresannées témoignent de progrès remarquables. Ils doivent poursuivre leurs efforts afin d’être capablesde rejoindre l’UEM dans de bonnes conditions, ce qui est de leur intérêt et de celui des pays membresde l’Union européenne.En ce qui concerne la coopération internationale, la zone euro va également jouer un rôle essentiel.Elle représente une zone de stabilité et de croissance économique durable pour quelque 290 millionsde citoyens et elle aura certainement une influence déterminante au sein de la communautéinternationale. L’avènement de l’euro va faciliter la coopération internationale en matière économiqueentre les principaux partenaires : États-Unis, Japon et zone euro. Chacun de ceux-ci est en mesure deparler au nom de régions dont l’importance économique est significative et qui sont exposées à desdegrés relativement similaires aux chocs pouvant affecter le système financier international. C’estpourquoi l’euro devrait conduire à une relation plus équilibrée dans laquelle chacun des partenairesassumerait sa part de responsabilité dans la construction d’un environnement mondial stable.Ce changement institutionnel majeur dans l’architecture du système monétaire international a rendunécessaire une représentation internationale de l’Eurosystème.c) La représentation internationale de l’EurosystèmeLe SEBC est déjà représenté auprès des institutions et des forums internationaux. Même si certainesquestions sont encore en voie de règlement, des accords ont été conclus avec le Fonds monétaireinternational (FMI), la Banque des règlements internationaux (BRI), l’Organisation pour lacoopération et le développement économique (OCDE) et dans le cadre du G7 et du G10. Plusrécemment, le FMI a accordé le statut d’observateur à la BCE.Le SEBC bénéficie de bonnes relations bilatérales avec les autres banques centrales du monde entier.B .- L’UEM renforcera la stabilité monétaire et financièrea) Le rôle international de l’euroEn ce qui concerne le rôle international de l’euro, je voudrais dire que le SEBC adopte une attitude deneutralité.Le rôle international d’une devise est une question complexe. Une monnaie peut être utilisée pardifférents groupes d’agents économiques, dans divers desseins, comme monnaie d’ancrage ou commemonnaie de réserve d’une part, et  comme monnaie de facturation et de règlement pour le commerceinternational ainsi que comme monnaie d’expression d’actifs financiers, d’autre part.En tout état de cause, le rôle de l’euro comme monnaie internationale dans ses différentes fonctionsmettra du temps à se développer.En ce qui concerne la future part de l’euro dans les réserves publiques de change globales, on peuts’attendre à ce que les banques centrales des pays hors zone euro réexaminent progressivement  leurstratégie de gestion des réserves en fonction des opportunités de diversification offertes par lanouvelle monnaie. De plus, l’euro pourrait jouer un rôle accru de monnaie d’ancrage dans d’autrespays européens envisageant de lier le taux de change de leur monnaie à l’euro.En ce qui concerne l’usage privé de l’euro, les agents économiques pourraient utiliser celui-ci pour  seprémunir contre des risques en diversifiant la composition de leur portefeuille. Si les investisseurs etles emprunteurs internationaux considèrent que l’euro deviendra une monnaie stable, ils détiendrontdes actifs libellés en euros pour réduire au minimum les risques dans le cadre de la diversification
9BIS Review   22/1999internationale de leurs portefeuilles. En outre, un marché financier de l’euro large et liquide peutconduire à un usage étendu de l’euro, usage  qui, en retour, pourrait faciliter son développement entant que monnaie de facturation ou de dénomination sur les marchés des produits de base . L’euro vaprogressivement accroître son rôle comme monnaie internationale utilisée par le secteur privé, mêmesi le rythme de son internationalisation peut être variable selon la fonction considérée.b) Les relations de change de la zone euro vis-à-vis des principales devises mondialesEn ce qui concerne les relations de change entre l’euro et les principales devises mondiales, à savoirle dollar et le yen, je pense qu’il ne faudrait jamais oublier ceci : dans un régime de changes flottants,la stabilité du taux de change dépend des données fondamentales de l’économie. C’est pourquoi despolitiques saines et avisées dans les domaines monétaire et budgétaire sont les meilleurs garants d’unfonctionnement approprié du système monétaire international. Il est encourageant, à cet égard, denoter que des deux côtés de l’Atlantique, nous partageons la même optique globale au sujet d’unemonnaie qui conserve sa valeur et d’un budget tendant à être proche de l’équilibre ou en excédent. Encomplément de ces données fondamentales saines, qui sont d’une importance décisive, nous devonspréserver le processus de la coopération internationale  et nous devons renforcer cette coopération .Elle s’est avérée utile au cours de ces quinze dernières années.En se fondant sur l’expérience et les enseignements de ces dernières années, on peut probablementencore améliorer cette coopération internationale, et le fait que trois devises de pays du G7 se soientactuellement fondues dans l’euro pourrait et devrait rendre plus facile et de plus en plus efficace cettecoopération.Dans cette perspective, j’aimerais attirer votre attention sur quatre principes, qui sont essentiels pourl’efficacité de la coopération internationale.- Le premier principe dont nous ne devons pas nous écarter est le respect du fait que ce sont lesdonnées fondamentales qui commandent l’évolution des taux de change dans le moyen et le longtermes ;- le deuxième principe est la nécessité de rechercher un consensus approprié entre les représentants dupouvoir exécutif et les autorités monétaires d’une part, entre les différents pays concernés d’autrepart ;- le troisième principe est le respect de ce que j’appellerais la discipline verbale. Les marchés peuventêtre troublés par des déclarations hétérogènes et contradictoires. Au contraire, ils sont impressionnéspar la cohésion et par la cohérence de déclarations s’en tenant au plus près des “ termes de référence ”agréés d’un commun accord ;- le quatrième principe est la nécessaire préservation de la crédibilité des autorités dans toutes lescirconstances.Durant ces dix dernières années, les communiqués du G7 qui délivraient un message commun relatifaux taux de change ont toujours fait l’objet de la plus grande attention de la part des investisseurs etdes marchés, et se sont révélés efficaces. Il s’agit là d’un atout inestimable que nous devons préserveravec le plus grand soin.***En conclusion permettez-moi de souligner trois points :
BIS Review   22/199910D’abord, en ce qui concerne la Banque centrale européenne et le Système européen de banquescentrales, j’aimerais proposer une métaphore qui pourrait éclairer mon propos. Il y a une équipemonétaire européenne composée de douze joueurs, la BCE et les 11 banques centrales nationales.C’est toute l’équipe monétaire des douze qui joue sur le terrain, avec un seul “ esprit d’équipe ”, quiconstitue un des atouts inestimables de l’Europe.Deuxièmement, le GVII de samedi à Bonn nous a permis de faire de nouveaux progrès dans lerenforcement de ce que l’on est convenu d’appeler l’architecture financière internationale. On aparfois un peu trop tendance, à mon avis, à insister sur les différences de sensibilité qui se manifestentici et là. Ce qui est beaucoup plus important, c’est que la communauté internationale est en accordprofond sur de très nombreux points. Qu’il me suffise de mentionner ce dont nous sommes convenussamedi dernier : importance des “bonnes pratiques” en matière de politique sociale, renforcement dela surveillance des institutions à hauts risques, y compris les “hedge funds”, création du forum destabilité financière, organisation de deux séminaires en mars et avril avec les pays émergents, réunionde préparation du Comité intérimaire.Je voudrais particulièrement souligner un point, à savoir les dangers spécifiques qui sont associés au“comportement moutonnier”, ce que les Américains appellent le “herd instinct” des opérateurs,investisseurs et marchés. Ce “comportement moutonnier” a caractérisé pendant les 18 derniers mois àla fois l’attitude des investisseurs vis-à-vis des économies émergentes en transition et certainementaussi les marchés des pays industrialisés eux-mêmes. Le “comportement moutonnier” pourrait être unde nos pires ennemis dans notre recherche de la stabilité financière internationale. Selon moi, un desmeilleurs moyens de lutter contre ce phénomène est que chaque pays, chaque emprunteur et chaquesignature accepte d’être parfaitement transparent. Seule, une transparence complète et fiable de toutesles entités, qu’elles soient publiques ou privées, permettra d’évaluer correctement les mérites dechacun des cas et de convaincre les investisseurs qu’il faut se méfier des raisonnements par analogie.“Comparaison n’est pas raison” dit justement le proverbe.Troisièmement, en ce qui concerne le niveau actuel de nos taux d’intérêt, je voudrais attirer votreattention sur le fait que, dans toutes les économies de la zone euro, les taux de marché s’établissent auniveau le plus bas observé depuis la seconde guerre mondiale. Nos taux à long terme, notamment,sont extrêmement bas, à 150 points de base environ en dessous du taux le plus bas qui avait étéobservé historiquement pour le DM ou pour le Franc au cours des cinquante dernières années, ce quiconstitue une contribution importante à la préservation de la croissance et à la création d’emplois. Letaux d’intérêt à trois mois sur le marché monétaire de la zone euro s’établit actuellement à 120 pointsde base au-dessous des taux moyens observés en octobre 1997. Le taux d’intervention de la BanqueCentrale Européenne est à 100 points de base environ en dessous de la moyenne des tauxd’intervention des banques centrales nationales de la zone euro. Enfin, il est significatif que les tauxd’intérêt réels à court terme soient aujourd’hui, en Europe, à 100 points de base environ en dessousdes taux d’intérêt réels  à court terme prévalant aux États-Unis.

1BIS Review   19/1999Mr George talks about monetary policy in the United Kingdom: The Economic ProspectText of the Chancellor’s Lecture delivered by the Governor of the Bank of England, Mr E A JGeorge, at Hertfordshire University on 18/02/99.As you would expect of a central banker I will talk about monetary policy – under the title of“The Economic Prospect”. I will begin by explaining what it is that we are trying to dothrough monetary policy; then I’ll describe how we’ve been doing, where we are now, andwhere we might be headed.What we are trying to doSo let me begin with what it is that we are trying to do.In one sense that’s very easy to explain these days. The previous Conservative Governmenthad already in 1992 defined the objective of monetary policy in terms of a target rate for retailprice inflation. The new Labour Government, immediately on assuming office, similarlydefined the objective in terms of an inflation target, but went an important step further. Assoon as Gordon Brown became Chancellor of the Exchequer, in May 1997, he announced thathe would no longer exercise his powers to set short-term interest rates, which is the heart ofmonetary policy, but instead he would set the inflation target, and delegate the achievement ofthat target to a new Monetary Policy Committee to be established in the Bank of England.This position was subsequently formalised in the new Bank of England Act which came intoeffect in June of last year. That Act now defines the Bank’s objective as “the maintenance ofprice stability, and, subject to that, to support the Government’s economic policy, including itsobjectives for growth and employment”.Under the Act the Chancellor tells the Bank what precisely we are to understand by “pricestability” and he has done this by setting a target of 2½% for a particular measure of retailprice inflation (RPIX – which is the RPI excluding mortgage interest payments); and althoughthe Act provides for the Chancellor to set the target each year, the expectation is that it is inpractice set for the medium to longer term. That is the political decision. The task of achievingthat target – the technical implementation of monetary policy – is then delegated, transparentlyand accountably, to the MPC. The Government no longer has the power – as it had under the1946 Bank of England Act – to issue directions to the Bank in the field of monetary policy,except, in the terms of the new Act, “in extreme economic circumstances”.So the objective of monetary policy these days, in this immediate sense, could hardly beclearer; and that objective is accepted across a broad part of the political spectrum.But it is important to understand that this objective – of permanent effective price stability – isnot simply an end in itself.Now a lot of people think that, because our objective is defined in terms of an inflation target,controlling inflation is all that we at the Bank of England actually care about. We’re oftendescribed as a lot of “inflation nutters”, or even as “pointy-headed industrial hooligans” whodon’t care at all about real economic activity or jobs – and I don’t think these epithets arenecessarily intended as terms of endearment! That view I have to tell you is profoundly andfundamentally wrong.
BIS Review   19/19992The implication, of those who take that view, is that they think there is a trade-off betweeninflation and the rate of economic growth; they think that if only we would let up a bit oncontrolling inflation then we could all enjoy higher activity and lower unemployment andrising living standards, which are, of course, the really good things of economic life. At thevery least, they say, if you were a bit less manic in your pursuit of low inflation, we couldavoid some of the worst damage that is currently being inflicted upon agriculture, upon largeparts of manufacturing, and even some service sectors.And that might even be true for a time. The trouble is that, in anything other than the shortterm, it would be likely to mean more rather than less economic damage, and lower ratherthan higher growth and employment.Often in the past in this country we behaved as if we thought that promoting higher growthand employment – which I repeat is, of course, what we all want to see – was largely a matterof pumping up demand. We paid too little attention to the structural, supply-side, constraints.All too often we tried to buy faster growth and higher employment at the expense of just a bitmore inflation. But that was like trying to squeeze a quart out of a pint pot. And you all knowthe result: inflation accelerated, often accompanied by a worsening balance of payments, untilit could only be brought back under control – as eventually it had to be brought back undercontrol – by pushing up interest rates dramatically and forcing the economy into recession.We get uptight these days when interest rates rise by ¼%: it was only 14 years ago that wewere driven to increase interest rates by 4% in the space of 17 days. I don’t need to remindyou – or perhaps I do – of the really miserable social as well as economic consequences, asright across the economy people lost their jobs, their businesses and their homes. But evenmore insidiously, repeated experience of boom and bust produced a pervasive short-termismin business behaviour, which infected both industry and finance, and both employers andemployees, however much we all like to blame everyone else. The reality during this periodwas that everyone was tempted to grab as much as they could while the going was good,because they knew it would not last.But we have learned from that experience. We’ve learned that in anything other than the shortterm there really is no trade-off between growth and inflation. What we are trying to do nowthrough monetary policy is to keep overall demand in the economy growing continuouslybroadly in line with the supply-side capacity of the economy – as a whole – to meet thatdemand. Both the previous Government and the present one set a low inflation target as theimmediate objective of monetary policy, not as an end in itself, but in effect as a barometer ofour success in keeping demand in line with supply. So the real aim of monetary policy thesedays is to achieve stability across the economy as a whole in this much wider sense.Now, there is not a lot, frankly, that we can do, directly through monetary policy, to affect thesupply side – the underlying rate of growth that can be sustained without causing inflation torise. That depends ultimately on the ingenuity, the productivity, and the flexibility, of theeconomy, though it can, of course, be influenced by the whole raft of Government policies,ranging from education and health, through taxation and social security, to the balancebetween regulation in all its forms, including regulation of the labour market, and productiveefficiency. Like the setting of the objective of monetary policy, these are, of course, quiterightly, matters for elected politicians.Monetary policy operates on the demand side. And the best help that we can give is to keepoverall demand consistently in line with supply-side capacity – symmetrically not letting it run
3BIS Review   19/1999above capacity but not letting it fall below capacity either – as reflected in achievement of theinflation target. That way we can moderate rather than aggravate the unavoidable ups anddowns of the business cycle, enabling steadier growth, high levels of employment and risingliving standards to be sustained into the medium and longer term. And if we can do that, thenwe will contribute indirectly to the supply side by creating an environment which encouragesmore rational, longer-term, decision-making throughout the economy.So that, Chancellor, is what we are trying to do. The debate about monetary policy is notabout the ends, it is about the means. We are every bit as concerned with growth andemployment as we are about price stability – as anyone in their right mind must be.Permanently low inflation is a necessary means of achieving growth and employmentsustained into the medium and long term. I don’t think that any of us at the Bank of Englandor on the MPC would get half the satisfaction that we do in fact get from our involvement inmonetary policy, if we thought that controlling inflation was simply an end in itself.How we’ve been doingSo much, then, for what we are trying to do. How, then, are we doing? Well – whatever youread in the newspapers – the answer is that since we adopted an inflation target as theimmediate policy objective, we’ve actually been doing pretty well.Inflation over the past six years or so has in fact averaged about 2¾% a year on the targetmeasure and it has recently been almost spot on its 2½% target.But equally important, total output in this country has grown consistently for almost sevenyears – 27 consecutive quarters – up to the final quarter of last year, at an average annual rateof around 3%, and that is well above our long-term rate of growth of underlying capacity ofsome 2-2½%. We were, in fact, over this period steadily reabsorbing the economic slackcreated by the earlier recession.Employment has risen on the most recent figures published yesterday, by some 1.8 mn since1992, to an all-time high of 27.3 mn. And the unemployment rate is at a near 20-year low, notjust for the UK as a whole, but in nearly every region in the Kingdom.Encouragingly these developments in the labour market produced only a rather gradual pick-up in earnings growth compared with past periods of labour market tightening, which was animportant factor helping to contain inflation. And our balance of payments remained insurplus on the latest available data – for Q3 last year.Short-term interest rates – which are currently at 5½% – actually peaked last year at 7½%. Formuch of my 37 years at the Bank I’d have given my eye-teeth for them to trough at 7½%.Long-term interest rates, which have recently been at around 4½%, are lower than they’vebeen since the late 1950’s. That’s certainly good for the economy as a whole, though Irecognise that it does not necessarily feel good to people living on interest on their savings,even though those savings keep their real value far better than during the earlier period of highinflation.The public sector’s balance sheet is in excellent shape compared with most of the rest of theworld – and the Government’s borrowing requirement position is strong and sustainable. And
BIS Review   19/19994the same is true of the balance sheets of the banking system, and of both the household andcorporate sectors.And on top of all that, England beat the Springboks at rugby – even if our cricketers didn’t doso well down under!Yet all that one reads about – all that anyone wants to talk about apparently – is the bad news.So let me not disappoint you this evening, and now come on to the bad news.Where are we now?By around the beginning of 1997 it was becoming clear that we were once again in danger ofhaving too much of a good thing. Overall output growth needed to moderate if we were not torun up against overall capacity constraints – particularly in the labour market. In fact outputgrowth actually picked up during the course of 1997, from a rate of close to 3% to around 4%,partly under the impact of the windfall effect of building society demutualisation on consumerspending. Aggregate demand growth, in other words, needed to slow if we were to avoidoverheating, and that essentially was the background to the tightening of monetary policyduring 1997 and the first half of 1998.But there was a major complication. In the autumn of 1996 sterling’s exchange rate againstthe core European currencies started to strengthen, and by early 1997 it had alreadyappreciated by some 17% against the deutschemark. Although sterling appreciated rather lessagainst the dollar – which also strengthened against the core European currencies over thisperiod – sterling’s effective exchange rate index (ERI) still rose by some 13.5%. Sterling wentup further against the deutschemark right up until the spring of last year.It was never entirely clear just why sterling – and the dollar – strengthened in this way, orperhaps more appropriately why the core European currencies weakened, when they did.It appeared to have little to do with relative monetary conditions between the Anglo-Saxoncountries and the Continent. It may have had more to do with market perceptions – or marketmisperceptions – about the future prospects for the euro. Financial markets appeared at thattime to take the view that European Monetary Union was being driven increasingly bypolitical determination – even if that meant softening the interpretation of the economicconvergence criteria written into the Maastricht Treaty. They concluded that this implied abroad rather than a narrow initial euro membership; and that that, in turn, implied a weakrather than a strong euro.But whatever the reason – and whether it was valid or not – the effect of sterling’sappreciation was to introduce a pronounced imbalance into the UK economy. It dampened netexternal demand, and had a restraining influence on cost and price inflation, at a time whendomestic demand growth remained unsustainably strong, and when we were approaching fullcapacity.We understood very well that, after a relatively favourable exchange rate environment,following our exit from the ERM, the abrupt appreciation meant that the internationally-exposed sectors of the economy, including large parts of manufacturing industry, were nowsuddenly confronted with much harsher trading conditions. That, as I say, had a dampening
5BIS Review   19/1999effect on the UK economy and on inflation. But we couldn’t just rely on that to cool theeconomy for us. Clearly at some point the exchange rate would stop appreciating, and thisexternal dampening effect would have worked its way through. In the meantime, we needed toslow the rate of growth of domestic demand sufficiently to avoid overheating in the economyas a whole. The strong exchange rate gave us somewhat more time than we would otherwisehave had to bring about this domestic slowdown – it meant that monetary policy did not needto be tightened as aggressively as would have been necessary otherwise. But we could notavoid tightening policy altogether, even though we realised that this would be likely toincrease the pressures on the internationally-exposed sectors, because in anything other thanthe short term that would have put the whole economy – including the internationally-exposedsectors we were trying to shelter – at risk of accelerating inflation. I would remind you thatright up until the summer of last year we were seeing signs of increasing pressures in thelabour market, even in the manufacturing sector – reflected in increasing skills shortages andrecruitment difficulties, in the employment/unemployment data, and in gradually increasingpay settlements. The uncomfortable reality, as I’ve said very often before, is that monetarypolicy can only target the economy as a whole – it can’t seek to protect individual firms, orsectors, or regions, however much we might wish it otherwise. That – as I’ve discovered – isnot exactly a popular idea, but there’s no question that that is the reality of it.Over the past year the world – and I mean the world – has changed very substantially.The exchange rate has, in fact, tended gradually to soften since last spring when the decisionto go ahead with the euro was finally confirmed; but increasingly since the autumn theinternationally-exposed sectors of the economy have been dealt a further massive blow as aresult of global economic turbulence.This started, in fact, with the financial disturbances in Asia in the latter half of 1997, but evenas late as the beginning of last summer it seemed as if it might have only limited impact on theoverall world economy. The IMF, for example, was then still projecting 3-3¾% world growthin 1998 and 1999 respectively, which was certainly a setback compared with their forecast ofover 4% just six months before, but it was hardly catastrophic.Since last summer it has become increasingly clear that things are likely to be significantlyworse than that. The financial collapse in Russia, deepening recession in Japan, the long battle– then sudden defeat – in Brazil to hold its exchange rate, and fluctuating fears of possibleknock-on effects on the major countries’ financial markets, all contributed to an increasedsense of financial fragility, which has not been easy to contain, though I am now hopeful thatwe will be able to stop the financial rot.But even if we can – and the financial markets’ response to the latest developments in Brazil,as well as the beginnings of a recovery in capital flows to some countries in Asia, arereasonably encouraging in this respect – we are now having to cope with the economic after-effects of these earlier financial disturbances. The IMF has cut its most recent forecasts forworld growth to close to 2%. And the risks almost certainly remain on the downside. That’sstill not global slump or recession. But large parts of the world economy are in fact inrecession and the prospect for the world as a whole turns very much on what happens in themajor industrial countries.In essence, what we have seen is a brutally sharp cutback in capital flows to much of theemerging world and to some of the transition economies, creating a corresponding need for
BIS Review   19/19996urgent improvement in their current accounts. This has caused massive currency depreciationsand forced the emerging countries to make equally sharp cutbacks in domestic demand. Thecounterpart is a sharp decline in net external demand in the industrial countries, which, if itwere not to be offset by action to stimulate domestic demand in those countries, could indeedlead to weakening global activity and price deflation.In fact to varying degrees, reflecting differing assessments of how far our particular currencyareas are expected to be affected by the world slowdown and different starting points, relatingboth to our assessment of trends in domestic demand, and of how close we were initially tofull capacity, both the UK and the Euro-zone, as well as the US, have acted fairly aggressivelyto reduce interest rates since the autumn; and Japan has moved to more active fiscal stimulus.And if the global economic prospect, and net external demand in the industrial countries, wereto deteriorate further, then it would be right to contemplate further moves in the samedirection – consistently with our aim of effective price stability. What we all aim to do – as Isaid earlier – is to keep aggregate demand in line with the supply capacity of our economies.We have no interest in the creation of unnecessary spare capacity in our economies as awhole, nor in a fall in the underlying general price level.But that will still inevitably mean a sharp deterioration in the balance of payments of theindustrial countries, collectively and probably individually, reflecting the imbalance betweenexternal and domestic demand growth in the industrial economies. And that in turn is boundto mean substantial pressure on the internationally-exposed sectors of the economy, not just inthis country but throughout the industrial world, and we are already seeing ample evidence ofthat.In the case of this country these adverse international influences really began to affect us justas overall demand was already weakening in response to the earlier monetary, and incidentallyfiscal, tightening. The result was a very sharp decline in industrial – especially manufacturing– confidence, and widespread, and often exaggerated, fears of recession, which in turnappeared to undermine consumer confidence. The slowdown – or soft landing – we had beenconsciously seeking to engineer threatened quite rapidly to become a much sharper decline –or harder landing – than we had either expected or needed. And that, of course, is why wepromptly changed our monetary policy stance as we did, cutting interest rates by 2% to 5½%in the space of five months.In doing so, we have demonstrated that the inflation target is – as we have frequently said it is– symmetrical, so that we would be at least as determined and aggressive in cutting rates if wethought we were likely to undershoot the inflation target as we had been earlier in raising ratesto avoid an overshoot of the inflation target.So, where do we go from here?I would strongly advise you to regard anyone who claims to know with any great certaintywhere we go from here with the gravest possible suspicion. Forecasting the economy is verydefinitely an art rather than a science – though some artists craft their work rather morecarefully than others.But, for what it is worth, the Monetary Policy Committee’s view – described in considerabledetail in our recent quarterly Inflation Report, which I can make available to you for aremarkably modest fee if you care to get in touch with me afterwards – is that while we will
7BIS Review   19/1999not see much growth in the first half of this year – certainly in the internationally-exposedsectors of the economy – overall output growth will pick up on the back of stronger domesticdemand as we move towards the Millennium to around trend or above from the second half ofnext year. We can’t of course altogether rule out an actual downturn in total output over thenext few months, though the odds are against that for the economy as a whole. And we arereasonably confident that the slowdown will be relatively mild and short-lived – certainlycompared with equivalent periods in the past, for example at the beginning of the 1980’s and1990’s. The good news is that we expect inflation to remain close to the Government’s 2½%target over the next two years, which should allow the relatively steady growth we have seenin the overall economy since 1992 to resume on a sustainable basis.Within this overall picture, we are still confronted with the difficult problem of imbalancebetween external and domestic demand and the sectoral and regional stresses that this implies.At some point, as global economic activity begins to recover, we will again need to act torestrain the growth of domestic demand, but that is a problem for the future.Given the present international economic environment, and given the present advanced stageof our own economic cycle, if the outturn over the next couple of years is anything close tothis – that is about the best we can realistically hope for.
1BIS Review   21/1999Mr Greenspan presents the Federal Reserve’s semi-annual report on monetary policy to the USSenateTestimony of the Chairman of the Board of the US Federal Reserve System, Mr Alan Greenspan,before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the US Senate on 23/02/99.Chairman and members of the Committee, I appreciate the opportunity to present the FederalReserve’s semiannual report on monetary policy.The U.S. economy over the past year again performed admirably. Despite the challenges presented bysevere economic downturns in a number of foreign countries and episodic financial turmoil abroadand at home, our real GDP grew about 4 percent for a third straight year. In 1998, 2¾ million jobswere created on net, bringing the total increase in payrolls to more than 18 million during the currenteconomic expansion, which late last year became the longest in U.S. peacetime history.Unemployment edged down further to a 4¼ percent rate, the lowest since 1970.And despite taut labor markets, inflation also fell to its lowest rate in many decades by some broadmeasures, although a portion of this decline owed to decreases in oil, commodity, and other importprices that are unlikely to be repeated. Hourly labor compensation adjusted for inflation posted furtherimpressive gains. Real compensation gains have been supported by robust advances in laborproductivity, which in turn have partly reflected heavy investment in plant and equipment, oftenembodying innovative technologies.Can this favorable performance be sustained? In many respects the fundamental underpinnings of therecent U.S. economic performance are strong. Flexible markets and the shift to surplus on the booksof the federal government are facilitating the build-up in cutting-edge capital stock. That build-up inturn is spawning rapid advances in productivity that are helping to keep inflation well behaved. Thenew technologies and the optimism of consumers and investors are supporting asset prices andsustaining spending.But, after eight years of economic expansion, the economy appears stretched in a number ofdimensions, implying considerable upside and downside risks to the economic outlook. The robustincrease of production has been using up our nation’s spare labor resources, suggesting that recentstrong growth in spending cannot continue without a pick-up in inflation unless labor productivitygrowth increases significantly further. Equity prices are high enough to raise questions about whethershares are overvalued. The debt of the household and business sectors has mounted, as has theexternal debt of the country as a whole, reflecting the deepening current account deficit. We remainvulnerable to rapidly changing conditions overseas, which, as we saw last summer, can be transmittedto U.S. markets quickly and traumatically. I will be commenting on many of these issues as I reviewthe developments of the past year and the prospects going forward. In light of all these risks, monetarypolicy must be ready to move quickly in either direction should we perceive imbalances anddistortions developing that could undermine the economic expansion.Recent DevelopmentsA hallmark of our economic performance over the past year was the continuing sharp expansion ofbusiness investment spending. Competitive global markets and persisting technological advances bothspurred the business drive to become more efficient and induced the price declines for many types ofnew equipment that made capital spending more attractive.Business success in enhancing productivity and the expectation of still further, perhaps accelerated,advances buoyed public optimism about profit prospects, which contributed to another sizable boostin equity prices. Rising household wealth along with strong growth in real income, related to betterpay, slower inflation, and expanding job opportunities, boosted consumption at the fastest clip in adecade and a half. The gains in income and wealth last year, along with a further decrease in mortgagerates, also prompted considerable activity in the housing sector.
BIS Review   21/19992The impressive performance of the private sector was reflected in a continued improvement in thefederal budget. Burgeoning receipts, along with continuing restraint on federal spending, produced thefirst unified budget surplus in thirty years, allowing the Treasury to begin to pay down the federaldebt held by the public. This shift in the federal government’s fiscal position has fostered an increasein overall national saving as a share of GDP to 17¼ percent from the 14½ percent low reached in1993. This rise in national saving has helped to hold down real interest rates and to facilitate thefinancing of the boom in private investment spending.Foreign savers have provided an additional source of funds for vigorous domestic investment. Thecounterpart of our high and rising current account deficit has been ever-faster increases in the netindebtedness of U.S. residents to foreigners. The rapid widening of the current account deficit hassome disquieting aspects, especially when viewed in a longer-term context. Foreigners presumablywill not want to raise indefinitely the share of their portfolios in claims on the United States. Shouldthe sustainability of the build-up of our foreign indebtedness come into question, the exchange valueof the dollar may well decline, imparting pressures on prices in the United States.In the recent economic environment, however, the widening of the trade and current account deficitshad some beneficial aspects. It provided a safety valve for strong U.S. domestic demand, therebyhelping to restrain pressures on U.S. resources. It also cushioned, to some extent, economic weaknessin our trading partners.Moreover, decreasing import prices, which partly came from the appreciation of the dollar throughmid-summer, contributed to low overall U.S. inflation, as did ample manufacturing capacity in theUnited States and lower prices for oil and other commodities stemming from the weak activity abroad.The marked drop in energy prices significantly contributed to the subdued, less than 1 percent,increase in the price index for total personal consumption expenditures during 1998. In addition,supported by rapid accumulation of more efficient capital, the growth of labor productivity picked uplast year, allowing nominal labor compensation to post another sizable gain without putting addedupward pressure on costs and prices. I shall return to an analysis of the extraordinary performance ofinflation later in my remarks.The Federal Open Market Committee conducted monetary policy last year with the aim of sustainingthe remarkable combination of economic expansion and low inflation. At its meetings from March toJuly, the inflation risks accompanying the continued strength of domestic demand and the tighteningof labor markets necessitated that the FOMC place itself on heightened inflation alert. Although theFOMC kept the nominal federal funds rate unchanged, it allowed the real funds rate to rise withcontinuing declines in inflation and, presumably, inflation expectations. In August, the FOMCreturned to an unbiased policy predilection in response to the adverse implications for the U.S.outlook of worsening conditions in foreign economies and in global financial markets, including ourown.Shortly thereafter, a further deterioration in financial market conditions began to pose a more seriousthreat to economic stability. In the wake of the Russian crisis and subsequent difficulties in otheremerging market economies, investors perceived that the uncertainties in financial markets hadbroadened appreciably and as a consequence they became decidedly more risk averse. Safe-havendemands for U.S. Treasury securities intensified at the expense of private debt securities. As a result,quality spreads escalated dramatically, especially for lower-rated issuers. Many financial marketsturned illiquid, with wider bid-asked spreads and heightened price volatility, and issuance wasdisrupted in some private securities markets. Even the liquidity in the market for seasoned issues ofU.S. Treasury securities dried up, as investors shifted toward the more actively traded, recently issuedsecurities and dealers pared inventories, fearing that heightened price volatility posed an unacceptablerisk to their capital.Responding to losses in foreign financial markets and to pressures from counterparties, highlyleveraged investors began to unwind their positions, which further weighed on market conditions. Ascredit became less available to business borrowers in capital markets, their demands were redirected
3BIS Review   21/1999to commercial banks, which reacted to the enlarged borrowing, and more uncertain businessprospects, by tightening their standards and terms on such lending.To cushion the domestic economy from the impact of the increasing weakness in foreign economiesand the less accommodative conditions in U.S. financial markets, the FOMC, beginning in lateSeptember, undertook three policy easings. By mid-November, the FOMC had reduced the federalfunds rate from 5½ percent to 4¾ percent. These actions were taken to rebalance the risks to theoutlook, and, in the event, the markets have recovered appreciably. Our economy has weathered thedisturbances with remarkable resilience, though some yield and bid-asked spreads still reflect ahesitancy on the part of market participants to take on risk. The Federal Reserve must continue toevaluate, among other issues, whether the full extent of the policy easings undertaken last fall toaddress the seizing-up of financial markets remains appropriate as those disturbances abate.To date, domestic demand and hence employment and output have remained vigorous. Real GDP isestimated to have risen at an annual rate exceeding 5½ percent in the fourth quarter of last year.Although some slowing from this torrid pace is most likely in the first quarter, labor markets remainexceptionally tight and the economy evidently retains a great deal of underlying momentum despitethe global economic problems and the still-visible remnants of the earlier financial turmoil in theUnited States. At the same time, no evidence of any upturn in inflation has, as yet, surfaced.Abroad, the situation is mixed. In some East Asian countries that, in recent years, experienced a lossof investor confidence, a severe currency depreciation, and a deep recession, early signs ofstabilization and economic recovery have appeared. This is particularly the case for Korea andThailand. Authorities in those countries, in the context of IMF stabilization programs, early onestablished appropriate macroeconomic policies and undertook significant structural reforms tobuttress the banking system and repair the finances of the corporate sector. As investor confidence hasreturned, exchange rates have risen and interest rates have fallen. With persistence and follow-throughon reforms, the future of those economies has promise.The situations in some other emerging market economies are not as encouraging. The Russiangovernment’s decision in mid-August to suspend payments on its domestic debt and devalue the rubletook markets by surprise. Investor flight exacerbated the collapse of prices in Russian financialmarkets and led to a sharp depreciation of the ruble. The earlier decline in output gatheredmomentum, and by late in the year inflation had moved up to a triple-digit annual rate. Russia’sstabilization program with the IMF has been on hold since the financial crisis hit, and the economicoutlook there remains troubling.The Russian financial crisis immediately spilled over to some other countries, hitting Latin Americaespecially hard. Countering downward pressure on the exchange values of the affected currencies,interest rates moved sharply higher, especially in Brazil. As a consequence of the high interest ratesand growing economic uncertainty, Brazil’s economic activity took a turn for the worse. Higherinterest rates also had negative consequences for the fiscal outlook, as much of Brazil’s substantialdomestic debt effectively carries floating interest rates. With budget reform legislation encounteringvarious setbacks, market confidence waned further and capital outflows from Brazil continued,drawing down foreign currency reserves. Ultimately, the decision was taken to allow the real to float,and it subsequently depreciated sharply.Brazilian authorities must walk a very narrow, difficult path of restoring confidence and keepinginflation contained with monetary policy while dealing with serious fiscal imbalances. Although thesituation in Brazil remains uncertain, there has been limited contagion to other countries thus far.Apparently, the slow onset of the crisis has enabled many parties with Brazilian exposures to hedgethose positions or allow them to run off. With the net exposure smaller, and increasingly held by thosewho both recognized the heightened risk and were willing to bear it, some of the elements that mighthave contributed to further contagion may have been significantly reduced.
BIS Review   21/19994The Economic OutlookThese recent domestic and international developments provide the backdrop for U.S. economicprospects. Our economy’s performance should remain solid this year, though likely with a slowerpace of economic expansion and a slightly higher rate of overall inflation than last year. The stocks ofbusiness equipment, housing, and household durable goods have been growing rapidly to quite highlevels relative to business sales or household incomes during the past few years, and some slowing inthe growth of spending on these items seems a reasonable prospect. Moreover, part of the rapidincrease in spending, especially in the household sector, has resulted from the surge in wealthassociated with a run-up in equity prices that is unlikely to be repeated. And the purchasing power ofincome and wealth has been enhanced by declines in oil and other import prices, which also areunlikely to recur this year. Assuming that aggregate demand decelerates, underlying inflationpressures, as captured by core price measures, in all likelihood will not intensify significantly in theyear ahead, though the Federal Reserve will need to monitor developments carefully. We perceivestable prices as optimum for economic growth. Both inflation and deflation raise volatility and risksthat thwart maximum economic growth.Most Governors and Reserve Bank Presidents foresee that economic growth this year will slow to a2½ to 3 percent rate. Such growth would keep the unemployment rate about unchanged. The centraltendency of the Governors’ and Presidents’ predictions of CPI inflation is 2 to 2½ percent. This levelrepresents a pick-up from last year, when energy prices were falling, but it is in the vicinity of coreCPI inflation over the last couple of years.This outlook involves several risks. The continuing downside risk posed by possible economic andfinancial instability around the world was highlighted earlier this year by the events in Brazil.Although financial contagion elsewhere has been limited to date, more significant knock-on effects infinancial markets and in the economies of Brazil’s important trading partners, including the UnitedStates, are still possible. Moreover, the economies of several of our key industrial trading partnershave shown evidence of weakness, which if it deepens could further depress demands for our exports.Another downside risk is that growth in capital spending, especially among manufacturers, couldweaken appreciably if pressures on domestic profit margins mount and capacity utilization dropsfurther. And it remains to be seen whether corporate earnings will disappoint investors, even if theslowing of economic growth is only moderate. Investors appear to have incorporated into currentequity price levels both robust profit expectations and low compensation for risk. As the economyslows to a more sustainable pace as expected, profit forecasts could be pared back, which togetherwith a greater sense of vulnerability in business prospects could damp appetites for equities. Adownward correction to stock prices, and an associated increase in the cost of equity capital, couldcompound a slowdown in the growth of capital spending. In addition, a stock market decline wouldtend to restrain consumption spending through its effect on household net worth.But on the upside, our economy has proved surprisingly robust in recent years. More rapid increasesin capital spending, productivity, real wages, and asset prices have combined to boost economicgrowth far more and far longer than many of us would have anticipated.This “virtuous cycle” has been able to persist because the behavior of inflation also has beensurprisingly favorable, remaining well contained at levels of utilization of labor that in the past wouldhave produced accelerating prices. That it has not done so in recent years has been the result of acombination of special one-time factors holding down prices and more lasting changes in theprocesses determining inflation.Among the temporary factors, the sizable declines in the prices of oil, other internationally tradedcommodities, and other imports contributed directly to holding down inflation last year, and alsoindirectly by reducing inflation expectations. But these prices are not likely to fall further, and theycould begin to rise as some Asian economies revive and the effects of the net depreciation of thedollar since mid-summer are felt more strongly.
5BIS Review   21/1999At the same time, however, recent experience does seem to suggest that the economy has become lessinflation prone than in the past, so that the chances of an inflationary breakout arguably are, at leastfor now, less than they would have been under similar conditions in earlier cycles.Several years ago I suggested that worker insecurity might be an important reason for unusuallydamped inflation. From the early 1990s through 1996, survey results indicated that workers werebecoming much more concerned about being laid off. Workers’ underlying fear of technology-drivenjob obsolescence, and hence willingness to stress job security over wage increases, appeared to havesuppressed labor cost pressures despite a reduced unemployment rate. More recently, that effectseems to have diminished in part. So while job loss fears probably contributed to wage and pricesuppression through 1996, it does not appear that a further heightening of worker insecurity aboutemployment prospects can explain the more recent improved behavior of inflation.Instead, a variety of evidence, anecdotal and otherwise, suggests that the source of recent restrainedinflation may be emanating more from employers than from employees. In the current economicsetting, businesses sense that they have lost pricing power and generally have been unwilling to raisewages any faster than they can support at current price levels. Firms have evidently concluded that ifthey try to increase their prices, their competitors will not follow, and they will lose market share andprofits.Given the loss of pricing power, it is not surprising that individual employers resist pay increases. Butwhy has pricing power of late been so delimited. Monetary policy certainly has played a role inconstraining the rise in the general level of prices and damping inflation expectations over the 1980sand 1990s. But our current discretionary monetary policy has difficulty anchoring the price level overtime in the same way that the gold standard did in the last century.Enhanced opportunities for productive capital investment to hold down costs also may have helped todamp inflation. Through the 1970s and 1980s, firms apparently found it easier and more profitable toseek relief from rising nominal labor costs through price increases than through cost-reducing capitalinvestments. Price relief evidently has not been available in recent years. But relief from costpressures has. The newer technologies have made capital investment distinctly more profitable,enabling firms to substitute capital for labor far more productively than they would have a decade ortwo ago.Starting in 1993, capital investment, especially in high-tech equipment, rose sharply beyond normalcyclical experience, apparently the result of expected increases in rates of return on the newinvestment. Had the profit expectations not been realized, one would have anticipated outlays to fallback. Instead, their growth accelerated through the remainder of the decade.More direct evidence confirms improved underlying profitability. According to rough estimates, laborand capital productivity has risen significantly during the past five years. It seems likely that thesynergies of advances in laser, fiber optic, satellite, and computer technologies with oldertechnologies have enlarged the pool of opportunities to achieve a rate of return above the cost ofcapital. Moreover, the newer technologies have facilitated a dramatic foreshortening of the lead timeson the delivery of capital equipment over the past decade, presumably allowing businesses to reactmore expeditiously to an actual or expected rise in nominal compensation costs than, say, they couldhave in the 1980s. In addition, the surge in investment not only has restrained costs, it has alsoincreased industrial capacity faster than factory output has risen. The resulting slack in productmarkets has put greater competitive pressure on businesses to hold down prices, despite taut labormarkets.The role of technology in damping inflation is manifest not only in its effects on U.S. productivity andcosts, but also through international trade, where technological developments have progressivelybroken down barriers to cross-border trade. The enhanced competition in tradable goods has enabledexcess capacity previously bottled up in one country to augment worldwide supply and exert restrainton prices in all countries’ markets. The resulting price discipline also has constrained nominal wagegains in internationally tradable goods industries. As workers have attempted to shift to other sectors,
BIS Review   21/19996gains in nominal wages and increases in prices in nontradable goods industries have been held downas well.The process of price containment has potentially become, to some extent, self-reinforcing. Lowerinflation in recent years has altered expectations. Workers no longer believe that escalating gains innominal wages are needed to reap respectable increases in real wages, and their remaining sense ofjob insecurity is reinforcing this. Since neither firms nor their competitors can count any longer on ageneral inflationary tendency to validate decisions to raise their own prices, each company feelscompelled to concentrate on efforts to hold down costs. The availability of new technology to eachcompany and its rivals affords both the opportunity and the competitive necessity of taking steps toboost productivity.It is difficult to judge whether these significant shifts in the market environment in which firmsfunction are sufficient to account for our benign overall price behavior during the past half decade.Undoubtedly, other factors have been at work as well, including those temporary factors I mentionedearlier and some more lasting I have not discussed, such as worldwide deregulation and privatization,and the freeing-up of resources previously employed to produce military products that was broughtabout by the end of the cold war. There also may be other contributory forces lurking unseen in thewings that will only become clear in time. Over the longer run, of course, the actions of the centralbank determine the degree of overall liquidity and hence rate of inflation. It is up to us to validate thefavorable inflation developments of recent years.Although the pace of productivity increase has picked up in recent years, the extraordinary strength ofdemand has meant that the substitution of capital for labor has not prevented us from rapidlydepleting the pool of available workers. This worker depletion constitutes a critical upside risk to theinflation outlook because it presumably cannot continue for very much longer without puttingincreasing pressure on labor markets and on costs.The number of people willing to work can be usefully defined as the unemployed component of thelabor force plus those not actively seeking work, and thus not counted in the labor force, but whononetheless say they would like a job if they could get one. This pool of potential workers aged 16 to64 currently numbers about 10 million, or just 5¾ percent of that group’s population – the lowest suchpercentage on record, which begins in 1970, and 2½ percentage points below its average over thatperiod. The rapid increase in aggregate demand has generated growth of employment in excess ofgrowth in population, causing the number of potential workers to fall since the mid-1990s at a rate ofa bit under 1 million annually. We cannot judge with precision how much further this level candecline without sparking ever greater upward pressures on wages and prices. But, should labor marketconditions continue to tighten, there has to be some point at which the rise in nominal wages will startincreasingly outpacing the gains in labor productivity, and prices inevitably will begin to accelerate.Ranges for Money and CreditAt its February meeting, the Committee elected to ratify the provisional ranges for all three aggregatesthat it had established last July. Specifically, the Committee again has set growth rate ranges over thefour quarters of 1999 of 1 to 5 percent for M2, 2 to 6 percent for M3, and 3 to 7 percent for domesticnonfinancial debt. As in previous years, the Committee interpreted the ranges for the broadermonetary aggregates as benchmarks for what money growth would be under conditions of pricestability and sustainable economic growth, assuming historically typical velocity behavior.Last year, these monetary aggregates far overshot the upper bounds of their annual ranges. Whilenominal GDP growth did exceed the rate likely consistent with sustained price stability, the rapidgrowth of M2 and M3 also reflected outsized declines in their velocities, that is, the ratio of nominalGDP to money. M2 velocity dropped by about 3 percent, while M3 velocity plunged by 5¼ percent.Part of these velocity declines reflected some reduction in the opportunity cost of holding money;interest rates on Treasury securities, which represent an alternative return on non-monetary assets,dropped more than did the average of interest rates on deposits and money market mutual funds in
7BIS Review   21/1999M2, drawing funds into the aggregate. Even so, much of last year’s aberrant behavior of broad moneyvelocity cannot readily be explained by conventional determinants. Although growth of the broadaggregates was strong earlier in the year, it accelerated in the fourth quarter after credit marketsbecame turbulent. Perhaps robust money growth late in the year partly reflected a reaction to thisturmoil by the public, who began scrambling for safer and more liquid financial assets. Monetaryexpansion has moderated so far this year, evidently in lagged response to the calming of financialmarkets in the autumn. Layered on top of these influences, though, the public also may have beenreapportioning their savings flows into money balances because the huge run-up in stock prices inrecent years has resulted in an uncomfortable portion of their net worth in equity.For the coming year, the broad monetary aggregates could again run high relative to these ranges. Tobe sure, the decline in the velocities of the broader aggregates this year should abate to some extent,as money demand behavior returns more to normal, and growth in nominal GDP should slow as well,as suggested by the Governors’ and Presidents’ central tendency. Both factors would restrain broadmoney expansion relative to last year. Still, the growth of M2 and M3 could well remain outside theirprice-stability ranges this year. Obviously, considerable uncertainty continues to surround theprospective behavior of monetary velocities and growth rates.Domestic nonfinancial debt seems more likely than the monetary aggregates to grow within its rangefor this year. Indeed, domestic nonfinancial debt also could grow more slowly this year than lastyear’s 6¼ percent pace, which was in the upper part of its 3 to 7 percent annual range. With thefederal budget surplus poised to widen further this year, federal debt should contract even morequickly than last year. And debt in each of the major nonfederal sectors in all likelihood willdecelerate as well from last year’s relatively elevated rates, along with the projected slowing ofnominal GDP growth.The FOMC’s Disclosure PolicyThe FOMC at recent meetings has discussed not only the stance of policy, but also when and how itcommunicates its views of the evolving economic situation to the public. The FOMC’s objective is torelease as much information about monetary policy decision making, and as promptly, as is consistentwith maintaining an effective deliberative process and avoiding roiling markets unnecessarily. Sinceearly 1994, each change in the target nominal federal funds rate has been announced immediatelywith a brief rationale for the action. The FOMC resolved at its December meeting to take advantageof an available, but unused policy, originally stated in early 1994, of releasing, on an infrequent basis,a statement immediately after some FOMC meetings at which the stance of monetary policy has notbeen changed. The Federal Reserve will release such a statement when it wishes to communicate tothe public a major shift in its views about the balance of risks or the likely direction of future policy.Such an announcement need not be made after every change in the tilt of the directive. Instead, thisoption would be reserved for situations in which the consensus of the Committee clearly had shiftedsignificantly, though not by enough to change current policy, and in which the absence of anexplanation risked misleading markets about the prospects for monetary policy.Year 2000 IssuesBefore closing, I’d like to address an issue that has been receiving increasing attention – the centurydate change. While no one can say that the rollover to the year 2000 will be trouble free, I amimpressed by the efforts to date to address the problem in the banking and financial system. For ourpart, the Federal Reserve System has now completed remediation and testing of 101 of its 103mission-critical applications, with the remaining two to be replaced by the end of March. We openeda test facility in June at which more than 6000 depository institutions to date have conducted tests oftheir Y2K compliant systems, and we are well along in our risk mitigation and contingency planningactivities. As a precautionary measure, the Federal Reserve has acted to increase the currency ininventory by about one-third to approximately $200 billion in late 1999 and has other contingencyarrangements available if needed. While we do not expect currency demand to increase dramatically,the Federal Reserve believes it is important for the public to have confidence in the availability of
BIS Review   21/19998cash in advance of the rollover. As a result of these kinds of activities, I can say with assurance thatthe Federal Reserve will be ready in both its operations and planning activities for the millenniumrollover.The banking industry is also working hard, and with evident success, to prepare for the event. By theend of the first quarter, every institution in the industry will have been subject to two rounds of on-site Y2K examinations. The Federal Reserve, like the other regulators, has found that only a smallminority of institutions have fallen behind in their preparations, and those institutions have beentargeted for additional follow-up and, as necessary, formal enforcement actions. The overwhelmingmajority of the industry has made impressive progress in its remediation, testing, and contingencyplanning efforts.Concluding CommentAmericans can justifiably feel proud of their recent economic achievements. Competitive markets,with open trade both domestically and internationally, have kept our production efficient and on theexpanding frontier of technological innovation. The determination of Americans to improve theirskills and knowledge has allowed workers to be even more productive, elevating their real earnings.Macroeconomic policies have provided a favorable setting for the public to take greatest advantage ofopportunities to improve their economic well being. The restrained fiscal policy of the Administrationand the Congress has engendered the welcome advent of a unified budget surplus, freeing up funds forcapital investment. A continuation of responsible fiscal and, we trust, monetary policies should affordAmericans the opportunity to make considerable further economic progress over time.
1BIS Review   18/1999Mr Duisenberg evaluates the single European monetary policySpeech by the President of the European Central Bank, Dr Willem F Duisenberg, at theUniversity of Hohenheim, Germany, on 09/02/99.Ladies and gentlemen,The single European monetary policy has been a reality for a little more than five weeks. Afteryears of intensive preparatory work and successful economic convergence, monetary policy isnow jointly determined for a large part of Europe by the Governing Council of the EuropeanCentral Bank. The monetary policy is implemented by the Eurosystem, the name given to theECB and the 11 central banks of the EU Member States participating in Monetary Union.The single currency is quoted on the international financial markets and is used in non-cashpayments. However, the euro will not appear as yet in tangible form as banknotes and coins.Nonetheless there is no doubt that this currency, which was only brought into existence on 1January 1999, will play an important role both within the euro area and beyond.There is good reason for this confidence, ladies and gentlemen. Overall the first few weekswent smoothly for the single currency and the monetary policy of the Eurosystem. The startdid not pass by entirely without a hitch – which was not to be expected in any case, given thesignificance and scale of this project – but there were no major complications.Monetary Union is a unique and outstanding achievement. It provides the great opportunity toachieve the goal of lasting price stability throughout Europe. Price stability is the bestcontribution that monetary policy can make to lasting economic and employment growth inEurope. The national governments and all those involved in collective wage bargaining arebeing called on to remove the structural causes of the excessively high unemployment. Wecan only hope that the introduction of the euro will spur the implementation of structuralreforms.The stability-oriented monetary policy strategy of the EurosystemThe Treaty establishing the European Community assigns the European System of CentralBanks (ESCB) and thereby the Eurosystem the primary objective of maintaining pricestability. The Governing Council will do its utmost to fulfil this task and to explain itsmonetary policy so as to be comprehensible to the general public. For this reason we havedeveloped a stability-oriented monetary policy which essentially consists of three mainelements.The Governing Council has published a quantitative definition of its primary objective, pricestability. This gives clear guidance for expectations in relation to future price developments.Price stability is defined as an increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP)of the euro area of less than 2% compared with the previous year. The publication of thisdefinition provides the public and the European Parliament with a clear benchmark againstwhich to measure the success of the single monetary policy, and thereby provides for thetransparency and accountability of the Eurosystem and its policy.The wording “less than 2%” clearly defines the upper limit for the measured inflation ratewhich is compatible with price stability. I do not think I need emphasise that deflation – or a
BIS Review   18/19992sustained fall in prices – would be incompatible with price stability. The latest available datafor the annual rate of inflation according to the HICP for the euro area as a whole fall withinthe definition of price stability. This outcome is clearly the result, above all, of the successfulmonetary policy of the national central banks in the years before the start of Monetary Union.The ECB has only been responsible for monetary policy for a little more than one month. Itwill only be possible to judge the success of its current policy in one to two years’ time. Thisreflects the fact that the transmission of monetary policy impulses is subject to relatively longand variable time lags. The Governing Council has therefore emphasised that price stabilitymust be maintained in the medium term. This statement underlines not only the need for aforward-looking approach to monetary policy, but also takes into consideration the short-termvolatility of prices in response to non-monetary shocks which are beyond the control ofmonetary policy.In order to achieve the goal of price stability, our strategy rests, in particular, on two “pillars”.Before I explain this in more detail, I should like to emphasise that traditional and previouslyestablished macroeconomic relationships could change as a consequence of the introductionof the euro. This was one key reason why neither a monetary targeting nor a direct inflationtargeting strategy could be applied. Our strategy is also more than just a simple combinationof these two approaches. Rather, it is precisely tailored to the needs of the ECB.The first pillar of the monetary policy strategy is a prominent role for money. Since inflationis ultimately a monetary phenomenon in the medium term, the money supply provides anatural “nominal anchor” for a monetary policy geared to safeguarding price stability. Toemphasise this prominent role, the Governing Council has published a quantitative referencevalue for growth in the money supply. The first reference value decided upon by theGoverning Council for growth in M3 was 4.5% per annum and was published on 1 December.This value is based on the above-mentioned definition of price stability and assumes a trendgrowth in real gross domestic product of 2-2.5% per annum, as well as a medium-termreduction in the velocity of circulation of M3 of around 0.5-1% per annum.We shall not, however, respond mechanistically to deviations from the reference value formoney supply growth, but shall first analyse them carefully for signals relating to future pricedevelopments. Larger or sustained deviations normally signal risks to price stability.The second pillar of the monetary policy strategy consists in a broadly based assessment of theoutlook for price developments in the entire euro area. This assessment will be based on abroad range of monetary policy indicators. In particular, those variables which could containinformation on future price developments will be analysed in depth. This analysis should notonly provide information on the risks for price development, but should also help to identifythe causes of unexpected changes in important economic variables.Some commentators reduced this comprehensive analysis to an inflation forecast. At the sametime, there were demands for the ECB to have to publish these forecasts in order to satisfy theneed for transparency and accountability. Therefore allow me to make this clear: our strategyincludes a comprehensive analysis of numerous indicators and several forecasts. To focus on asingle official inflation forecast of the Eurosystem for a specific point in time would in no wayaccurately reflect our internal analytical and decision-making process. It would impinge uponthe transparency and clarity of the explanation of our policy. The publication of an officialinflation forecast would also be inappropriate with regard to the accountability of the ECB, all
3BIS Review   18/1999the more so if this forecast were based on the assumption of no change in the monetary policy.The success of the monetary policy of the ECB should primarily be measured in terms of themaintenance of price stability, not the accuracy of its conditional forecasts.The stability-oriented monetary policy strategy of the Eurosystem, which I have just outlined,constitutes a new and clear strategy. It emphasises the primacy of the goal of price stability. Ittakes into account the inevitable uncertainties concerning economic relationships inherent inthe transition to Monetary Union and the associated systemic changes and guarantees a highdegree of transparency.Ladies and gentlemen,Allow me to comment on certain suggestions on the orientation of monetary policy whichhave recently appeared in the press. Some of these ideas give the impression that monetarypolicy should concentrate upon objectives other than price stability, since stable prices havealready been achieved. Inter alia, it has been suggested that the ECB should react more or lessmechanistically to exchange rate developments or other variables such as unit labour costs.Furthermore, there were calls for monetary policy, by means of reductions in interest rates, tobe used to combat unemployment. Against this background there is a need to set out clearlythe possibilities and limitations of monetary policy.Both the reasoning in the Maastricht Treaty and many economic analyses show that the bestcontribution the single monetary policy can make to employment growth is to concentrate onprice stability. Without such a clear approach there is a danger that the public may questionthe commitment of the Eurosystem to the goal of maintaining price stability. Inflationexpectations, risk premia and thus long-term rates would rise. This would increase the cost ofthe investment which is necessary for a sustained and lasting rise in the standard of living.Even under the best possible circumstances, though – i.e. if it proves to be possible to assurelasting price stability – monetary policy alone cannot solve the major economic problems ofunemployment and future problems in social security systems.The Governing Council regards the current high level of unemployment in the euro area as amatter of great concern. This problem is, however, predominantly a structural one. It is mainlythe result of the rigidities in the labour and goods markets in the euro area which have arisenpartly through an excessive and disproportionate degree of regulation. Structural economicreforms, which target the reduction of rigidities, are the appropriate solution. In those euroarea countries in which such reforms have been implemented unemployment figures havedeclined markedly. In addition, I should like to emphasise that moderate wage developmentsand a reduction in the burden of tax and social security contributions would generally help toreduce unemployment. This would be the case even if the country concerned did not tradeheavily with its neighbouring countries. The positive influence of low taxes and wages onemployment clearly has overall benefits from an international perspective. Such a policyshould not be denounced as “wage dumping”.Turning to the role of exchange rates between the euro and other important currencies outsidethe EU, in particular the US dollar, the Eurosystem has, in formulating its monetary policystrategy, made an unambiguous choice. This strategy clearly rules out explicit or implicitobjectives or target zones for the euro exchange rate. The pursuit of an exchange rateobjective could easily jeopardise the maintenance of the objective of price stability and could
BIS Review   18/19994thereby also be detrimental to real economic development. Target zones for exchange ratescould, for example, lead to the ECB having to raise interest rates in a recession, despiteincreasing downward pressure on prices. I am sure you will agree that such a mechanisticresponse to a change in the euro exchange rate would not be optimal. Furthermore, it isimportant to remember that we are living in a world with high capital mobility. Exchange rateagreements, which might have been possible to implement until recently, are no longerfeasible.The lack of an exchange rate target does not mean that the ECB is totally indifferent to ortakes no account of the euro exchange rate. On the contrary, the exchange rate will beobserved and analysed as a potentially important monetary policy indicator in the context ofthe broadly based assessment of the outlook for price developments. A stability-orientedmonetary and fiscal policy, as stipulated by the Maastricht Treaty and the Stability andGrowth Pact, is an essential pre-condition for a stable euro exchange rate. Of course, there isno guarantee of lasting exchange rate stability, not even in a fixed exchange rate regime.Exchange rate fluctuations are often caused by structural or fiscal policy, asymmetric realshocks or conjunctural differences. Monetary policy would clearly be overburdened if it had toprevent such movements in the exchange rate.We cannot and shall not gear our monetary policy towards a single variable, whether a moneysupply aggregate, an index, the exchange rate or an inflation forecast for a particular point intime. Nor can we be involved in any ex ante co-ordination which would entail an obligation toreact to particular commitments or plans. The ECB will always carefully analyse all relevantindicators. In this context, it is particularly important that the economic causes of potentialrisks to price stability in the euro area are understood as fully as possible. Appropriatemonetary policy decisions also depend upon the causes of unexpected changes in importanteconomic variables. The Governing Council must, for example, take a view on whetherchanges in important indicators are of a temporary or permanent nature, and whether ademand or supply shock is involved. In our deliberations we also attempt to take into accounthow the financial markets, consumers and firms are expected to react to monetary policydecisions. I believe few would contest that such a complex analysis cannot meaningfully bereduced to a more or less mechanistic reaction to a few variables or a single official forecast.In addition, concern was often expressed that the Eurosystem would not act transparentlyenough. In this context, it was said that a transparent monetary policy also necessitated thepublication of the minutes of the meetings of the Governing Council and disclosure of thevoting behaviour of the individual members of the Council.For sound reasons the Governing Council decided not to adopt this approach. The publicationof individual positions could easily lead to national influence being exerted over theindividual Council members. The members of the Governing Council must not, however, beseen as national representatives. They decide together on the monetary policy for the euro areaas a whole. The Governing Council has committed itself to go beyond the reporting andexplanatory requirements laid down in the Treaty, which are among the most comprehensiverequirements by international standards.On the basis of our strategy, after every first meeting in the month I deliver to the press adetailed explanation of our assessment of the overall economic situation and, in particular, theoutlook for price stability. The content of this so-called “introductory statement” is very closeto what other central banks refer to as minutes. In this way, the public receives comprehensive
5BIS Review   18/1999information immediately following the meetings of the Governing Council. In addition, eachmonth we shall publish a detailed report on the economic situation and monetary policythroughout the euro area in our Bulletin. Such rapid information on the results of the meetingsof the Governing Council and the current economic analysis of the ECB without doubtdemonstrates a high degree of openness and transparency.The most recent monetary policy decisions and operationsCo-operation between the European central banks was always very close. In the last fewmonths of 1998 the countries participating in the third stage of Monetary Union co-operatedmore and more closely. The co-ordinated reduction in leading rates at the beginning ofDecember 1998 clearly showed that the currency union had begun de facto before the start ofStage Three. This co-ordinated measure contributed substantially – as we now know – to thestabilisation of market expectations.For more than five weeks the ECB has been conducting monetary policy operations, mainly inthe form of reverse open market operations. The main operation will be carried out at aweekly frequency with a maturity of two weeks. So far, five such operations have beenconducted successfully, at a fixed interest rate of 3%.Besides the reverse transactions which constitute the main instrument for liquidity control andtargeting interest rates, the Eurosystem offers two “standing” facilities: the marginal lendingfacility and the deposit facility. These can be accessed by credit institutions via the nationalcentral banks. The marginal lending facility is primarily a safety valve for short-term liquidityshortages in the banking system and thereby limits upward movements in money market rates.To some extent, its counterpart is the short-term deposit facility, which is used to absorbshort-term liquidity surpluses. This forms the lower limit for money market rates. For the startof Monetary Union the interest rate on the deposit facility was set at 2% and the rate on themarginal lending facility was set at 4.5%.As a transitional measure, the Governing Council decided to establish a narrow corridor of2.75-3.25% between the rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility from 4to 21 January 1999. The intention was to facilitate the necessary adjustment to the newinstitutional environment brought about by the transition to Stage Three. As alreadyannounced, on 21 January 1999 it was decided to return to the rates on the two “standing”facilities that were set for the start of the single monetary policy. Since 22 January 1999,therefore, the rate on the deposit facility has been 2% and the rate on the marginal lendingfacility has been 4.5%.A critical factor in this decision was the behaviour of the money market for the euro area as awhole since the beginning of the year. The Governing Council established that over time therehad been a marked reduction in the difficulties experienced by some market participants withthe introduction of the integrated money market and, in particular, with cross-border liquidityflows. All in all, the integration of the money market in the euro area reached a satisfactorystage only three weeks after its implementation. In analysing the money market it should benoted that, inter alia, there can be a marked difference between ECB interest rates and short-term market rates. On the one hand, market rates may include credit risk premia and, on theother, expectations may lead to differences between the two rates.
BIS Review   18/19996At its meeting last Thursday the Governing Council confirmed its earlier assessment of theoutlook for price stability. Therefore it was decided to leave the conditions for the next mainrefinancing operations, on 10 and 17 February 1999, unchanged. They will be carried out asvolume tenders at a fixed rate of 3%, the same conditions as for the last such monetary policyoperations.In addition, in recent weeks the first longer-term open market operations were conducted, inthe form of reverse transactions. These were carried out on 14 January 1999 in three paralleltender procedures with maturities of one, two and three months. The fixed rate tenderprocedure was used. By contrast with the regular main refinancing operations, the Eurosystemdoes not use these longer-term operations to send signals to the market and therefore usuallyacts as a price-taker. The ECB thus gives advance indication of the planned allocation. Theinterest rates which arise from these monetary policy operations should therefore be seen asindicators of prevailing market conditions.Regular assessment of the monetary, financial and economic situationTo conclude, I should like briefly to report on the Governing Council’s current assessment ofthe monetary, financial and economic situation. On the basis of these assessments theGoverning Council decided last Tuesday to leave interest rates unchanged.Taking into account the latest monetary data for December 1998, the three-month movingaverage of the 12-month growth rate of the monetary aggregate M3 (for the period fromOctober to December 1998) remained more or less stable at 4.7%. This value is very close tothe reference value set by the Governing Council. According to our analysis, the evolution ofthe money supply shows no risks to price stability. Credit to the private sector also grewstrongly in December last year. Although at present we do not perceive any inflationarysignals, further developments will be very carefully monitored.With regard to the broadly based assessment of the outlook for price developments and therisks to price stability in the euro area, monetary and financial developments can be seen toindicate a favourable assessment of the latest monetary policy decisions of the Eurosystem.They indicate that market participants expect a continuation of the environment of pricestability. Long-term rates fell to new historical lows at the beginning of 1999 and there was anoverall downward shift in the yield curve. Therefore, financing conditions for investment arecurrently exceptionally favourable.At present the growth prospects for the euro area are, however, still marked by theuncertainties relating to the development of the world economy in 1999. These uncertaintieshave had a negative impact on indicators of the economic climate in the euro area. There arewidespread expectations of an economic slowdown in the near future. This deterioration in theexternal economic environment can be linked, above all, to the financial crises in Asia, Russiaand Latin America. However, there is a mixed picture. While the growth rate for industrialproduction fell up to November 1998, retail sales figures and consumer confidence haverecently shown positive trends. Furthermore, growth in real gross domestic product in the euroarea was relatively robust in the third quarter of 1998. In the United States real growth in thefourth quarter actually turned out higher than expected. Measured against the HICP, consumerprices in the euro area rose by 0.8% in December 1998. This is a tenth of a percentage pointlower than in November. This development is in line with earlier trends. It can be linked, in
7BIS Review   18/1999particular, to a further decline in energy prices and a weakening in price increases in industrialgoods.All in all, the above-mentioned economic development and the available forecasts for 1999 donot indicate any noticeable upward or downward pressure on prices. Potential upward riskscould arise from a change in the external global economic situation and any associated effectson the euro area, via import and producer prices. These developments must be carefullymonitored. There is concern that inflationary pressure might develop in the event of a strongincrease in wage prices and an easing of fiscal policy. Developments in the exchange rate willalso be closely monitored in view of their significance for price developments.Finally, let me emphasise that the current level of real interest rates is exceptionally low. Ifreal interest rates are taken simply as the difference between nominal rates and the currentincrease in consumer prices (HICP), short-term real interest rates in January 1999 stood at2.3%, i.e. around 80 basis points lower than one year ago. Long-term real rates have falleneven more, by 110 basis points, and stood at 3% in January. These levels are very low,compared both with other countries and with historical data. In line with the safeguarding ofprice stability, the current monetary and financial conditions thus clearly support futureeconomic growth. Monetary policy can do no more than this without jeopardising the greatoverall economic advantages of price stability and its own credibility.Real structural reforms which increase the flexibility of the labour markets, as well as acontinuation of the moderate increase in wage prices, would not only ease the burden onmonetary policy but would also support employment growth. This will be all the more true ifthe deterioration in the economic situation this year is worse than expected owing to thenegative aspects of the external economic environment.
BIS Review   17/1999Mr Ferguson gives a 20-year overview of economic developments in Latin AmericaSpeech by Mr Roger W Ferguson, Jr, member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem, to the Florida International Bankers Association in Miami on 11/02/99.Thank you very much for inviting me to join you this evening here in Miami. It is a pleasure tobecome a member of the roster of Federal Reserve Governors who have addressed this joint meetingof the Florida International Bankers Association and the Miami Bond Club.My theme this evening will mirror the fact that international banking has grown significantly inFlorida in the more than 20 years that have elapsed since the passage of the Florida InternationalBanking Act. Many of you in the audience represent institutions that are active in trade financethroughout the hemisphere, and there is a natural strong link between Florida and Latin America.Similarly, about 20 years ago I studied Latin American economic development with Albert OHirschman, one of the great development economists of our time. Therefore, the topic I would liketo discuss this evening is what has worked, and apparently has not worked, in Latin America in thelast 20 years or so.The main message is that, after the 1980s debt crisis, many Latin American countries embarked on apath of greater economic freedom, lessened government intervention in markets and sounderpolicies. Those policies provided the basis for heightened economic dynamism and growth, andthereby led to significant benefits for their citizens, including higher incomes, lower inflation, and awider range of economic opportunities. In view of my audience today, I should also mention that,partly as a consequence of improved and more market-friendly policies, many of Latin America’sbanking systems are endeavoring to become more efficient, more stable, and better integrated withglobal financial markets. As a result, Latin American banks should become better able to support theprocess of stable, non-inflationary growth in the future. The current economic and financialproblems in Brazil should, if anything, reinforce the importance of pursuing sound fiscal andmonetary policies and improvements in the underlying institutions that support economic activity.BackgroundTwenty years ago, or by the end of the 1970s, Latin America was on the verge of moving from aphase of unsustainable economic activity – based on high domestic consumption, heavy borrowingfrom abroad, unsustainable currency levels, and excessive intervention by government in theeconomy – into a decade of lost growth and lost opportunities known as the Debt Crisis. As the1980s began, Latin American countries saw prices of their exports plunge, interest rates skyrocket,and access to international capital being cut back severely. In this harsh new environment, theshortcomings of previous policies became even more apparent, and economic performance faltered.Currency values plummeted as governments ran out of reserves, inflation soared, in some cases to asmuch as triple digit levels, and the output of the region contracted severely. Key social anddevelopmental priorities had to be scaled back as governments struggled to finance their budgets andfind the funds to repay foreign creditors. Domestic financial systems were thrown into disarray andmany banks were severely weakened, both in direct response to the shocks hitting the region, andalso as a result of misguided government policies undertaken in response to economic and politicalproblems. The main discussions regarding Latin America seemed most focused on issues ofhyperinflation, high unemployment, and repaying the external debt.Not surprisingly, under these circumstances, job creation during the 1980s was slow, many domesticbusinesses did not invest, and direct foreign investment was weak as well. These problems were notmerely the result of uncontrollable, external shocks. They also reflected the fact that manygovernments in the region were slow to enact the reforms that would lay the foundation for futuregrowth. In fact, in many cases governments responded to problems with policies that made things
– 2 –BIS Review   17/1999worse, not better, including wage and price controls, freezes on domestic interest rates, and adoptionof protectionist trade policies. These latter were in some ways particularly problematic, in that LatinAmerican countries in general did not focus on growing out of their problems through expansion offoreign trade. Trade flows during the period were relatively small, compared with what one mightexpect from economies of their size, and the trade that did occur was highly tilted toward rawmaterials and semi-processed industrial products.In sum, notwithstanding some bright spots, the tone of discussion regarding Latin America seemedbiased toward discussion of problems and not of opportunities.Current conditionsI cannot say that all of the problems of the late 1970s and 1980s have evaporated. Indeed, as isillustrated by the current situation in Brazil, there are clearly problems still to be resolved. Itcontinues to be important for Brazil to implement macroeconomic and structural policies that restoreinternational confidence and also reassure citizens that inflation will not reignite.However, much does seem to have changed with respect to Latin America during the interveningperiod, and the region as a whole, even recognizing the ongoing challenges of the current situation,appears to be closer to achieving the promise that it showed a generation ago. Most of the countriesin the region have experienced growth since the 1980s. Indeed, the growth rate of Latin Americancountries has averaged about 3½% annually during this decade.In addition, the scourge of inflation seems, in general, to have been brought under control. The costswere high, but the battle seems mainly to have been won. Admittedly, the worst inflation rates, atabout 40%, are still high by the standards in the United States. However, they are much reducedfrom those that existed 20 years or even 10 years ago. Last year, Argentina’s inflation rate was under1%. That is down from nearly 5000% in 1989!Knowing that many of your institutions are involved in trade finance, you know that the tradeoutlook for the region has changed significantly from what it was a generation ago. The annual totalmerchandise trade of Latin American countries has grown from $130 billion in 1978 to $522 billionin 1997. Even adjusted for inflation, this represents nearly a doubling of its trade, allowing thegrowth of Latin American imports and exports to roughly match the explosion in international tradeexperienced throughout the world economy during this period. Moreover, in many Latin Americancountries, exports have grown substantially as a proportion of total production, and the fraction ofthese exports accounted for by manufactured goods has also increased.Finally, Latin America has become an active participant in the flow of foreign direct investment andother forms of capital. In 1990, as the Debt Crisis was winding up, net direct investment flows toLatin America totaled only $7 billion; by 1997, this figure had risen to $51 billion. Portfolio capitalflows also have grown very substantially. Although they have been more volatile as well, netportfolio investment rose from $18 billion in 1990 to a peak of about $61 billion in 1993 and 1994,and were $34 billion in 1997 in the wake of the Asian crisis. Obviously, the current problemsindicate that participation in the global capital markets requires policy discipline and soundinstitutional structures, which many countries have put in place and others must continue to develop.Causes and lessonsAs with any macroeconomic performance, there are many causes for the general improvement thatmuch of Latin America experienced since the 1980s. The most general statement is that many of theeconomies of Latin America have adopted more prudent and open policies that foster competitionand participation in global markets. The adoption of these improved policies did not come out of thinair. They were born out of the disastrous economic performance of the region during the 1980s, and
– 3 –BIS Review   17/1999the realization that only dramatic improvements in economic policies would suffice to allow growthand prosperity to take hold.First, there has been a general acknowledgment, and recent reinforcement of the lesson, that prudentfiscal policy is crucial to economic stability, and several of the economies of the region have madesignificant strides in this direction. While much is left to do in this sphere, it does appear that manycountries have learned the benefits of prudent fiscal policy. Fiscal deficits in most countries in theregion have dropped, and in cases where they have not yet declined, serious attention towardachieving improvements is being mustered. Improvements in budget balances have not beenachieved without pain. In many countries government payrolls have been slashed, generous transferand subsidy programs have been cut, and social expenditures have had to be reduced. On the otherhand, the realization has become widespread that in the absence of such budget-cutting measures,employment and wages would become even more depressed. Moreover, people have found thatmany of the actions taken to cut budgets, including privatization of money-losing state enterprises,has led to better service and an improved quality of life.Second, there has been a substantial dismantling of the controls imposed by government over privatesector prices and wages. It is now widely understood that excessive budget deficits and moneycreation are the root causes of inflation, and controls over private prices have been generallyabolished. Governments also have largely scaled back their role in private wage negotiations as well.Public controls on privately contracted interest rates and other financial market prices also have beeneliminated for the most part. Finally, exchange rates in many Latin American countries have becomemore flexible, and where the government still intervenes in foreign exchange markets, there is agreater understanding that such intervention must be underpinned by appropriate fiscal and monetarypolicies.Third, the role of the government in other aspects of the economy has been substantially diminished,with an accordingly greater scope allowed for private activity and for competition from abroad.Internally, many countries have privatized major businesses. The privatization of Telebras, theBrazilian telephone company, is a prominent recent example, and privatization has proceeded evenfurther in other Latin American countries. Such privatization has in many cases been complementedwith legislation opening particular sectors to greater and fairer competition. Additionally, tradebarriers have been removed in many countries, often through participation in regional agreementsand broader international arrangements. The trade barriers that have been dismantled include bothtariffs and non-tariff barriers. In consequence, the share of foreign trade in economic activity hasincreased substantially in certain cases. Closely associated with increased participation ininternational trade has been increased participation in international capital markets, made possible inpart through substantial liberalization of Latin American financial markets.Finally, in areas where government oversight is important and necessary, progress has been made inimproving supervision and regulation. In particular, effort has focused on strengthening andmodernizing the region’s banking sectors, which emerged from the Debt Crisis of the 1980s in ahighly debilitated state. In consequence, banks have gradually risen toward a higher internationalstandard, assisted in part by an opening of domestic financial sectors to foreign competition andparticipation. Measured by various criteria, including capital/asset ratios and loan loss reserves,banking systems in various Latin American nations are significantly healthier than they were goinginto the Debt Crisis. While the region has further to go in strengthening its financial systems, andimportant problems remain, the progress achieved to date has been important to the overall recoveryof Latin American economies in the 1990s.Having said this, Latin America has been affected by some major international financial crises in thelast several years, and obviously Brazil is being affected currently. The lessons to be learned fromthese crises remain the subject of strenuous debate; I would offer only the following observations.
– 4 –BIS Review   17/1999First, appropriate and balanced fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policies continue to matter. The1994–95 Mexican crisis and the current stresses on Brazil both indicate that markets watch closelycountries that allow imbalances to emerge. In fact, in an era of open capital markets and rapid capitalmobility, the punishment for policy mistakes arguably is even more rapid and severe than have beenthe case in the past.Second, it may not be enough for countries merely to avoid excessive budget deficits or highinflation. Countries must take steps to reduce their vulnerability to dislocations in the internationalfinancial system, including by raising domestic saving rates, reducing excessive levels of short-termdebt, and increasing the degree of transparency and disclosure both in the public and private sector.Third, a healthy banking system is an integral part of participation in the modern financialenvironment, and also is a particularly important buffer against future financial shocks, bothdomestic and external. The question becomes how best to acquire such a system. Some countrieshave attempted to maintain a closed national system and build skills at home. Others have openedtheir banking market and allowed foreign competition to force the pace of modernization. Inpractice, the development of banking sectors is likely to involve some combination of local andforeign input, although increasingly, countries appear to be finding that foreign involvementprovides important infusions both of expertise and competition. As well, countries are discovering astrengthening of the systems of banking supervision and regulation to be an indispensable part of theprocess of modernizing the financial sector.Open questionsMany questions about how best to manage economies in an international setting are still open. Thefirst question is what is the best way to enter the modern world of rapid capital mobility. Foreigncapital obviously can be of tremendous benefit in helping economies to modernize and grow. At thesame time, the tendency of foreign investors to pull their capital out of a country at the same time, ashas recently been observed in various instances throughout the globe, can leave an economy inserious trouble. How can the benefits of foreign capital flows be retained while their adverse side-effects are minimized? Some observers have pointed to the Chilean experience with capital controls.These controls, which have now been removed, were intended to discourage inflows of short-termcapital, and along with measures to strengthen the banking system, may have helped insulate Chile’seconomy from the recent round of financial disturbances. The jury is still out on whether suchcontrols might be appropriate for other economies. It seems clear that their principal attraction is as ashort-term measure that helps an economy make a full transition to a fully open capital market.A second question is whether fixed or more flexible exchange rate regimes are more appropriate inan era of rapid capital mobility. In principle, more flexible exchange rates allow economies to adjustmore easily to changes in international economic and financial conditions, while fixed exchange ratesystems may be useful in instilling a greater degree of discipline on the part of economicpolicymakers. In practice, the experience of the past year and a half has taught us that systems inwhich exchange rates are only halfheartedly fixed – that is, where fiscal and monetary policies arenot geared toward supporting the currency – are the least sustainable and hence the least desirable.On the other hand, regimes in which economic policies are rigorously focused on maintaining anexchange rate peg may still have value in motivating prudent economic policies and in insulatingeconomies from international financial turbulence. However, fixed rate foreign exchange regimesand currency boards require considerable internal discipline to work as intended. The benefits arepotentially large, but the effort to maintain such a system and the risks associated with having toabandon such a system under duress are also large.
– 5 –BIS Review   17/1999ConclusionsTo summarize, much of the story of the evolution of Latin American economies in the past decadehas been a story about globalization. Globalization has operated on many different levels to improvethe performance and productivity of the region. However, participation in the global financial marketdoes, as we have seen, entail risks for countries that have not followed prudent policies. On balance,globalization clearly has been a strong positive force in the region’s economy. Latin America’seconomies are sounder, more entrepreneurial, and more dynamic than they have been in manydecades. And yet, grave problems remain. These include widespread poverty, tremendous disparitiesin wealth and income, and a level of per capita GDP that in many countries remains little higher thanit was in the early 1980s. I believe that these problems are more likely to be resolved throughcontinued participation in the global economy than by falling back on earlier models of economicdevelopment.In closing, since I am speaking to a group of bankers, I would like to reiterate the importance ofgood banks and good banking skills in contributing to the economic prospects for the region. Byfacilitating trade finance, providing funds for growing companies, and integrating domestic financialsectors into the global capital market, banks have played a key role in furthering the development ofthe Latin American economies. Latin American banking systems, benefiting in large part from risinglevels of foreign participation, are providing increasingly competitive levels of credit and depositoryservices, thereby laying the groundwork for future dynamism and growth. Healthy banking systemsalso are crucial to promoting economic stability. The recent experience of several Asian countries,where severely weakened banking systems helped contribute to financial crises, has reminded us thatgood banking skills and strong bank supervision are indispensable.Albert Hirschman’s wish for Latin American development, which is captured in the title of his book,A Bias for Hope: Essays on Development and Latin America, may eventually be fulfilled if theregion stays the course and pursues sound fiscal and monetary policies and the needed improvementsin underlying economic and financial institutions.* * *
BIS Review   16/1999Mr Bergo looks at the impact of the euro on the economies of non-member statesSpeech by the Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Norway, Mr Jarle Bergo, to the ScottishNorwegian Business Forum, in Edinburgh, Scotland on 3/2/99.At the beginning of this year we witnessed the implementation of the greatest monetary reform of thecentury: the launch of the euro and the final stage of EMU.Norway watches this great experiment from the outside, but we are not uninfluenced by it. On thecontrary, it constitutes an important change in the environment of our policy-making, especially withrespect to monetary policy. In addition, there are important questions concerning the use of the euroby Norwegian economic agents and possible implications for the Norwegian business sector,particularly the banking and financial industry.I shall try to address these issues. My basic proposition will be that in most respects the euro doesnot give rise to fundamentally new challenges, but almost certainly accentuates some that are alreadypresent.The euro and Norwegian monetary policyMonetary policy in Norway has been oriented towards maintaining exchange-rate stability for almostthe entire post-war period. When the Bretton Woods system collapsed in the early 1970s, Norwayjoined the European “Snake”. However, when the European Monetary System was set up in 1979Norway chose a link to a trade-weighted basket of currencies. In spite of the objective of a fixedexchange rate, several adjustments of the international value of kroner were made in the 1970s and1980s to compensate for the loss of cost competitiveness due to price and wage inflation.From the mid-1980s the focus of monetary policy was increasingly shifted to the role of a stableexchange rate as a nominal anchor – against the backdrop of very high price and wage inflation andrelatively high domestic interest rates following the devaluation in 1986. The EU countries’ low-inflation track record was used as an argument for pegging the krone rate to the ECU in 1990.The currency turmoil in Europe in 1992-93 prompted Norway to abandon the fixed rate against theECU in favour of a sort of “managed float”, now aiming at keeping the exchange rate “stable”against European currencies, but with no fluctuation margins. This regime is still in force.In this context it is important to note that the small and very open Norwegian economy is highlyvulnerable to fluctuations in the international economy. Furthermore, the petroleum sector is ofsubstantial importance to our economy, and mainland industries are largely commodity-based.Whatever the choice of exchange rate or monetary policy regime may be, there will be considerablechallenges associated with stabilising an economy which is that heavily exposed to cyclicalfluctuations.This has been amply illustrated by recent events. Whereas two years ago we were trying to fight offheavy appreciation pressures against the krone, we have since last summer seen quite the oppositetendency.Last year, the krone exchange rate moved on a weaker trend, in spite of continued governmentbudget surpluses and our still relatively healthy current account. As downward pressure on the kronegrew, Norges Bank raised its key rates in seven steps last year, in line with its mandate to stabilisethe krone exchange rate. In the course of five months, key rates were raised by a total of 4½percentage points. In spite of this, the krone has been weaker than its initial range vis-à-vis Europeancurrencies since last August. In this situation, the focus of monetary policy must be to adjustfundamental factors in a way consistent with a return of the krone to its target range. Of course,monetary policy can do nothing to reverse the terms-of-trade shock brought about by the steep fall in
– 2 –BIS Review   16/1999commodity prices. However, the aim to stabilise the krone against European currencies implies thatinflation over time cannot deviate from the inflation in these countries. If inflation is brought in linewith inflation in the euro area, a return of the krone to its initial level becomes more likely. Thus, inthe current situation Norges Bank must focus on relative inflation when setting interest rates. For thetime being inflation in Norway, although fairly moderate in absolute terms at just over 2 per cent, isconsiderably higher than inflation in the euro area. Narrowing this differential is a prerequisite forstrengthening the krone and is thus the best contribution monetary policy can offer in the currentsituation. There are, however, obvious limits to how tight monetary policy can be. Interest ratescannot be set so high that it results in an unnecessary severe economic recession and deflation,because that in itself would reduce the credibility of monetary policy and most likely weaken thekrone.Since August last year Norges Bank’s key rate has been 8 per cent – close to 5 percentage pointshigher than in the euro area. For the time being we find that our instruments are set in a mannerconsistent with bringing the krone back to its initial range over time.This illustrates the challenges of stabilising the exchange rate of a small, open, oil and commodities-based economy against that of larger, more diversified economies. Though a much larger economy,the UK has also over time experienced problems with exchange rate targets, most recently the eventsthat led sterling to leave the ERM in 1992 and orient monetary policy towards an inflation target.The introduction of the euro from 1 January 1999 did not in itself require changes in Norwegianmonetary policy. The euro could replace the ECU as the operational indicator of the external valueof the krone. However, last spring Norges Bank also reviewed the merits of a change in anchorcurrencies.Norges Bank found the potential benefits of changing the exchange rate target to a trade-weightedbasket to be relatively marginal and fairly uncertain, and recommended that the Government refrainfrom modifying the Exchange Rate Regulation. In the Revised National Budget for 1998, theGovernment affirmed this view and decided that the Exchange Rate Regulation would continue toapply without any changes, with the euro replacing the ECU as the indicator of the krone’s valueagainst European currencies. Thus, the consequences of the introduction of the euro for theorientation of Norwegian monetary policy might not appear particularly great at the outset. Thelaunching of EMU nevertheless entails changes in the environment for our monetary policy, for thefollowing reasons among others:First, the European Central Bank formulates its monetary policy with the aim of maintaining lowinflation for the euro area as a whole. Euroland will be a more closed economy than the individualmember countries used to be, and thus exchange-rate changes less important. This can result inlarger exchange rate fluctuations between the major countries than in the past. If so, keeping thekrone stable against the euro might become more challenging.Second, the launch of the euro will reinforce global financial integration and contribute to highercapital mobility, and the establishment of an efficient payment and settlement system in eurosreduces the cost of moving capital. Increased mobility of capital, both in and out of countries,including Norway, could follow.As I indicated earlier, we, like others, have experienced increasing difficulty in maintaining a stableexchange rate in a world of large, unrestricted capital flows. The relative calm within the euro areaduring the recent turmoil linked to the financial crises in Asia and Russia and later Brazil could beindicative of future differences between Europe’s “ins” and “outs”. Finland, despite its dependenceon raw materials and relatively large exports to Russia, was less adversely affected than the otherNordic countries. For Norway, success in maintaining a stable exchange rate could become morechallenging in the new environment.
– 3 –BIS Review  16/1999Use of the euro in Norway. Euro and the Norwegian banking industryUse of the euro in NorwayI would now like to comment on how, and to what extent, Norwegian economic agents might beexpected to use the euro in the future. There are many indications that the euro will be used moreextensively in trade between Norway and euro countries than the currencies of the 11 member statescombined today. Over time the euro will most likely be used on an even wider scale. Obviously, theeuro would increase in importance in the Norwegian market should Sweden, Denmark and the UKjoin EMU.The euro may also play a role – though probably limited – as a settlement currency betweenresidents. This will primarily be of relevance for import and export enterprises as well as sub-contractors in industries that are heavily exposed to the euro area. However, several factors point tothe continued use of Norwegian kroner among enterprises and households. Government paymentssuch as pensions, social security and taxes will continue to be in Norwegian kroner, as, mostprobably, will wages. Furthermore, Norwegian residents are not permitted to settle outstandingclaims in foreign currency in cash, according to Norwegian Foreign Exchange Regulations.Regulatory issuesNorway is under no obligation to incorporate EU legislation pertaining to the introduction of theeuro into Norwegian law. However, there has been some discussion as to whether it would beappropriate to implement some changes in the regulatory framework.One issue has been whether there is a need for statutory amendments to assure the continuity ofcontracts in which the parties’ payment obligations are expressed in ECUs or in one of theparticipating countries’ currencies. Norwegian law is considered to be clear on this issue, however,and in the view of the Ministry of Finance there was no need for legislative changes. In itsdeliberations on the Revised National Budget last spring, the Storting (Norwegian parliament) tooknote of this.Another issue is the possibility of keeping accounts in currencies other than the Norwegian krone.The new Accounting Act, which entered into force on 1 January 1999, provides for the registrationof accounting information in Swedish, Danish, English or Norwegian. Annual company accounts,however, are to be recorded in Norwegian kroner and in the Norwegian language unless otherwiseprovided for by regulation or separate decisions by the Ministry of Finance. The annual report mustbe written in Norwegian. Under certain circumstances, consolidated accounts may be recorded in aforeign currency. Accounts expressed in a foreign currency may also be published as a supplement toaccounts in Norwegian kroner.A third question was whether it should be possible to quote financial instruments traded on the OsloStock Exchange in euros and, if so, whether this would require changes in stock exchangelegislation. A broadly based committee appointed by the Oslo Stock Exchange has addressed thisquestion. The committee concluded that, although this situation may change, there is little interest inthe Norwegian securities market in quotations and settlements in euros. The committee found nolegal obstacles to quotations and settlements in euros. Consequently, the Ministry of Finance has notfound a basis for recommending changes to stock exchange rules. The Ministry of Finance has alsoconsidered whether conversion to euros should be regarded as realisation within the interpretation oftax legislation. The Ministry has concluded that the parties’ positions are not actually altered byconversion. The Ministry therefore maintains that assets and liabilities recorded in the currency of anEMU country cannot be considered as realised after that currency was replaced by the euro.Euro payment systems
– 4 –BIS Review   16/1999A common monetary policy in the euro area is contingent on cross-border payments in euros takingplace just as rapidly and efficiently as payments in national systems do today. All countriesparticipating in EMU are therefore linked to a common payment system, TARGET. In addition tobeing a channel for monetary policy, TARGET is, however, designed to enhance the efficiency andreliability of cross-border payment systems. TARGET is therefore used for settling both monetarypolicy and commercial transactions. EU countries outside the euro area are also linked to the system.Payment settlements using TARGET take place on a real-time gross basis. This means thattransactions are settled individually and with finality throughout the day. The system is also used tosettle net positions generated through netting of gross positions between banks.The TARGET system consists of the national settlement systems linked together into acommunications network called Interlink. Payments are transferred from one country to another viathe settlement system of the payer country, where the central bank debits the payer bank’s accountand credits an account of the central bank of the beneficiary country. In turn, the central bank of thebeneficiary country credits the recipient bank.There are several alternative systems for making cross-border payments in euros. The mostimportant are probably the Euro Banking Association (EBA) clearing system and the traditionalnetwork of correspondent banks. In addition, some large domestic clearing systems like Euro AccessFrankfurt (EAF) allow banks from all EU countries to participate. The participants naturally takesuch factors as price, risk and time into account when considering whether to make use of TARGETor any of the other options.The Norwegian banking industry has expressed an interest in having Norges Bank providesettlement services for a multilateral netting system for domestic transactions in euros. As an EEAmember, Norway participates fully in the single market (with the exception of agricultural products)and Norwegian banks are subject to the same requirements and obligations as those applying in theEU. Access to the common payment system on virtually equal terms is therefore regarded asdesirable and natural. Norwegian banks attach importance to being able to offer competitive euroservices, and a Norwegian euro settlement system could make a contribution in this respect. NorgesBank is pursuing this matter with the ECB. We have taken note of the solutions found with respect tothe non-euro EU members, including the UK.Developments in the Norwegian banking industryThe industry that will probably be most affected by the euro is the banking industry. The bankingindustry in Norway and other countries has undergone, and will continue to experience, substantialchanges as a result of technological advances, internationalisation, deregulation and changes incustomer behaviour. This has intensified competition and reduced margins, thereby prompting aneed for restructuring and reducing overcapacity. In addition to increased competition betweenbanks, new participants – both financial and non-financial – have contributed to increasing thepressure on margins. Securities markets have also become more important in terms of their role insaving, financing and risk management, adding to the pressure on financial intermediaries such asbanks.Like banks in other countries, Norwegian banks have had problems compensating for the decline innet interest income by increasing other income or reducing costs. Intensified competition bothbetween banks and from other financial market participants suggests that banks will in general befacing major challenges in the years to come. On top of this comes EMU, which will probablyamplify some of these trends.The euro will have varying effects on different market segments. The most immediate consequenceof the transition to the euro is the elimination of foreign exchange and hedging transactions in the
– 5 –BIS Review  16/1999currencies concerned. As exchange between euro-country currencies accounts for a very limitedshare of total currency exchange in Norwegian banks, this will be of little consequence.Two other areas that will be directly affected are international payment transactions and liquiditymanagement. International payment transactions do not represent a substantial source of income forNorwegian banks. However, it will be important for banks to be able to provide competitive paymentservices in euros to avoid losing customers.Foreign lenders today account for close to 30 per cent of all loans to Norwegian enterprises, a sharethat has been stable for the past five years. Thus far, foreign branches in Norway have primarilyfocused on the largest enterprises and financial market segments that demand more advancedservices. As the euro gradually gains a foothold in the Norwegian business sector, the Norwegianmarket may prove to be of greater interest to foreign banks. Nor can we disregard the possibility thatmergers and acquisitions in the Norwegian business sector – which may partly be perceived as aresponse to consolidation in the business sector in the euro area – will lead to a situation whereby alarger number of Norwegian enterprises move into the “division” where foreign competition isstrongest. Norwegian enterprises with close ties to the euro area will also demand a wide range ofeuro services from their banks. For this reason, foreign banks will probably compete more intenselywith Norwegian banks in the future. Technological advances, including the development of newchannels of distribution, will reinforce this tendency.Substantial overcapacity in the financial sector in European countries, particularly in traditionalbanking, has spurred the need for enhancing efficiency and consolidation. Over the last couple ofyears we have seen a considerable increase in the number of mergers and acquisitions in Europe,with mergers taking place both within and across national borders. The introduction of a singleEuropean currency has probably been an important catalyst in this process. Mergers and acquisitionscreate entities with ambitions, financial strength and, not least, a range of services well designed tocompete on international markets. This points to increasing competition across national borders.Several large Nordic bank conglomerates define the Nordic area as their home market, and haveestablished, or plan to establish, branches in most Nordic countries. The largest Swedish and Danishbanks have been the most active so far. A few of them, in contrast to other international banksestablished in Norway, have started to show an interest in the market for households and small andmedium-sized enterprises. The strengthening of the position of Nordic banks in their home marketmay partly be perceived as a defensive strategy to keep out large global banks. The launching of asingle currency in Europe may have been an important driving force.The euro is likely, at least in the short term, to be of greater consequence to the banking sector ineuro countries than in Norway and other countries outside the euro area. The loss of income in someareas, such as currency trading, is greater for banks in the euro area, and the costs associated withadapting systems, etc. are also higher. In addition, cross-border competition is likely to intensifymore between countries with a single currency than between euro countries and non-euro countries,although this is not certain. These factors point to a reduction in earnings for euro area banks.However, increased competition may in the longer term enhance the efficiency and competitivenessof banks.The introduction of the euro will also have a considerable influence on the development of securitiesmarkets in euro countries. There is reason to believe that capital intermediation via the securitiesmarket will increase at the expense of financial institutions. The elimination of foreign exchangerisk, greater price transparency and harmonisation of market practices will increase liquidity in themarket, leading to conditions similar to those in the US.Losing the advantage of operating in the national currency will result in keener competition insecurities markets for brokers, issuers, investors and stock exchanges. National ties will be of less
– 6 –BIS Review   16/1999importance as participants are drawn towards markets with the lowest costs. The integration of stockexchanges will increase. The Oslo Stock Exchange, for example, is one of several stock exchangescurrently evaluating prospective partners.The possibility that the euro may lay the foundation for a European market for private bonds shouldbe of interest to enterprises both within and outside the euro area. This market is large and welldeveloped in the US, whereas European enterprises have primarily relied on bank financing. Theintroduction of the euro will also result in a broader and more differentiated selection of securities ina single currency, while increased competition in issue and investment services will probably makeit less expensive to raise capital directly in the securities market. The elimination of currency risk inthe euro area will also enable investors to focus more on credit risk, thereby improving their abilityto evaluate this risk. This may make the market more receptive to private bonds, as investors may bewilling to accept higher credit risk when seeking a return. This factor, combined with lowerborrowing costs, may give medium-sized enterprises, which so far have had to rely on bankfinancing, increased access to the bond market.It should be emphasised that the expected increase in competition in securities markets in the euroarea is not solely due to the single currency. Technological advances, deregulation andharmonisation of laws and regulations are important forces contributing to a freer flow of capital andservices in the single market. There is little doubt, however, that the introduction of a single currencywill make a major contribution to accelerating this process.In sum, trends influencing developments in the banking and financial industry such as deregulation,internationalisation, changes in customer behaviour and rapid technological advances – leading tointensified competition – have been there for some time and will continue. However, theestablishment of monetary union will probably intensify existing trends, creating even greaterchallenges with regard to competition in the banking and financial industry.This brings me back to the basic proposition made in the introduction. In many respects, the eurowill not give rise to fundamentally new challenges. It is highly likely, however, that the euro willaccentuate challenges that are already present. And that, I think, goes for the UK as well as Norway.* * *
BIS Review   16/1999Mr Stals reviews the 1998 IMF and World Bank annual meetingsPresentation by the Govenor of the South African Resrve Bank, Mr Chris Stals, to the PortfolioCommittee on Finance in Cape Town, South Africa on 04/02/99South Africa’s position in the FundSouth Africa is one of the more than 180 member countries of the IMF and the World Bank Group.At this stage, South Africa holds a quota in the IMF equal to SDR 1,365 million (R9.3 billion). TheFund is now in the process of raising all quotas by approximately 45 per cent. South Africa’s quotawill increase to SDR 1,868 million (R12.7 billion). The total new quotas for all members add up toSDR 212 billion. South Africa therefore holds about 0.87 per cent of the total voting rights in theFund.Under certain conditions, South Africa can borrow its total quota (R12.7 billion) from the Fundunder normal Fund policies, but, of course, subject to the implementation of certain prescribedmacroeconomic policies. The Fund also provides a number of other specific credit facilities, e.g. theSupplemental Reserve Facility, the Compensatory Financing Facility, and the Enhanced StructuralAdjustment Facility, that members can make use of under certain conditions. At this stage, SouthAfrica has no borrowings outstanding from the Fund.The size of a country’s quota also determines its participation in the Special Drawing RightsScheme. Up to now, South Africa has been allocated a total of SDR 220 million. Under the terms ofa decision of last year, there will be a further allocation of SDRs later this year, when South Africawill receive a further amount of SDR 180 million (R1.2 billion).As a member of the IMF, South Africa has the right to be represented on the Executive Board of theFund (24 Executive Directors represent all members). South Africa joined the English SpeakingGroup of African countries for this purpose (20 countries), and is given an opportunity on a rotationbasis amongst the members of this Group to appoint an Executive Director to the Fund. (This Groupis now represented by Mr Jose Pedro de Morais of Angola, with Mr C.D.R. Rustomjee from SouthAfrica as the Alternative Executive Director for the Group. Two years from now, i.e. in September2000, South Africa will provide the Executive Director for the Group for a two-year period.)The main controlling body of the IMF is the Board of Governors (Ministers of Finance andGovernors of Central Banks of all participating countries). The Board meets once a year (the AnnualGeneral Meeting).The Interim Committee of the Board of Governors is an advisory board and has 24 members (one foreach constituency). This Committee meets twice a year and advises the Board of Governors onmajor policy issues. South Africa’s Minister of Finance was elected in October 1998 to represent theEnglish Speaking Group of African countries on the Interim Committee for the next two years.There is also a Development Committee, constituted on the same basis as the Interim Committee,but with the task of advising the Fund and the World Bank on developmental issues.South Africa is also a contributing member to the capital of the World Bank and its affiliates. TheWorld Bank has a similar institutional structure to the IMF. Our constituency is at this stagerepresented on the Board of Executive Directors of the World Bank by Namibia. Loans from theWorld Bank are, however, granted to countries on a completely different basis and are normallyproject linked. The Annual Meetings of the Board of Governors of the World Bank and of the IMFtake place at the same time (Joint Annual General Meetings).At the Annual Meetings, the South African delegation participates actively in:
– 2 –BIS Review   16/1999• the plenary sessions (three days);• the Interim Committee Meeting;• the Africa Constituency Meeting;• many bilaterally arranged private meetings, and• a series of social functions and receptions.Other meetings at the time of the Annual MeetingsThe confusion for any new participant in this annual event is substantially increased by numerousother conferences and meetings that take place at the same time. Of great importance are meetingsof:• the Group of Seven, and• the Group of Ten.South Africa obviously does not participate in these meetings.In addition, there is also a Group of Twenty-four, representing mainly developing countries fromAfrica, South America and Asia. This group is officially known as The Intergovernmental Group ofTwenty-four on International Monetary Affairs. South Africa is not a member of this Group, but hasbeen given observer status with an open invitation to participate in the activities of the Group.Many other (regional) groups also make use of the occasion to hold meetings in Washington. Lastyear, the South African Minister of Finance invited all the SADC countries for a short discussion inWashington.A new grouping that is now in the making is the so-called Willard Group, called together earlier lastyear by the American Secretary of the Treasury and the Chairman of the Board of Governors of theFederal Reserve System, for a special discussion on the world financial crisis. The Group originallyincluded 22 countries, being the major industrial countries and leading emerging market countries,including South Africa. At a meeting in Washington on 5 October 1998, three more countries fromEurope were also invited to participate. This Group, working through sub-committees in whichSouth Africa also participates, produced three interesting documents with proposals for improvingthe international financial system in respect of:• Transparency and Accountability;• Strengthening of Financial Systems (Regulation and Supervision), and• Managing International Financial Crises.The nature of the current debateLast year’s Annual Meetings took place against the background of:• the East Asian crisis and its contagion effect, first on other emerging markets, and later on theworld economy;• the serious eco-political situation in Russia;• the collapse of a major hedge fund in New York – Long Term Capital Management;
– 3 –BIS Review  16/1999• the growing threat of a collapse of the Brazilian economy; and• growing concern about a slow-down in world economic growth.At the Washington meetings, these economic problems were dissected from all angles; the causes ofthe problems were linked to: bad macroeconomic management; ineffective financial regulation andsupervision; the current non-system of international exchange rates; excessive gearing withinfinancial institutions; etc. Steps taken by countries and by the multinational institutions to managethe problem and to find solutions were criticised, sometimes for good reason, but often also on thebasis of illusory perceptions. The search for measures to prevent the recurrence of a similar situationin future started in all earnest.It is not possible to summarise all the discussions in this short presentation of today. I am thereforetaking a cue from summaries published by the IMF itself (after the meetings) of some consensusreached in the discussions (from IMF Survey of 19 October 1998).Apart from stressing the need for sound macroeconomic policies at the national level, a programmewas agreed to for further studies on the strengthening of the international financial system (the“architecture”). These further studies would be undertaken within the Executive Board of the Fundand would cover:• a possibility of strengthening or transforming the Interim Committee;• a code of conduct for fiscal policy, as well as the ongoing work on the code of monetary andfinancial policies (standards);• the need for greater transparency at all levels, beginning with the IMF itself. The IMF’s SpecialData Dissemination Standard should be expanded; systems for reporting external debt should beimproved; the operations of international investors should be disclosed in more detail; theFund’s surveillance operations should be expanded;• plans for an increase in private sector involvement in preventing and resolving financial crises;• introducing or tightening capital controls is not regarded as appropriate in dealing withfundamental economic imbalances. The IMF’s Executive Board was nevertheless asked toreview experience with the use of controls and the circumstances under which they may beappropriate;• the Interim Committee expressed its serious concern over the IMF’s tight liquidity position. Itstressed the critical importance of augmenting IMF resources; and• there was general support for expanding the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF)and the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. South Africa does not qualify for anyone of these facilities, although we have a vested interest in the proposal because of oursympathy for other countries in our constituency.It will be noted that none of these proposals are very revolutionary and are intended to work mostlythrough the existing framework of institutions and systems. More radical proposals are neverthelessalso being thrown around in the global debate, e.g.:• for a major revision of the present floating exchange rate system and a return to a more stablesystem for the global structure;• for a merger of the IMF and the World Bank in one organisation (a merger of the InterimCommittee and the Development Committee);
– 4 –BIS Review   16/1999• for the conversion of the IMF into a world central bank with a lender-of-last-resort facility; andeven• for a close-down and termination of the role of the IMF.South Africa’s role in the debateOver the past year the South African economy was severely affected by the adverse world financialconditions. Our approach has been to manage our economy as best as we could in this adverseenvironment, and to work with the international community to seek for a global solution. As one ofthe leading emerging market economies, South Africa has many opportunities to make a constructivecontribution to the ongoing debate on the reform of the international financial system. Unfortunately,we do not have the resources to participate more actively in all the discussions that are now takingplace.* * *
BIS Review   15/1999Mr Hayami outlines recent economic conditions in Japan and gives his thoughts on the roleof a central bank and its balance sheetSpeech by the Governor of the Bank of Japan, Mr Masaru Hayami, at the Kisaragi-kai meeting inTokyo on 22/12/98.I. IntroductionI am truly honored to have this opportunity to speak to you. I will begin with a briefoutline of recent economic and financial developments in Japan and then give my thoughts ontoday’s topic, the role and balance sheet of a central bank.II. Economic Conditions and Monetary Policy ManagementA. Current Economic and Financial ConditionsJapan’s economy still remains in a severe situation. Recently, however, the pace ofeconomic deterioration has moderated somewhat, thanks to increased public investment andexports. The decline in production has decelerated, reflecting some progress in inventoryadjustment. With regard to financial developments, the temporary increase in concern overcorporate fund-raising toward the year-end has eased gradually, on account of the government’sexpansion of credit guarantee system and the Bank’s introduction of new market operationsmeasures and lending facilities.Thus, there have been some bright signs for Japan’s economy. However, it is still unclearat this stage whether these suggest an escape from the current vicious circle, or just a pausebefore further hardship. The results of the December Tankan——Short-Term Economic Surveyof Enterprises in Japan——published in mid-December showed that the majority of firms stillhad a cautious view of the economic outlook.The key to economic recovery lies in whether private demand can lead to a self-sustainedrecovery of the economy while the public sector is underpinning it. However, given thecontinued deterioration in corporate profits as well as employment and income conditions,developments in business fixed investment and private consumption require close attention.Prices continue to be weak, reflecting a widening output gap in the economy. Therefore, it needsto be carefully watched whether or not the implementation of the emergency economic packageand other measures will have the intended effect of improving business and householdconfidence.In the financial markets, concern over credit and liquidity risks continues to exist. Onemanifestation of this is the market interest rates on instruments maturing after the fiscal year-endin March 1999, which are likely to remain high.Under these circumstances, the Bank will maintain the current decisive easy stance ofmonetary policy, and continue to do its best to support economic activity and financial stability.B. The Bank of Japan’s Balance SheetThe failure of some financial institutions in autumn 1997 was followed by increasedanxiety about the stability of the financial system, which has had a dampening influence oneconomic activity. The Bank has responded to this situation by implementing a variety ofmonetary policy measures, including an additional lowering of the target call rate on September9, 1998 and continued provision of ample liquidity under the relaxed policy stance.
– 2 –BIS Review   15/1999The Bank has also taken the following measures in its money market operations. First,the Bank has injected large amounts of longer-term funds to ease the upward pressure on marketinterest rates maturing beyond the end of the semiannual accounting term in September and theend of the calendar year in 1998. This has caused the Bank’s balance sheet to expand by about 40percent over the year. Second, the Bank has adopted some new measures to facilitate corporatefinancing, such as increasing commercial paper (CP) repo operations and introducing atemporary lending facility in November 1998. As a result, there has been a continuing rise in theproportion of private-sector debt to the asset account on the Bank’s balance sheet. Third, as partof its efforts to maintain financial stability, the Bank has expanded special lending since 1997under Article 38 of the Bank of Japan Law of 1997. The function of these loans, which is toprovide emergency liquidity to ensure financial system stability, has recently been taken over byloans to the Deposit Insurance Corporation (DIC).The Bank’s balance sheet has thus changed dramatically over the past year. The change isa reflection of the Bank’s constant efforts to combat the economic downturn and the increasinguncertainty about financial stability. However, the expansion of the balance sheet has also givenrise to a significant number of questions and criticisms focusing on a perceived threat to thefinancial soundness of the Bank. I would therefore like to devote the rest of my speech to a fairlydetailed examination of the Bank’s role and its approach to provision of credit, in light of thechanges in the Bank’s balance sheet.III. Extension of Credit by the Bank of JapanA. The Role of a Central Bank and Its Balance SheetBefore explaining why the soundness of the Bank’s balance sheet has become an issue, Ineed to refer to the mission of a central bank.In brief, the mission of the Bank of Japan, the central bank of Japan, is to issuebanknotes, ensure the functions of the currency, and contribute to the sound development of theJapanese economy. Perhaps “ensuring the functions of the currency” sounds a little too abstract.Specifically, the Bank must first ensure the stability of the currency’s value, and second maintainan appropriate framework for its circulation. Referring to these two requirements, the role of acentral bank is often defined as maintenance of price stability and financial system stability.On a day-to-day level, the Bank seeks to fulfil its mission by engaging in bankingactivities that are similar to those of commercial banks. When the economy is experiencinginflation or deflation, the Bank tries to restore and maintain a non-inflationary and non-deflationary situation——that is, a situation of price stability——by influencing the quantity ofmoney in circulation and the levels of various interest rates. The Bank achieves this objective byinfluencing interest rates in the financial markets. And this is done basically by supplying orabsorbing the appropriate amount of funds through the purchase or sale of financial assets. Suchactivity by the central bank is called “market operations.” The same is true of the Bank’sactivities to maintain an orderly financial system. When the stability of the financial system is atrisk due, say, to failure of a commercial bank, the Bank of Japan acts decisively to minimize theensuing disturbance by injecting funds into the system. The principal tool the Bank employs insuch cases is lending.As with commercial banks, the activities of the Bank are clearly reflected in its assets andliabilities shown on its balance sheet. For instance, when the Bank drastically eases money inorder to avert deflation, as is the case at present, the Bank increases provision of funds in the
– 3 –BIS Review   15/1999markets by increasing its purchase of financial assets. This naturally causes the Bank’s balancesheet to expand.The key question is whether or not people will trust their central bank and be willing tohold the country’s currency (including banknotes, which bear no interest). This depends onwhether or not the central bank’s behavior has measured up to the expectations of the people, andwhether or not it continues to do so. One source of clues for making such a judgment is thebalance sheet, and it is therefore natural that people in Japan and abroad take a keen interest inthe Bank’s balance sheet.The Bank’s balance sheet can be discussed from various perspectives. From theviewpoint of people’s confidence in a central bank, it is most important that the financial assetsthe Bank holds are adequate to secure the banknotes issued. This adequacy, I believe, involvestwo specific points. First, the Bank’s assets must be sound and its financial base must be solid——the latter means that the Bank must have a sufficient capital base——in order for the Bank tocontinue to act decisively as a central bank in total independence of intervention by a third party.Second, the Bank must have a sufficiently liquid asset portfolio to flexibly inject or withdrawfunds as necessary.I believe that the Bank’s balance sheet has also attracted growing attention in othercountries. Some observers have expressed concern over the expansion of the Bank’s balancesheet as a sign of deterioration in its assets. This may be because a rapid growth of the balancesheet is associated in people’s minds with an increase in nonperforming assets that need to bedisposed of at a substantial loss. But as I stated at the beginning of my speech, setting asidetechnical factors, the recent expansion of the Bank’s balance sheet is primarily the result ofactive provision of liquidity under the easing policy. Nevertheless, mere suspicion about anerosion of asset quality can be a serious problem if it undermines people’s confidence in thecentral bank and, in turn, in the national economy. Such loss of confidence could, for example,result in Japan’s commercial banks and firms paying an unnecessary premium when raisingfunds in other countries. That is why the Bank recognizes the need to be vigilant againstdeterioration in its assets. The Policy Board, the Bank’s decision-making body, constantlydeliberates whether the various measures implemented to fulfil the Bank’s mission couldjeopardize the Bank’s credibility because of the resulting changes in its balance sheet.B. Three Key Principles of the Bank of Japan’s Portfolio SelectionI will next talk about the philosophy that guides the Bank in portfolio selection——inother words, the key principles in selecting a central bank’s portfolio. There are three.The first principle is to maintain the soundness of the Bank’s assets. In other words,assets and collateral held by the Bank must be of high quality.The Bank has devised a number of methods to achieve this. When supplying funds tofinancial institutions through loans, the Bank acquires financial assets that are trustworthy ascollateral. When providing funds through market operations, it purchases financial assets fromfinancial institutions or other sellers based on repurchase (gensaki or repo) agreements. The onlyexception to this rule for market operations is when the Bank makes outright purchases ofgovernment bonds. Thus, the credits provided by the Bank are secured by the creditworthiness ofplural entities: not only by the creditworthiness of financial institutions to which the Bank lendsdirectly, but also by that of the government or the entities in the non-banking private sector,which are the issuers of the debt instruments. This approach is common among central banks. Atthe Bank of Japan, it is called “the double-name principle.”
– 4 –BIS Review   15/1999Where the collateral for the Bank’s loans and the financial assets purchased in marketoperations are issued by such entities as private-sector firms, the Bank assesses the eligibility ofthese assets according to its own criteria——that is, its internal ratings——and reviews it at leastonce a year. If a firm’s financial performance deteriorated, the financial debt of this firm wouldno longer be acceptable as collateral or as an instrument of market operations, even if it had oncebeen deemed to be suitable for such purposes.Of course, these measures alone are not enough. The double-name principle might reducethe probability of defaults, but taking a firm’s debt as collateral is not sufficient if the firm’screditworthiness is bolstered by the support of the commercial bank to which the Bank of Japanis lending. Nor is it desirable for the Bank’s assets and collateral to be concentrated in theliabilities of firms in a particular industry. The Bank pays careful attention not only to thesoundness of individual assets but the entire portfolio, ensuring that its assets and collateral arenot exposed to linkages of risk or excessive risk concentration.The second principle is to maintain neutrality with respect to resource allocation. If theBank held an excessive quantity of certain types of financial assets, price making and resourceallocation in the market might be distorted. In view of its role in the economy, the Bank shoulddo its best to minimize such influences. The supply of funds by the Bank of Japan in the contextof monetary policy management is aimed at influencing the overall level of market interest rates.Furthermore, provision of funds for the purpose of maintaining an orderly financial system isaimed solely at containing systemic risk and preventing disruption of the entire financial system.The third principle is to maintain liquid assets. The assets of the Bank must be such ascan be liquidated at reasonable cost whenever necessary. This is so that the Bank is ready torespond to any sudden policy decisions. In the management of monetary policy, if the Bank is tocontrol interest rates in rapidly moving financial markets, it must be able to acquire or liquidatefinancial assets instantly in order to supply or absorb funds. The same principle applies to itsprovision of funds to maintain an orderly financial system. Asset liquidity is vital to the Bank’scapacity to make flexible policy responses while maintaining the Bank’s financial soundness.Bearing in mind these three principles that guide the Bank in its selection of assets andcollateral, the Bank has made great efforts to adopt new market operations measures and reviewcollateral requirements to accommodate current policy agenda. One example of this isintroduction of new market operations tools to contribute indirectly to the development offinancial markets. Another is the Bank’s “New Measures for Money Market Operations inResponse to the Recent Situations in Corporate Financing Activities,” decided on November 13,1998. As stated in the press release, the aim of these measures is to contribute to facilitatingcorporate financing activities by devising new methods of market operations and lending.IV. Some Related IssuesHaving outlined the Bank’s principles, I would now like to examine its approach in morespecific terms by addressing some frequently asked questions relating to the balance sheet.A. Government Debt or Private-Sector Debt?The first question is whether a central bank should primarily hold safe assets such asgovernment debt. Some believe that holding private-sector debt reduces the quality of the Bankof Japan’s assets, and that the Bank should buy more government bonds.In fact, the Bank already holds a very substantial amount of government securities. Itsholding at the end of November 1998, including short-term securities (financing bills, or FBs),
– 5 –BIS Review   15/1999amounted to approximately \52 trillion. This, together with the government securities worthabout \5 trillion borrowed through repo operations, accounted for approximately two thirds oftotal assets. However, such a high ratio is not typical of central banks. In fact, the only centralbank having a higher proportion of government securities in its portfolio is the Federal Reserveof the United States. The central banks in continental Europe primarily purchase private-sectordebt such as bills and deeds in providing liquidity, and therefore government securities comprisea smaller proportion of their portfolio. The European Central Bank (ECB), which will administera common monetary policy for the countries participating in the European Monetary Union fromJanuary 1999, will also accept both government securities and corporate-sector debt as eligibleassets.Historically, the concept of a central bank dates from when the Bank of England evolvedfrom a commercial bank into a central bank. The traditional activities of central banks haveincluded provision of funds through the rediscounting of bills discounted by commercial banks.Thus, they have long successfully employed corporate-sector debt as collateral for supplyingfunds by adequately managing the risks involved, although this has not always been easy. Beforelarge-scale issuance of government bonds began in Japan, the Bank of Japan in fact made activeuse of corporate-sector debt, especially bills, in providing funds.The important issue in the portfolio selection of a central bank is not the choice betweengovernment and private-sector debt, but rather the avoidance of distortions in resource allocationin the respective financial markets. Based on this principle, the Bank intends to make greater useof selected, sound private-sector debt as market operations instruments or as collateral when itdeems this necessary to achieve current policy objectives, such as the development of newmarkets.B. Transaction CounterpartiesThe second question is whether the central bank should make direct contact only with thebanking sector, and influence the economy indirectly. Some argue that direct contact with thecorporate sector is undesirable in that it creates a potential for arbitrary behavior by the centralbank, or for the prolongation of the life of inefficient firms.This is a matter of principle of whether a central bank should limit its counterparties tobanks, or whether it should also deal with the non-banking sector.The concern seems to have originated in the Bank’s active use of private-sector debtthrough such means as expansion of CP repo operations, which may have given the impressionthat the Bank is excessively involved in corporate fund-raising. But this concern appears tocontain a slight misunderstanding. Although the Bank is indeed buying CP——which is a formof corporate-sector debt——through market operations, it buys the CP from financial institutionsincluding banks, and therefore the counterparties in its operations have not changed.Furthermore, the Bank does not specify the individual CP issues to be submitted, but rather thecounterparty financial institutions offer issues of their choice from among those deemed eligibleby the Bank. Purchasing CP is no different from providing commercial banks with loans on billsin the sense that the Bank supplies funds to commercial banks by refinancing corporate debt.However, it merits consideration whether participation in market operations and otherBank transactions should be made open to non-bank entities. If we look at examples overseas, itappears that the ECB will carry out its market operations only with banks. In the United States,however, the Federal Reserve conducts market operations with so-called primary securitiesdealers, many of which are securities companies that do not have accounts at Federal Reserve
– 6 –BIS Review   15/1999banks. A key point in considering this counterparty issue is whether the emphasis is on interbanktransactions or open market transactions. If a central bank primarily conducts interbanktransactions, the counterparty will naturally be the banking sector. Yet it seems that the globaltrend is a growing preference by central banks for open market transactions. In Japan, the Bankselects counterparties according to its own eligibility criteria from among banks, securitiescompanies, tanshi companies (money market broker-cum-dealers), and other institutions thathave accounts with the Bank.In the final analysis, I think that the rational solution to this issue is not to restrictcounterparties to banks, but choose them from a wider range of entities in order to achieve swiftand certain permeation of policy effects and adequate control of counterparty risk, while takinginto account such factors as changes in the financial structure. It is certainly essential that themoney market, where the central bank makes transactions, be sufficiently developed in bothqualitative and quantitative terms. In this regard, Japan will soon have a fully fledged FB marketwith the introduction of a public auction system for FB issues. As such open market transactionsexpand, leading to diversification of financial services providers, the Bank will review itsselection of counterparties in the Bank’s market operations.C. Corporate Bonds and EquitiesThe third question is whether the Bank should purchase corporate bonds and equities inview of the critical state of the Japanese economy. This argument is based on the fact that thestock market was at one time supported by the public sector’s purchase of equities. It is also theview of the advocates of such intervention that, if the Bank is concerned about risks, it can askfor government guarantees.First of all, I would like to emphasize that a central bank can create liquidity but notcapital. There is intrinsically a definite limit to the extent to which a central bank can take onprivate-sector risk. Assuming such risk and compromising the quality of its assets might impairthe Bank’s credibility, which is needed to fulfil its mission. This is why the Bank of Japan Lawof 1997, like the previous law, does not allow the Bank to buy equities, which are subject to largecredit and price volatility risks. Accordingly, the Bank cannot purchase equities and judges that itshould not provide funds in a manner that would involve a similar degree of risk. For the samereason, it also believes that it is inappropriate for the Bank to purchase corporate bonds outrightand hold them until maturity.Placement of government guarantees is not a perfect solution. Although this wouldreduce credit risks, purchase of corporate bonds and equities yet involves another problem——itmight lead to the long-term fixing of assets on the Bank’s balance sheet. For example, loansextended to the DIC are increasing rapidly, but the Bank cannot justify extending them for alonger term than necessary just because they are government guaranteed. The prolonged holdingof such assets would reduce the Bank’s flexibility in money market operations. Moreover, if thebalance sheet were left expanded, it would arouse concern about a decline in asset quality. In anyevent, the outcome would be an impairment of Japan’s credibility, which would force Japanesebanks and firms to pay unnecessarily high financing costs overseas.In view of the current state of Japan’s financial system, the Bank is prepared to providethe DIC with necessary liquidity in order for the corporation to perform its role effectively.However, I believe that the DIC should subsequently secure longer-term funds by swiftlyreplacing the Bank’s loans with government-secured bond issues or commercial bank loans. TheBank must always be ready to carry out flexible money market operations and serve the function
– 7 –BIS Review   15/1999of the lender of last resort whenever necessary. And for this, it is essential that the Bank avoidfixing the massive loans to the DIC on its balance sheet.V. Rebuilding Japan’s Economy and Financial SystemI hope my remarks today have been able to clarify some of the issues concerning theBank’s balance sheet. Before ending my speech, since the end of 1998 is only a week away, Iwould like to discuss Japan’s policy agenda for the new year and emphasize the Bank’scommitment to it.The most important task for 1999, given the current state of the Japanese economy, willbe to rebuild the economy and the financial system. The role of the Bank will be to workrelentlessly to (1) support the rebuilding of the Japanese economy by maintaining the currenteasy stance on monetary policy; and (2) continue to supply sufficient liquidity to ensure thestability of the financial system.The fundamental problem confronting the Japanese economy is not a shortage ofliquidity, but a shortage of capital and reluctance to take the risks that would help economicexpansion. The cure for these, as I have stated many times, is firstly to strengthen the capital baseof financial institutions and restore their financial intermediary functions, and secondly to actpromptly to create in the capital market an environment that makes it easier for investors to takerisks. As an essential first step toward improvement in these two areas, household and businessconfidence must be restored.In the currency field, January will see the debut of the “euro”. As a result, the world willhave three major currency areas——those of the dollar, the euro, and the yen——each backed byits own giant economic sphere. Overcoming the aforementioned problems is a prerequisite tomaking the yen more usable and reliable internationally, enhancing its integrity. This is anextremely important step in accomplishing further development of the Japanese economy byutilizing the world’s capital and innovative management techniques.To repeat, the priorities in 1999 will be to rebuild Japan’s economy and financial system,and thereby lay the foundation for a globally credible yen. The Bank of Japan is determined tosupport these efforts through its monetary policy and financial system policy.* * *
BIS Review   14/1999Mr Bäckström discusses the monetary policy situation in SwedenSpeech by the Governor of the Bank of Sweden, Mr Urban Bäckström, at Stockholm Chamber ofCommerce and Veckans Affärer on 2/2/99.Thank you for the invitation to attend this conference and talk about “The krona and the interestrate”. I shall be speaking mainly about the current monetary policy situation and the factors that maybe crucial for the policy’s future formulation. However, now that the Riksbank is directed by the sixmembers of the new Executive Board, which also makes the monetary policy decisions, thedecision-making process has changed. So I shall begin by briefly describing how monetary policywill be decided and presented in this new environment.The new process for monetary policy decisionsAt 1pm on Thursday 11 February, the new Executive Board of the Riksbank will be convening forits first meeting specifically devoted to monetary policy. Compared with the Board’s ordinarysessions, the discussion at what are called monetary policy meetings is to cover monetary policymore comprehensively and conclude with a decision on the policy’s future stance. The discussionwill be minuted and published in this form on 6April, around eight weeks after the event. Moreover,a brief account of the grounds for the decision will be presented in a communiqué on the day afterthe meeting, in this case at 9.30am on Friday 12 February.These monetary policy meetings will be held 8–10 times a year and the minutes will be publishedwith a time lag of 6–8 weeks. Monetary policy matters may, of course, appear on the agenda in theintervals between these meetings, particularly as repo rate decisions are normally made once afortnight and announced for the coming two weeks. In the normal course of events, however, it isenvisaged that repo rate decisions will be based on the discussions at monetary policy meetings. So itis only under special circumstances that monetary policy will need to be discussed morecomprehensively in between the meetings specifically reserved for this.For the Riksbank, this is a new procedure. The time when decisions will be announced is also new.In future, monetary policy decisions will be published on Fridays at 9.30am, though there may beexceptions to this rule in certain cases, such as the publication of the Inflation Report. Judging fromtheir newsletters, it seems to me that so far most market players have understood our newarrangements. That is a good thing and also important.There may be situations in which members of the Executive Board reach divergent conclusions. Thatwill necessitate a more formal voting procedure. The outcome will be recorded in the minutes. Nomention of a vote indicates that the Board agreed unanimously; otherwise, members with dissentingopinions will be named.Disagreement on the Executive Board is clearly not something that is desirable as such. I am, indeed,convinced that each of the six members will aim for as collegiate an attitude as possible. To me, thisis already evident from the work to date. But it is also the case that, in making monetary policy, avariety of factors have to be weighted into an overall assessment of inflation’s future path. Inweighing up the odds, different people may reach different conclusions, which need not be anentirely bad thing. It might even have the advantage of demonstrating that decisions on the monetarypolicy stance tend to involve assessments that are complex and tricky.From interviews and comments in the press, it is already evident that members of the ExecutiveBoard voice somewhat different shades of opinion in their inflation assessments. This, too, issomething that all those who follow monetary policy will have to get used to. It is, moreover, anassurance that our discussions in the Riksbank will be properly informed about aspects of the
– 2 –BIS Review   14/1999monetary policy stance. It is also consistent with the transparency that the Riksbank is striving forand which is a basic condition for the new legislation.The monetary policy situationSweden’s economy in perspectiveIn the years since the crisis in the early 1990s, economic development in Sweden has been rathergood. Growth has been relatively high, yet inflation has been kept at a low level. Since summer1993, annual GDP growth has averaged almost 3%. In other words, Sweden is now in the sixth yearof favourable economic growth. The 3% average is much the same as during the upswing in the1980s but clearly above the annual average of 2% achieved in the 20 years from 1970 to 1990. Itmay be more than we can expect to sustain in the long run.An important reason why it has still been possible to keep inflation down in recent years has beenthe existence of unutilised capacity. This in turn has to do with the deep recession from which therecovery started and the comparatively rapid expansion of capacity since then. Medium-terminflation expectations have gradually stabilised around the 2% inflation target.At times, however, including the recent period, transitory price movements have brought the annualaverage change in the CPI just outside the lower limit of the target’s tolerance interval. There haveeven been periods when trend inflation has been lower than expected. For the decision-making ofmonetary policy, as the Riksbank has pointed out earlier, transitory effects on inflation are normallya secondary consideration. We are working to clarify how the target formulation is applied in orderto dispel any uncertainty about how we should appraise direct effects on consumer prices that comefrom movements in, for example, house mortgage interest costs and indirect taxes.Altered conditions for international developmentsLast autumn, in the September Inflation Report, the Riksbank pointed to a growing risk of a weakerinternational trend on account of the crisis in Asia. However, the outlook was complicated by amarked weakening of the krona, which could have a contrary effect on inflation.The exchange rate influences inflation via the level of resource utilisation and via the developmentof import prices; in the past two years the impact has come mainly from the first of these twomechanisms. As the effects on import prices should be regarded as transitory, they are of secondaryimportance for the monetary stance provided they do not alter expectations of inflation in themedium term. In other words, exchange rate movements are relevant only if they affect inflation’sfuture trend though, for a small, open economy, exchange rate stability is, indeed, desirable.In September and part of October last year, immediately before and after the publication of theReport, the monetary policy environment was turbulent and difficult to assess. Besides theinternational unrest, it was uncertain how fiscal policy would be constructed after the generalelection. All this prompted the Riksbank to keep the repo rate unchanged. The possibility of a reporate cut would be considered when inflation prospects had become clearer.During the autumn the financial unrest grew. The suspension of debt payments by the Russiangovernment in mid-August, followed by the problems in the US hedge fund Long-Term CapitalManagement that came to light at the end of September, contributed to the markedly more nervousmood. Stock markets fell around the world and the financial crisis spread to other emerging marketsthat had previously not been hit. The lower share prices and the contagious spread of the crisis toother markets were liable to have consequences via decreased demand for exports from theindustrialised countries, as well as via more cautious behaviour among their consumers and firms.
– 3 –BIS Review   14/1999The problems in LTCM also aroused fears of a considerably more serious scenario where banks inthe industrialised countries became so cautious about granting credit that this would paralyse globaleconomic activity.As the signs of an international slowdown became increasingly clear and were accentuated by thegrowing turbulence in financial markets, the Riksbank revised its assessment of the Swedisheconomy and the path of inflation. This warranted some easing of the monetary stance. In Novemberthe repo rate was therefore lowered in two steps, from 4.10 to 3.60%.In the December Inflation Report it was still considered that in one to two years’ time, both thechange in the CPI and the underlying rate of inflation would be below the Riksbank’s 2% target forprice stability. On 16 December the repo rate was therefore lowered another 0.2 percentage points, to3.40%. After this adjustment, responsibility for the future formulation of monetary policy passed tothe Riksbank’s new Executive Board, which would be taking over from the turn of the year.Strong finish to 1998Most signs suggest that activity in the Swedish economy was fairly strong in the latter part of 1998.GDP figures have still to be published but the available statistics point to a good fourth quarter. Thestrong trend is mainly due to the expansion of domestic sectors, not least in retailing. Thedevelopment is not dramatic but Statistics Sweden does report a 12-month increase in retail sales of3.3% in November. According to the Wholesale & Retail Research Institute, this was followed by agood Christmas season. The contribution to growth from investment also seems to have beenfavourable. As a result of all this, employment is rising more markedly than in recent years and thisin turn led to a drop in unemployment during 1998.Current inflationary pressure is still low. The rate of CPI inflation remains negative and theDecember out-turn was lower than expected: the level of consumer prices dropped 0.6% fromDecember 1997, as against the fall of 0.3% that had been foreseen in the Riksbank’s latest InflationReport. However, this is partly a consequence of the Riksbank’s repo rate cuts, which have broughthouse mortgage rates down. So while we lowered the repo rate in the light of favourable inflationprospects, the cuts have had the initial effect of depressing CPI inflation even more. This has beenaccompanied by a further decline in commodity prices. But underlying domestic inflation(UNDINHX) in December was unchanged from the preceding month at 1.6%, though this was stillsomewhat below our forecast.US equity prices a possible riskThe global financial unrest subsided towards the end of 1998. Interest rate differentials betweendifferent market segments narrowed again and stock markets stopped falling. This made it lessprobable that the global economy would remain weak for a number of years.Recent developments in Brazil have contributed to some recurrence of unrest in internationalfinancial markets. Once again there has been an international flight to securer assets but it has beenmore limited than last autumn. There has, however, been a substantial depreciation of the Braziliancurrency.It is still difficult to tell just how crisis in Brazil may affect the world economy. The future course inBrazil, with the attendant risks of knock-on effects in Latin American and other parts of the globe,will depend on what the national authorities do to construct a sound foundation for the economy. Ithas been shown, not least by our own economic experience in the early 1990s, that changing from afixed to a floating exchange rate does not by itself provide a lasting solution to economic problems.What is needed is rather a comprehensive programme for enhancing confidence, with budget policyas not the least important component. A clear target and a consistent approach in monetary policy
– 4 –BIS Review   14/1999can also contribute to economic policy’s credibility. But it does seem likely that developments todate in Brazil will tend to subdue growth in Latin America and even to some extent in the OECDarea as a whole.Despite the unusually long duration of the US economy’s upward phase, the situation there is stillbuoyant. Growth in the closing months of 1998 was very strong. However, some slowdown isforeseen, partly because of a weak international trend but also due to subdued consumption. Thehigh level of equity prices has been cited as a risk to US economic development. US stock marketshave recovered completely from last autumn’s fall and new all-time highs have been noted. Equityprices are considered by many observers to be unduly high in relation to the companies’ profitexpectations and there has been talk of a future correction. Given the importance of the share pricerise for the US economy’s upward trend, a price fall could by the same token lead to a slowdown.Prospects for the euro area as well as for the Japanese economy seem to have become somewhatpoorer since the December Report, at least for the coming year. In the euro area, it is mainlymanufacturing which has weakened, while the consumption trend still looks relatively good. At thesame time, household sentiment is closely related to the development of employment, not least inGermany.Thus, the international outlook can hardly be said to have improved since the publication of theDecember Report and there still seem to be risks of a development that is weaker.Industrial activity weaker but domestic demand good so farTurning to the Swedish economy, the statistics suggest that industrial activity may go on weakening.But households’ expectations of their own economy indicate that private consumption may remainrelatively strong. Increased employment and a good development of real disposable income, not leastas a consequence of low inflation, are grounds for households’ optimism.The duration of this trend is, however, uncertain, as it was last autumn. One question lies in thedifferences between households and firms in their assessments of the future. Negative news from thecorporate sector could make households more pessimistic. Recently, moreover, there have beencertain tendencies for households to become somewhat less optimistic about their own economicfuture.The picture of total resource utilisation suggests that the Swedish economy still has unutilisedresources. This in turn acts as a damper on inflation.The weaker activity in manufacturing has led to a fall-off in net exports. If earlier cyclical patternsstill hold, stockbuilding may be heading for a downturn. Moreover, if manufacturing remains weak,there could be some slackening of investment later this year. The rate of GDP growth this and nextyear will thus depend on the extent to which domestic demand makes up for the development offoreign trade and industrial activity.When assessing future inflationary pressure, however, a point to bear in mind is that the past year’scomparatively sharp fall in market interest rates is exerting a stimulatory effect on the Swedisheconomy. Since January last year the 10-year bond rate has moved down almost 2% and the short-term interest rate has fallen more than 1%. As only part of the effects of this have probably beentransmitted to date by various mechanisms, allowance should still be made for some effects in thefuture.The Executive Board’s monetary policy discussion on 11 February will thus focus to a large extenton assessing global economic prospects and their consequences for Sweden’s economy. Other
– 5 –BIS Review   14/1999questions will be the durability of the positive trend for domestic sectors and how the relationshipbetween demand and supply will affect the development of prices.Monetary policy’s focus on price stability is important in the context of economic stability. Whilethe possibility of fine-tuning an economy should not be exaggerated, a policy for price stabilityshould normally lead to a real economic development that is also balanced.The Riksbank’s representatives continuously talk about the prospects for inflation; however, thequestion we are trying to analyse could equally well be put like this: how should the Riksbankhandle the repo rate so that the Swedish economy’s favourable path in recent years is maintained?* * *
1BIS Review   77/1999Mr Heikensten talks about the interaction between monetary and fiscal policy and labourmarket developmentsSpeech by Lars Heikensten, First Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, the Swedish centralbank, to the Landskrona Municipality in Landskrona, Sweden on 16 June 1999.For more than six years now, monetary policy in Sweden has been conducted with an inflation target.Sweden was one of the first countries, together with Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom,for example, to adopt an inflation targeting strategy. Other countries have recently displayed aninterest in targeting inflation directly as the guideline for monetary policy. Examples are countrieswith strong economic growth in Asia, South America and Eastern Europe.In many respects, Sweden’s period with an inflation target has been one of good economic results.Inflation and interest rates have come down to levels that are historically low and growth since thecrisis in the early 1990s has been relatively high and stable. Part of the explanation is, of course, thatthe recession left us with plenty of unutilised resources. But new production capacity has also beencreated at a rapid rate. Moreover, inflation expectations have been lowered, which gives a new andbetter environment for price and wage formation. International inflation has also been low. Thepicture of unemployment is more disappointing, though here too the recent trend points in the rightdirection.Monetary policy, however, is just one of the factors that are important for economic development.Two crucial matters for economic development in general and thereby for the conditions underlyingmonetary policy are the situation in the labour market and fiscal policy. In recent years it is not leastthe construction of fiscal policy that has contributed to the good economic performance.The interaction of fiscal and monetary policy has been debated a good deal of late. Income tax cutshave been discussed, for instance. Now that Sweden’s economy seems to be moving into a strongerphase, in large measure as a result of higher domestic activity, it is of the utmost importance that wedo not land in a situation with wage drift and overheating as a consequence of an unduly expansionaryfiscal stance. Against this background, I shall be talking today about the conditions for monetarypolicy and its interaction with fiscal policy and labour market developments.036912158082848688909294969803691215-3-2-101234568082848688909294969800-3-2-10123456Growth and inflation in OECD andSweden 1999 and 2000 forecastPercentage annual changeSource: OECDSwedenOECD*SwedenOECDGrowthInflation* excluding hihginflation countries
BIS Review   77/19992Interaction with fiscal policyFiscal policy affects the chances of success in monetary policy in various ways: via its impact ongeneral confidence in monetary policy, via short-run effects on demand and by modifying the long-term conditions for economic growth and low inflation.Let me begin with credibility. If the direction of fiscal policy is perceived as being unsustainable inthe longer run, economic policy’s overall focus on low inflation and stable growth is liable to bequestioned. Few industrialised countries have experienced this as recently and tangibly as Sweden.The massive budget deficits in the early 1990s, with rapidly accumulating government debt, madeSweden’s economic future uncertain and pushed interest rates up. With the consolidation ofgovernment finances, however, and the long-term ambitions for fiscal policy that the Government,supported by the Riksdag (Sweden’s Parliament), has presented, confidence has improved.The new budget process — with a moving budget ceiling and a budget surplus of 2 per cent of GDPas a medium-term target — means that the Government and the Riksdag have set up a clear set ofrules to show that Sweden has no intention of relapsing into earlier habits. There is nothing fortuitousabout these rules. But the purpose of the budget ceiling and the budget target as confidence-enhancinginstruments does presuppose that they are observed consistently and continuously over the businesscycle.Changes in fiscal policy also affect monetary policy through their direct impact on demand. Thedebate in recent weeks has focused not least on these effects. An adjustment of income tax or oftransfers to households alters disposable income and thereby private consumption. Similarly, a changein corporate tax or transfers to firms affects company profits and thereby investment and othereconomic decisions. Activity in the economy may also be affected if the government decides to spendmore on public sector consumption or investment.This makes fiscal policy a factor of importance when assessing economic activity and futureinflationary pressure. At the same time, the changes that are generated do not lend themselves tomechanical calculations. Part of the reason is that the path of inflation is determined by other factorsbesides fiscal policy.A third important aspect of fiscal policy’s interaction with inflation has to do with fiscal effects onpotential output. Lower tax on productive capital or companies may lead to more companies beingestablished and thereby raise potential output. Similarly, lower tax on labour or increased educationalinputs may generate an increased supply of labour and also influence wage formation. These areexamples of the numerous ways in which changes in tax and expenditure systems are likely to modifyeconomic opportunities and promote conditions for good growth without the attendant capacityshortages that generate price pressure.Current fiscal policyThe trade-off between monetary and fiscal policy — the policy mix, as we economists like to say —has improved considerably in the present decade.The rapid accumulation of government debt has ceased and the stock is now being reduced. While theconsolidation of government finances has made the fiscal stance restrictive, it has been possible tolower interest rates and this in turn has stimulated investment, economic activity and employmentlately. This is accordingly a considerable improvement compared with the early 1990s, for example,when factors such as very weak government finances led the Riksbank to keep interest rates up at atime when government debt was rising markedly.
3BIS Review   77/1999In the June Inflation Report we noted that as a result of measures proposed in the Budget Bill, during1999 and possibly also in 2000 fiscal policy would probably be more restrictive than the Riksbankhad assumed earlier but would still become successively more expansionary. The restrictive economiceffect of fiscal policy was accordingly judged to be less marked than in the period 1994 – 97.Our scenario assumed, however, that there would be no further tax cuts next year. We foresee agovernment financial surplus somewhat above 2 per cent of GDP but have thus assumed that it will beused to repay government debt. In 2001, on the other hand, we assume that any surplus in excess of 2per cent of GDP will be transferred to households.The Swedish debate about tax cuts and increased spending has become more intense as thegovernment budget moved out of the red and is expected to show continued and growing surpluses inthe years ahead. That is hardly surprising. We had exactly the same debate in the 1980s as soon as thebudget deficits had been eliminated. Some comments are therefore called for.One comment concerns the formulation of the budget target. A medium-term average implies that ingood years the surplus should be above 2 per cent and by most standards the coming years must beregarded as good. While the economy does admittedly still appear to have some unutilised resources,they will gradually be utilised. Maintaining a surplus above 2 per cent when activity is high meansthat a smaller surplus can be tolerated when activity is lower. In this way, room is created for thebudget to act as an automatic stabiliser. If, instead, the surplus is held mechanically at exactly 2 percent from year to year, fiscal policy will tend to accentuate cyclical fluctuations and exert adestabilising effect.Another comment concerns the demand effects of an easier fiscal stance in the present situation. Thetax changes being discussed seem largely to be unfinanced income tax reductions for low and mediumincome groups. Judging from what has been indicated to date, a corresponding adjustment of publicspending is not envisaged. In that case, the tax cuts would enlarge household income and raise thelevel of economic activity via increased consumption. That could result in increased inflationarypressure that monetary policy might need to counter.That said, I want to underscore that tax cuts may well be motivated. There are many indications thatthe Swedish economy would work better if taxes were lower.

BIS Review   77/19994level than in the rest of the world will become increasingly difficult. But there is reason to deliberatethe type of tax cuts that would benefit the Swedish economy most in connection with good growth.Tax reductions with positive supply-side effects — instead of the cuts being discussed, which mainlystimulate demand — would increase the possibilities of combining the good growth with persistentlylow inflation.Interaction with labour market trendsLet me now leave monetary policy’s interaction with fiscal policy and consider its relationship withthe situation in the labour market. What forms does this interaction take?Monetary policy’s chief contribution to employment lies in the creation of economic stability andclear rules for wage formation. A monetary policy that is predictable and operates with a clearinflation target provides good guidance for wage negotiations. The lack of a properly functioningstabilisation policy was presumably one reason why wage formation did not work in the 1970s and1980s. The rules of the game were unclear to the labour market organisations. That is hardly the casetoday, as the Trade Union Confederation, for example, has acknowledged. Their wage negotiations in1997 started, in fact, from the 2 per cent inflation target.In the assessment of future inflationary pressure, monetary policy in turn must take the labour marketsituation into account. Wages are of major economic importance: in that the wage bill accounts foralmost 70 per cent of value added, the development of wages has a large impact on costs and thus onprice formation. Moreover, wage settlements are liable to influence inflation expectations.Wage tendencies are therefore one of the principal variables in any assessment of inflation. However,the difficulties in forecasting wage trends are considerable. The Riksbank does, of course, follow dataon wages and unit labour costs; other important indicators include labour shortages in particularindustries, wage drift, registered and total unemployment in relation to job vacancies.A central concept in this context is equilibrium unemployment, often referred to by the Englishacronym NAIRU—the level of unemployment that can be combined with stable inflation. Attempts topush unemployment down below the NAIRU with monetary stimuli are liable to have the sole effectTax and expenditure ratios in1998Per cent of GDPKällor: Europakommissionen och KI* Euro-11 excluding  Luxembourg010203040506070SwedenEuro-10*010203040506070Tax ratioExpenditure ratio
5BIS Review   77/1999of boosting inflation. In other words, the NAIRU is not responsive to an expansionary stabilisationpolicy. It depends instead on the workings of the labour market, together with demographic changesand technology. Thus, lastingly higher employment cannot be generated by continuouslyimplementing an expansionary monetary policy. This is a basic tenet of economics, yet to judge fromthe public debate it still seems to be misunderstood.Various attempts have been made to estimate the NAIRU for Sweden. If this could be done with somecertainty, it would obviously be of interest. Insights into when a reduction of unemployment risksboosting inflation would be a useful guide for monetary policy. The matter is unfortunately not thatsimple, mainly because equilibrium unemployment is something that cannot be observed directly.Assessing the level of the NAIRU for Sweden is presumably particularly difficult at present. We stilldo not know all that much about the long-term consequences of all that has happened in the pastdecade. After fluctuating around a low level for decades, possibly with a slight upward trend, with thecrisis in the early 1990s, unemployment shot up in just a few years. Moreover, policy has beenrealigned and focused successfully on low inflation. This is likely to influence wage formation andhence the NAIRU.It is notable that problems have also been encountered recently in estimating the level of the NAIRUfor the United States. Yet the adjustment to low inflation occurred there back around the turn of the1970s. For some time now, US unemployment has been below the rate that an earlier rule of thumbidentified as the equilibrium level but inflation has not accelerated. Some explain this mainly in termsof favourable transitory effects, while others attribute it to more far-reaching changes of a structuralnature. In any event, the US example shows that drawing conclusions about the NAIRU can bedifficult even in economies where unemployment has remained close to a level that is comparativelyconstant.In the Riksbank’s work, estimates of the NAIRU are accompanied by, for example, calculations of theoutput gap, which aim to provide a picture of total capacity utilisation. The output gap is thedifference between current production and the economy’s long-term production capacity or potentialGDP. Like the NAIRU, the latter equilibrium level is not directly observable and therefore has to beestimated with statistical methods.

BIS Review   77/19996points in common. The situation in the labour market must be a central aspect of any assessment oftotal capacity utilisation.While good forecasts of inflation can be made without knowing the exact levels of potential GDP andthe NAIRU, for those of us who conduct monetary policy it is naturally a problem that it is difficult totell just how much employment can rise without entailing a risk of a renewed acceleration of wagesand inflation. But that is no reason for believing that the functioning of the labour market and wageformation will not be of central importance for future inflation. This brings me to the current situationin the labour market.The current situation in the labour marketThe Riksbank’s view of the Swedish economy in the coming years is comparatively optimistic. Withthe low interest rates and some recovery in international economic activity, GDP growth is judged tobe 2.5 per cent this year and 3 per cent in both 2000 and 2001. As I mentioned earlier, this willpresumably involve the gradual utilisation of the resources that are unutilised at present.Unemployment and output gaps Per cent-8-6-4-202461980198219841986198819901992199419961998-8-6-4-20246Unemployment gapOutput gapSource: The Riksbank
7BIS Review   77/1999Increased employment is also foreseen and in the June Inflation Report we counted on a reduction ofunemployment to below 5 per cent in two years time. Against this background, in the period 1999–2001 the average annual rate of wage increases is judged to be 3.5–4 per cent. That seems to beconsistent with a forecast annual rate of productivity growth of 1.5–2 percent and the same order ofinflation expectations among the labour market organisations.I should perhaps underscore that this is a forecast, not a desired rate of wage increases. A lowernominal wage rise would create better conditions for a quicker increase in employment.How wages actually develop and the consequences of this for inflation and monetary policy willdepend in large measure on how the labour market turns out to function in the coming upward phase.The Riksbank will be keeping a watchful eye on the available indicators. The estimates of the NAIRUand the output gap suggest that inflationary pressure is rising and that in our forecast period theeconomy will approach or even reach full capacity utilisation. But, as I emphasised earlier, it is notonly these indicators that we will be considering. All incoming statistics that contribute to the pictureof future inflationary pressure will be followed closely.It should also be underscored that the outcome is not inevitable. An influence can be exerted witheconomic policy. I spoke earlier of how budget measures in the form of taxes as well as expenditurescan modify the workings of the labour market and the economy in general. As regards the labourmarket and wage formation, there are many other things to do, for instance in labour market policy,the rules and implementation of unemployment support, the rules that influence wage formation andso on.Concluding remarksIn many respects, economic policy has produced good results in recent years. This applies not least tothe interaction of fiscal and monetary policy. Government debt has been reduced, interest rates havefallen and economic growth has been good, and all this has been combined with low inflation.Employment has been a problem; there are now clear signs of an improvement here, too.One important explanation for the successful combination of high growth and low inflation in recentyears is that the crisis in the early 1990s brought capacity utilisation down to a low level.

BIS Review   77/19998activity strengthens as expected, the situation may gradually change. Capacity utilisation is rising.This presents policy with new challenges, with an increased risk of higher inflation.It is desirable that the interaction of fiscal and monetary policy continues to function well. There arestrong reasons for adhering to the rules that have been established. An increase of 1 percentage pointin the level of interest rates weakens the budget balance by about SEK 10 billion. A continuedamortisation of the sizeable government debt will create much-needed room to manoeuvre ineconomic policy. There will be more scope for stimulating increased demand in future slowdowns.At the same time, tax cuts would clearly benefit the Swedish economy in the somewhat longer run.But the cuts must then be concentrated to just those taxes that play a major part in the workings of theeconomy, where changes can help to raise potential output. Together with other measures thatimprove wage formation and the functioning of the labour market, such tax adjustments could lead tothe creation of new jobs without an acceleration of inflation. The more steps that can be taken in thisdirection, the better will be the conditions for a continuation of a good economic development inSweden.This BIS Review is available on the BIS website at www.bis.org.
1BIS Review   76/1999Mr Stals discusses regional trade and financial integration in the Southern AfricanDevelopment CommunityAddress by the Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, Dr Chris Stals, at a meeting for businesspeople arranged by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe in Harare, Zimbabwe on18 June 1999.Reasons why international financial cooperation is importantThere is a worldwide trend towards an integration of financial markets. This process of globalisationis no longer restricted to the industrial countries of the world, but emerging markets, countries intransformation and the developing countries of the world are all being drawn into this process.In many parts of the world, this process of globalisation goes through an intermediate phase, and thatis one of regional economic cooperation or integration. The European Union, which has beendeveloping over the past thirty years, has now reached the advanced stage of almost full financialintegration. There are many other examples, such as Mercosur in South America, NAFTA in NorthAmerica, and ASEAN in East Asia, where similar initiatives for economic integration are in progress.The smaller countries of the world can easily be marginalised in this process of global financialintegration, unless they form part of some regional cooperation arrangement to guide them into thishighly competitive global system of integrated financial markets. The Southern African DevelopmentCommunity (SADC) provides the opportunity for the countries of Southern Africa to approach theprocess of global financial integration through first combining forces in a regional cooperationarrangement that will, in a second phase, facilitate the real worldwide integration process.There are, of course, a number of other more localised reasons why financial integration within theSouthern Africa region will hold advantages for all participating countries. These can be summarisedas follows:• The expansion of trade between Southern African states will be supported by a simultaneousintegration of the financial sector. Payment and settlements will be facilitated by the removalof unnecessary financial obstructions and constraints.• The extension of services across borders will be made easier. Such services can includeinsurance, business, legal advice and assistance, engineering, architectural, medical, and otherprofessional services.• The movement of people within the region will become easier in support of activities such astourism, inter-governmental services, exchange of skills, and the mobility of labour.• It is of vital importance for the Southern Africa region that maximum use shall be made ofscarce resources. The coordination and sharing of limited resources such as skills,technological infrastructure and financial systems will contribute to a higher rate of economicdevelopment for the region as a whole.What has been achieved so far?The Southern Africa Development Community is a political association of the Governments (Headsof State) of fourteen countries in Sub-Sahara Africa (including Mauritius and Seychelles). It has, ofcourse, much wider objectives than just financial cooperation in the region.The Governors of the central banks of the 14 member states of SADC made use of the opportunity tocreate within the SADC structure an independent Committee of Governors of SADC with theobjective of promoting financial cooperation within the region. The South African Reserve Bank set
BIS Review   76/19992up a small Secretariat and Research Unit for SADC within the Economics Department of the ReserveBank to assist the Governors’ Committee with its programme. A number of working groups and sub-committees were created within the structure to give attention to specialised projects.The work done by the Governors’ Committee over the past 3½ years can be summarised under a fewheadings:(i) Enhanced cooperation amongst central banks:It was important for the central bankers of the region to know each other better. Meetings weretherefore arranged, not only between Governors and Managers, but also between staff members at alllevels. Specialised groups, such as economic research staff, bank regulators and supervisors,information technologists, computer operators, money and financial market dealers and traders, andsecurity officials, met from time to time to exchange views on their functions.A database was established for each central bank on its structure, functions, internal administration,relations with government, statistics and legal aspects. This mass of information is now available inbook form, and also on a special website provided on the Internet for the distribution of SADCinformation.Discussions took place within the Governors Committee on the exchange controls and exchange ratepolicies, interest rate policies and accommodation facilities provided by each central bank to itsnational banking institutions. Assessments were also made of the implications of last year’s EastAsian crisis for the countries of our region.The independence of central banks is a topic which is often discussed in this forum. There are manyreasons why central banks should be given some autonomy for the implementation of monetarypolicy. It is accepted that governments (Parliament) established central banks and gave them thespecial power to create money. Because of this special power, central banks have a greatresponsibility, and that is to protect the value of the currency (that is, to keep inflation low). Themonetary policies needed to keep inflation low, are often very unpopular, and politicians normally donot like to take responsibility for such unpopular measures.Furthermore, the power to create money can easily be abused for short-term gains, but any excessivecreation of money in the short-term will eventually lead to higher inflation (and therefore higherinterest rates).It is also understood that, because Parliament has vested the power to create money within the centralbank, this institution must remain accountable to Parliament for its policies.(ii) Cooperation amongst bank regulators and supervisorsThe Governors’ Committee has encouraged bank regulators and supervisors in the region to worktogether in order to standardise and coordinate policies followed to control the banking system.Special attention has been given to:• the implementation of the Basel Committee’s recommendations for capital adequacy;• the implementation of the BIS Core Principles for Banking Supervision;• training of bank regulators and supervisors in the region; and• identifying and eliminating money laundering and illegal banking transactions.
3BIS Review   76/1999(iii) The expansion of training facilities for central bankers in the regionThe South African Reserve Bank expanded its Training Institute to accommodate participants fromthe other central banks of SADC.We also coordinated our training programmes with those provided by other central banks (forexample, Bank of Tanzania) and institutes (Macroeconomic and Financial Management Institute ofEastern and Southern Africa [MEFMI]) in the region. Our training efforts within SADC are nowgetting recognition from the International Monetary Fund and other central banks, such as the Bank ofEngland, and can make an important contribution to the improvement of central banking skills in theregion.(iv) Development of the payment, clearing and settlement systems in the regionAn analysis was made of the existing facilities for inter-bank clearing, payment and settlementsystems in each one of the original 12 members of SADC.The sophisticated SAMOS system of South Africa, which provides for real-time on-line settlement forlarge transactions and full daily settlement for smaller transactions, can eventually be expanded toother countries, and can provide a system for cross-border settlement of intra-regional transactions.(v) Cooperation amongst (private sector) banking institutions in the regionThe Committee of Governors formed a sub-committee, consisting of the private sector bankinginstitutions in the region, to encourage cooperation at this level.(vi) Cooperation amongst stock exchangesThe Association of Stock Exchanges of the SADC region is making a useful contribution to thedevelopment of financial integration in the region. This sub-committee has been instrumental inproviding for:• dual listing procedures;• the reduction of exchange control restrictions; and•  sharing of information technology.(vii) Harmonisation of exchange controlsThe existing exchange controls in the region were analysed by a sub-committee of the Governors’Committee with a view to gradual harmonisation. Participating countries are being encouraged toremove remaining exchange controls for transactions within the region as quickly as possible.Arrangements were made for the repatriation of banknotes amongst participating countries, and for aneasing of private sector investments across borders in the region.Three countries, i.e. Botswana, Mauritius and Zambia, have removed all exchange controls and someothers are making steady progress in the implementation of this programme.A vision for the futureAs already mentioned, the SADC organisation is a political association that covers a much widerobjective than just financial cooperation within the region. This wider objective, however, has morepotential for disputes and friction, and will also at times be constrained by the red-tape of a longdrawn-out inter-governmental decision-making process. I believe that the Committee of Governors of
BIS Review   76/19994the Central Banks of SADC provides a unique body that should be able to proceed with a programmeof financial cooperation in the region, without being unduly constrained by the more complexpolitical decision-making processes.At this stage, I believe work should continue to proceed on the accepted road of focusing on identifiedprojects that can be developed on a regional basis without full economic integration of the 14countries now forming part of SADC. Most of these programmes will also not require any formalinter-governmental agreements. In the process, we shall provide a basis for gradual but effective co-operation and integration of the financial systems and markets of Southern Africa.In the longer term, the vision should be:• to make it possible for residents of the whole SADC region to move funds around withinthe region without formal exchange control restrictions or border controls;• to make it possible for residents of the region to invest in the shares of companies inevery country of the region without restriction, to buy and sell on any one of a series ofclosely-linked stock exchanges, and to arrange for settlement anywhere in the region; and• to make it possible for business people to do their business, whatever kind of business itmight be, anywhere in the region without any undue financial restriction.To reach these objectives, however, I believe that the central banks of the region should, for the timebeing, continue to work on an almost informal way to establish a sound basis for the more ambitiousplan of eventual full economic integration of the region. The momentum built up over the past fewyears amongst the central banks, with the attention focused on the building of a compatible financialinfrastructure in the region, must be maintained.We must first establish:• independent central banks with strictly defined monetary policy objectives;• well-managed and sound private sector banking institutions;• well-functioning and well-coordinated financial markets, including foreign exchange markets; and• effective clearing and settlement arrangements within and amongst countries,before we can proceed to the more ambitious plans for macroeconomic integration. Only after thebasic financial structures have been established in our countries can we harmonise interest rate,exchange rate, money supply and inflation policies.Cooperation on this basis will strengthen the position of the SADC region in the on-going process offinancial globalisation. As part of the strategy, SADC countries should indeed now begin to give moreattention to the development of a common economic strategy vis-à-vis the outside world for theeventual integration of the SADC region in the global financial markets.
1BIS Review   75/1999Mr Noyer focuses on the benefits of EMU and on the euro as an accelerator for economicgrowth in europeSpeech by Christian Noyer, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, at the lunch-meeting ofCercle d’Union Interalliée in Paris on 23 June 1999.IntroductionOn 1 January of this year, the euro was introduced in 11 countries (EU-11 countries) with a totalpopulation of almost 300 million. The start of Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU)established a combined economy that is only slightly smaller than that of the United States. So, bothin human and economic resources, the euro area can be compared with the largest economy in theworld. Furthermore, eventual participation of the four countries which have not yet adopted the singleEuropean currency – Denmark, Greece, Sweden and the United Kingdom – would only furtherenhance the economic weight of the euro area and promote the contribution of Europe to worldeconomic development. In this sense, the euro is truly an accelerator of economic growth, as the useof the same currency in the euro area will increase cross-border competition and market integration,thereby enlarging economic prosperity for European citizens that will spillover to other European andnon-European countries as well. It is my conviction that EMU could be a catalyst for economicprogress in Europe, and could fundamentally re-shape the contours of the world economic order in the21st century. Today I shall deal with the benefits of EMU and the stability-oriented policies that haveto be implemented in order to reap the full potential of EMU. Making EMU a success is a processwhich requires the efforts of all of us.Economic Growth – The Benefits of EMUI should now like to address the benefits of EMU and why I believe that the introduction of the euroand the single monetary policy should result in higher economic growth in the euro area and therebycontribute positively to the development of the world economy. The degree to which these benefitsare achieved depends not only on the monetary policy of the Eurosystem, but even more so onaccompanying stability-oriented fiscal and appropriate labour market policies. When speaking of theEurosystem, I refer to the European Central Bank (ECB) and the eleven national central banks(NCBs) of the participating Member States.The most important contribution that the Eurosystem’s monetary policy can make towards exploitingto the maximum the benefits of EMU is to fulfil its primary objective to maintain price stability, asstipulated in the Treaty on European Union. As has long been argued by central bankers and academiceconomists, inflation is costly, both economically and socially.1 Nobel prize-winner Milton Friedmanexpressed this well in 1980, when he said : “Inflation is a disease, a dangerous and sometimes fataldisease, a disease that if not checked in time can destroy a society”2. The same could be said aboutdeflation. In my view, EMU is a tool to consolidate the progress made towards price stability in recentyears and to firmly anchor expectations in line with price stability, and thereby establish the necessaryframework to seize the opportunities of monetary union. The Eurosystem enjoys full independence todetermine the appropriate level of interest rates in order to satisfy its primary objective of pricestability. Moreover, the members of the ECB Governing Council have long terms of office and areonly dismissible for serious misconduct or inability to perform their duties. These provisions implythat the concept of monetary stability benefits from explicit legal statutes and that the credibility ofthe Eurosystem will be safeguarded by protecting the monetary policymaking process from politicalinterference.                                                     1 S. Fisher, “Why are central banks pursuing long-run price stability?,” revised version of a paper prepared forthe Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Symposium (Achieving Price Stability), August 1996.2 M. Friedman and R. Friedman, Free to Choose: A Personal Statement, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1980,p.253.
BIS Review   75/19992A further important benefit of EMU is that it has greatly reduced the risk of real exchange ratemisalignments within the euro area. This fosters economic growth and avoids a misallocation ofresources. In fact, it enables the European Single Market to function smoothly to the advantage ofproducers and consumers. EMU has eliminated nominal exchange rate volatility and exchange raterisks within the euro area. This benefits not only trade between, and economic growth in, the euroarea countries but also the economic development of other European and non-European countries. Inaddition, foreign direct investments into the euro area economies should be promoted, as theseinvestments are negatively affected by exchange rate volatility.The advantages of economic integration afforded by the Single Market process are enhanced by theelimination of the transaction costs of exchanging different currencies, the direct result of theintroduction of the euro. Furthermore, the single currency will make prices across the euro areadirectly comparable, which should increase competition and hence efficiency and economic growth inthe euro area.A number of further positive effects on economic growth flow from the elimination of separatecurrencies in the euro area countries. One benefit is the potential for the reduction of risk premia builtinto real interest rates. This in turn will stimulate investment. By facilitating the development of deepand integrated capital markets, the single currency should further reduce long-term rates via theelimination of premia resulting from less liquid markets. For example, empirical research has shownthat due to more liquid markets, US long-term interest rates are 25 to 50 basis points lower thancomparable European interest rates3. In addition, a wider and deeper capital market in the euro areawill improve intermediation between savers and investors.Finally, EMU may stimulate further political integration of Europe. In general, the process ofEuropean integration has been driven and continues to be driven by the political conviction that anintegrated Europe will be safer, more stable and more prosperous than a fragmented Europe. In thissense, the introduction of a single currency in the euro area could become an important symbol ofpolitical and social integration in Europe. It could serve as a catalyst for further integration in otherareas.Ensuring the Benefits (I): A Stability-Oriented Monetary PolicyAs I mentioned earlier, the most important contribution of the Eurosystem’s monetary policy toeconomic growth in the euro area is achieving its primary objective of maintaining price stability. Thespecific way in which the ECB should pursue this primary objective is laid down by what is called themonetary policy strategy. I should like to address now the main aspects of the Eurosystem’s strategy.First, in order to guide expectations of future price developments and to facilitate the public’sassessment of the success of the single monetary policy, the Governing Council of the ECB hasannounced a quantitative definition of its primary objective. That is, price stability has been definedas a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area ofbelow 2%. Price stability is to be maintained over the medium term.Second, to maintain price stability according to this published definition, we have chosen a distinctmonetary policy strategy, one that reflects the special circumstances that exist at present as well asthose likely to prevail in the foreseeable future. It ensures as much continuity as possible with thestrategies previously pursued by the NCBs. At the same time, it gives due consideration to the uniquesituation that prevails in the early years of the introduction of the euro. Our strategy rests on two                                                     3 G. Alogoskoufis, R. Portes and H. Rey, “The Emergence of the Euro as an International Currency”, 1997, asdiscussed in A. Bénassy-Quéré, B. Mojon and A.D. Schor, The Role of the Euro, CEPII, document de travail no.98-03, January 1998.
3BIS Review   75/1999“pillars”: a prominent role for money as expressed by the announcement of a reference value for theannual growth of M3 and a broadly based assessment of the outlook for price developments, and therisks to price stability in the euro area as a whole.In the context of the first pillar of the monetary policy strategy, the Governing Council of the ECB hasannounced a quantitative reference value for the growth of a broad monetary aggregate (M3), whichhas been set at an annual rate of 4½%. Under normal circumstances, substantial deviations from thereference value would tend to indicate future risks to price stability. However, monetary policy doesnot react to deviations of monetary growth from the reference value in a “mechanistic” way. In thefirst instance, such deviations will be thoroughly analysed to infer any signals which they may sendabout the prospects for price developments. If this analysis points to a threat to price stability,monetary policy will react in a manner appropriate to counter this threat, rather than attempt toeliminate the deviation of monetary growth from the reference value in the short term.Although monetary data contain information which is vital for monetary policy decision-making,monetary developments alone will clearly not constitute a complete summary of all the economicinformation necessary to enable appropriate policy decisions to be taken. That is why it is importantto monitor simultaneously a wide range of financial and other economic indicators, includingeconomic forecasts. This broadly based assessment constitutes the second pillar of our monetarypolicy strategy.All in all, the combination of the two pillars of the Eurosystem’s strategy ensures that monetary,financial and economic developments are closely monitored and analysed. On the basis of thisthorough analysis, the interest rate will be set in a way that best serves the maintenance of pricestability.Ensuring the Benefits (II): Stability-Oriented Non-Monetary PoliciesLet me now turn to the importance of prudent and stability-oriented non-monetary policies in order toreap the fruits of the single currency. I should like to emphasise that the true benefits of EMU derivefrom the unique opportunity to shape a macroeconomic environment conducive to stability, growthand employment, and to foster structural change which is needed to maintain medium to long-termdynamism in the European economies. The full benefits of the single currency will arise only if thereis appropriate support from other stability-oriented policies, especially fiscal and labour marketpolicies, and if structural reforms are carried out in these areas. Thus, price stability is a necessary,but not a sufficient condition for grasping all the opportunities of EMU.As regards fiscal policy, it is of the utmost importance that the governments of the EU Member Statespursue in implementing fiscal policies that aim at a budgetary position close to balance or in surplus.This condition is stipulated by the Stability and Growth Pact, to ensure lasting compliance of fiscalpolicies with the requirement of budgetary prudence. From the perspective of a central banker, aprime reason for the establishment of the Pact is that a lack of fiscal discipline would negativelyimpact on the Eurosystem’s policies to maintain price stability. Let me elaborate on this. Theinstitutional framework of EMU and the Eurosystem has been designed so as to prevent any directlink between an increase in public sector deficits and a monetary expansion, and thereby inflation.This is ensured by assigning to the Eurosystem the primary objective of price stability, banning directfinancing of government deficits by central banks and precluding any influence by governments orother institutions on monetary policy decisions. However, even in this setting, the conduct of fiscalpolicies has a clear bearing on the objective of price stability. In particular, doubts about thesoundness of fiscal policy can influence the effectiveness of monetary policy instruments andundermine the credibility of monetary policy.For decades – and until very recently – fiscal policies have followed a trend of ever-growing publicsector and government debt levels. In EMU, without binding fiscal rules, countries might have even
BIS Review   75/19994less incentive to pursue prudent fiscal policies. The main reason is that risk premia offsetting inflationand exchange rate expectations disappear on a country-specific basis and may not be fully outweighedby default risk premia. Hence, the Treaty establishing the European Community contains a number ofprovisions on the conduct of fiscal policies, which have been further clarified by the Stability andGrowth Pact. In this sense, the Stability and Growth Pact is an essential safeguard to ensure that priceand fiscal stability remain the cornerstones of EMU. Therefore, we attach great importance to theimplementation of this Pact.It is a misunderstanding to believe that the Stability and Growth Pact is imposed on countries only asa price they have to pay for entry into EMU. In fact the Pact just stipulates what had to be achieved inany case, with or without EMU. The need for addressing budgetary imbalances is clear, in particular,from the costs associated with the ageing of the population, which will soon require additionalbudgetary room for manoeuvre. According to long-term projections and estimates, current trends inbirth rates and life expectancy, together with unfunded public pension and health care schemes, resultin very high implicit government liabilities in most euro area countries. In many cases these implicitliabilities appear to be far in excess of official government debt levels.Let me turn now to the contribution that structural reforms, particularly of euro area labour markets,can play in reducing unemployment and in supporting the stability of the euro. The high level ofEuropean unemployment is rightly a source of deep concern. Clearly, the approaches that are mostlikely to have a lasting effect are those that address the root cause of the problem, not just thesymptoms. The root causes of high unemployment in the European Union are structural rigidities inlabour markets as well as tax and public transfer policies. This view is supported by a wide body ofacademic literature and was also a key finding of the OECD Jobs Study.The underlying structural nature of the European unemployment problem can be seen most strikinglyif one compares developments in Europe with those in the United States over the last three decades. In1970, the unemployment rate in the United States, at around 4%, was at least twice as large as thatprevailing in most European economies. Since 1970 there has been significant cyclical variation in theunemployment rate in the United States, but no upward trend. At 4.2% in May 1999, theunemployment rate in the United States is almost the same as it was in 1970. In contrast, averageEuropean unemployment appears to have risen with each passing economic cycle. By the early 1980sthe unemployment rates in the United States and Europe had broadly converged. Since then theunemployment rate in the United States has been below the average for the European Union. Despiterecording some decline last year, the euro area unemployment rate was 10.4% in April 1999, morethan double the corresponding rate in the United States. However, some European countries,particularly those with more flexible labour markets, have managed to avoid the trend of ever-risingunemployment. For example, the Netherlands, Ireland, Portugal, Austria and Luxembourg at presenthave unemployment rates well below the euro area average.If one examines the duration of unemployment, it is immediately apparent that Europe’s problem isprincipally one of long-term unemployment. According to OECD figures, around half of theunemployed of the European Union has been out of work for at least a year, while in the UnitedStates, under 10% of the unemployed have been without work for this long. This suggests that inEurope there is an urgent need to improve incentives aimed at getting the long-term unemployed backto work.There are many good examples of what can be done - and is currently being done in some euro areacountries – in terms of structural reforms. First, there are measures to ensure that low-productivityworkers are not forced out of the labour market. To this end, the burden of taxes and non-wage labourcosts could be reduced for low-paid workers. In addition, minimum wage schemes and wageagreements reached by collective bargaining need to take account of the need to preserve jobs forlow-productivity workers by reducing labour costs. Second, there are “active labour market measures”which provide programmes of education, training and work experience targeted at the long-term
5BIS Review   75/1999unemployed. Third, reforms to the tax and benefit systems could be implemented which ensure thatpeople are significantly better off in work than out of it.I recognise that structural reforms are not always easy to implement. The benefits are often enjoyed inthe medium term, while short-term costs for some groups may mean that reforms are vigorouslyopposed by interest groups. Although there is a common objective of reducing unemployment, there isno common programme of reforms that will work in all countries. While it is possible to learn fromthe experience of others, each Member State will wish to develop workable policies that reflect itsown particular circumstances. Although the path of structural reform is not always an easy one, it isthe only way in which we can achieve the lasting reductions in unemployment that are so urgentlyrequired. Only structural reforms that aim at stable labour markets where supply and demand meet ina flexible way will ensure that the benefits of EMU for economic growth are really achieved.ConclusionsI am convinced that Economic and Monetary Union provides a great opportunity to create andmaintain a large zone of price stability and economic prosperity in Europe, including a substantialreduction of unemployment. However, while price stability is a necessary condition for fully graspingthe opportunities of EMU, it is not in itself sufficient. Stability-oriented polices regarding thedevelopment of national fiscal positions and the functioning of labour markets are of crucialimportance as well. As I have explained, the benefits of EMU will not arise in a quasi automatic way.While monetary policy will deliver its contribution by following policies that maintain price stability,other economic policies must be implemented to ensure that the opportunities of the single currencywill be fully utilised. Monetary policy alone - however well designed and implemented - cannot solveEurope’s economic problems. Policy-makers in all areas must be determined to take the newenvironment of Stage Three of EMU and its consequences appropriately into account when formingtheir policies. Only then will the euro be able to function as a truly accelerator of economic growth inEurope.
1BIS Review  73/1999Mr Macfarlane’s overview of monetary policy in AustraliaOpening statement by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Mr I J Macfarlane, to the Houseof Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration, inMelbourne, Australia on 17 June 1999.Thank you, Mr Chairman. It is a pleasure to be here in Melbourne again appearing in front of theCommittee.Like last time, the Semi-Annual Statement on Monetary Policy has already been released a monthbefore the hearing. On this occasion, it was the Budget that caused the delay in the hearing, but I donot think this is a serious matter because the Statement is still relevant. If anything, the advancerelease of the Statement may have been helpful in giving more time to digest the material contained init. We have more recently sent to the Committee some new material in the form of a paper on bankfees.I would now like to start off in my customary manner by comparing what I told you last time withwhat now appears to be the most likely outcome. I do this in the interests of accountability, but I alsothink it has the advantage of drawing out the limitations of economic forecasting and the necessity ofseeing policy formulation as an iterative process.Last time, I indicated our expectation that our growth rate was likely to be lower in 1998/99 and thatthere would be some pick-up in inflation (though to a rate consistent with our target). I said that thecurrent account deficit would expand, and would probably reach 6 per cent of GDP on a quarterlybasis at some stage. I indicated that not much further progress could be expected in reducingunemployment from the rate of 7.9 per cent which had prevailed in the three months before thehearing.It is now well known that growth has not, as yet, declined. In all likelihood, growth for the 1998/99year has been in excess of 4 per cent, measured either in year average terms or for the four quarters toJune. This makes this expansion, which began in the middle of 1991, the longest continuous upswingsince the 1960s. Nor is there any sign yet that the expansion will come to an end soon.We are still of the view, however, that some decline in growth is likely, but from a considerablystronger starting point (and, of course, more delayed) than earlier thought. The outcome for calendar1999 will, in our judgement, be lower than the growth recorded in 1998 – something between 3 and 4per cent. This is a fairly mild decline, given the size of the external shock to which we have beensubject.More importantly, the risks of a sharp slump have lessened considerably since we last met. LastDecember, we had just been through a period in which confidence in the prospects for the globaleconomy, including, of course, the US economy, had reached its lowest point. Behind this wereconcerns about extreme instability in global financial markets and the possibility of a “credit crunch”.Since then, the US economy has continued its strong performance and concerns about credit cruncheshave disappeared. Indeed, there is now a widespread expectation that the strength of the US economymeans that a tightening of US monetary policy is on the cards. Evidence has also continued toaccumulate of a turn for the better in the countries in East Asia which slumped so sharply during 1997and 1998.Inflation in Australia, meanwhile, has risen, but very slightly and considerably more slowly than ourcentral forecast of six months ago had suggested. A possibility which we flagged in our November1998 Statement – that competitive pressures in international markets would have a dampening impacton the rises in prices for imported goods – has in fact turned out to be the case. In our latestStatement, we have forecast inflation to be about 2 per cent in underlying terms by the end of 1999. In
BIS Review   73/19992headline terms, the CPI also is likely to be about 2 per cent. This is a little higher than we suggested inthe Statement, as we have now taken full account of higher international oil prices, which roughlyoffset the effect of the health care changes.The current account deficit has turned out to be something like 5½ per cent of GDP for 1998/99, andwas almost 6 per cent in the March quarter. It is highly likely that a quarterly figure over 6 per centwill be recorded in the June quarter. It seems to us that numbers something like that might well beseen over the next few quarters, with the result that the outcome for 1999 as a whole will be about 6per cent of GDP.The unemployment rate has fallen further, in line with the stronger than expected growth in theeconomy, and over the past three months has averaged 7.5 per cent, its lowest for about a decade.Given the amount of growth we have had over the past year, some further moderate decline inunemployment will probably be recorded, in net terms, over the remainder of this calendar year.Even though the outcome has turned out better than expected, if someone wanted to score a point,they could say we are not very good forecasters. I would concede that we have been a littleconservative in our forecasts, but it has not led us astray in a policy sense, i.e. it has not jeopardisedthe achievement of a good economic outcome.As someone who has been involved in forecasting and economic policy in the lean years as well asthe good, there is a more interesting question that has to be asked. It is this: How is it that theAustralian economy has been able to grow at 4½ per cent plus per annum in the seventh and eighthyears of an economic expansion without generating significant wage and price pressures? It certainlywas not able to do so in earlier expansions.I have already given part of the answer to this question in my December testimony, and in a couple ofspeeches since. It is that the economy has achieved improved productivity growth as a result of themicro-economic reforms of the past fifteen years. The main changes have been reductions in tariffs,privatisations, financial deregulation, competition policy and labour market reforms. Of course,businesses have also become much leaner and more adaptable as they have responded to increasedcompetitive pressure. The key piece of evidence for this is the higher growth of multi-factorproductivity in Australia in this expansion compared with previous ones. A lot more could be saidabout this subject, but I will leave it to others, and move on to a related subject.It seems to me to be quite possible to have higher productivity growth and yet to still encountermacro-economic imbalances which would bring an economic expansion to a halt. In other words,higher productivity growth can explain why the economy’s average growth rate is faster, but I do notthink it can provide an adequate answer for why the expansion will last longer. To do this, I think amacro-economic explanation is required.Here I have to come back to low inflation and low inflationary expectations, which have characterisedthe 1990s expansion, but were clearly absent from earlier expansions. As the earlier expansionsmatured, inflationary pressures built up which simultaneously pushed up prices (requiring a monetarypolicy response) and squeezed businesses and business confidence. In the mid-1970s and early 1980sthe expansions came to an end with a wage explosion, while in the late 1980s it was an asset priceboom and bust. This time we have had neither of these.As I said, a recent history of low inflation has been crucial this time. It certainly has helped the wagebargaining process. Employees have seen that quite modest nominal wage increases have translatedinto decent real wage increases because inflation has been contained. They have not had to buildanticipatory increases into their wage bargains to safeguard themselves against inflation getting awayfrom them. Increased flexibility in industrial relations arrangements has also helped.
3BIS Review   73/1999Similarly, low inflation and low interest rates have had a favourable impact on business behaviour.An important reason for this is that with low interest rates, there is little or no scope for negativegearing. Most of the reckless schemes of the entrepreneurs of the 1980s were simply negative gearingwrit large. This was the biggest contribution to the boom and bust in asset prices. It was not the only(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:7)(cid:3)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:2)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:7)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:3)(cid:11)(cid:7)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:2)(cid:7)(cid:1)(cid:3)(cid:10)(cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:7)(cid:13)(cid:6)(cid:9)(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:2)(cid:7)(cid:13)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:2)(cid:7)(cid:6)(cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:17)(cid:2)(cid:1)(cid:7)(cid:5)(cid:18)(cid:7)(cid:19)(cid:2)(cid:6)(cid:14)(cid:2)(cid:1)(cid:4)(cid:7)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:9)(cid:13)(cid:3)(cid:11)(cid:2)(cid:14)(cid:7)(cid:20)(cid:13)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:7)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:2)(cid:7)(cid:14)(cid:2)(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:21)(cid:15)(cid:19)(cid:3)(cid:11)(cid:13)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:5)(cid:18)the finance sector also played a role. We could argue about the relative weights of these two factors ifwe wish, but the relevant fact for today is that neither of these two factors is present in the currentexpansion.If we do not seem to be developing our usual ailments, as I have argued above, are there some newailments that may bring our progress to a halt? A number of possibilities could be identified, but onethat has attracted a fair bit of attention is the fall in the household saving ratio. In contrast to thebusiness sector, which has become more cautious in the 1990s, the household sector has become lesscautious, as shown by:• the household saving ratio falling from 12 per cent in the first half of the 1980s to about 1 percent at present. This has been a pretty steady trend (see Diagram 1).• Household borrowing rising as a percentage of annual income.Household Saving Ratio0481204812%%1996199319901987198419811999Diagram 1This less cautious attitude by households is a surprise to many people because it seems to be at oddswith the usual media depiction of a public worrying about its future, anxious about job security andgenerally insecure. If we were instead to judge the public by what they actually do, we wouldconclude the opposite. Unlike their parents and grandparents, who saw a great need to save for arainy day and who had the privations of the Depression still in their minds, the spending and savingpattern of the current generation indicates a totally different attitude.Of course, developments on the supply side have made this a lot easier. At today’s low interest rates,it is possible to service a much bigger loan than it was at the start of the decade. Also banks and otherfinancial intermediaries have found new ways of providing credit based on previously inaccessiblecollateral.
BIS Review   73/19994The important issue is whether this trend change in household behaviour is going to cause problemsfor the economy, particularly whether it is going to endanger the present expansion. I think there arethree possible problems that could arise, so I will discuss each one briefly.1. The first possible problem is that if inadequate household saving persists, it could meaninadequate provision for retirement. This, in turn, would put increased demands on futuretaxpayers. This is an issue of inter-generational equity. I do not want to suggest that this is nota problem – it may well be a big one, but the solution to it would be found in improvements toour policies regarding retirement income.2. The second possible problem is that any reduction in saving, other things equal, would lead toan increase in the current account deficit. Has the trend decline in household saving over thepast decade caused the balance of payments to deteriorate? The answer seems to be no: thecurrent account deficit has shown roughly the same cyclical movement that it has exhibitedover the past twenty years (Diagram 2), but no change in trend. The reason for this is thatthere is not a one-for-one relationship between household saving and the current accountdeficit. We have to also take into account government sector saving, business sector savingand, of course, investment before we get to the current account of the balance of payments,and movements in some of these factors have offset the reduction in household saving.-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-8-7-6-5-4-3-2Current Account Balance*Per cent of GDP%%199619931990198719841981* Excludes RBA gold transactions.1999Diagram 23. The third possible problem is that increased indebtedness makes the household sector morevulnerable when interest rates rise. This is probably true, but the main implication is that toachieve a given macro-economic effect, interest rates would not have to be raised as much asformerly was the case. I now want to turn to a totally different subject, but one that will bevery important over the next seven months. I refer, of course, to the issue of the end ofcentury date change — or Y2K as it is colloquially known.The main point I want to make is that the Australian financial system is very well prepared for Y2K.The formal processes of fixing and testing their systems began in the mid—1990s and it has beenunder the scrutiny of APRA and the Reserve Bank since early 1997. Financial intermediaries havedevoted over a billion dollars and thousands of staff to checking and updating computer systems.Where problems have been found, they have been fixed. Outmoded ATMs and EFTPOS machines
5BIS Review   73/1999have been replaced, computer programs have been rewritten or new software has been installed.With all this effort, the Australian financial system rightly enjoys a world-class reputation for itshigh level of Y2K preparedness.The Reserve Bank’s own computer systems are, of course, Year 2000 ready. In particular, thesystems that the Reserve Bank uses to distribute pensions and other government payments to banks,building societies and credit unions on behalf of Centrelink have been thoroughly tested. Pensionpayments will be made on time.So much work has now been completed to ensure that the system works, that the big issue facing usis no longer a technical one – it is instead an issue of public reaction. While I am very confident thatthe overwhelming majority of the Australian public will act sensibly, there are no doubt a few whoare inclined to believe doomsday scenarios. With this in mind, there are a few preparations that weat the Reserve Bank have been putting into place to help reassure the community.An important step was to talk to the banks, building societies and credit unions to make sure thatthey were communicating with their customers in clear language to reassure them that their depositswere safe. Because the simple fact is that their deposits are safe and their records are not at risk fromY2K related problems.All financial institutions have extensive back-up systems to ensure that each night they keepmultiple physical records of all account information. While some members of the public haveexpressed concerns for the safety of their deposits because they think records might disappear, thereis no basis for this type of concern. The safest place for people to keep their savings is in thefinancial institution that they are already with. Withdrawal and conversion to cash would exposethem to a lot of unnecessary risks.The vast majority of people, I believe, do not have those concerns, but they probably still have a fewuncertainties. Many will wish to take more cash out to tide them over the New Year period than theynormally do. To this group, I just want to make a few points:• Do not, for a minute, fear that you need to take out more cash because there may not be enoughto go round. There will be. The Reserve Bank has printed, and is carrying in stock, a lot morenotes than usual so that it can meet any increased demand.• If you are worried about high-tech systems such as ATMs or EFTPOS letting you down,remember you are only dependent on them for the first three days of the new year. After that, thebanks, building societies and credit unions open their doors again and you can go back to theold-fashioned ways of obtaining cash. You are really only dealing with a long weekend.• Even in those three days, you are not completely dependent on cash – credit cards can, ifnecessary, still operate in their traditional paper-based mode and cheques can be used as normal.Overall, our view is that the system will be able to operate on a “business as usual” basis and thepublic should view the new year as just another long weekend. That is what I will be doing. Forthose who want a little extra reassurance in the form of extra cash, they can be confident that it willbe readily available.That is all I wish to say in general terms about Y2K at this stage, but I will be happy to answer anydetailed questions you wish to put to me. I am also conscious that I have been talking for quite awhile, so that I have not left any time to cover the subject of bank fees. But with a copy of our paperat your disposal, I am sure you will find plenty of material to supply you with questions on thatsubject also.

1BIS Review   72/1999Mr Tietmeyer talks about systemic risk and lender of last resort facilitiesSpeech by the President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, Prof Hans Tietmeyer, at the conference entitled“Systemic Risk and Lender of Last Resort Facilities” organised by the Center for Financial Studies inFrankfurt on 11 June 1999.IThank you very much for the invitation to speak to this distinguished audience. As a financial center,Frankfurt has to be more than a center of commercial and central banking. Undoubtedly, it also needsto be a center of critical scientific analysis. Therefore, I appreciate very much the contribution whichthe Center for Financial Studies is making to the intellectual capabilities of Frankfurt.IIThe subject of this conference “Systemic risk and Lender of Last Resort Facilities” is likewise bothimportant and tricky. There is no doubt about the fact that recent events have placed questions aboutthe soundness of global financing on the intellectual and political agenda. On the one hand, we haveexperienced severe financial crises in different regions over the past few years. In terms of theirimpact, the speed with which the events occurred and the ensuing contagion effects, the crisesrevealed a new dimension. On the other hand, new games and players have entered global financialmarkets; for example, highly leveraged activities and institutions. We have learned, in one case inparticular, that such institutions can cause serious troubles if their working assumptions on the futuredevelopment of market prices fail.So, besides all the old or new-fashioned macroeconomic questions, the discussion on the soundness ofappropriate financial and supervisory structures is an important one. And the consideration ofsystemic risk is part of that discussion. However, we should be careful when using the label “systemicrisk”.Firstly, not every financial crisis of a country or an institution necessarily causes a systemic risk. Thatdoes not mean that the international community should or could neglect such crisis. But in order toassess which measures are appropriate, the nature of the crisis has to be clear.And secondly, systemic risk is not a given quantity. To a large extent, it is an endogenous variablewhich depends on the structures of the financial market, on the supervisory framework at the nationaland international levels and on the decisions taken by the political and monetary authorities.Therefore the topic of systemic risk has a lot of different aspects. The aspect on which this conferencefocuses, namely the lender of last resort, is certainly not the most prominent point.The first and most fundamental question in that context is how to make a substantial reduction insystemic risk. Or, to be more precise, how to reduce systemic risk without restraining or patronizingfinancial markets but rather by improving their functioning. A lot of work is under way to find waysof doing this. Improved transparency should foster the self-control and self-discipline of the markets.That includes different aspects such as: more and better data on the debt structure of individualcountries, the application of standards for banking supervision, improved disclosure of risk positionsof market participants.Of course, in the case of a national sovereign crisis, financial assistance too might play a role.Therefore, we have agreed to fill up the IMF’s reserve tanks. Such assistance, however, has to bebound to conditionality, to an incentive to redeem the official credits and to a fair burden-sharingbetween official and private sectors. If the talk of a lender of last resort means only that kind of
BIS Review   72/19992financial assistance, I don’t mind. Even though that expression might not be absolutely accurate. Butwe should not argue about words.But if lender of last resort in a broader sense means that draining liquidity and offering generous oreven unlimited credit lines should be regarded as main response and that the international communityshould place its highest priority on such measures, I would be strongly opposed. A lender of lastresort of that kind may be of intellectual interest for academic textbooks. In reality, such a role for theIMF or another institution would severely hamper the functioning of the markets.The main point is: Whatever the international community intends to do, the measure should — as faras possible — avoid creating incentives for moral hazard behaviour. For domestic policy-makers, thismeans that international assistance must not be seen as insurance either against dangerous exchangerate experiments or against a loss of credibility. For the markets, there should as few incentives aspossible to underrate country-specific risks based on the hope of a later bail-out.So, in the first place, financial crisis and systemic risk do not lead to the question of the lender of lastresort. Instead, they lead to the question how to improve the framework. And that was the backgroundto my report I presented to the Group of Seven (G-7) Ministers and Governors at their meeting inBonn on February 20, 1999. Professor Illing asked me to add some remarks on that report. I willfollow that suggestion.IIIAs you know, my proposal to the G-7 included convening a Forum of Financial Stability.What is the philosophy behind that proposal?Firstly, there is the conviction that sweeping institutional changes are not necessary. Instead, a processto improve coordination between existing national and international authorities and groupings isimportant for improving the functioning of the market and, in doing so, promoting the stability of thefinancial system.Secondly, a permanent body which brings together major experts on supervisory issues, eithertechnical or political representatives, either at the national or at the international level has morepotential to be a driving force for practical change than several ad-hoc-groups may have.How is the Forum composed?Members of the Forum are: representatives of the IFIs, the BIS and the OECD, representatives of keyinternational regulatory groupings, namely the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, IOSCO, theInternational Association of Insurance Supervisors, central bank experts concerned with marketinfrastructure from the Committee on Payment & Settlement Systems and the Committee on theGlobal Financial System and — not least — representatives of the national authorities — theministries of Finance, central banks and senior supervisory authorities — initially of the G-7countries.What is the Forum’s field of activity? The G-7 report identifies three areas where improvement isnecessary.The first potential area concerns the assessment of vulnerabilities affecting the global financialsystem. These kinds of information-pooling-and-processing activity must be clearly separated fromnormal macro-economic policy assessment. The Forum should obviously not attempt the IMF’ssystematic surveillance of individual countries, although cases may arise where financialvulnerabilities in individual counties merit the Forum’s attention.
3BIS Review   72/1999A second potential area of activity for the Forum is identifying and overseeing actions needed toaddress the vulnerabilities affecting the global financial system, including encouraging thedevelopment or strengthening of international best practice and standards and defining priorities foraddressing and implementing them.A third potential area of activity for the Forum is improving mutual coordination and the exchange ofinformation among the various authorities responsible for financial stability (a sort of permanentround-table). In this respect, the forum should be a vehicle for the regular in-depth exchange ofinformation among the international financial institutions and the international regulatory groupings.How should the Forum work?The Forum should not duplicate work being undertaken elsewhere. The Forum should, rather, workthrough its members, taking due account of their comparative advantages. Specifically, the Forumshould bring together information about activities taking place in diverse groupings and coordinateoverlapping activities. In addition, the Forum should identify gaps in existing work, and proposeappropriate means of filling such gaps. Finally, the Forum should, wherever possible, aim to produceconcrete, implementable recommendations, as distinct from analytical reports stating alternativeviews. And it should monitor the implementation of those recommendations.IVTwo particular points have to be addressed further.Firstly, the involvement of the private sector. The Forum is asked to find flexible ways of drawing onprivate sector expertise. One way is for the Forum to meet with the private sector immediately beforeor after the meeting. It would also be possible for sub-groups of Forum members to meet the privatesectors on other occasions.Secondly, countries outside the G-7 should be more involved. That can be done either be invitingqualified experts from outside the G-7 to contribute to the activities of the Working Groups. Or byinviting representatives from national authorities as guests in the forthcoming regular meeting of theForum.In the meanwhile, the first meeting has taken place. Upon my proposal, the G-7 Ministers andGovernors have appointed Andrew Crockett to be the Chairman of the Forum for three years. Thatguarantees the necessary experience as well as continuity. Three Working Groups have beenestablished:- The Working Group on Highly Leveraged Activities and Institutions; Howard Davis (UK) hasthe chair.- The Working Group on Short-term Capital Flows; Mario Draghi (Italy) has the chair.- The Working Group on Offshore Centres; John Palmer (Canada) has the chair.The second meeting is scheduled for mid-September. I am personally following the work of theForum with great interest, of course, but also at some distance because from September 1st onwards Ishall be only an outside observer, but an interested one.And let me end with the following remark: if the Forum can help to improve the internationalfinancial framework, it may make a greater contribute to coping with systemic risk than a lender oflast resort ever could.
BIS Review   72/19994
1BIS Review   71/1999Mr Meyer’s remarks on market discipline as a component of banking supervision andregulationSpeech by Mr Laurence H Meyer, a member of the Board of Governors of the US FederalReserve System, at the conference on Reforming Bank Capital Standards in New York on 14June 1999.Good afternoon. The topic of this conference – reforming bank capital  standards – could notbe more timely. Reform is very much an issue on the minds of all supervisors and marketparticipants. But regulatory capital standards are only one component of the overallframework for maintaining bank safety and soundness. This overall framework can bedescribed, as in the consultative paper recently released by the Basle Supervisors Committee,in terms of “three pillars” – bank supervision, market discipline, and regulatory capitalstandards.There are two approaches to assessing the adequacy of the overall framework. First, we couldconsider merely rebalancing the existing components, in search of the most efficientcombination. Some have argued, for example, that enhancing market discipline could permitreduced reliance on the more intrusive and burdensome regulatory and supervisorycomponents. Second, to the extent that recent changes in banking and financial markets havemade bank regulation and supervision more difficult, we may also need to incrementallyimprove capital standards and supervisory practices as well as enhance market discipline.My remarks today will focus on the market-discipline component of the three-pillarsframework, specifically on how we might enhance market discipline in banking as we adapt tochanges in banking and financial markets that have made bank supervision and regulationmore difficult. There is an irony here in that it might take additional regulation – for example,increased disclosures and/or a mandatory subordinated debt  requirement – to enhance marketdiscipline. I will also discuss practical issues that must be considered and questions that mustbe answered if we are to move in this direction.Adapting to changeAs we all know, financial markets and institutions are evolving at a rapid and unprecedentedpace. This evolution has been driven in part by statutory reforms and dramatic regulatorychanges. The abolition of interstate banking constraints has allowed for the creation of agrowing number of very large banking organizations. The erosion of legal and regulatorybarriers has permitted banking organizations to expand their scope of activities. And both therelaxation of trade barriers and the freer flow of capital have facilitated the operation of banksacross national boundaries.Financial and technological innovations have had an equally dramatic effect on financialmarkets and institutions. As a result of technological innovations, the increased speed andreduced cost of transacting have improved the depth and liquidity of financial markets. Theseimprovements, together with advances in financial theory, have led to the adoption of new andarguably more complex tools for measuring, taking, and controlling risks.
BIS Review   71/19992The growing size and complexity of banking organizations make the supervisor’s job ofprotecting bank safety and soundness increasingly difficult. Size, scope, and complexitysimply make it more difficult for supervisors to understand and evaluate bank positions andoperations. In response, heightened supervisory focus on risk-management procedures andpolicies has been under way for some time. This focus recognizes that a bank’s own risk-management process is the linchpin for controlling risks. However, while new procedures,policies, and tools for risk management may ultimately buttress supervision and regulation,these tools are based on relatively recent financial theories that have yet to be tested under thefull range of market conditions. Moreover, the sophistication and complexity of these newtools often make it more difficult, not less, for supervisors to assess the true risk of a bankingorganization and to assign appropriate capital requirements. Adding to these difficulties,supervisors must account for risk exposures that are altered at an ever faster pace.We have often said that, in this environment, we want supervision and regulation to simulateor mimic market discipline in the sense of creating the proper incentives, costs, and rewards. Ialso believe that we ought – where we can – to skip the middlemen and go right to our firstline of defense: market discipline. By aligning market incentives with regulatory incentives,policies designed to harness market forces could complement bank supervision byencouraging banks to refrain from excessive risk-taking.Indeed, I believe that market discipline is a particularly attractive tool for encouraging safetyand soundness in a rapidly evolving environment. Market discipline is inherently flexible andadaptive with respect to innovations, since market participants have incentives to change theways that they evaluate risks as innovations are adopted.Market discipline as a complement to supervision and regulationBefore discussing how market discipline might complement bank supervision and regulation,it is useful to discuss how market discipline works. It seems to operate through two channels.“Direct” market discipline is exerted through risk-sensitive debt instruments when a bankingorganization’s expected cost of issuing those instruments increases substantially with anincrease in its risk profile. For this to occur, investors must gather and collect informationabout the banking organization’s risks and prospects, and then incorporate that informationinto their decisions to buy the organization’s debt. The anticipation of higher funding costsprovides an incentive for the banking organization to refrain from excessive risk-taking.“Indirect” market discipline is exerted through risk-sensitive debt and equity instrumentswhen private parties, and possibly government supervisors, monitor secondary market pricesof those instruments in order to help determine the risk exposure (or default probability) of abanking organization. In response to perceived increases in bank risk, such parties could thentake a variety of actions that increase bank operating costs. For example, purchasers of bankclaims could increase the bank’s cost of funds and limit its supply of credit, and both privatecounterparties and supervisors could reduce the bank’s ability to engage in certain types ofcontracts. The anticipation of these actions, which are essentially various types of penalties,provides banking organizations with incentives to refrain from excessive risk-taking.Market discipline does not come naturally to banking. The federal safety net limits directmarket discipline because it reduces the demand for disclosure and the risk-sensitivity of debtholders. Clearly, insured depositors have almost no incentive to penalize banks for excessive
3BIS Review   71/1999risk-taking. And, uninsured depositors, because of depositor preference laws, may alsoperceive relatively little need to impose higher costs on banks for excessive risk-taking. Giventhese incentives, secondary market rates and spreads on these debt instruments would beinadequate – if not irrelevant – barometers of a bank’s risks and would therefore generate littleindirect market discipline. Further, the real and perceived  certification of soundness providedby supervisory authorities may also reduce the demand for disclosures and the risk-sensitivityof debt holders. Compounding these disincentives for investors to evaluate bank risks, theraison d’être of banks is that these institutions provide credit in environments characterized byasymmetric information. Therefore, banks are inherently opaque and difficult to assess.Nevertheless, there seems to be fairly strong statistical and anecdotal evidence supporting theview that both direct and indirect market discipline currently are exerted on large bankingorganizations. With respect to direct market discipline, econometric studies of the relationshipbetween deposit growth and portfolio risk have generally found that uninsured depositorholdings decline with increases in the depository institution’s risk. And, other econometricstudies have found that rates on uninsured certificates of deposit are sensitive to measures ofrisk. Supervisory experience is consistent with both of these observations.Other types of bank liabilities also appear to be sensitive to risk. For example, during periodsof financial stress, riskier banking organizations tend voluntarily not to issue subordinateddebt. This is precisely what would be expected if the subordinated debt market imposed riskpremiums on banking organizations. Above and beyond this implication that issuance costsare risk sensitive, this empirical evidence suggests that direct market discipline is substantialenough in the subordinated debt market to affect actual decisions made by bankingorganizations.The evidence with respect to indirect market discipline is also encouraging. Studies that haveconsidered recent secondary market spreads on subordinated debt have found them to bestatistically sensitive to various measures of risk. Importantly, while risk-sensitivity ofsubordinated debt spreads is necessary for market participants to exert indirect marketdiscipline on banking organizations, it is not sufficient. Market participants outside of thesubordinated debt market also must monitor these spreads to assess the condition of thebanking organization. Indeed, market participants confirm that the “Street,” not just the bondmarket, appears to pay considerable attention to such spreads. On balance, the empiricalevidence together with anecdotal evidence from the market indicates that secondary marketsubordinated debt spreads are generating indirect market discipline on banking organizations.While market discipline is currently exerted directly and indirectly on large U.S. bankingorganizations, the strength of this discipline could be enhanced by policymakers in a numberof promising ways. For example, a policy improving disclosures of bank risk exposures andinternal capital assessments could potentially improve the market’s ability to assess risks.Another option is for supervisory policy to enhance indirect market discipline by linkingsupervisory actions to secondary market information. For example, secondary marketinformation could be used to help time bank examinations, to possibly limit bank activities, orto potentially raise bank capital requirements. In this way, market discipline might strengthenbank supervision. While the evidence is not yet clear whether secondary market indicatorsprovide information that the supervisor does not yet have, at worst such indicators couldconfirm supervisory views or could prompt supervisors to reassess their appraisals of banks.
BIS Review   71/19994Using subordinated debt to enhance market disciplineA promising approach to enhance market discipline, which has received considerable renewedattention of late, is to adopt a subordinated debt policy. There are a number of features ofsubordinated debt that make it particularly attractive for providing increased marketdiscipline. First of all, subordinated debt is the most junior of all bank liabilities. Therefore,these bondholders are the least likely to be bailed out in the event of bank failure, and themost likely to demand disclosures of a bank’s condition. Second, subordinated debt holdersdo not partake in the upside gains associated with risk-taking. Hence, at least in principle, theissuance and secondary market spreads on subordinated debt should be particularly sensitiveto banking organization risk. In contrast, since equity holders may also benefit from the upsidegains associated with risk-taking, equity issuance may provide inadequate direct marketdiscipline, and the signals of bank risk derived from secondary market prices may be blurredand difficult to interpret.In addition, subordinated debt has a relatively long maturity. This feature magnifies the risk-sensitivity of the debt and reduces the probability of a “silent run” on the bank occurring whenthe debt becomes due. Subordinated debt issued in place of insured deposits also provides anextra “cushion” for the deposit insurance fund in the event of bank failure. Subordinated debtis also attractive from a market discipline perspective because there exists a well-established,deep, and fairly liquid market for such instruments. Market participants claim that bond issuesof $150 million or more are traded in liquid markets – a requirement satisfied by very largebank holding companies and a much smaller number of very large banks. The standardizationof publicly traded subordinated debt of banking organizations is also striking and desirablefrom a market discipline perspective. The majority of U.S. bank or (more commonly) holdingcompany subordinated debt instruments being issued today are fixed-rate, noncallable, 10-yearmaturity bonds with few bells and whistles. These two features of the market, liquidity andstandardization, facilitate the comparison by market participants of secondary marketsubordinated debt spreads. The finding in recent empirical research that spreads are sensitiveto banking organization risks further supports the depth of the secondary market. Notsurprisingly, market participants claim routinely to monitor such spreads for various peergroups, which is consistent with the imposition of indirect market discipline on these bankingorganizations, and some of this discipline is no doubt passed through to banks, particularly ifthe bank makes up a sizable fraction of the bank holding company.Existing proposalsBased on the appealing characteristics of subordinated debt, many observers have called forrequiring banking organizations to issue subordinated debt and some have also called forfrequent issuance of such debt. Requiring banking organizations to issue subordinated debtfrequently would force them to issue risk-sensitive debt, rather than insured deposits, whenthe bank’s risk has increased. Without such a requirement, there is empirical evidence thatrisky banks tend to shift their funding sources toward insured deposits and away from risk-sensitive securities. This evidence provides important motivation for a policy that wouldrequire a banking organization to regularly issue subordinated debt. In short, mandatory andregular subordinated debt issuance would weaken a banking organization’s ability to shielditself from direct market discipline.
5BIS Review   71/1999Existing proposals for mandatory subordinated debt typically share three common elements:first, that organizations be required to issue subordinated debt; second, that the subordinateddebt be held by independent third parties; and third, that the bank have total subordinated debtoutstanding in excess of 2 percent of its risk-weighted assets. There are, however, a number ofother practical issues that have to be considered in designing an operational mandatorysubordinated debt policy and many of these involve important tradeoffs that have to beweighed in deciding how to proceed.Practical considerations and details of a mandatory subordinated debt proposalOnly large banks? Some proposals would only require large banks to issue subordinated debt.This approach is consistent with a theme I have been emphasizing, the importance ofdifferentiation in regulatory standards and supervisory practice between the largest, mostcomplex and  internationally active banks and all others. As we begin to think of reform of thecapital standards, for example, I expect we will move to a bifurcated approach in the UnitedStates, applying the revised Basle Accord only to large, complex, and internationally activebanks and designing a simpler, less burdensome approach for the overwhelming majority ofU.S. banks. In our supervisory program, the Federal Reserve is already focusing increasedattention on a small number of large, complex domestic and foreign-owned bankingorganizations. It is sensible that any effort to enhance market discipline should also be focusedon those banks.Several arguments can be advanced that suggest that a policy focused on large banks wouldget the most bang for the regulatory buck. Such banks hold the most significant systemic riskpotential, and most of the banking system’s assets are in such organizations. These are theinstitutions that have become larger, more varied in their services and practices, and are morecomplex and, as a result, are more difficult to supervise. It is also the case that subordinateddebt issues of the largest banks are more likely to be large enough to ensure a liquid marketfor the instrument. Finally, large banking organizations are already voluntarily issuing asignificant amount of subordinated debt, so that a mandatory policy could be introduced withminimal transition costs.Bank or bank holding company? Interestingly, the top fifty U.S. insured commercial banks onaverage already finance in excess of 2 percent of their risk weighted assets with subordinateddebt. Thus, many large banks already issue subordinated debt in the amounts stipulated inmany of the existing subordinated debt proposals. This is not to say, however, that a 2 percentsubordinated debt requirement would have no bite. Currently, most bank subordinated debt isheld by the parent holding company and hence is not traded. Thus requiring a bank to issuetradable debt would likely increase both direct and indirect discipline. Moreover, in theabsence of such a requirement, risky banking organizations could shift into risk-insensitivedeposits and, in effect, avoid market discipline. With the requirement, this option would beclosed and riskier banks would have higher funding costs.Most of the largest bank holding companies already have 2 percent or more of their risk-weighted assets in subordinated debt, and, in this case, the debt is publicly traded. While suchdebt issue is voluntary, these organizations typically come to the market to issue subordinateddebt at  least once or twice a year.
BIS Review   71/19996Most subordinated debt proposals focus on banks, however, and there are strong public policyreasons for doing so. Insured commercial banks have direct access to the federal safety net,and thus, banks are where the dangers of moral hazard and the consequent risks to thetaxpayer are concentrated. The commercial bank is the primary concern of supervision andregulation, and where the supervisors most need the market’s help. It follows that asubordinated debt policy should be focused on banks and not on their parent or affiliateorganizations. In addition, subordinated debt issued at the bank level can provide increasedprotection for the deposit insurance fund. And, a policy focused on banks would reinforce theregulatory philosophy that the safety net and associated policies are limited to just commercialbanks.How frequently should debt issuance be required? In the design of a subordinated debt policy,one also needs to analyze what frequency of issuance would be required. On the one hand,frequent issuance could improve the quality of the signals provided by spreads ofsubordinated debt in the secondary market, because the issuance process generally involvesincreased disclosure. This boost in the information content of secondary prices may beparticularly important during periods of financial stress. More generally, frequent renewal ofthe information content of secondary prices may be highly beneficial as financial andtechnological innovations allow banking organizations to change their financial conditionrapidly. Frequent issuance may also result in lower spreads as the market’s familiarity with theissuers increases. This would, of course, reduce the cost of a subordinated debt requirement.On the other hand, a lower required frequency of issuance may allow banks to signal theirfinancial condition through their timing of issuance. Flexibility with respect to issuance mayalso allow banks to avoid the unnecessary cost of issuing subordinated debt during periods inwhich the bond market is turbulent. On balance, a mandated frequency of once or twice a yearwould seem reasonable, and would be in line with current practice for larger bankingorganizations.Should subordinated debt with standardized characteristics be required? There are alsotradeoffs associated with requiring banking organizations to issue a standardized debtinstrument with the same maturity, option characteristics, and covenants. The benefit ofstandardized debt is fairly obvious. It makes it easier for market participants to decipher thesignals of a banking organization’s condition. The costs are also pretty clear. A standardizeddebt instrument could be more costly for some banks to issue than for others because bankcapital structures differ across organizations. And, a standardized debt instrument may be verycostly during certain market conditions. For example, in periods of actual or expected interestrate volatility, spreads on debt without put options may be relatively high. I would expect thatthe benefits of standardization in ensuring a purer signal about the relative risk of differentbanking institutions would outweigh the costs associated with such a restriction.Should put options be required? Some proposals have advocated that the requiredsubordinated debt have put options. These options have been suggested for two reasons. First,they would provide debt holders with a powerful tool for increasing the cost of bank risk-taking. With a put option, debt holders would be able to force early repayment of debt when abank changed its risk profile. Second, under some proposals, put options take the closuredecision out of the hands of the regulators and place it in the hands of the debt holders. Notcoincidentally, these proposals arose in the wake of the savings and loan crisis during which
7BIS Review   71/1999regulators were criticized for their forbearance. Put options may also increase indirectdiscipline if they trigger supervisory actions.As disciplinary as they may be, there are strong arguments against the inclusion of putoptions. First, the exercise of put options can be extremely Draconian, inducing liquidationsand possibly premature closures. Second, the high correlation of risks across banks mayinduce a simultaneous exercise of put options, which could exacerbate or even trigger asystemic crisis.Should there be a cap on the rate paid at issuance for subordinated debt? Other proposalshave advocated that a subordinated debt policy should impose maximum caps on rates orspreads over Treasuries with comparable maturities. The primary appeal of such an approachis that direct market discipline would be relatively strong under a rate cap. Bankingorganizations unable to issue under such a cap would be forced to lower their riskiness byshrinking their assets or by changing their asset mix. A cap could also be used to strengthenindirect discipline. A banking organization’s inability to issue subordinated debt under the capwould send a “red flag” to the market. Alternatively, the cap could be used to triggersupervisory action in the same way that a banking organization’s capital ratios currentlytrigger prompt corrective action.The downside of a cap is that it would be difficult, perhaps in practice impossible, todetermine the optimal rate or spread that should serve as a cap, particularly since the optimalcap would vary with bond market and macroeconomic conditions. A fixed cap might harshlypunish all banking organizations unnecessarily when the bond market is highly illiquid. Afixed cap might also be highly procyclical. Banking organizations would be forced to shrink,change their asset mix, or face supervisory discipline during downturns because spreadswould be more likely to run into a fixed cap at such times. While some procyclical effects ofmarket discipline are unavoidable, a fixed rate cap may make a market discipline policy soseverely procyclical as to be undesirable from a macroeconomic perspective.As one considers the various features that have been recommended in the existingsubordinated debt proposals, it is important to keep in mind that there are strong reasons tostay closely aligned with current market practices and conventions. Capitalizing on suchconventions could, of course, reduce the potential costs of a subordinated debt policy. And, atthe same time, a subordinated debt policy aligned with such conventions could be veryeffective. Given the current deep and liquid markets for subordinated debt, such a policywould likely improve the information content of secondary market debt spreads. Thesespreads would facilitate an increase in indirect market discipline.Questions about the value of a subordinated debt requirementIt is important to recognize that the costs and benefits of a subordinated debt policy – evenone tailored to current market conventions – would vary over time.Subordinated debt in times of stress. A mandatory subordinated debt requirement would likelybe most costly to banking organizations when either the markets are under stress, the economyis deteriorating, or the bank itself is in financial difficulty. During these periods, the cost ofissuing risk-sensitive securities would likely increase, and, at such times, forced issuance ofsubordinated debt would be particularly costly.
BIS Review   71/19998I believe proposals that increase market discipline inevitably risk aggravating instability intimes of overall stress. Eliminating deposit insurance, for example, would have the samequalitative outcome. The key in designing approaches to enhance market discipline istherefore to ensure a favorable tradeoff – sufficiently better controlled risk-taking in goodtimes and bad times relative to somewhat aggravated risks during periods of overall stress.Subordinated debt, with its relatively long maturities and therefore limited ability to “run,”appears to offer such a favorable tradeoff..The cost of reduced funding flexibility. Another major cost of a subordinated debt proposalwould be the reduced flexibility in financing, resulting in a somewhat higher cost of financingthan would otherwise be available. These higher costs may also vary with business conditions,market conditions, and banking conditions.One of the ironies of a subordinated debt proposal is that it suggests that additional regulationis required to induce additional market discipline. Regulations are never costless, so we must,therefore, ask what additional costs might be imposed as a consequence of the mandate.Of course, to the extent that the proposal follows existing market conventions – in terms ofthe amount, frequency, etc. – the incremental costs are limited, though, of course, so are thebenefits. It is therefore important to be satisfied that the benefits outweigh the costs.More research is importantA subordinated debt proposal is, in my judgment, promising and intriguing. Still, there remainquestions to be answered. To move in the direction of answers, the Federal Reserve isworking to improve the data it has available on the market price of subordinated debt issuedby banks and bank holding companies, as well as other market data that could be useful insignaling changes in the risk profiles of banking organizations. We will be evaluating thedegree to which prices of market instruments track the changing risk profiles of bankingorganizations, assessing the usefulness of such market signals in the surveillance of thefinancial conditions of large, complex banking organizations, and evaluating the potentialusefulness of such data in the supervisory process. We believe that before we seriouslyconsider imposing a mandate related to subordinated debt, we should carefully study how theexisting market functions and the degree to which current practices may already be fulfillingmany of the objectives of a mandatory system.In addition, we will be focusing increased research effort on topics related to market disciplinein general and subordinated debt in particular. We must get a reasonable estimate of howmuch additional market discipline would be imposed by forced issuance of risk-sensitive debt.How much more effective would subordinated debt holders be than uninsured deposit holderswhen they raise funding costs for a risky bank? Does the strength of penalties associated withbank debt issuance vary systematically across bank liabilities or with the business cycle? Thisresearch may also help us understand how to strike a balance between supervision, regulation,and market discipline in order to most effectively achieve the safety and soundness of ourfinancial system.Conclusion
9BIS Review   71/1999I hope my review of the difficulties and challenges associated with developing anoperationally feasible market discipline policy has not been disheartening. Such has not beenmy intention. Rather, I have sought to realistically review the practical issues and tradeoffsthat need to be resolved. When all is said and done, however, it seems clear that  marketdiscipline remains our first line of defense. It is perhaps the most flexible option formaintaining bank safety and soundness in a rapidly evolving environment and has thepotential to strengthen and complement bank supervision and regulation, particularly on theoutside chance that the market knows best. While I believe that more research is needed tomake the case for a policy to enhance market discipline through subordinated debt, and to pindown the design features of a specific policy for such instruments, we should not ignore theabundant evidence that highlights the promise of market discipline in general and – perhaps –subordinated debt in particular.
1BIS Review   69/1999Mr Reddy looks at external debt policies in emerging economiesSpeech by the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, Dr Y V Reddy, at the Seminaron Corporate External Debt Management in Kathmandu, Nepal, on 11 June 1999.Mr Chairman and friends,At the outset, I would like to express my gratitude to Dr Shanker Acharya, Mr Ravi Mohanand Mr Sanjay Kathuria, who gave me an opportunity to attend this seminar on “CorporateExternal Debt Management”. The deliberations have indeed been a feast and there is nothingbut admiration for the outstanding organisational abilities of all concerned. There has been anideal mix of participants and subjects. In the previous seminar on external debt at Trivandrumlast year, we had flagged the corporate angle to external debt as a priority item. We should allbe happy that the suggestion has been acted upon now. Like the proceedings of the earlierseminar which have been published by the RBI, I hope CRISIL would arrange to get thepapers and proceedings published soon.A number of valuable suggestions have been made in the seminar and some of them areparticularly relevant to the RBI. Some of them require clarifications as to the rationale ofcurrent policies and procedures. A few of them need immediate attention while others have tobe pursued in the medium term. They require careful examination. I assure you that we in theRBI will consider all of them seriously and seek your advice and cooperation.Let me not try to either summarise the highlights of this seminar or respond to the valuableinsights. I intend sharing with you some thoughts on new dimensions in external debt policiesof emerging economies, consequent upon the recent crises in East Asia, Latin America andRussia. New approaches are being advocated in the context of discussions on the newinternational financial architecture.The responses to the recent crises, the follow-up consideration of measures to prevent similarcrises, and possible actions to meet them when they occur, have covered a wide spectrum ofpolicies. The debate covered many policy issues: domestic and external, macro and micro,financial and regulatory, national and multilateral, relating to both developed and emergingeconomies. Eminent academics have also contributed to the debate. At policy level, there havebeen discussions in G-7, G-24, and the newly founded G-22, G-33 and Financial StabilityForum, not to speak of the Commonwealth Secretariat, UN, IMF, World Bank and BIS. Indiahas been invited to participate in most of these. In all these deliberations, external debtpolicies were a crucial part. Perhaps this is an ideal forum to describe these new dimensionsbriefly and narrate the Indian position.The new dimensions relating to external debt policies can be analysed under five broad heads,viz.: level of reserves and external debt; maturity pattern; issues relating to short-term debt;policies relating to transparency and standards; and involving the private sector in forestallinga debt crisis.Level of Reserves and External DebtThere has always been a continuous but inconclusive discussion on the optimum level ofreserves. Traditionally, however, the adequacy of reserves has been mainly linked to importrequirements. Incidentally, recent experience has shown that countries which were holdinglarge levels of reserves did not necessarily escape the crisis. This shows the importance ofappropriate policies and avoidance of excessive comfort from level of reserves. Nevertheless,the level of reserves continues to be an important source of comfort on matters relating to
BIS Review   69/19992stability in the external sector, and consequently on the domestic economy. Because of theimportance of showing the real level of reserves in a transparent manner, there are increasingefforts to measure unencumbered reserves. The emphasis has also shifted from measuring theadequacy of reserves only in relation to imports to measuring in terms of short-term liabilities,in particular short-term debt.Two notable suggestions in this regard have emanated – one from Pablo Guidotti, DeputyFinance Minister of Argentina, and the second from the Bank for International Settlements.Mr Pablo Guidotti proposed a simple guideline for policy makers in emerging marketeconomies. He suggested that countries should manage their external assets and liabilities insuch a way that they are always able to live without new foreign borrowing for up to one year.In other words, usable foreign exchange reserves should exceed the scheduled amortisation offoreign currency debts (assuming no rollovers) during the following year. In terms of debtmanagement, this implies a limit on the size of the debt, in particular short-term debt and debtthat is falling due for repayment.The BIS, in its latest Annual Report, recognises the importance of countries preparingthemselves for the possibility of sudden outflows, and identifies ways in which reserves canbe built up. One way of doing this is to run trade surpluses and what the BIS terms as a lessdisruptive solution is the Argentine proposal, namely to borrow reserves and arrangecontingent lending facilities with the private sector. In the view of the BIS, “Given the swingsof mood in these markets, the authorities might at certain times find it relatively easy andinexpensive to lock in longer-term foreign currency loans for later use. Finally, countriesmight then make use of the recently announced Contingent Credit Lines offered by the IMF.In conjunction with similar private sector arrangements, this would be a joint testimonial tothe soundness of the country in question and could contribute materially to the avoidance ofcontagion problems”.In a somewhat similar vein, Chairman Greenspan expressed a view that countries could adopta “liquidity-at-risk” standard to manage their exposure to financial risks. This standard wouldgive the ex ante probability that a country would avoid new borrowing for one year, based onthe level of reserves.In India, we have been steadily building up reserves by encouraging non-debt-creating flowsand de-emphasizing debt-creating flows. India’s foreign exchange reserves have been steadilyincreasing over the years. For instance, the last three years saw increases in reserves in therange of $4.7 billion in 1996/97, $2.9 billion in 1997/98 and $3.1 billion in 1998/99, i.e. acumulative $10 billion. However, between end-March 1996 and December 1998, India’s totalexternal debt increased by a mere $2 billion.Our policy of building and maintaining an adequate level of reserves while at the same timeconstraining debt, especially short-term debt, will continue though we would continuouslymonitor the international debate in this regard.Maturity PatternIn many emerging countries, with deregulation and liberalisation, adequate attention has notbeen paid to the maturity profile of the external debt portfolio. In fact, in some cases, eveninformation gathering on this subject was dispensed with as part of deregulation. Determiningthe maturity was a micro decision left to the final borrowers, whose main consideration wascost. Thus, borrowers in many emerging market economies have tended to borrow short witha view to minimising cost. Creditors lent short-term since they expected their claims to mature
3BIS Review   69/1999quickly. The recent crises showed that this could be risky. The policy dimension relating to anappropriate maturity structure, which was earlier viewed as a micro decision, is now beingrecognised as a macro aspect and a stability issue.Elongation of the average maturity ensures a sort of private sector burden sharing in times ofcrisis. It is important to recognise that the insurance embedded in long-term debt oftenoutweighs the cost.These issues have direct relevance to corporates’ access to external funds, both in terms ofcost and the period of borrowing. The cost of borrowing may increase on account of longermaturities, but they will have the comfort of stable flows. In times of crisis, the costs ofdisruption on account of destabilising flows may far exceed the cost of raising longer-termdebt.There are issues on how the policy makers could promote or ensure an optimal maturitystructure. There can be several views on what an optimal maturity itself is. There is oneinfluential view that the average maturity of a country’s external liabilities should exceed acertain threshold, say three years.In India, from 1992, emphasis has been laid not only on the cost and size of debt, but also onthe maturity. The desired maturity profile is taken into account in policy articulation andclearance of individual cases. The average maturity of our ECB, as you may be aware, is fiveyears. Basically, considerations of the size, cost and maturity are embedded in the clearancemechanism for ECB.Thus, the ECB policy, though it is being liberalised gradually, will ensure built-in measurestowards an optimal maturity. The instruments by which this objective is achieved willcontinue to be refined from time to time, taking account of international developments also.Short-Term DebtA major source of vulnerability in the Asian crisis was the large stock of short-term liabilitiesof banks and corporates. In the short-term liabilities, debt constitutes a contractual obligationand is thus on a different footing. As mentioned, the link between short-term debt andreserves has come to the fore in these deliberations. There is a cost to building up reservesthrough large debt flows since the cost of debt would generally be higher than the return onreserves. However, not all short-term flows are bad and some short-term finance is essential tofinance transactions. In fact, it is recognised that trade-related short-term credit is not asvolatile as non-trade-related credit.Overall, there appears to be a consensus now in favour of restraining the inflow of short-termcapital until markets, institutions and regulatory frameworks have been sufficientlystrengthened.There is, however, a growing debate on the means by which short-term flows can becontrolled. Major suggestions relate to effective monitoring, tax on spot transactions, variedreserve requirements, increased capital requirements on interbank transactions, changes incapital adequacy requirements of lending banks to non-OECD countries, and discouraginglocal firms from undertaking external borrowing by imposing taxes. Quantitative controlshave also been recognised as effective.The oft-quoted measure relates to reserve requirements imposed on short-term flows. Chileand Colombia imposed unremunerated reserve requirements of 30 per cent on short-term
BIS Review   69/19994flows, subsequently reduced to 10 per cent. This represented a tax on short-term holdings. Theempirical evidence on its effectiveness is inconclusive.A favourite for economists has been the never-tried Tobin Tax, though it has often beenseriously considered by policy makers. The Tobin Tax proposal envisages a levy of uniformtax on all spot transactions in foreign exchange. The objective is to discourage a one-nightstand by speculators in the foreign exchange market as the tax burden will be inverselyproportional to the maturity of flows. Another economist, Dornbusch, seeks a variant of theTobin tax, viz., to impose a tax on all cross-border flows. This is also on the drawing table sofar.Paul Krugman has recently suggested that emerging nations should consider using taxes todiscourage local firms from borrowing in foreign currencies. Tax at uniform rate will have alarger impact on short-term borrowing, and will thus operate in a somewhat similar way to theTobin tax.The role of financial intermediaries, especially banks, in short-term flows has figuredpredominantly in these deliberations. Alan Greenspan has also proposed imposing increasedcapital requirements on borrowing banks to bring greater discipline to cross-border interbankmarkets.It is now accepted that just as there is no irresponsible borrowing without irresponsiblelending, there is no short-term borrowing without short-term lending. Hence, it is argued thatcapital requirements in the banking system should be so prescribed as to discourage lendingbanks also. In fact, the current policy is biased in favour of short-term lending. The currentBasle Accord provides that all claims on banks incorporated in OECD countries and short-term claims (i.e. up to one year) on banks incorporated in non-OECD countries carries a riskweight of only 20 per cent, whereas long-term claims on banks in non-OECD countries carrya risk weight of 100 per cent. The new Capital Adequacy Framework, which has just beenissued by the BIS as a consultative paper for comments, is reviewing this norm.Most of the above proposals have the effect of increasing the cost of short-term debt. Hence,these developments would be of interest to the corporate sector.In India, we carefully monitor short-term debt. We maintain a difference in treatment betweentrade- and non-trade-related debt. The authorities sanction short-term debt over six months ona case-by-case approval of purpose, amount and terms, within a sub-ceiling of the totalexternal commercial borrowings ceiling. NRI deposits are controlled through specification ofinterest rates or interest rate ceilings for different maturities in respect of deposits in selectschemes. According to the latest Status Report on External Debt circulated by the Ministry ofFinance, our short-term debt is very modest by all criteria.The international consensus on the need for controlling short-term debt vindicates our policythrust with regard to discouraging short-term flows. We will have to continue with theobjective of restricting short-term flows, though the means of doing it could be refined fromtime to time in consonance with domestic and, to some extent, global developments.Policies Relating to Transparency and StandardsA major area of concern has been lack of transparency in regard to macroeconomic andfinancial health. The issue of transparency has generated some debate. Transparency cannot beone-sided – say only by public systems and not the corporate sector. Transparency providesinformation and inference is a matter of interpretation or judgement. There are country-
5BIS Review   69/1999specific circumstances also that govern the degree of transparency, which include the timingof some disclosures.India is one of the earliest members of the SDDS of the IMF. The RBI provides up-to-dateweekly data on all relevant macroeconomic and financial indicators through the WeeklyStatistical Supplement to the RBI Bulletin, which is available on the RBI website. In addition,the RBI and Government disseminates as much information as possible through monthly,quarterly and annual publications.The World Bank, IMF, BIS, OECD and other international institutions are active in theevolution of standards relevant for the functioning of domestic and international financialsystems. These cover a wide range of areas including data dissemination, fiscal, monetary andfinancial policy transparency (IMF), banking regulation and supervision (BIS), securitiesmarket regulation (International Organization of Securities Commissions), insuranceregulation (International Association of Insurance Supervisors), accounting (InternationalAccounting Standards Committee), Auditing (International Federation of Accountants),Bankruptcy (United Nations Commission on International Trade Law) and CorporateGovernance (OECD, World Bank and Basle Committee). In addition, work relating toimproving the robustness of payments systems, general principles of good practices in socialpolicies, identifying practices and structures that support deep and liquid forward markets is inprogress.It would be interesting to see how these standards evolve. While it may not be possible for allcountries to adopt these standards completely and promptly, countries will have to takeaccount of these standards, depending on individual country circumstances.Increasingly, these international standards will have to be adapted to suit local requirements.These will have an impact on our corporates trying to access international markets in terms ofcosts and regulatory compliance. Corporates will need to impute these into their debtmanagement strategies.Role of the Private Sector in Forestalling a CrisisThe efforts to involve the private sector in debt management have many objectives, viz., bringabout a more orderly adjustment process, limit moral hazard, strengthen market discipline,help protect countries against volatility and contagion. The idea is to have mechanisms inplace before any crisis takes place – so that resolution of the crisis is more orderly.While there is consensus regarding the need for the private sector to share the burden,discussions in the various fora have centred on the mode of burden sharing. Ideas that arebeing considered include contingent credit lines, embedded call options, debt-serviceinsurance, bond covenants, bankruptcy procedures, debt standstill and creditor-debtorcouncils.Basically, these mechanisms bind private sector participants to either provide additionalfunds, or reduce debt service burdens in times of crisis without creating moral hazard ordisrupting the normal market conditions. For instance, countries could contract market-basedContingent Credit Lines with commercial banks to trigger liquidity support in times of crisis.If the credit lines are fairly priced, they could provide effective insurance against adversemarket developments. Call options on interbank credit lines would provide the basis for theextension of maturities during times of trouble. Standstill arrangements will allow the privatesector to give additional borrowing when there has been a default on existing debt. Creditor-debtor councils could serve to improve the flow of information. Bond and debt covenants
BIS Review   69/19996could introduce sharing clauses, provisions for the modification of terms by qualifiedmajorities will speed up the negotiation process. There is also a suggestion that the G-10countries could start including these new contractual terms in their fresh sovereign bondissues in order to initiate the demonstration effect.Another proposal relates to a universal debt rollover option with a penalty. The idea is that allforeign currency debt should have attached to it an option, exercisable at the discretion of theborrower, to roll over the liability at a penalty rate.It is too early to comment on how these suggestions would evolve. These deliberations andtheir outcomes are of interest not only to the Government of India and the RBI, but to thecorporates, since these would impinge on their operations. I trust that financial intermediariesare closely following these developments. The RBI would welcome and indeed invitesuggestions in these matters.When I started this address, I expressed happiness over the focus on the corporate angle toexternal debt in this seminar. Encouraged by the response, I have a suggestion for the nextseminar. It would be worthwhile if the next seminar focuses on external debt management byfinancial intermediaries, viz., banks, financial development institutions and non-bankfinancial companies. The discussions could include risk management systems.
1BIS Review   68/1999Mr Duisenberg reports on developments in the financial sector in Europe following theintroduction of the euroSpeech by Dr Willem F Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, delivered at the ThirdEuropean Financial Markets Convention in Milan on 3 June 1999.1. IntroductionThe period of the five months following the introduction of the euro has been very rich in new events,with significant developments taking place both in the continental securities markets and in thefinancial system as a whole. Although experience has been gathered over a relatively short period oftime, I am tempted to make two observations of a fundamental nature.The first observation is that developments following the introduction of the euro do not imply that theeuro area is set to become a financial fortress whose financial markets and institutions would be cutoff from the rest of the world. In fact, market participants residing outside the euro area seem to betaking a keen interest in the financial markets of the euro area. “Core Europe”, so to speak, hasbecome more interesting to outsiders as the breadth and liquidity of its financial markets haveincreased.The second observation is that the euro can be expected to have a significant influence on thestructure of the financial system by bringing about more securitisation. A traditional feature of thefinancial system of continental Europe has been a marked dependency on the funds intermediated bybanks. This feature contrasts with the financial system of the United States, which is much moresecuritised. For instance, corporate bonds have not been very widely issued in the euro area, and stockmarket capitalisation – relative to the size of the economy – is much lower in the euro area than in theUnited States. There are good reasons to believe that a process of securitisation will gather pace in theeuro area now that the single currency is in use. This view seems to be shared by many observers andI shall, in the course of my remarks, provide some arguments in its favour.In my remarks today, I should like to discuss the structural changes in the financial sector, inparticular those that have occurred as a result of the launch of new product types and the changingnature of public and private institutions. I shall address developments in the money markets, the bondmarkets and the equity markets as well as the process of adaptation of banking institutions to theirnew environment.2. Money marketsThe money markets of the euro area became rapidly integrated after the introduction of the eurodespite the fact that their structures had previously been quite different at the national level.Transaction volumes and measures of bid-ask spreads on the various money market instruments bothindicate that the markets reached a very high level of liquidity very rapidly in the course of January1999 and have subsequently retained it.The high degree of integration of the euro area money markets is, first of all, a result of the singlemonetary policy, which is conducted through the harmonised operational framework of theEurosystem. This integration has also been made possible by the significant and increasing integrationof payment systems. Cross-border payments processed by TARGET accounted for more than 37% ofthe value of all real-time payments (domestic and cross-border) effected by credit institutions inMarch and April 1999. Moreover, the continuously high use which our counterparties make of thecorrespondent central banking model (or CCBM) for the cross-border transfer of collateral inmonetary policy operations is an important indication of area-wide integration. This is evidenced bythe fact that cross-border collateral currently represents around 25% of the total amount of collateralin custody in the context of the Êurosystem’s monetary policy operations.
BIS Review   68/19992Taking a closer look at the various instruments traded in the money markets, a feature that is worthyof note is that market participants in the 11 countries of the euro area have shown an increasingtendency to demonstrate a similar reliance on each instrument type. For example, what we call“overnight indexed swaps”, which are swaps indexed on the overnight reference interest rate EONIA,have become an important derivative instrument in the money markets of the euro area. This can beseen from the low level of quoted bid-ask spreads and the high turnover relative to other majorinternational markets. Both indicators show a high level of liquidity in this instrument. Another typeof instrument of interest in the money market (but also at the fringe of the bond market) is that of therepurchase agreement. The development of more integrated repo markets in the euro area willobviously accompany the development of area-wide securities trading, settlement and custodysystems. This will reduce transaction costs and improve efficiency for the cross-border transfer ofsecurities through repurchase operations.Looking ahead, other developments in the money markets are expected in the coming months. Thereare aims to establish new area-wide standards for the repo markets, with a view to overcoming theseparation between different models in the national markets. These new standards could obviously co-exist with other standards and broader conventions for international transactions. In fact, over the lastfew months the European Central Bank (ECB) has been examining whether this co-existence couldaffect the integration of money markets. We have come to the conclusion that, in particular owing tothe efforts of the sponsors of the different standards, this should not be considered a threat.Finally, it should also be noted that national and international central securities depositories arecurrently developing links with one another, which will enable participants in one country to makedirect use of securities deposited in other countries. Twenty-six of these links (concerning mainlyBelgium, Germany, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria and Finland) may be used by theEurosystem.3. Bond marketsI should now like to turn to bond markets and first to comment on the position of euro area bondmarkets in the global market. Some data sources on international securities issuance available so farshow a pattern of increased reliance on euro-denominated bonds at the beginning of 1999, inparticular as opposed to US dollar-denominated bonds. While it remains difficult to draw firmconclusions on the determinants of bond denomination choices without considering information onthe nature of bond holdings and trading patterns, recent bond issuance volumes indicate that the eurohas the potential to become an important currency for international bond issuance.The importance of the euro area bond market is also apparent in measures of secondary marketactivity, i.e. turnover or trading volumes. In particular, trading volumes on exchange-traded bondfutures are indicative of the overall degree of market activity. Volumes traded in euro-denominatedbond futures were low shortly before the changeover to the euro, when the bond markets in the euroarea were exceptionally quiet. Since then, volumes have increased markedly and they currently standat consistently high levels, which indicates a continuously high degree of turnover in euro-denominated bond markets in general.Turning to the internal structure of the bond markets of the euro area, I should like to make an initialobservation related to the recent marked increase in euro-denominated corporate bond issuance,which was accompanied by an increase in the average size of issues. This tendency is likely tocontinue in the future, in particular to the extent that bonds may be used by firms to finance increasingmergers and acquisitions activity in the euro area. The underlying reasons for increased bond issuanceby euro area firms are clear, both on the supply and on the demand side. On the supply side, largefirms with good credit ratings will find opportunities in the increased depth and liquidity of the euroarea bond market. On the demand side, the respect by governments of the parameters of the Stabilityand Growth Pact over the medium term should leave more room for the private sector to issue debtsecurities. In addition, the euro area must be in a position to save in order to be able to take care of its
3BIS Review   68/1999future pension payments, and a part of these savings is likely to be invested in corporate debtsecurities. An increase in global demand for euro-denominated debt securities is also expected as theeuro becomes a major reserve currency. Moreover, the demand for higher risk euro-denominated debtsecurities is likely to increase, particularly as the current low level of sovereign yields increasesincentives to search for higher yields.With regard to the government bond markets, an issue of importance for the euro area that I shouldlike to stress is the fact that governments now find themselves in a rather new position as issuers. Thisreflects a number of developments, two of which I should particularly like to mention. First, the majorpublic issuers have attempted to position themselves as providers of benchmarks for euro-denominated bond markets. Second, certain issues of government bonds have effectively gained largerportions of secondary markets, in particular in relation to developments that have occurred on bondfutures markets.Market participants have responded to these developments in the bond markets with a range ofconcurring or competing initiatives and alliances. In the derivatives industry, market participants haveestablished new alliances. On the trading side, electronic cross-border platforms for bonds have beencreated or are in the process of being developed. On the clearing side, integrated platforms fordifferent markets have been launched or are being finalised, while, finally, on the securities settlementside, initiatives have also been launched. It is important to note that while some of these developmentsare internal to the euro area, others aim at creating links with financial markets outside the euro area.One may reasonably expect that all of these new circuits, as well as others, may in the future beenlarged to encompass a growing number of market participants.4. Equity marketsTurning to equity markets, structural developments of most interest relate to the infrastructure ofstock exchanges on the one hand and equity derivative exchanges on the other. First, within the euroarea, equity investment and trading activities appear to be less and less influenced by country-specificfactors and increasingly subject to area-wide considerations. Consistent with this development, area-wide equity indices have been developing. Market participants are showing considerable interest inthese area-wide indices, in particular as they are also now adopting investment positions on area-wideindustrial sectors, using the sub-indices made available for that purpose. An indication of the degreeof interest raised by area-wide indices is the relatively fierce competition for benchmark status thathas developed between the various proponents of area-wide indices.Second, market developments in relation to stock index futures and options will reflect the rise ofarea-wide indices. This may in turn lead to either consolidation or product specialisation of equityderivative exchanges. For my part, I consider the development of fair competition between exchangesto be a positive factor in terms of the improvement of the range of products and services available tothe financial industry.Third, in the equity market the euro has also provided a powerful incentive for the creation of new –and possibly competing – alliances among exchanges. Before the launch of the single currency,circuits had been created for the launch of integrated “new markets” within and beyond the euro area,encompassing the shares of small and medium-sized companies with a high potential for growth. Thedevelopment in the integration of exchanges has also continued more recently, and, as you know, ithas not been limited to the euro area.5. BankingIn the field of banking, the securitisation trend appears to demand strategic and organisationaladjustment on the part of banks. The relative importance of the more traditional types of bankingactivity can be seen to be decreasing, even though it should be mentioned that traditional bankingactivities have nonetheless continued to grow at a rate exceeding that of growth of nominal GDP. In
BIS Review   68/19994the euro area, growth in recent years has been much more rapid in assets under the management ofmutual funds and other institutional investors than in the assets of banks. This reflects a tendencytowards decreasing the relative weight of bank deposits compared with securities in financial wealth.The euro area banking industry has reacted to this development already by diversifying into the assetmanagement area. Banking groups have been able to “internalise” a significant part of thesecuritisation tendency as they control a large majority of the mutual funds. As a result of thesecuritisation trend, there has been an increase in the share of security holdings among bank assets,and an increase in the share of capital gains – although those are quite cyclically sensitive – as well asin fee income stemming from asset management services. Meanwhile, the relative importance ofinterest income has declined correspondingly. At the bank level, dividend income from equityparticipations has generally become much more important, indicating an increase in the importance ofthe profit generated by non-bank subsidiaries.Beside the establishment of non-bank subsidiaries, there have been other strategic and organisationalchanges that have resulted in banks strengthening their securities-related activities. In particular,significant motives behind the recent merger trend seem to include the desire to increase bank sizeand hence to be able to operate efficiently in wholesale securities markets as well as to be able tocater for the needs of large international corporations for investment banking services.The trend towards securitisation can be regarded as one of the reasons for the structural changes in thebanking system that appears to have accelerated recently. There have naturally also been otherreasons why banks have sought to merge, predominantly the need to cut capacity and to reduce costs.These cost-driven mergers have taken place primarily among smaller banks.6. ConclusionIn my remarks today, I have referred to a number of changes and market initiatives in the euro areafinancial landscape. These developments point to the increasing importance of the fixed income andequity markets that many expected in Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU),providing new opportunities for borrowers and investors and causing pressure to adjust for financialinstitutions. In this respect, I should like to mention the importance of removing the remainingregulatory barriers to the further development of the securities markets. To this end, the EuropeanCommission has recently published an Action Plan of regulatory changes to improve the singlemarket for financial services that would certainly – when implemented – boost the integration andmarket-driven development of the European securities markets.Finally, I should like to conclude with some remarks about the role of the Eurosystem (the term thatwe use to mean the ECB and the 11 national central banks of the Member States participating in StageThree of EMU) in the developments in the financial sector in Europe. First of all, the Eurosystemcontributes to developments in the financial sector by providing it with a stable and credible monetarypolicy. With a strong and credible commitment to its primary objective, price stability, theEurosystem has created a situation in which the financial sector can concentrate on those issues thatare of the greatest relevance to its activities.The Eurosystem does not play a direct role in structural developments in the financial sector. With itssingle monetary policy framework and TARGET in particular, the Eurosystem has created aninfrastructure that has proved to be useful for the establishment of an integrated money market in theeuro area.In addition, the Eurosystem carefully monitors structural developments in the financial sectorto the extent that they might have an impact on the conduct of monetary policy. To make afinal point, in observing developments in the financial sector, the Eurosystem constantly takesaccount of the fact that one of its tasks, laid down in the Treaty establishing the EuropeanCommunity, is to “contribute to the smooth conduct of policies pursued by the competent
5BIS Review   68/1999authorities relating to (…) the stability of the financial system” [(Article 105 (5))]. Analysis ofthe common developments in the European financial system represents such a contribution.
1BIS Review   67/1999Mr Meyer’s remarks at the Conference of State Bank SupervisorsRemarks by Mr Laurence H Meyer, member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve, atthe Conference of State Bank Supervisors, Williamsburg, Virginia on 3 June 1999.Moving Forward into the 21st CenturyIt is a pleasure to be here, when — once again — the industry has enjoyed another year of strongperformance. That is not to say bank supervision and regulation today is without its challenges, or thatthere are few risks to U.S. banks. Perhaps to the contrary, as a result of market dynamics, bothdomestically and abroad, we can expect to see some loan losses and earnings pressures. Someweaknesses have already surfaced. For the most part, though, we continue to be spared the crisisevents that can be so disruptive.This “lull” in domestic financial problems has come at an opportune time, as U.S. and world financialsystems adjust to the profound changes of the last decade. The number of insured commercial bankscontinues to decline — down 4 percent last year and by roughly one-third since the decade began.Meanwhile, the scope and pace of financial innovation continues to expand, making manytransactions increasingly difficult to manage and more opaque. Risk management and measurementtechniques throughout the industry have become much more quantified with greater integration ofinformation systems and financial theory. Large banks, in particular, have also become far morediversified, now that they can expand nationwide.These changes and the industry’s transition, in general, should be viewed as a continuous and naturalresponse by banks to evolving market needs and new technologies. That the industry, itself, ischanging is not a problem; banks must adapt to survive. The fact that the industry, rather than thelegislative or regulatory process, is leading the change is also appropriate; the private sector shouldalmost always show the way. The result, though, must be managed with care. During the 1990s,banking organizations have increased tremendously in size as a result of the consolidation process,and the complexity of many bank activities has grown as well. These developments have crucialimplications for bank supervisors, including those pertaining to systemic risks. In many respects, theyhave also made bank supervision more difficult.We have not yet achieved “financial modernization” in terms of legislation, but we certainly have afar different banking and financial industry than existed a decade ago. Undoubtedly, more change ison the horizon, as distinctions among financial institutions continue to erode. That fact simplyunderscores the need for Congress to modify U.S. banking laws and permit the regulatoryenvironment to catch up with market events.Meanwhile, bank supervisors and regulators should remain focused on their principal tasks. First, toensure that the banking system remains sufficiently safe and sound, posing little risk to the federalsafety net and adequately protected against systemic risk. Second, to ensure that the industrycontinues to provide the American public with a full range of competitively priced banking servicesand conforms to legislative standards of competitiveness. Perhaps more than before, achieving thesegoals requires us to adapt our practices to changing circumstances within the banking industry and totake full advantage of the technologies that exist.Clearly, as the industry has changed, so has bank supervision. As banks expanded nationwide, stateand federal supervisors worked together, producing the interstate supervisory protocol that provides amore seamless oversight process for state chartered banks. As banks grew larger and more complex,we focused more on risk management practices and controls and less on a bank’s condition at a pointin time. We also became more risk focused in our overall supervisory approach, emphasizing thoseactivities that presented the greatest risks. As financial innovation and capital arbitrage took hold, wealso became more aware of the need to update regulatory capital standards and to make greater use ofmarket discipline.We are pursuing our objectives both domestically among ourselves and abroad through the BaselCommittee on Bank Supervision, under the auspices of the Bank for International Settlements in
BIS Review   67/19992Basel, Switzerland. We are designing a way forward, building upon the “three pillars” approachoutlined in a consultative document released today by the Basel Committee, a subject I will return toin a moment. This approach encompasses (1) a strong, risk-sensitive regulatory capital standard; (2)an active supervisory program; and (3) improved bank disclosures that allow the marketplace toevaluate an institution’s risk posture and to reward or discipline it appropriately.In my remarks today, I would like to address many of these and other points, with particular emphasison the supervisory process and how we at the Federal Reserve are adapting to change. At the outset, Iwould emphasize that bank supervision is, by its nature, a dynamic process. Our practices mustconstantly improve or they will become quickly outdated. Supervisors must also be flexible, both intheir application of supervisory techniques to banks and in their expectations regarding what practicesindividual banks should follow.Perhaps more so than any other, the U.S. banking system is highly diverse, with its thousands of smallcommunity banks and a small number of increasingly large, highly complex, internationally activeinstitutions accounting for a growing share of total bank assets. Neither a single supervisory approach,nor a single risk management technique will work for all. That need for flexibility and adaptation hasbeen well served by our dual banking system and by the ability of individual states and state charteredbanks to innovate.Large and Complex Banking OrganizationsOne aspect of supervision that has become more crucial to our oversight process relates to systemicrisk and to the activities of our largest banking organizations. A decade ago, for example, the 20largest U.S. banking organizations held 68 percent of the assets of the 50 largest bank holdingcompanies; now its 82 percent. Then, the 20 largest holding companies held 37 percent of all U.S.commercial bank assets; now that figure has risen to 64 percent.Those figures conceal, of course, the dramatic increase in the complexity of their activitiesrepresented by securitizations and derivative products. The notional value of derivative and futurescontracts held by U.S. banks now exceeds $33 trillion, nearly five times the level at the end of 1990.Securitizations by U.S. banks, at $270 billion, have grown as fast and are expanding beyondconsumer-based loans, such as credit card and auto loans, to commercial credits. Virtually all of thesesecuritization and derivative activities are concentrated among the largest banks. While notionalvalues and amounts securitized say almost nothing about the level of underlying risk to individualbanks, they speak strongly to the increased volume and complexity of large bank activities and of thesomewhat hidden risks they face. For these organizations, balance sheets and traditional lending havemuch different meanings from a decade ago.Last year, the Federal Reserve responded to this trend by sharpening its supervisory focus on asmaller number of large complex banking organizations, both domestic and foreign. We now giveincreased attention to roughly twenty U.S.-owned and another ten foreign-owned banks. Althoughthey are generally the largest institutions we supervise, they warrant the greater attention not onlybecause of their size, but also because of their on-and off-balance sheet activities, their broad range ofproducts and services, their more complex domestic and international oversight structure, and theirrole in payment and settlement systems. We refer to them as LCBOs, for “large, complex bankingorganizations.”In supervising these institutions we recognize that each is unique and complex and that it isparticularly necessary for our analysts, examiners, and supervisors to understand sound practiceswithin the industry and to compare activities and risk management techniques among institutions.Accordingly, we are taking a “portfolio” approach, whereby we evaluate practices across institutionswhere we find similar business lines, characteristics, and risk profiles. This approach fosters moreinformed and consistent supervision among institutions and provides supervisory staff with greateropportunities to identify and promote sound practices. It also accommodates more readily thedevelopment and coordination of staff expertise throughout the Federal Reserve System.
3BIS Review   67/1999The Federal Reserve’s supervisory approach toward LCBOs requires ongoing monitoring, including aformal re-evaluation of an institution’s risk profile and a quarterly update of our supervisory plan.This periodic assessment is based, in part, on internal management reports, internal and external auditreports, and publicly available information. Since these organizations typically conduct a broad rangeof regulated activities, supervisory staff must also frequently communicate and coordinate their ownactivities with those of other bank and nonbank regulators.Management of this oversight process rests with a senior staff member designated as CPC, or “centralpoint of contact.” That individual, in turn, coordinates virtually all interaction between the FederalReserve and the institution, and directs an identified team of examination and supervisory staff havingspecialized skills tailored to the unique profile of the institution. This structure, combined with theability of the CPC to draw upon additional staff throughout the Federal Reserve System, shouldpromote greater understanding of an institution’s business and risk management process, whilereducing our level of intrusion.Indeed, a necessary aspect of our supervisory review is maintaining a steady flow of relevantinformation about an institution’s exposures and risk management system in order to reduce the time-consuming and burdensome discovery process often associated with traditional examination andoversight techniques. Periodic review of management reports should not only enhance our knowledgeof specific exposures and events, but also provide insights into a bank’s control process and aboutwhat information management deems important. In some cases, it may be most convenient to us andto the bank if we have direct access, on-line, to management information. Indeed, that is the case nowfor a couple of our largest institutions, particularly with respect to the internal audit process.Effective supervision of an LCBO requires a supervisory plan that is tailored to the institution’scurrent risk profile and organizational and operational structure and that considers the activities ofother supervisors — highlighting, once again, the need for communication and coordination. The planshould address the major risks (e.g., credit risk, market risk, and so forth) and should employ follow-up actions ranging from off-site analysis and meetings with management, to targeted or full-scopeexaminations. CPCs should also structure the plan to achieve the proper balance of review of riskmanagement practices and transaction testing, the latter relying typically on statistically soundsampling techniques.Information sharing and coordination with other supervisors are key elements of the program and areessential to successful supervision of these large institutions. For this purpose, the Federal Reservewill continue to enhance its base of information technology and extend its resources to othersupervisors. Many of you are already aware of an information system we are developing called theBanking Organization National Desktop, or “BOND.” When introduced next year, that system shouldprovide supervisors with both public and confidential information about an institution in a highlyuser-friendly way. The system should prove particularly helpful in monitoring and evaluatingconditions at the largest institutions.For the system to be useful, though, it needs to be used — and to be fed the information people want.These requirements, in turn, require a high degree of security, so that individuals can take comfortthat information they put into the system is not misused or misdirected. This aspect of the system hasbeen given great importance and should actually strengthen the level of security surroundingconfidential information, while also disseminating necessary information.In supervising LCBOs, we not only expect more of ourselves, we also have higher standards for theinstitutions. A fundamental tenet of supervision is that the nature of a bank’s risk management processmust be consistent with the level of underlying risk. More sophistication is necessary as transactionvolume and complexity rise.Credit Risk and CapitalOur higher expectations in the level of management skills and sophistication at larger banks will alsobecome more apparent in the years ahead in terms of capital standards. Much has been said recently insupervisory statements and industry publications about the need to revise the 1988 Basel Capital
BIS Review   67/19994Accord and to improve, more generally, the credit risk management of banks. Credit risk has alwaysbeen the dominant risk in banking, yet it remains crudely measured. This lack of quantitativelyrigorous risk measurement within the industry explains why we developed the current Accord as wedid.The trouble is that measuring credit risk is hard. Experienced bankers and examiners can usuallydistinguish a good loan from a bad one, but quantifying the level of risk on a portfolio basis and bank-wide is quite a different matter. Much attention has been devoted to the exercise within the industryand among bank supervisors, but no solution is at hand. Best practice banks and early research at theFederal Reserve suggest that significant strides are being made in credit risk management, but theindustry and regulators still have a long way to go. It is — and should be — the highest priority forthe industry and the supervisors.Last year, as you may recall, the United States and the other countries represented on the BaselSupervisors Committee adopted new capital requirements for trading activities that are based on abank’s internal measure of “value at risk.” That regulatory amendment represented an important shiftin regulatory thinking and a greater willingness by the regulatory community to build on riskmanagement practices of banks. With market risk, though, the basic elements of the “value-at-risk”measure were relatively well established, although most institutions still needed to strengthen certainaspects of their calculations and management processes.In that exercise, the necessary data for identifying current trading positions and measuring thehistorical volatility of their market values were also generally available. The mark-to-market processand short horizon of daily trading also helped greatly in evaluating the effectiveness and overall“accuracy” of the market risk models.None of these crucial elements exists today for measuring credit risk, and industry practice has not yetconverged around a particular measure of credit risk, or even a conceptual definition of credit loss.Some models, for example, identify a loss only when a borrower defaults, largely reflecting the viewthat the bank will hold the asset until it matures. If the model forecasts a default during the relevanttime horizon, it then calculates an expected loss, or “loss rate, given default.” Other models take moreof a mark-to-market approach, recognizing the gains or losses in the economic value of a loanportfolio resulting not only from defaults or expected defaults, but also from changes in the creditquality of a borrower or from different market and economic conditions.As you can sense, model structures and assumptions become crucial. Moreover, the fundamental input— a borrower’s credit risk rating — can be highly subjective and is largely determined internallywithin the bank. Some borrowers have public debt ratings from recognized rating agencies, but mostdo not. Even a public rating needs to be translated into the rating schedule of each bank. This lack ofcredit risk data is a serious weakness, with even large banks lacking enough historical defaultexperience for a given borrower type to determine appropriate capital charges without substantialjudgmental input.The subjective and variable quality of risk ratings, lack of historical data, and the long time horizonbefore answers are known about a portfolio’s underlying strength make validating credit risk models adifficult task. If more risk-sensitive models are to be used for regulatory capital standards, thesedifferences become more important because they can have material effects on competition and on thesafety and soundness of banks, both domestically and abroad.Moreover, unlike trading activities, where the related capital requirements represent a small part ofthe total, credit risk counts. We need to get this measure right for obvious reasons. “Getting it right”means also providing the proper risk management incentives to banks.Far more needs to be done in measuring and managing credit risk than has been done so far by U.S.and foreign banks. As I noted, much progress has been made in recent years, make no mistake. Butmuch more progress is necessary before most large banks, themselves, can gain a solid grasp on theirrisk exposures for risk management purposes, let alone before supervisors will be able to substantiallyrevise the Capital Accord.
5BIS Review   67/1999In recent months Federal Reserve staff visited a number of large money center banks to understandbetter what role credit risk models perform now in senior management’s internal assessments of theinstitution’s capital adequacy. While, again, progress is being made, the results were somewhatdisappointing. Nearly all institutions indicated that in their own internal reviews, they focused largelyon factors such as their targeted external credit rating and their regulatory risk-based capital ratiosrelative to those of their primary competitors. If these figures were in line, they generally viewed theircapital as adequate. Although the targeted and actual ratios were significantly above regulatoryminimums, these responses were disappointing, indeed.It should be noted that a key ingredient in rating agency evaluations of bank capital is the risk-basedcapital ratio. While we regulators are flattered by the use of our capital standard for internal andmarketplace analysis, we must emphasize that the well-known shortcomings of the standard make itan inappropriate tool for many internal and market purposes. We expect institutions to be ahead ofregulators in this analysis, not the other way around.Where models are available, generally pertaining to commercial credits, they are used principally insetting concentration and exposure limits, pricing, and evaluating performance on a risk/return basis.Important uses, for sure, but in no case did management indicate their risk measures offered asignificant input to evaluating the institution’s overall capital adequacy.This assessment is not intended to be pessimistic. I believe significant progress can be made ifsufficient attention and resources are devoted to the effort, and if the industry is given the rightincentives to make it work. Supervisors can provide some of the incentives — both the carrot of animproved capital standard and a better risk management process, and the stick that management willbe judged, in part, by its ability to quantify risk. In large part, virtue can also be its own reward. Banksthat effectively measure and manage risk will make and price credit better.New Capital ProposalAs I mentioned earlier, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has now released its longawaited consultative report on revisions to the 1988 Basel Capital Accord. For the largest institutions,the Accord has increasingly been weakened by the changes that have occurred in financial markets.Most importantly banks here and abroad have been engaging in capital arbitrage techniques designedto move their higher quality, lower-risk assets to securities markets, sometimes reducing their capitalcharges on these assets more than proportional to the retained risk positions. In addition, theremaining higher-credit risk assets have the same regulatory capital charges as the lower-risk assetsthat have been securitized, changing the meaning of the resultant capital ratio. For these and otherreasons, the 1988 Accord has become increasingly undermined and the risk-weighted capital ratioshave become more difficult to interpret.Modifying the Accord is an incredibly complex and difficult procedure, not only because it must benegotiated among 12 nations and affect the policies of many more, but also because the issues are sodifficult. As I noted, the underlying approach has three equally important legs, all of which reflectefforts to respond to the evolving changes in financial markets. The first leg is modification of theCapital Accord per se, especially for the large complex banking organizations, the most important ofwhich will be to change the risk-weighting scheme on portfolio assets. The framework calls formoving from a four-weight scheme — with most of the assets at one weight regardless of risk — tomultiple and more sensitive risk weights and also includes steps to curtail loopholes dealing withsecuritization transactions. The risk weights, in turn, would be based perhaps on one or a combinationof techniques: external ratings, internal management risk ratings, and/or bank-specific formal riskmodels. Please note that in each of these, the process is leveraging off the market’s risk evaluation,including what the bank management applies for its own purposes. Consistency and improvement inbank risk management is thus a prerequisite to improved, and more rational, capital regulation.The second leg is increased market discipline. Market discipline, of course, can occur only to theextent that the banks make information available to creditors and counterparties that have the abilityto respond to that information. Thus, the consultative document contemplates more transparency
BIS Review   67/19996about bank risk-taking and controls so that creditors and counterparties can decide more rationallyabout their required compensation for the risk of dealing with that bank. Of course, the objective is tocreate the incentives for more rational and efficient risk taking by the bank.The final leg is supervisory review of the capital adequacy of the banking organization. The purposeis twofold: first, to ensure that a bank’s capital position is consistent with its overall risk profile andstrategy and, second, to encourage early supervisory intervention. The purpose of this review is toprovide supervisory comfort that each bank’s internal process for assessing its capital adequacy, andthat each bank’s actual capital levels, are consistent with the scale and complexity of its risk takingactivities. In some cases, these reviews may well result in requiring individual banks to hold morecapital than the minimum regulatory standard.As we think about capital standards for the years ahead, it seems appropriate to consider a morebifurcated approach: one standard for large, complex institutions; another for most other banks. Thatdirection seems especially necessary if we do pursue a more sophisticated, risk sensitive measure ofcredit risk to capture developments and techniques at the larger and more complex bankingorganizations. My sense is that greater complexity would be unnecessary for community banks, wherea simpler, less burdensome approach may be quite satisfactory for supervisory purposes for mostbanks. Nevertheless, all banks should take to heart the message the Federal Reserve and othersupervisors are sending about the need for stronger practices for evaluating credit risk.Loan Loss ReservesOn the topic of capital, I would like to say a few words about loan loss reserves and the interaction ofthe Federal Reserve and other federal banking agencies with the Securities and ExchangeCommission. In recent months, as you know, the Commission has devoted increased attention topractices of large U.S. banks in setting their level of loan loss reserves. The issue surfaced last fall,when SunTrust was required to reduce its reserves and revise previous financial statements. Sincethen, several other institutions have been asked to explain their reserve practices to staff of the SEC.As supervisor of these holding companies, the Federal Reserve has been actively involved in thismatter from the outset and has urged the Commission to work with us, with the institutions, and withthe other banking agencies toward a satisfactory resolution. Obviously, this means reconcilingdifferent perspectives on this issue. For example, in light of increased volatility and banking risks inrecent years, the banking industry has appropriately maintained robust reserving practices and levels.From a safety and soundness perspective, the Federal Reserve and other banking regulators haveexpected institutions to maintain strong loan loss reserves that are conservatively measured. Incarrying out its responsibilities, the SEC has emphasized the need for financial statements andreported earnings to be transparent and, therefore, for allowances to be adequate but not excessive.Enhanced transparency has also been a critical objective of bank regulators, both domestically andinternationally.Last week, press reports characterized the Fed’s position as being different from that of other federalbanking agencies. That is not true. The main point of contention between the banking agencies andthe SEC appears to be whether the recent guidance issued by the Financial Accounting StandardsBoard (FASB) represents a mandate to reduce reserves. The Federal Reserve has worked with theSEC to issue guidance emphasizing that the FASB guidance does not mandate any material changeand that bank management should feel free to maintain reserves at the high end of a reasonable range.The Federal Reserve’s policy guidance provides background information that is intended to assistinstitutions and their auditors in understanding the SEC announcement and the FASB article in thebroader context of other accounting initiatives and discussions between the SEC and the FederalReserve on allowance accounting matters. Moreover, our policy letter sends a clear message that theFederal Reserve wants banks to maintain prudent reserving practices and not to over-react as a resultof a narrow interpretation of the FASB guidance. The other banking agencies appear less sanguineabout the intent of the FASB guidance and have registered protests on Capitol Hill.
7BIS Review   67/1999The Federal Reserve will continue to work with the SEC and the accounting profession in the monthsto come in providing further information regarding appropriate documentation and other matters. Iunderstand Richard Spillenkothen, the Federal Reserve’s Director of Banking Supervision andRegulation, will also speak to this topic in his comments at lunch.Disclosure and Market DisciplineAlthough we disagree with the need for banking organizations to revise previous financial statements,battling the SEC on many of these issues seems not the proper course. They have an obligation toenforce sound reporting and disclosure practices as best they can, and our financial markets have beenwell served in the process. The U.S. banking industry has its obligations, too, to manage its risks andto tell its story to bank supervisors, the SEC, and the general public. If for no other reason than thefact that banks today are so large and complex and have the potential to present such widespread risk,these largest institutions, in particular, should be held to high performance and compliance standards.As bank supervisors, we should welcome the market’s help to identify and assess banking risks and tominimize the risk of moral hazard. One approach the Federal Reserve is exploring would enhance therole of investors in bank or bank holding company subordinated debt. Unlike shareholders, whobenefit from any gains from excessive risk, subordinated debt holders have only downside risk. As aresult, their incentives are similar to those of supervisors and the bank insurance fund: they lose if thebank defaults but they don’t participate in outsized gains.A difficulty, however, in creating a greater role for subordinated debt is determining how to provideinvestors with adequate and timely information about a bank’s risks and with sufficient leverage toaffect management decisions. From the supervisor’s perspective, another difficulty is separatingmarket “noise” in changing yield spreads from meaningful signals they may provide. We will becollecting and analyzing these data in the months ahead and will be evaluating their potentialusefulness, both as a tool for supervision and as a market mechanism for providing feedback tobanking organizations. Whether or not the exercise proves fruitful, it points in the right direction —providing incentives for greater market discipline and for sound management of banking risks.ConclusionIn closing, I would remind you that we are beginning to see slippage in important indicators ofindustry strength. Though still low by historical standards, the volume of nonperforming assetsincreased last year for the first time since 1991, with the deterioration concentrated withincommercial and industrial loans. Delinquencies in agricultural loans have also risen, as a result ofextremely weak markets for many farm products. Continued weakness in much of this sector couldbegin to weigh on some community banks.The next stress-point for any particular bank may come from poor credit quality, from structural andcompetitive pressures within the industry, or from many other sources. Fortunately, the U.S.commercial banking system has demonstrated a great deal of strength and resiliency in dealing withchallenges of the past, and it still seems as strong and as well positioned overall now to handle stressas it has been in many years. I have no doubt that the U.S. banking system will continue to grow andthat it will remain central to the nation’s financial system. To do that, though, requires that we all toadapt to changing times and that banks manage risk carefully in both good times and bad.
1BIS Review   66/1999Mr Issing’s speech entitled “Hayek – currency competition and European monetary union”*Text of the Annual Hayek memorial lecture delivered by Mr Otmar Issing, a member of the ExecutiveBoard of the European Central Bank, hosted by the Institute of Economic Affairs in London on27 May 1999.1.IntroductionAs a young student I read “The Road to Serfdom”. It was the first book written by Hayek I cameacross, and it has left a deep and lasting influence on me. Only 11 years after the Hitler regime and thewar I suddenly started to understand the interdependence between totalitarianism and economicpolicy. Since then I have read most of Hayek’s publications. Many left their marks, only to mentionthe impressive “The Constitution of Liberty”.But, perhaps more than anything else, it was the perception of “competition as a discovery process”which has shaped my thinking. This approach is of extreme relevance for economics but goes farbeyond this. Related to this “discovery” is “pretence of knowledge” as a permanent danger forsocieties. All those in public office responsible for making decisions should never forget thismessage.Against this background you can imagine that it is a great honour for me to be invited to give thislecture on the occasion of Hayek’s 100th birthday. Even more so as the invitation came from theInstitute of Economic Affairs, an institution devoted to the study and propagation of liberal ideas – tothe idea of liberty. I accepted immediately, not reflecting on the obvious time constraints.It was the Institute of Economic Affairs which in 1976 published Hayek’s “Choice in Currency: AWay to Stop Inflation”. I chose the subject for my lecture for the following reasons. First of allbecause I might have some comparative advantage in a subject related to monetary economics.Having joined the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, the relations of Hayek’s ideas oncurrency offer a special kind of interest. And, finally, it was the publication mentioned which broughtme into personal contact with Hayek. Fascinated (but, to indicate already, not convinced) by theapproach, which was out of line with anything discussed in mainstream monetary theory at that time, Iwished to include this paper in a reader on monetary policy issues I was preparing.I proposed to put in front of the text a quote by Hayek: “Inflation is made by government and itsagents. Nobody else can do anything about it”. But we could not agree on the translation of the word“government” into German. After an extended correspondence we finally came to the conclusion overthe phone that this quote should remain, but not be translated.1It only comes home to us fully how long and fruitful Hayek’s career was when we realise that hisrightly renowned monograph on the denationalisation of money was published some 60 years after hispioneering contribution to the theory of intertemporal equilibrium in Weltwirtschaftliches Archiv2 in1928.The monograph has to be seen against the background of decades of worldwide inflation. Hayekhimself mentioned the great German inflation of 1923. After the second World War, prices hadmoved worldwide only in one direction. In the course of the 1960s “booming” US FederalGovernment expenditure, which was partly associated with the Vietnam War, led to a sustainedperiod of strong growth in nominal aggregate demand. This, in turn, led to an increase in inflation inthe United States. In 1969 the inflation rate was already up to almost 6%, after having been less than2% at the start of the decade. Given the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates, theinflationary pressures emanating from the United States spread to other areas of the world, includingEurope. The strain in the Bretton Woods system became apparent in the late 1960s.

BIS Review   66/19992system finally collapsed. The problems created were magnified by the increase in oil and commodityprices in 1973. This led to soaring inflation.3A few years later the industrial world was caught in a combination of high inflation and substantiallyincreased unemployment. The policy that had brought the world to such an unfavourable conjuncture,and that could be characterised by a belief that “money does not matter” and a hubris of excessivereliance on demand management, had ostensibly failed. As Robert Lucas commented: “This is thelegacy of stagflation: a general loss of confidence, whether warranted or not, in the formerly acceptedframework guiding discretionary economic management”.4Hayek’s view about these developments becomes clear from, for example, an excerpt of his NobelLecture, delivered in December 1974: “Economists are, at this moment, called upon to say how toextricate the free world from the serious threat of accelerating inflation which, it must be admitted,has been brought about by policies that the majority of economists recommended or even urgedgovernments to pursue. We have indeed at the moment little cause for pride: as a profession we madea mess of things.” He expanded upon this in 1976:5 “practically all governments of history have usedtheir exclusive power to issue money in order to defraud and plunder the people”.It was against this background that Hayek proposed his radical solution. It called for no less than thecomplete abolition of the government’s monopoly over the issue of fiat money, leaving the way openfor comprehensive competition in its supply by the private sector. In his Hobart Paper Special No. 70,he spelt out his philosophy with respect to free competition in the supply of money: “The purpose ofthis scheme is to impose upon existing monetary and financial agencies a very much needed disciplineby making it impossible for any of them, or for any length of time, to issue a kind of moneysubstantially less reliable and useful than the money of any other. As soon as the public becamefamiliar with the new possibilities, any deviations from the straight path of providing an honestmoney would at once lead to the rapid displacement of the offending currency by others. And theindividual countries, being deprived of the various dodges by which they are now able temporarily toconceal the effects of their actions by ‘protecting’ their currency, would be constrained to keep thevalue of their currencies tolerably stable” (p.125).Although his proposal was not implemented, his contribution kindled a lively and far-reaching debateon the role of government in the monetary system, a debate that addressed the choice between a freemarket monetary regime and government management of the monetary system via a central bank. Theproposal was so profound and radical in its conception that some leading advocates of a laissez-faireapproach to most aspects of economic life (Milton Friedman, for example) were put on the defensive.As it happened, Hayek also held some pretty strong views on Monetary Union in Europe, an ideawhich was still only in a rather embryonic stage when he commented on it in 1978: his own scheme ofcompeting currencies seemed to him “… both preferable and more practicable than the utopianscheme of introducing a new European currency, which would ultimately only have the effect of moredeeply entrenching the source and root of all monetary evil, the government monopoly on the issueand control of money” (p. 126).                                                     3See Michael Bruno and Jeffrey Sachs, “Economics of Worldwide Stagflation”, Harvard University Press,1985, for an excellent presentation of this period.4Robert E Lucas, Jr, “Rules, Discretion and the Role of the Economic Advisor”, in Stanley Fischer (ed.),Rational Expectations and Economic Policy, Chicago 1980, p. 204.5“Choice in Currency: a Way to Stop Inflation”, IEA Occasional Paper 48, 1976.
3BIS Review   66/19992.Summary presentation and assessment of Hayek’s proposal for competing currenciesThe proposal put forward by Hayek, that is, full competition between private issuers of currency, is anextremely interesting concept. It relates to the debate on the viability of unregulated banking and tothe literature on the historical experience with free banking.6The basic idea seems to be as follows: creating the possibility of banks issuing currency would openthe way to competition. Banks could issue non-interest-bearing certificates and open cheque accountson the basis of their own distinct registered trade mark. Different banks would issue differentcertificates, that is currencies. The currencies of different banks would trade at variable exchangerates. Competition and profit maximisation would lead to an equilibrium in which only banks payinga competitive return on liabilities could survive. Since currency corresponds here to non-interest-bearing certificates, the crucial requirement is the maintenance of the value of the currency. So, inequilibrium, only currencies guaranteeing a stable purchasing power would exist. Banks that failed tobuild up such a reputation for their currency would lose customers and be driven out of business.Hayek was of the opinion that his proposal would, if implemented, contribute to the overall stabilityof the economy. In his monograph he wrote: “The past instability of the market economy is theconsequence of the exclusion of the most important regulator of the market mechanism, money, fromitself being regulated by the market process” (Denationalisation of Money – the Argument Refined,p. 192; Hobart Paper Special No. 70, 2nd (Extended) Edition, IEA (1978); italics in the original).Let me now examine the characteristics of the equilibrium envisaged in Hayek’s proposal.7 Themarginal costs of producing and issuing a currency (in the form of notes and coin) are rather low(close to zero).8 In the context of the type of competition envisaged by Hayek, the nominal rate ofinterest would be driven (close) to zero. If the real rate of interest required by lenders to lend funds toborrowers were positive (say 3%), equilibrium in the loan market would require that lenders wouldhave to be rewarded by a rate of deflation equal to this real rate. This would produce an outcome thathas been advocated as a normative rule for inflation by Friedman in the past, that is, in a situation inwhich money is non-interest-bearing, the optimal rate of inflation should be set equal to the negativeof the real rate of interest. This is analogous, in this context, to the well-known correlation betweenfree competition and efficiency (Pareto optimality).Hayek’s privatisation proposal would, initially at least, involve a multiplicity of privately issuedmoneys. If these failed to trade at par, which is not unlikely given that the financial health of thedifferent issuers is likely to be different, then it is also likely that a multiplicity of exchange rates willalso emerge between these privately issued currencies. So long as there is no restriction imposed onthe holding of the different currencies, those that are likely to depreciate in value would, according toHayek’s logic, be driven out of existence, leading to a situation in which only currencies with stablevalues would remain in existence.Hayek believed that such competition between currencies was a discovery process, which would leadto a stable non-inflationary outcome. In this respect, it may be best to let Hayek speak for himself,which I do by quoting from his Denationalisation of Money: “Indeed, if, as I am convinced, the main                                                     6Hayek’s proposal must be distinguished from free banking, which refers to a monetary system without acentral bank, in which private banks would be allowed to issue currency and bank deposits withoutrestriction. As practised in the 19th century, this version of free banking involved banknotes beingredeemable in gold and silver coin. (see Lawrence H White, Free Banking in Britain, Theory, Experience,and Debate, 1800 – 1845. Institute of Economic Affairs, London, 1995).7It should be noted that, in Hayek’s proposal, equilibrium is assumed to exist and to be stable, and informationis complete, symmetric and acquired at no cost. See Charles Goodhart, The Evolution of Central Banks, MITPress, 1988.8This is the assumption made by Milton Friedman in his seminal paper, “The Optimum Quantity of Money” in“The Optimum Quantity of Money and other Essays”, Aldine Publishing Company, Chicago, 1969.
BIS Review   66/19994advantage of the market order is that prices will convey to the acting individuals the relevantinformation, only the constant observation of the course of current prices of particular commoditiescan provide information on the direction in which more or less money ought to be spent. Money is nota tool of policy that can achieve particular foreseeable results by control of its quantity. But it shouldbe part of the self-steering mechanism by which individuals are constantly induced to adjust theiractivities to circumstances on which they have information only through the abstract signals of prices.It should be a serviceable link in the process that communicates the effects of events never whollyknown to anybody and that is required to maintain an order in which the plans of participating personsmatch” (p. 192/193).Nevertheless, despite Hayek’s claims for this discovery process, most economists would argue thatfree competition with respect to money couldn’t guarantee either a stable or an efficient outcome.This is the fundamental point.In order to try to understand and assess Hayek’s proposal, it is essential to take a closer look at moneyand its role in the economy. This is best done by, as it were, first breaking money up into itsconstituent functions. The classic textbook treatment of the functions of money is still valid: moneyfulfils three functions, namely that of (i) a unit of account, (ii) a means of payment and (iii) a store ofvalue.The use of money as a unit of account is, arguably, the most basic monetary function. It is thenumeraire, that is, the unit for quoting prices, for drawing funds, for negotiating contracts, and forperforming economic calculations. In this regard, money is a basic convention of society, such as thelanguage and the standards for measurement. This seems to be a very Hayek-like way of looking atmoney.Indeed, the fundamental problem in economics for Hayek is that of co-ordinating the plans of manyindependent individuals. Competition through the market system leads to such a co-ordination.Individuals, acting in their own self-interest, respond to price signals. Prices, in turn, reflect theinformation available in society. Price signals allow the transmission of previously unknowninformation in the most synthetic and relevant way for the purpose of economic calculus. Now, prices– impersonal signals that provide for an extensive social division of labour – are expressed in terms ofmoney. Irving Fisher coined the term “money yardstick”.9The unit of account represented by the respective unit of money (that is, the euro, the US dollar, theJapanese yen, etc.) is a metric or measuring tape. With inflation or deflation, the measuring tape keepschanging all the time. The unit of account, as represented by money, becomes elastic and of uncertaindimension at any one time and of even more uncertain dimension over extended periods of time intothe future. Inflation or deflation, therefore, means that the common unit-of-account language or, say,money language, for which the unit of account provides the foundations, is changing all the time. Anduncertain inflation, which tends to accompany high inflation, means that the unit of account ischanging in uncertain ways.This impairs the efficiency of the common money language and, therefore, communication and co-ordination in the economy. “Its undependability impairs the meeting of minds between borrowers andlenders and other transactors; it impairs economic calculation and co-ordination” (Greenfield andYeager, 1983).10 One of these authors (Yeager, 1983)11 invites his readers to “consider how difficultconstructing a house would be (ordering and fitting together the components, appliances, and all therest) if the unit of length, the metre or the foot, kept changing and accordingly were perceived bydifferent persons to have different sizes. Consider how preposterous it would be for the length of themetre to fluctuate according to supply and demand in the market for metre sticks. Yet our dollar                                                     9Irving Fisher, The Money Illusion, Adelphi Company Publishers, New York, 1928.10See Greenfield and Yeager (1983), “A Laissez-Faire Approach to Monetary Stability”, Journal of Money,Credit and Banking, Vol. 15, pp 302 – 315.11 See Yeager (1983), “Stable Money and Free Market Currencies”, Cato Journal, Vol. 3, No. 1, pp 305 –326.
5BIS Review   66/1999suffers from a comparable absurdity – or a worse one, in view of the associated macroeconomicdisorders.”Money used as a unit of account has characteristics of a public good. Given the unit-of-accountfunction, the medium-of-exchange and store-of-value functions have traditionally, but not exclusively,been supplied by private enterprise.Just as stable money is of crucial importance for a stable price level in a macroeconomic context, astable price level is of equal significance for the efficient performance of money in a microeconomiccontext. A stable price level is, in principle, of central importance in ensuring that the three famousmicroeconomic functions which money provides are allowed to operate with maximum efficiency.12From the point of view of the public involvement in the economy, the unit of account is of the greatestimportance.Efficient co-ordination in the economy cannot occur unless the various agents involved (that is,virtually everybody) speak the same money language. The institution that allows them to do so ismoney itself, but more specifically the unit-of-account function of money. The decentralised plans ofhundreds of millions of consumers and millions of producers and distributors cannot meshharmoniously in the aggregate if this common money language, as encapsulated in the unit-of-accountfunction of money, is missing. The efficiency of this language in performing this vital co-ordinationrole depends crucially on whether the unit of account always means the same thing to differentindividuals both at one and the same moment and over time. A necessary condition for it to mean thesame thing is that price stability prevails both at any moment in time and with a credible commitmentthat it will continue to prevail into the indefinite future. From this point of view, the commitment tomaintaining price stability is like the standardisation of units of measurement.It is not difficult to imagine problems in the Hayek proposal arising from the inherent dynamicsbehind the discovery process, which would characterise competition between banks in the supply ofcurrency. There are many questions left unanswered by Hayek about how the discovery processwould work in practice. How would the economy function during this discovery process? Since badissuers are, according to the theory, driven out by the fact that they have recourse to inflationaryissuance, this suggests that the discovery process would itself be characterised by inflation.Furthermore, if, say, a single stable currency did initially emerge from the discovery process, howcould one be sure that, having established a monopoly, the private issuer would not then, in a time-inconsistent fashion that has become all too familiar under politically dependent central banks, start toengage in inflationary over-issue so as to maximise seigniorage? And even if a few issuers were tosurvive, how could one be sure that the resulting oligopoly situation would not result in collusionand/or instabilities?Another potential problem with the Hayek proposal is that the real rate of interest would tend to varyacross the business cycle in response to the short-run pressures of supply and demand for loans and sotoo, according to his scheme, would the rate of deflation. And, of course, a steady rate of deflationwould only emerge if the whole private sector discovery process is itself stable, which any reasonableperson might be permitted to doubt. It would therefore appear that the outcome earnestly desired byHayek, a money of stable value, would not be achieved in practice by his own proposal of competingcurrencies.In a situation in which money were to be issued by many different issuers as in Hayek’s proposal and,either because of over-issuing by some agents or because of poor investment decisions, these issuesfailed to trade at parity, then many different numeraires could emerge. In principle, there could, in theend, be as many numeraires as there are issuers. In the presence of many numeraires or, moremeaningfully, in the absence of a single numeraire, financial communication, based on the common                                                     12As is well known by now, the Governing Council of the ECB has not opted for strict price stability as anobjective but has rather defined price stability “as a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index ofConsumer Prices (HIPC) for the euro area of below 2%”. Price stability, according to this definition, “is tobe maintained over the medium term”.
BIS Review   66/19996money language which would be provided by a single numeraire, would degenerate. This wouldprobably result in very poor co-ordination in the economy, with the efficiency of the decentraliseddecision-making of firms and households, which is the hallmark of capitalist economies, beingjeopardised and the productive potential of the economy being gravely endangered. The purely privateprovision of a public good (the unit-of-account function of money) would, in this case, be sub-optimalsince private issuers cannot easily underpin the single numeraire. Nor do they have an incentive to doso since they cannot capture the vast social benefits of the common monetary language provided bythe unit-of-account function of money.There are further issues that any proposal in the spirit of Hayek would have to confront. First, the useof money in transactions makes it subject to network externalities. Network externalities, in turn, mayinhibit free competition and may make it difficult, if not impossible, to dislodge an incumbent issuerwho has resorted to inflationary issuance. In other words, networking externalities would inhibitHayek’s discovery process from working as he envisaged it. Network externalities also provide arationale for regulation. Second, the assumption of complete, symmetric and free informationimplicitly assumed in the Hayek proposal does not apply to banking. The remark is equally valid interms of banking activities (for example, a fundamental activity in banking is the evaluation of thecreditworthiness of borrowers) and banks themselves (the special nature of the balance sheets ofbanks makes their valuation and risk assessment particularly difficult). In the absence of symmetricinformation, important issues of moral hazard, adverse selection and systemic stability becomerelevant.13Networking externalities therefore mean that there is no guarantee that new entrants into the marketfor supplying money would be able to dislodge the incumbent issuer(s) if these resorted toinflationary issuance, given the inertia that is an inherent part of phenomena subject to networkingeffects such as currencies. In any case, why should people be willing to believe the claims of anypotential new entrant that its currency will, unlike that of the incumbent(s), turn out to be stable? Inmy opinion, there are too many unanswered questions for Hayek’s proposal for currency competitionto be a viable candidate for society searching for a stable monetary system.Furthermore, it is very unlikely that the kind of uncertainty about future prices which Hayek wantedto banish with his proposal (“..a money of stable value is really the best we can hope for”) would bethe outcome if his proposal were to be implemented. Hayek’s discovery process could, on thecontrary, entail substantial costs in practice. According to his own logic of free competition inprivately issued currencies, the nominal interest rate would be driven to zero with, as alreadyexplained, deflation being the outcome. Hayek’s proposal would not therefore deliver what it seems topromise, namely price stability. Under his proposal, there would still be uncertainty about the futureprice level.3. Hayek and Gresham’s LawUnder Hayek’s scheme, market forces would determine the relative values of the different competingcurrencies. In other words, the exchange rates between the competing currencies would float freely.People would not want to hold on to the currency of an issuer that was expected to depreciate relativeto one that was expected to hold its value in terms of purchasing power over goods and services.Therefore, good money that maintained its purchasing power would drive out the depreciation- andinflation-prone bad money. However, it is not inconceivable that competing private issuers woulddecide to collude by fixing the relative values of their currencies. They would do this by agreeing tointervene mutually whenever any of the currencies in question came under pressure in the market forthese currencies. This would be easier to do, and would be more likely to succeed, if there were only afew issuers left after the Hayekian discovery process has reached some equilibrium state.Although this could be the outcome in a Hayek world of competing private currencies, it wouldclearly not be appreciated by Hayek himself. This is because if some arrangement were to be arrived                                                     13See, for example, Goodhart, op. cit.
7BIS Review   66/1999at by private issuers to counter the tendency for the values of the different moneys to fluctuate againsteach other, then the bad money would begin to drive out the good money, the exact opposite of whatHayek himself espoused. In other words, Gresham’s Law would, most likely, start to apply.As Hayek himself put it: “If the law makes two kinds of money perfect substitutes for the payment ofdebts and forces creditors to accept a coin of smaller content of gold in the place of one with a largercontent, debtors will, of course, pay only in the former and find a more profitable use for thesubstance of the latter”.14 And: “(Gresham’s Law) is not false, but it applies only if a fixed rate ofexchange between the different forms of money is enforced” (italics in original15). The bad (i.e. over-issued and inflation-prone) money would start to drive out the good (i.e. well-managed andmaintaining stable purchasing power) money. More of the bad money would be produced at theexpense of the good money and inflation would accelerate.In principle, Hayek’s proposal also works with national currencies produced monopolistically bycentral banks, provided the currencies in question are convertible and can be freely exchanged againsteach other on foreign exchange markets. In such settings, good national currencies will tend toincrease in importance relative to bad, inflation-prone, national currencies. This naturally constrainsthe ability of national governments to use “their exclusive power to issue money in order to defraudand plunder the people” (op. cit.). In this context, I think it is fair to say that the widespread use of theDeutschmark, for example, as an international investment currency is symptomatic of the enduringsuccess of the Bundesbank in maintaining, in relative terms, the internal purchasing power of theDeutschmark. However, as long as national currencies remain legal tender only within their ownnational boundaries, the scope for good national currencies to drive out bad national currencies maynot be as complete as in the Hayek world of competing private currencies where none of thesecurrencies has the status of legal tender. In other words, Hayek’s competition between currencies goesbeyond the limited competition we have seen on foreign exchange markets between nationalcurrencies.If this limited competition between national currencies is not sufficient to constrain domesticmonetary policy not to engage in excessive monetary creation, then a government may decide to tie itshands further by opting for a currency board arrangement. This would eliminate the possibility of anydiscretionary domestic monetary policy action since the domestic component of the monetary basecould only change in response to a change in the foreign currency component of the base. Despite theonly limited experience with the currency board arrangement to date, the experience wouldnevertheless allow us to declare it, provisionally, to be a success.Some governments which have opted for this arrangement have found, however, that during the recentfinancial market turbulence, their economies were not immune from contagious spillover despitehaving fairly healthy economic fundamentals. This is the result of the currency board arrangement notbeing an unequivocal one since the government in question retains the option of revoking thearrangement. Financial markets will therefore factor this possibility into their calculations andactions, ensuring that these countries suffer some contagious effects. This has stimulated a debate asto whether it would not be better for such currency board countries to go beyond the currency boardarrangement and opt for full “dollarisation”, and allow the domestic currency to be replaced entirelyby the “dollar” for all transactions.Hayek espoused the denationalisation of currencies. He recommended that this be achieved through acomprehensive privatisation of the supply of money. It is notable that, of the two routes todenationalisation of currencies that have been taken so far, neither follows the route recommended byHayek. One is the route taken by the governments of the EU11 through an international agreement ofequals, which has resulted in the arrival of the euro. Another route is through so-called                                                     14See Denationalisation of Money, op. cit., p. 142.15See also Denationalisation of Money, op. cit., p. 142 
BIS Review   66/19998“dollarisation”, whereby a country voluntarily relinquishes its own currency in favour of adopting aforeign currency, the “dollar”.It appears to me, therefore, that under the Hayek proposal, we are likely to get either one or other ofthe following unfavourable outcomes. On the one hand, we could see the emergence of floatingexchange rates between different privately issued moneys, resulting in an uncertain discovery processwithout any guarantee of a stable outcome, along with a deterioration in economic communicationand co-ordination in the economy overall. On the other hand, any attempt by private issuers to pre-empt these outcomes by fixing the exchange rates between their currencies would probably triggerGresham’s Law and result in accelerating inflation.4.The importance of inside moneySince the birth of central banking, governments – via the central bank – have supplied financialinstruments that have simultaneously fulfilled all of the three functions of money I have alreadymentioned. They have suppressed competition in the supply of currency and bank reserves (that is, so-called outside money). However, they have not suppressed competition in the supply of the othercomponents of money, that is, so-called inside money, which has been supplied exclusively by theprivate sector. Until just recently, inside money consisted exclusively of bank deposits which weresupplied competitively by banks. However, governments have nevertheless restricted the supply ofmeans of payment and stores of value by the private sector in the past. But this has been verysubstantially liberalised over the last 20 years or so. The result is that the availability of efficientmeans of payment that can also serve as good stores of value (and thus as a hedge against inflation)has improved almost beyond recognition compared with what was available during the period offinancial repression.Although governments have retained a monopoly on the production of high-powered money, theyhave always permitted and indeed increasingly encouraged competition in the production of insidemoney. The upshot of this is that outside money now comprises only a rather small fraction of totalmoney balances (taking, say, a broad definition of the money stock). After undergoing a dramaticdecline, particularly in the period following the Second World War, it now ranges from about 1% inthe United States and about 5% in the United Kingdom to about 6% in Germany.16 Governments haveretained a monopoly over the production of high-powered money. There are very good reasons forthis. Notes and coin issued by the central bank and, in some cases, by the government are unique inthe following sense: they are the only instrument that can mediate a transaction and settle it withfinality at one and the same time, which it does by virtue of its legal tender status. Currency is alsounique in that it supplies the unit of account for the whole economy.Although privately supplied inside money and publicly supplied outside money compete with oneanother as transaction media and stores of value, there is nevertheless a kind of symbiotic relationshipbetween the two. This is, first, because inside money (predominantly bank deposits) may owe itsacceptability to the fact that its issuers promise, and indeed are legally bound, to redeem it [eitherimmediately (sight deposits), upon maturity (time deposits) or after a period of notice (savingsdeposits)] in outside money and, second, because outside money provides the unit of account for thewhole system without which inside money might be less acceptable in the absence of a single(commodity) numeraire.Seen in this light, it appears that Hayek was correct in arguing that efficiency and (price) stabilitywould be enhanced if money were to be supplied privately and competitively. Indeed, the fact is thatmost of conventionally measured money stocks are now comprised predominantly of inside money,i.e. money supplied by private enterprise, but more specifically the medium-of-exchange and store-of-value functions of this inside money. Hayek’s arguments for free competition in the supply of moneyare therefore, in principle, applicable to these two functions of inside money. However, I believe he                                                     16Both the US and German figures are corrected for estimated holdings of dollar and DM currency heldoutside the US and Germany respectively.
9BIS Review   66/1999was mistaken in thinking that the economy would best be served if his recommendation were to applyto all aspects or functions of money. His recommendation neglected the public good aspect of money,which derives from its function as a unit of account. Money with a stable purchasing power servesagents, who do not even use it as a medium of exchange or a store of value, as the universallyacceptable unit of account.It could be argued that, with Monetary Union in Europe, two things have happened which play a rolein the current discussion. First, the geographical reach of the new unit of account, the euro, has beenextended dramatically, relative to that of its forerunner currencies (or forerunner units of account).Second, the degree of competition between private sector agents in the provision of the other twofunctions of money, those of a medium of exchange and store of value, will almost certainly beenhanced, leading – over time – to considerable improvements in the quality of the latter.The introduction of the new single unit of account means that there has, as from the beginning ofJanuary this year, already been a direct and immediate welfare gain for both producers and consumerssince the “moneyness” of existing money balances has been greatly enhanced. There are severalsources of this welfare gain. To mention just one: the merger of the currencies of the Euro 11countries into the single currency, the euro, last January has – in one fell swoop – eliminated foreignexchange transaction costs for all cross-border transactions within the euro area.Indeed, it is because of the greatly extended reach of the new single unit of account that the scopeavailable to the private sector to improve the quality of money has been greatly enhanced. This willoperate through the new competitive opportunities for the banking and financial industries in thewhole euro area. Welfare will be further enhanced over time as the single currency imparts thenecessary critical mass to the single money and financial services market in Europe.5.Hayek transposed onto the world of the new payments technologies and e-moneyHayek’s analysis and comments related to a world of what might be called analogue money, that is,money that was represented as book entries (bank deposits, so-called inside money) or in the form ofpaper notes or metal coin (so-called outside money). Despite the fact that many earlier predictions ofthe demise of paper money turned out to be false, I think it is safe to say that it is at last making wayto the ongoing digitalisation revolution as reflected in the dramatic progress in computer andcommunications technologies. These developments are now underpinning rapid advances in paymentand settlement infrastructures. It has enabled new payment media to emerge that compete directlywith the means of payment, that is notes and coin, issued by the central bank and backed bygovernment. New payment media take many forms, but the most commonly known are prepaid cardsand debit cards. Still more advanced forms of digital money, such as electronic network money, havenow become technically feasible and may soon make their commercial appearance. These present newopportunities for a much more efficient payment system, but at the same time pose new challenges formonetary arrangements and monetary policy.An aspect worth emphasising here is the fact that central bank money in the form of notes and coindoes not need a payments infrastructure in order to mediate payments. As has already been noted,central bank money can perform the payment and settlement functions (with finality) at one and thesame time, by virtue of its legal tender status. However, privately issued financial instruments (bankdeposits, for example) are not money in this sense unless complemented by a payments infrastructure.The analogue payments structures with which we have become so familiar in many countries arecheques and cheque clearing. The payments technologies now becoming available to the privatesector are undergoing unprecedented improvements. The effects are likely to be profound. Theirwidespread application could eventually mean radical rethinking about what we understand bymoney. In particular, they will increasingly provide private enterprise with far greater scope tocompete directly with central bank notes and coin as payment media.There is a very specific part of this process which deserves special attention. When there is a delaybetween a transaction and its settlement, as is the case in most existing privately supplied paper-based
BIS Review   66/199910payment and settlement infrastructures (using cheques and paper-based direct debits, for example),there is an element of risk attached to most of the payments effected in this way. A number ofdifferent types of risk are involved – credit risk, interest rate risk, operational risk, etc. The risksinvolved in these privately based payments media imparted a comparative advantage to currency as atransaction medium, since the latter was the only instrument that could perform a payment andsettlement function (with finality) at one and the same time. And it did so by virtue of its legal tenderstatus. This meant that notes and coin facilitated transactions in anonymous market situations sincethe seller never had to concern himself/herself with the creditworthiness of the buyer.However, an important feature of the new electronic payment and settlement infrastructure is itsability (at least potentially) to compress the transactions settlement time lag to what is virtually zeroin economic time. This creates an essentially new situation which has the potential to obviate many, ifnot all, of the types of risk normally encountered in executing payments and their settlement withinside money and, in principle, allows a much wider array of assets, especially marketable assets, tobe mobilised as transaction media. The new technology allows the vendor to verify that the purchaserpossesses sufficient funds to cover the transaction and, in principle, permits a transfer of these fundsto the vendor’s bank account in real time. It further allows the vendor to verify in real time that thefunds have indeed been credited to his/her account. This allows the settlement of the transaction withfinality to occur at virtually the same time as the transaction itself.Privately supplied payment instruments therefore now have the potential, when complemented withthe most up-to-date computer and communications technologies, to provide a more attractivealternative to notes and coin as a transaction medium. And, given that the former are also potentiallymuch more efficient in a number of ways, it is not inconceivable that one could face the prospect of arapid erosion of the role of notes and coin as transaction media in the not-too-distant future.The type of networking effects that support the acceptance of the euro are the same as thosesupporting the growth of electronic competition to notes and coin. More specifically, the price peopleare willing to pay for the use of electronic means of payment increases with the number of existingusers (demand-side economies of scale), while the price they would have to pay would be likely tofall as a result of declining unit costs of production as output expands (supply-side economies ofscale, which tend to be large for networking products) and as competition forces lower costs to bepassed on to customers. This dynamic would, of course, only start to take effect once a critical massof usage has been attained.There may also be forces promoting the growth of electronic means of payment at work which areunique to the euro area and the changeover process to Stage Three (B) of Economic and MonetaryUnion. The conventional channels of access to a currency at the retail level (that is notes and coin)will not be available in the case of the euro for the first three years, that is throughout Stage Three (A)of Monetary Union. The only means of access to the euro for households, and possibly for many smallfirms, may therefore be via electronic media, both electronic money and electronic access productsthat allow scriptural money (bank deposits) denominated in euro to be mobilised for transactionpurposes. The non-availability of the euro in the form of notes and coin could therefore impart anextra stimulus to the growth of e-money and electronic access products.The assumption from the current perspective is that all of these new payment instruments will beissued by private issuers. Despite fairly extensive discussions of the topic among central bankers,there has been no suggestion that central banks should issue e-money or be involved in the new retailelectronic payments infrastructure as an active participant. Therefore, the growth of electronic meansof payment will amount to an important further step in the process of privatisation in the field of thepayments and monetary system, especially because the new digital payment media compete directlywith the analogue-based media (notes and coin) supplied by the central bank. If this were to happen tosuch an extent that central bank money were driven out of the business of retail payments, then
11BIS Review   66/1999Hayek’s vision would almost have been achieved.17 But with distinct differences because, first, itwould have been achieved by a gradual evolution in financial market innovation and by improvementsin payment technologies, rather than by the type of top-down legislative decree that he himself hadenvisaged to remove the central bank entirely from monetary management and, second, that evolutionwould have occurred without jeopardising the single unit of account.This gradual process of privatisation is one which central banks might logically be expected tooppose, but this has not been the case. On the contrary, they are actively taking steps to help promotethe growth of electronic substitutes for notes and coin. They are doing so by seeking agreementbetween the competent official bodies and potential private sector issuers on standardisation – theobjective being to promote inter-operability between different privately supplied alternatives.Although this might seem like the proverbial turkeys voting for Christmas, central bankers place avery high priority on the smooth and efficient working of the payment system at both the retail andwholesale levels.Therefore, the ECB considers it essential that the following minimum requirements be fulfilled:• issuers of electronic money must be subject to prudential supervision;• the issuance must be subject to sound and transparent legal arrangements, technical security,protection against criminal abuse and monetary statistics reporting;• issuers of electronic money must be legally obliged, at the request of the holders, to redeemelectronic money against central bank money at par;• the possibility must exist for central banks to impose reserve requirements on all issuers ofelectronic money.The ECB has also identified two further objectives, the pursuit of which it deems to be desirable: theinter-operability of electronic money schemes and the adoption of adequate guarantee, insurance orloss-sharing schemes to protect depositors. The third requirement mentioned is of particularsignificance in the context of the current discussion. This is because, from a monetary policy point ofview, “the redeemability requirement is, inter alia, necessary in order to preserve the unit-of-accountfunction of money, to maintain price stability by avoiding any unconstrained issuance of electronicmoney, and to safeguard the controllability of the liquidity conditions and short-term interest rates setby the ESCB” (p. 106, ECB Annual Report, 1998).If the whole process triggered by the availability of new electronic retail means of payment is finallybrought to its logical conclusion, as suggested by the dynamics of technological development and freecompetition, central banks and governments will be confronted with a very specific problem ofpivotal significance: can the unit of account be separated from the means of payment, while stillremaining a viable unit of account and playing the crucial role of providing the common moneylanguage for the whole economy? If the means of payment embodying the unit of account, that isnotes and coin, is – over time – eliminated as a transaction medium by virtue of the competition ofthe emerging digital equivalents issued by the private sector, would the familiar existing units ofaccount, the euro, the US dollar, the pound sterling, etc., continue to mean anything? And, if not, whatshould be the official response? I don’t propose to address either of these issues today, but you mayrest assured that they are crucial to our concerns regarding the future, albeit probably somewhatdistant future.Hayek seems to have had very little doubt but that private enterprise, operating in a largelyunregulated environment, would deliver a monetary system that is stable, safe and efficient. However,I remain rather sceptical whether the private sector can cope with all the externalities involved in theprovision of a smoothly working monetary and financial system. It must nevertheless be conceded thatthe private sector is increasingly helping to evolve a monetary and financial system, supported by                                                     17Central bank money could, of course, remain as a transactions and settlement medium at the wholesalelevel in the interbank market.
BIS Review   66/199912increasingly sophisticated payments infrastructures, that promises to be significantly more efficientthan the system it is gradually displacing. There is, accordingly, no strong case to be made forattempting to introduce such a system by fiat. It is preferable that it should evolve by piecemealengineering, rather than by some abrupt legislative change as sought by proponents of competingcurrencies and free banking, of which Hayek could, with some justification, be regarded as the highpriest. It should also be borne in mind that the central bank will continue to play, during thistransitional period and afterwards, an important role as a regulator of the financial system by, interalia, setting the rules for competition between private suppliers of inside money.6.Hayek’s legacy and Monetary UnionHayek referred, in 1978 (op. cit.), to the possibility of Monetary Union in clear and strong terms. Heput it this way: “though I strongly sympathise with the desire to complete the economic unification ofWestern Europe by completely freeing the flow of money between them, I have grave doubts aboutdoing so by creating a new European currency managed by any sort of supra-national authority. Quiteapart from the extreme unlikelihood that the member countries would agree on the policy to bepursued in practice by a common monetary authority (and the practical inevitability of some countriesgetting a worse currency than they have now), it seems highly unlikely that it would be betteradministered than the present national currencies”.At one level, Monetary Union encompassing the Euro 11 countries could, therefore, be seen as aproject diametrically opposed to the type of scheme advocated by Hayek according to theaforementioned quotes. Instead of allowing the private sector to compete in issuing their owncurrencies, the single currency was introduced by governments coming together and introducing theeuro in a top-down fashion by legislative decree, while continuing to prohibit the private sector fromissuing currency. Any attempt by the private sector to issue banknotes or coins is counterfeiting, aserious criminal offence.At another level, one can see many strands in Hayek’s thinking that may have influenced the course ofthe events leading to Monetary Union in subtle ways. What has happened with the introduction of theeuro has indeed achieved the denationalisation of money, as advocated by Hayek, at least in theEuro 11 countries. Furthermore, the euro is being managed by a central bank (the ECB) that isprotected from political interference by a Treaty (the Maastricht Treaty), to which all Member Statesare signatories. All national central banks that comprise the Eurosystem are now independent of theirrespective Euro 11 governments and, according to their respective statutes, cannot take instructionsfrom these governments.Moreover, the Eurosystem is supranational and does not therefore have any natural politicalcounterpart in the form of a supranational government with full executive powers. This furtherunderpins the independence of the Eurosystem and enables it to pursue its mandated ultimateobjective, that is price stability, without interference from government. Thus, monetary policy in theEuro 11 countries has been denationalised and is being conducted by a supranational central bank,which is politically independent of the governments of the Member States. Furthermore, anymonetary financing of the public sector or privileged access to financial institutions is prohibited. Theseparation between public finance and monetary policy is thereby ensured.This is very much in line with views expressed by Hayek:18 “It may still be true that, if there were fullagreement as to what monetary policy ought to aim for, an independent authority fully protectedagainst political pressure and free to decide on the means to be employed in order to achieve the endsit has been assigned might be the best arrangement. The old argument in favour of independent centralbanks still has great merit”. He goes on to elaborate that “under present conditions we have littlechoice but to limit monetary policy by prescribing its goals rather than its specific actions”. He thencomments on employment and price stability as goals for monetary policy, concluding that “the twoaims are not necessarily in conflict provided that the requirements for monetary stability are given                                                     18Friedrich von Hayek, The Constitution of Liberty, Routledge, London, 1960.
13BIS Review   66/1999first place and the rest of economic policy is adapted to them”. Last, but not least, Hayek emphasised(again strongly) the dangers from monetary financing: “if we are to preserve a functioning marketeconomy, nothing can be more urgent than that we dissolve the unholy marriage between monetaryand fiscal policy, long clandestine, but formally consecrated with the victory of Keynesianeconomics”19 (italics in original).7.ConclusionsHayek himself has explained the objectives of his proposal: “the abolition of the governmentmonopoly of money was conceived to prevent the bouts of acute inflation and deflation, whichplagued the world for the last sixty years”. Hayek was very clear about where to put the blame: “thebasic tools of civilisation – language, morals, law and money – are all results of spontaneous growthand not of design, and of the last two organised power has got hold and thoroughly corrupted them”.20Or, as he put it later, in even stronger terms: “the history of government management of money has,except for a few happy periods, been one of incessant fraud and deception”.21 The institutional reformwhich he espoused to tackle this problem was indeed radical. It involved, as we have seen, thedenationalisation of money to be achieved by the complete abolition of the government’s monopolyover the issue of fiat money, leaving the way open for supply of money to be determined bycomprehensive private sector competition.I would not be doing justice to Hayek if I neglected to mention that, at an earlier stage in his thinking,he put forward proposals for controlling inflation which have now become the conventional wisdom.In chapter 21 of his famous book entitled “The Constitution of Liberty” and published in 1960, hewonders, as I have just flagged, whether an independent monetary authority, fully protected againstpolitical pressure and free to decide on the means to be employed in order to achieve the ends it hasbeen assigned, might be the best arrangement.However, he seems to have viewed central bank independence as an inadequate solution since, asearly as the 1960s, he concluded that, in light of the high level of government debt, “…an effectivemonetary policy can be conducted only in co-ordination with the financial policy of the government.Co-ordination in this respect, however, inevitably means that whatever nominally independentmonetary authorities still exist have in fact to adjust their policy to that of the government” (seeHayek 1960, page 327). I think it is now clear that it was ideas along these lines that were theinspiration behind the rules and procedures in the EU Treaty, and I refer in particular to Articles 104and 104a.In fact, I would argue that one reason for Hayek’s change of mind and his subsequent advocacy ofcomplete privatisation of money, as revealed by the views expressed in Constitution of Liberty in1960 and those put forward in Denationalisation of Money in 1978, is to be found in hisdisappointment with the trends in the monetary institutions during his lifetime. He seems to have saidas much: “… high hopes of what could be expected from political control over money have beenbitterly disappointed. … unchecked party politics and stable money are inherently incompatible”(italics in the original).22 The tentative answer to Hayek’s concern – the now classic timeinconsistency-induced inflation bias – was finally found in institutional reform. In all industrialisedcountries, monetary policy is now being managed by (more or less) independent central banks withthe key objective of maintaining price stability. Monetary financing of the public sector is excluded.Monetary stability is protected by law and social consensus.How would Hayek, if he were alive today, see EMU and the ECB? Let me hazard what is probably asomewhat biased and speculative answer. The route to monetary union taken by member governments                                                     19Friedrich von Hayek, 1978, op. cit.20Friedrich von Hayek, Law, Legislation and Liberty, University of Chicago Press, 1979.21Friedrich von Hayek, The Fatal Conceit: the Errors of Socialism, Routledge, 1988.22Friedrich von Hayek, Market Standards for Money, Economic Affairs, April–May 1986.
BIS Review   66/199914and central banks was almost diametrically opposed to that espoused by him in his later writings. Butshould he not welcome what we have achieved? Should he not be pleased that so much of his earlier(1960) blueprint is now law?I am convinced that he would welcome the fact that the ECB has not joined the new fashionable wavearguing that money does not matter. It is very easy to slip into the trap of thinking that money isunimportant when inflation is low and to ignore the overwhelming evidence that all past episodes ofpersistent inflation have been preceded, or been accompanied, by rapid money growth. Robert Lucasin his Nobel Lecture has only recently reminded us of the facts and I quote: “…the prediction thatprices respond proportionately to changes in money in the long run, deduced by Hume in 1752 (andby many other theorists, by many different routes, since), has received ample – I would say decisive –confirmation, in data from many times and places” (p. 668).23 As I have already argued, the quality ofmoney, which has to do with how well it performs its micro-economic functions of medium ofexchange, store of value and in particular unit of account, is related to the quantity of money. Toomuch of the latter, relative to ex ante demand for money, can substantially impair the former. Sinceinflation is ultimately a monetary phenomenon, money constitutes a natural, firm and reliable“nominal anchor” for a monetary policy aimed at price stability. This accounts for why money isgiven a prominent role in the ECB’s monetary policy strategy.Therefore, although the path taken to achieve denationalisation of money has been very different thanthat advocated by Hayek, the ultimate objective being sought by Hayek, i.e. monetary independencefrom political interference and price stability, has, to all intents and purposes, already been achieved.Of course, I should add as an essential precautionary note that price stability is never fully achieved inthe sense that it is a forward-looking concept and the ECB must be eternally vigilant, and act in a pre-emptive way, so as to ensure that inflationary pressures are not given an opportunity to translate intoactual inflation. Having said this, however, I am afraid Hayek might not be in favour of a newcentralised authority with monopoly powers over base money. The Treaty of Maastricht is virtuallythe very opposite of what Hayek proposed, because, among other things, the new monetary order inthe EU11 has been created not in an evolutionary process but in a “constructivist” way per statute at afixed date, i.e. the first of January this year.I am convinced that the EU11 governments have, in principle, taken the correct route to monetaryunion. They could hardly afford to take what might have been an enormous risk in adopting aHayekian discovery process as a route to monetary union, as had been advocated in the so-called hardECU proposal.24 This would amount to experimenting with the monetary constitution, a verydangerous strategy. Continuity in monetary arrangements and institutions is of the essence. Apremium must be placed on the tried and tested. It is therefore preferable to subscribe to a philosophyof piecemeal engineering in the reform of a proven monetary system by allowing it to evolve inresponse to the needs of the economy and to the opportunities provided by advances in technology inan efficient fashion.Although the hard currency proposal has not been adopted, and correctly so in my view, it couldnevertheless be plausibly argued that a kind of Hayekian discovery process has indeed been triggeredby the introduction of the euro. This is because, with the introduction of the euro and the dramaticallyextended geographical reach of the new single unit of account, the scope available to the privatesector to enhance the quality of the medium-of-exchange and store-of-value functions of money,where its comparative advantage lies, has been significantly improved. This new and more robustcompetitive environment should ensure a lively discovery process in the provision of these functions                                                     23Robert E Lucas, Jr, “Nobel Lecture: Monetary Neutrality”, Journal of Political Economy, Vol. 104, No. 4,1996.24Such a proposal had been advocated at various times by the UK Chancellor and Prime Minister Thatcheras an alternative evolutionary route to monetary union in Europe.
15BIS Review   66/1999of money as new opportunities are presented for the banking and financial industries in the euro areaas a whole.In the sequencing of events on the road to the political integration of Europe, I once had a distinctpreference for political union preceding monetary union. As I have argued elsewhere,25 historicalexperience shows that national territories and monetary territories normally coincide. Now, of course,the reality is that, if political union is ever to occur, monetary union will have preceded it. However,with the establishment of the ECB and the introduction of the single currency, intentionally or not, aprocess towards further political integration has been triggered. Although this process is not withoutrisks, it nevertheless provides a golden opportunity for Europe to find its proper political shape.In Hayek’s terminology, “imposing” monetary union on Europe was an act of constructionism. But, tocontinue in his way of argumentation, this should also have started a search process for an appropriatepolitical framework so that, finally, the economic and monetary regime, and the field of politics,together form a viable, if not optimal, institutional arrangement. There are no patterns from the pastavailable which could easily be imitated. Further political integration might, subsequently, develop ina quite divergent direction. In some areas, more centralisation of decision-making should benecessary, whereas in other fields, responsibility might remain, or even be enhanced, at the local,regional or national level.As I have said recently,26 and I think it bears repeating, what is essential for a successful monetaryunion is a sufficient degree of political commitment by all participating countries, the leadingeconomic actors and the wider public to accept fundamentally and genuinely the political andeconomic constraints that a single and stable currency represents. The deeper underlying commitmentto make European integration a success even in the most difficult of times in history gives somegeneral grounds for hope on this count. Some degree of political unity (not necessarily union), orrather a sense of common responsibility, would appear to be important for the long-run health ofEMU. However, it is not a substitute for the right economic conditions for lasting success.                                                     25See Otmar Issing, “Europe: Political Union through Common Money”, IEA Occasional Paper 98,February 1996.26See Otmar Issing: “The Euro four weeks after the start”, speech delivered at the European-Atlantic Group,House of Commons, London, January 1998.
1BIS Review  64/1999Mr Greenspan’s statement on trade, technology and economic progressSpeech by the Chairman of the US Federal Reserve System, Mr Alan Greenspan, at theConference on International Business, organised by the Alliance for the Commonwealth inBoston, Massachusetts on 2 June 1999.I am pleased to join the Alliance for the Commonwealth today for its annual Conference onInternational Business. I should also like to thank my good friends John LaWare, Chairman ofthe Alliance, and Cathy Minehan, President of the Boston Federal Reserve Bank, whoencouraged me to participate in this daylong educational symposium.There are few better examples of the benefits of trade and investment than here in Bostonwhere the roots of international trade go back to our nation’s origins. Massachusetts, and NewEngland in general, are today, as in the past, actively engaged in the global trade environmentand are currently home to many of the firms that are the recipients or the sources of cross-border direct investment.The evidence is overwhelmingly persuasive that the massive increase in world competition – aconsequence of broadening trade flows – has fostered markedly higher standards of living foralmost all countries who have participated in cross-border trade. I include most especially theUnited States. And yet, as I have indicated in recent speeches and intend to outline shortly,there are reasons to be concerned that the benefits of increasingly open trade may not beallowed to be as readily forthcoming in the future as they have been in the past half century.Although many forces have been at play, the post World War II surge in trade has clearlyowed, in large part, to significant advances in technological innovation.Since the dawn of the industrial revolution, there has been an inexorable drive to leveragephysical brawn and material resources into ever greater value added or output. New insightsinto the laws of nature brought steam and later electric power. The development of aproduction quality level that facilitated interchangeable parts brought assembly lineproduction. And the development of railroads facilitated the evolution of mass markets.Almost all of the leverage of the physical to higher value added has reflected the substitutionof ideas – new insights – for material bulk and brute human effort.The resulting more effective organization of material has, of course, inevitably meant that lessof it was needed per unit of output. The insights of metallurgy and architectural andengineering design, for example, enabled the construction of buildings that use far lessphysical material per unit of space than, say, a half century ago. The insights that led to centralheating, as well as synthetic fiber, facilitated reduced clothing weight, while the developmentof the jet engine brought far greater annual passenger miles per unit of aircraft size.But doubtless it has been the advent in recent decades of the synergies of the microprocessor,lasers, and fiber optics that has fostered a distinct quickening in the displacement of physicalweight of output with concepts. The ability to miniaturize transistor electronic circuits hasdisplaced huge tonnages of copper and enhanced the speed of calculation that theminiaturization of circuitry facilitated.
BIS Review  64/19992As high tech became an increasing part of our national product, the relative physicaldimensions of our value added fell dramatically. The per capita physical weight of our grossdomestic product is evidently only scarcely higher today than it was fifty or one hundred yearsago.By far the largest contributor to growth of our price-adjusted GDP, or value added, has beenideas – insights that leveraged physical reality. The consequent downsizing of output, ofcourse, meant that products were easier, and hence less costly, to move, and most especiallyacross national borders.It is thus not surprising that the price-adjusted level of international trade, as I indicatedearlier, has expanded at a far faster pace than gains in real domestic demand. Imports of goodsand services as a percent of gross domestic products worldwide, on average, have risen fromapproximately 14 percent twenty-five years ago to 24 percent today.The growth in physical weight of such trade, as with the national product generally, has beenfar less. For example, United States data on both exports and imports indicates that the price-adjusted value of our trade per pound has risen by approximately 4 percent per year onaverage over those same three decades.But technology has augmented international trade for reasons beyond the downsizing ofmaterial output. New telecommunications technologies made it very difficult for the autarchicsocieties of the former Soviet Union to sustain their isolation in the face of the growingrelative affluence of the West. News could no longer be bottled up. Even in the West, thestultification of protectionism became increasingly evident as new consumer products enteredthe world markets en masse. The political pressures to deregulate moribund industries andopen up borders to trade soon became irresistible. The international trading system thatevolved has enhanced competition and fostered the continuous scrapping of old technologiesto make way for the new. Standards of living rise because the depreciation and other cashflows of industries employing older, increasingly obsolescent, technologies are marshalled tofinance the newly produced capital assets that almost always embody the cutting edgetechnologies. This is the process by which wealth is created incremental step by incrementalstep. It presupposes a continuous churning of an economy in which the new displaces the old.But there is also little doubt that this transition to the new high-tech economy, of which risingtrade is a part, is proving difficult for a large segment of our workforce that interfaces with ourrapidly changing capital stock day-by-day.Moreover, while major advances in standards of living are evident among virtually all nationsthat have opened their borders to increased competition, the adjustment trauma has alsodistressed those who once thrived in companies that were then at the cutting edge oftechnology, but which have since become increasingly less competitive in both domestic andforeign markets. Economists will say that workers should move from the steel districts ofwestern Pennsylvania to a vibrant Silicon Valley. And eventually they, or more likely theirchildren, will. But the adjustment process is wrenching to an existing workforce maderedundant largely through no fault of their own. It may be argued that all workers should havethe foresight to recognize long-term job opportunity shifts and move in advance ofobsolescence. This regrettably is a skill not in great abundance – among business managers orthe economists who counsel them, as well as among workers.
3BIS Review  64/1999Yet the protectionist propensity to thwart the process of the competitive flow of capital, fromfailing technologies to the more productive, is unwise and surely self-defeating. History tellsus that not only is it unwise to try to hold back innovations, it is also not possible over thelonger run. Generation after generation has experienced episodes in which the technologicallyobsolescent endeavored to undermine progress, often appealing to the very real short-termcosts of adjusting to a changing economic environment. From the Luddites to the Smoots andthe Hawleys, competitive forces were under attack. In the end they did not prevail and long-term advances in standards of living resumed.Nonetheless, the campaign to expand free trade is never won. Legislation to further lowertrade barriers, for example, is becoming increasingly more difficult to pass in our Congress. Itis a continuing battle. Further, while tariffs in industrial countries have come down sharplyover the past half century, other barriers have become more prevalent. Administrativeprotection in the form of antidumping suits and countervailing duties is a case in point. Whilethese forms of protection have often been imposed under the label of promoting “fair trade,”oftentimes they are just simple guises for inhibiting competition. Typically, antidumpingduties are levied when foreign average prices are below average cost of production. But thatalso describes a practice that often emerges as a wholly appropriate response to a softening indemand. It is the rare case that prices fall below marginal cost, which would be a morerelevant standard. Antidumping initiatives should be reserved, in the view of manyeconomists, for those cases where anticompetitive behavior is involved. Contrary to popularnotions about antidumping suits, under U.S. and WTO law, it is not required to show evidenceof predatory behavior, or intention to monopolize, or of any other intentional efforts to drivecompetitors out of business.In the end it is clear that all economic progress rests on competition. It would be a greattragedy were we to stop the wheels of progress because of an incapacity to assist the victimsof progress.Our efforts should be directed at job skills enhancement and retraining – a process in whichthe private market is already engaged. Thwarting competition, by placing barriers to imports,will prevent the needed transitions of the productive capital stock of the United States andother nations that enable it to continuously concentrate on producing those goods and servicesmost desired by consumers. Protectionism will also slow the inevitable transition of theworkforce to more productive endeavors. To be sure, an added few years may enable someworkers to reach retirement with dignity, but it will also keep frozen in place younger workerswhose better job opportunities decline with time.I regret that trade policy has been inextricably linked with job creation. We try to promote freetrade on the mistaken ground that it will create jobs. The reason should be that it enhancesstandards of living through the effects of competition on productivity.It is difficult to find credible evidence that trade has impacted the level of total employment inthis country over the long run. Indeed, we are currently experiencing the widest trade deficit inhistory with a level of unemployment close to record lows.Certainly, the distribution of jobs by industry is affected by international trade, but it is alsoaffected by domestic trade. It is the relative balance of supply and demand in a competitive
BIS Review  64/19994market economy that determines the mix of employment. When exports fall or imports rise,domestic demand and relative prices have invariably adjusted in the long run to leave totalemployment relatively unaffected. As economists like to say, all imports are eventually paidfor with exports.I also regret that, despite the remarkable success over a near half century of GATT, theGeneral Agreement on Trade and Tariffs, and its successor, the World Trade Organization, inreducing trade barriers, our trade laws and negotiating practices are essentially adversarial.They presume that a trade concession extracted from us by our trading partners is to theiradvantage at our expense, and must be countered.Few economists see the world that way. And I am rash enough to suggest that we economistsare correct, at least in this regard: trade is not a zero sum game.If trade barriers are lowered by both parties, each clearly benefits. But if one lowers barriersand the other does not, the country that lowered barriers unilaterally would still be better offhaving done so. Raising barriers to achieve protectionist equality with reluctant tradingpartners would be neither to our benefit, nor to theirs. The best of all possible worlds forcompetition is for both parties to lower trade barriers. The worst is for both to keep them up.For these reasons, I am concerned about the recent evident weakening of support for free tradein this country. Should we endeavor to freeze competitive progress in place, we will almostcertainly slow economic growth overall, and impart substantial harm to those workers whowould otherwise seek more effective longer-term job opportunities. Protecting markets fromnew technologies has never succeeded. Adjustments to newer technologies have been delayed,but only at significant cost.Even should our trading partners not retaliate in the face of increased American trade barriers,an unlikely event, we do ourselves great harm by lessening the vigor of Americancompetitiveness. The United States has been in the forefront of the postwar opening up ofinternational markets, much to our, and the rest of the world’s, benefit.It would be a great tragedy were that process reversed. I do not believe that will be allowed tohappen. There is too much at stake for us and our trading partners.
1BIS Review   63/1999Mr King looks at interest rates and the new Monetary Policy Committee in the UnitedKingdomLecture delivered by the Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, at Queen’sUniversity in Belfast on 17 May 1999.Present at the creationTwo years ago, when it announced that the Bank of England would be granted independence, then(N)ew Labour Government surprised everyone, not least the Bank of England. Since then,decisions on interest rates have been taken not by the Chancellor but by the Monetary PolicyCommittee. Much has followed from that single bold decision to take interest rates out of day-to-day politics. The transfer of the operational responsibility for setting interest rates to a newMonetary Policy Committee was a major policy, indeed constitutional, innovation. Theexcitement of being involved in the construction of a new monetary institution for the UnitedKingdom has both motivated and rewarded the extraordinary efforts of the Bank staff who madethe new process work, and I want publicly to thank them for that. In the words of Dean Acheson,to be “present at the creation” is an experience which few involved in policy are ever privilegedto share.Inevitably there have been changes to the Bank. It has had to redirect its resources to focus onachieving and maintaining monetary stability in this country. Responsibility for bankingsupervision has been transferred from the Bank to the new Financial Services Authority. The jobof managing public sector debt has passed to a new Debt Management Office. And the Treasury,relieved of its responsibility for setting interest rates, can now focus on fiscal policy and measuresto raise the long-run growth rate of the UK economy, as well as ensure that the fruits of thatgrowth are distributed fairly. Each body now has clearer responsibilities.Of course, not all of our present monetary framework dates from 1997. It was following our exitfrom the ERM in September 1992 that monetary policy was first directed to achieving an explicitinflation target, initially a range of 1–4% and, subsequently 2½% or less. With a floatingexchange rate, any anchor for the price level had to be based on a domestic nominal target. Themove from secrecy to transparency in the conduct of policy also dates back to 1992 when the thenChancellor asked the Bank to produce a regular independent Inflation Report in order “to makethe formation of policy more transparent and our decisions more accountable”. The first InflationReport appeared in February 1993. Those changes led to a significant improvement in ourmacroeconomic performance.But many, especially elsewhere in Europe, doubted the UK’s commitment to monetary stability inthe absence of a willingness to remove operational decisions on interest rates from the politicalarena. Long-term interest rates contained a risk premium to reflect the possibility that the timingand magnitude of interest rate changes might reflect political considerations. The “Ken and Eddieshow” was probably nearing the end of its run. And both principals needed their own show.So when Gordon Brown announced radical changes to the Bank of England and the monetarypolicy framework two years ago they were widely welcomed because they offered the basis for adurable commitment to price stability.What, then, is the substance of the main reforms announced in May 1997? First, there is a clearand unambiguous objective for monetary policy – an inflation target of 2½%, set by theGovernment, with inflation defined as the increase in retail prices, excluding mortgage interest
BIS Review   63/19992payments, over the previous twelve months – RPIX inflation. Second, decisions on interest ratesare taken by a Monetary Policy Committee, or MPC, comprised of nine individuals with expertisein monetary policy – five executive members of the Bank and four non-executives – who operateon the basis of one person one vote. Third, the process is characterised by a high degree oftransparency and accountability, both to provide the public with explanations of the MPC’sactions and to hold members of the MPC individually accountable for their decisions. Have thesereforms made a difference to the UK economy? My aim this evening is to pose and begin toanswer three questions about the MPC two years on.(1) What is the track record of the MPC after two years?(2) What has the MPC learnt during that period?(3) What are the challenges for the next two years?What is the MPC’s track record?Because of the infamous “long and variable” lags between changes in interest rates and theirimpact on inflation, the MPC does not yet have much of a track record in terms of inflationoutturns. But since the target given to the MPC is for inflation, let me start there. Between June1997 and March 1999 (the latest month for which inflation has been published) RPIX inflationaveraged 2.7%. During that period, inflation ranged from a low of 2.4% to a high of 3.2%. Overthe past nine months it has remained within 0.2 percentage points of the target, a remarkabledegree of stability.It is most unlikely that inflation can remain, month-by-month, as close to the target as that.Unexpected movements in the exchange rate, oil or other commodity prices, indirect tax rates or amultitude of other influences could all lead to divergences of inflation from target. Because of thelags I mentioned earlier, it would take the MPC some time to bring inflation back to the targetlevel. What matters, however, is not relatively small month-to-month movements in the inflationrate, but the expectation that inflation will average 22% over a number of years.As part of the arrangements for accountability, the Governor, on behalf of the MPC, is required towrite an open letter to the Chancellor whenever inflation deviates by more than a percentagepoint from the target. At the outset, the fan charts published in the Inflation Report showed thatthe odds on writing such a letter during the following two years were 3 to 1 on. In the event, noletter was required. Although the probability of writing such a letter has diminished, it remainshigh. The latest Inflation Report published last Wednesday implies that the odds on our having towrite a letter over the next two years are 2 to 1 against, or one in three.Thirty years ago the UK embarked on an inflationary journey, and what a roller coaster ride itturned out to be. During the 1970s inflation averaged no less than 13% a year, with a peak of over27% in August 1975. During the 1980s inflation averaged 7% a year, and it has fallen to 4%during the 1990s. That period also contained two of the deepest recessions experienced by anymajor industrial country in the post-war period. Since the inflation target was adopted in October1992 inflation has averaged 2.8%. The improvement in inflation performance during the 1990scan be seen in Chart 1.1 Inflation has been remarkably stable during the six years since aninflation target was introduced. Indeed, it has been more stable than in any period since monthlyRPI figures were first collected in 1947.                                                     1 Charts not included in this Review.
3BIS Review   63/1999Moreover, the adoption of a monetary regime which produced low and stable inflation has notdamaged growth in output and employment. Since the end of 1992 output has grown at anaverage annual rate of 2.8%, well above the post-war average. More significantly, growth wasmore stable, with a standard deviation less than one-half that of output growth in earlier post-wardecades. And unemployment, as measured by the Labour Force Survey, has fallen from 10.7% atits peak in 1993 to a current level of 6.3%.So since the inflation target was adopted inflation has been lower, and growth as high, as in anypost-war decade, and both have been more stable. And total output in the economy has nowincreased for 27 consecutive quarters, the longest period of uninterrupted growth since theSecond World War.Part of the credit for this improvement in UK macroeconomic performance belongs to the policyframework (both pre- and post-MPC), and part was the result of favourable economiccircumstances. From 1992 to 1996, the ability to grow at above trend rates without an increase ininflationary pressure was made possible by using up the margin of spare capacity created by thedeep recession of the early 1990s. After 1996, inflationary pressures were contained by lowercommodity and other world prices, and the impact of a sharp appreciation of sterling. Thesedevelopments have had a significant impact on inflation. And they were largely unpredicted. So,although monetary policy has faced some difficult choices over the past two years, it hasbenefited from an unexpected downward movement in imported inflation. These externalinfluences have offset a much higher level of domestically generated inflation. Despite that,inflation has been above the target more often than it has been below – in fact, it has been belowthe target in only one month so far since the MPC was set up. As the benign effects of thosetemporary external influences on inflation start to wear off, the challenges facing the MPC willbecome, if anything, even greater than those in its first two years.If the time lags in the monetary transmission process mean that it is too early to judge the MPCon its inflation track record, then what other criteria for assessing its performance might berelevant? One measure would be expectations of future inflation. Following Gordon Brown’sannouncement of Bank independence on 6 May 1997, inflation expectations in financial marketsfell sharply. Chart 2 shows the expected inflation rate at different horizons implied by yields onconventional and index-linked government bonds. These expectations fell by about 0.5percentage points on the day of the announcement. Since then inflation expectations have fallenfurther. Chart 3 shows the way in which two particular measures of inflation expectations haveevolved since May 1997. The first of these measures is the expectation of inflation ten yearsahead implied by bond market yields. The second is a Consensus Economics average of theexpectations of inflation five years ahead held by economic forecasters. Since 1997, inflationexpectations on both measures have steadily fallen towards the target, and the economicforecasters’ expectation has now become firmly anchored on the target. The bond market measurehas risen somewhat in recent months, although this reflects unusually low real yields on index-linked debt following the introduction of the minimum funding requirement for UK pensionfunds.Does this fall in inflation expectations matter? The simple answer is yes. If the MPC can anchorinflation expectations on the target, then unexpected movements in inflation will not immediatelylead wage bargainers or price-setters to change their view of where inflation is headed and hencewill help make less likely the inflationary spirals of the past. Both inflation and output should beless volatile as a result.
BIS Review   63/19994But there is also another, albeit one-off, benefit from the new-found credibility of policy and thesubsequent reduction in inflation expectations. Over the past two years, inflation has been close to2.5%. If inflation expectations had not themselves converged on the target, then inflation wouldhave been lower than expected. Why does this matter? Suppose wage bargains are struck on theassumption that inflation will be 3 per cent, but prices in fact rise by 2.5 per cent. Real wages willbe higher than either employers and employees expect, and employment – the demand for labour– will fall. An unexpected fall in inflation lowers both output and employment. So by bringinginflation expectations down towards actual inflation, the new monetary policy framework hasprobably led to higher output and lower unemployment than might otherwise have occurred. Wemight call these benefits a “credibility windfall”. It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, toknow how large that windfall might have been. But even a windfall of 0.1 percentage points ofGDP is a sizeable amount. Of course, somebody might very well point out that we could havereaped this same “windfall” by allowing inflation to rise to match the higher inflationexpectations. But that would be inconsistent with aiming to hit the inflation target, and might wellhave led to a further ratcheting-up of inflation expectations. It would have lost us all the benefitsthat low and stable inflation brings.What has the MPC learnt in the past two years?The first two years of the MPC have been a learning process for all concerned, both the membersof the MPC and those outside who observe and comment on its actions. We have learnt fromexperience and made changes where necessary. For example, the minutes of MPC meetings arenow published after two rather than six weeks. The additional delay created unnecessaryspeculation about the issues on the minds of MPC members, and made it difficult for us toexplain our actions – for example, to the Treasury Select Committee – when our decisions hadmoved on from those described in the most recent minutes. So we decided to acceleratepublication.I would like to focus on two main lessons from the first two years. The first is the crucialimportance of a symmetric inflation target. The second concerns how to manage a process inwhich the group has a common objective but in which individual members are held personallyaccountable for their decisions.Symmetry of the targetThe inflation target which the Chancellor has given to the MPC is a simple point target for RPIXinflation of 22%. Prior to May 1997, the inflation target was 22% or less. The meaning of thosewords “or less” was never entirely clear. Rarely in the history of economic policy have so fewwords caused so much confusion to so many economic commentators. Moving to a symmetricpoint target has removed any ambiguity as to the objectives of the MPC. That is importantbecause the rationale for handing operational responsibility for setting interest rates to the MPC isthat it is better qualified to make those decisions than elected politicians, whereas electedpoliticians have the democratic legitimacy to choose the target.A symmetric inflation target should also make it easier for people to understand how the MPC islikely to react to the different types of shock that may hit the economy from time to time. In moretechnical language, the MPC’s policy reaction function should be predictable. When anunexpected shock moves inflation away from the target, it may not always be sensible, or indeedfeasible, for the MPC to return inflation to the target level immediately. Shocks stay in thetwelve-month increase of the RPIX index for at least twelve months. To offset the impact of ashock on RPIX inflation in less than a year or so might imply undesirable volatility in output.
5BIS Review   63/1999Hence the MPC has been given “constrained discretion” concerning the horizon over which ittries to bring inflation back to the target level. The appropriate horizon depends, in general, on thetype and persistence of the shock. There is no simple rule to determine the appropriate horizon. Itdepends on the nature of the shocks. That is why the MPC spends so much time trying to unravelrecent economic history. On average, since shocks may take several months to have their fulleffect, a horizon of about two years is a reasonable one over which to bring inflation back to itstarget. But if shocks are sufficiently large – in either direction – then it may be sensible to aim tobring inflation back to the target level over a somewhat different horizon. In such circumstances,the MPC would make that clear both in the minutes of its meetings and in the Inflation Report,and, if required, in an open letter to the Chancellor.Common objectives versus individual accountabilityDuring its first two years, the MPC has had to develop a modus vivendi to manage the potentialtension between operating as a team with a common objective, on the one hand, and therequirement for individual accountability of its members, on the other. The Committee as a wholeneeds to explain its view of where the economy is heading. The Inflation Report has been themain vehicle for expressing the collective view of the Committee. Together with the minutes ofthe monthly meetings, it provides an explanation of past actions which should enable others tounderstand how we are likely to behave in the future.At the same time, the voting records of individual members of the MPC are in the public domain.That disclosure improves the quality of decisions, as well as the accountability of Committeemembers, because there is no better incentive to cast one’s vote for the policy most likely to hitthe inflation target than the prospect of having to defend that voting record in public. Of course,all members of the MPC are well aware that there is no certainty about the precise level ofinterest rates which is desirable in any given month. That is why we discuss with each other atgreat length the appropriate course of action before each member makes up his or her own mind.For such a system to work it is crucial that MPC members give their best judgment and do not tryto reach an artificial consensus. How, then, should we balance the need to give a clear view abouthow the Committee sees economic developments and the requirement of individualaccountability?There have been two main criticisms of the MPC in this respect. First, that the MPC has been tooopen about differences within it. Second, that the Committee has been not open enough. Let mestart with the first criticism. From its first meeting in June 1997 to the end of that year, theCommittee was unanimous on all six occasions. Output appeared to be above trend, the labourmarket was continuing to tighten, and there was a need to slow the growth of domestic demand inorder to reduce pressure on supply capacity. Interest rates were raised at each meeting betweenJune and August, and again in November. At that point the Committee was accused of acting likea “politburo”. But in January 1998 the first disagreement occurred. The Committee voted by fivevotes to three (the ninth member, John Vickers, did not join the MPC until June of last year) tohold interest rates constant. In February and March the Committee was evenly divided, and theGovernor used his casting vote in favour of an unchanged level of interest rates. Disagreementscontinued and in June the Committee voted 8 to 1 to raise interest rates for, as it turned out, thelast time in that interest rate cycle. By now, many commentators were disillusioned with theevidence of disagreements within the Committee. If I single out Philip Stephens from theFinancial Times it is only because his description, written in July 1998, of unhappiness with theCommittee was more vivid and articulate than most. He wrote:
BIS Review   63/19996“The Committee has thus far lacked both leadership and predictability. … On the evidence of theprevious six months, the MPC bears a closer resemblance to a post-graduate seminar than to aforum for strategic decision-making. …To put [several] economists in the same room is to invitewhat one commentator has called paralysis by analysis. As a result the Committee’s conclusionsare entirely unpredictable.”Since the beginning of 1998, the Committee has been unanimous at only one out of sixteenmeetings. That was in July of last year when the Committee voted to hold interest rates constantat 7.5%. Disagreements have become the norm, and are much less remarked upon by the pressthan they were before. Moreover, disagreement is now more widely accepted as natural. It wouldbe strange if the uncertainties facing the Committee were not reflected in small differences ofopinion. And views of the appropriate level of rates have never differed by more than 0.5percentage points. Nor have these technical disagreements led to “paralysis by analysis”. Indeed,the Committee has reduced interest rates by 23 percentage points since October of last year. Itwas precisely the analysis that led to the action.The willingness of the MPC to change interest rates either up or down in order to meet thesymmetric inflation target has altered commentator’s perceptions of the Committee itself. Early inits history, commentators were unable to resist labelling members of the Committee as either“hawks” or “doves”. I argued then that it made no sense to use these descriptions because eachmember of the Committee had the same objective. Members of the MPC cannot entertain closetviews about their desired inflation rate because they will be held personally accountable for theirjudgments about the level of interest rates necessary to meet the inflation target. No matter. Agood argument will never beat a good headline. Hawks and doves it was, though there were alsoreferences to ostriches, foxes and hedgehogs, and headless chickens. No doubt there were evenless flattering comparisons made in private. Still, unlike England football managers, we have not– yet – been compared with root vegetables. And we have made progress. As Chart 4 shows,press references to “hawks and doves” reached a peak in mid-1998 and have declined markedlysince. As I predicted in a speech in May last year, “as circumstances change, it is easy to imaginethat the ‘hawks’ shall be ‘doves’ and the ‘doves’ shall be ‘hawks’”.But we were also criticised for not being open enough about differences of view. The earlyminutes were thought to be too bland and to conceal expressions of individual points of view.Much of that criticism was indeed fair. And we have tried to respond by making the minutes amore accurate expression of the range of points of view that are expressed at the meeting. But Ishould stress that the discussion of the MPC focuses on the relative merits of different possibleexplanations of what is happening in the economy, in a spirit of mutual enquiry, rather than anexchange of fixed and conflicting views. A second criticism, made by the IMF team during therecent Article IV consultation, was that, whereas the minutes explained in some detail differencesof view among Committee members, the Inflation Report contained only a single projection forthe inflation outlook. Again, there was some justice in this criticism, and we have responded to it.In fact, for three out of the past four Inflation Reports, there have been explicit descriptions ofdifferences of view among Committee members about prospects for inflation.What are the challenges for the next two years?If monetary stability is to be a permanent feature of British economic life, the MPC will have toovercome several challenges in the years ahead. Two of these I would like to discuss briefly.First, how will the Committee deal with expectations that have been raised by the remarkable
7BIS Review   63/1999stability of inflation during its first two years? Second, how can the MPC build a constituency forlow inflation?Despite the openness and transparency of the new monetary framework, the British, indeed theworld, economy often moves in mysterious ways. Monetary policy is decision-making underuncertainty. That is why MPC projections are published as fan charts, not as point estimates. Thelags between a change in interest rates and its effects on output, demand and, ultimately, inflationmean that rough weather and occasional storms in the world economy are likely to blow us offcourse, at least for a time. A true test of the MPC is not whether it hits the target when the sea iscalm, but how it reacts to the storms, or economic shocks, that will inevitably arise.The most immediate challenge for the MPC is that, although inflation may fall below the targetover the next year, before long the inflation prospect further ahead will depend more on domesticinflationary pressures than it has over the past year or so, when external factors made a majorcontribution in holding down retail price inflation. Lags mean that the MPC needs to look ahead.The test of the MPC will be how it responds to the inflation prospect.Even in the absence of unexpected shocks there are major uncertainties. Trying to understandchanges in the way the economy behaves is a crucial part of the MPC’s work. In recent years wehave seen a combination of lower inflation, lower earnings growth and faster output growth thanprevious relationships would have led us to expect. The reasons for this benign combination ofgrowth with low inflation are not easy to diagnose. Some have talked about a new era or a “newparadigm”, in which productivity growth has permanently risen. We should be cautious aboutthose who speak of new paradigms. Paradigm is a word too often used by those who would like tohave a new idea but cannot think of one.Optimism about growth rates has been greatest in the United States, which is hardly surprisinggiven the recent performance of the US economy. But wiser heads counsel caution. AlanGreenspan has argued that, although there is evidence of a structural shift in the level ofproductivity, the laws of supply and demand have not been repealed. Eventually the oldrelationships will return.If the UK economy moves in mysterious ways, it does not always perform wonders. Acomparison between the US and UK is instructive. In both countries earnings growth has beenlower, given the level of unemployment, than would have been predicted on the basis of pastrelationships. Inflation has not picked up despite a tight labour market. In the US one explanationfor this benign outcome is that costs have been held down by an increase in productivity growth.Over the past three years labour productivity (output per person hour) in the US has grown at anaverage annual rate of around 22%, well above the average rate of 1–12% over the past thirtyyears; and over the past year productivity growth rose to an annualised rate of 3% or more. Overthe same three years productivity growth in the UK has been 12% a year, well below the thirty-year average of 2–22% a year. In the US the application of new technology, especiallyinformation technology, is often held responsible for this improved performance. Suchexplanations should, in principle, apply to most industrialised countries, at least to some degree.But, whatever similarities there are in the recent economic performance of the US and UK,productivity growth is not one of them. Indeed, since 1990, UK productivity growth has beenexactly in line with the thirty-year average. So it would be premature at this stage to suppose thatthere has been a permanent shift in productivity behaviour in the UK, although further study ofthe recent differences in productivity growth across countries and how they might relate todifferences in the way information technology has affected working practices is important.
BIS Review   63/19998If not productivity, what other changes might help to explain the recent benign behaviour ofinflation? A more plausible explanation for the lower-than-expected growth rates of earnings, andhence prices, is, in my view, a fall in inflation expectations. If that is the case, then part of theimproved performance of the last two or three years can be attributed to a combination of the“credibility windfall” resulting from the new monetary policy framework and the benign impacton inflation of the higher exchange rate and lower commodity and import prices.In order to assess whether economic relationships have changed, it is vital that the MPC haveaccess to timely and accurate information. Official statistics comprise the bulk of informationavailable to the MPC. Following the recent review of data on average earnings, it has beendecided to put the relationship between the Bank and the Office for National Statistics on a moreformal basis with a Service Level Agreement between the two organisations. Good progress hasbeen made on drafting that Agreement. But the MPC cannot live by official statistics alone, noreven on a diet of business and household surveys. In addition, the Bank has a network of twelveRegional Agents. Their main task is to ask local people how they view the current state of theeconomy. Each year the Bank’s Agents make, in total, around 7,000 visits to business contactsacross the country. The attraction of this information is that it is timely and focussed on theCommittee’s needs. Other data are often published with a considerable lag. And there arefrequently gaps and puzzles in those data which the Agents can help to resolve. Each month theMPC decides on a “question of the month” which the Agents then put to their contacts. Recentquestions have covered trends in employment, the behaviour of earnings, the reaction of exportsto the rise in sterling, and the likely effects of the Millennium on investment expenditure. Withina couple of weeks, the responses from a sample of about 150 companies are available to the MPC.More generally, the views of businesses around the country about the state of trade are passeddirectly to the MPC through the intermediary of the Regional Agents who attend the monthly pre-MPC briefing meetings. This may not be quite “One 2 One” but it is a rapid and directcommunication.The Bank of England has never had an Agency office in Northern Ireland. It is time to put thatright. I am very pleased, therefore, to announce that in January next year the Bank of England willopen an Agency in Belfast. It will increase our contacts with, and knowledge of, the economy andpeople of Northern Ireland. Nigel Falls, one of our most experienced Agents, will be the firstAgent for Northern Ireland. He is here tonight, and you will be seeing a great deal of him infuture.The second challenge for the future is to build a constituency for low inflation. There is I believe,a good deal of support in this country for monetary stability. Those who experienced the high andunpredictable rates of inflation of the 1970s and 1980s – the “inflation generation” – have ensuredthat all major political parties are now committed to stability. But there have been times in thepast when low and stable inflation was abandoned by those who succumbed to the temptations ofmonetary laxity. Some of you here tonight are, I hope, taking a break from revision for your finalexaminations. Thirty years ago this month I was in your position. As part of my revision, I studiedthe inflation rates since the Second World War for several different measures of inflation. Theywere all at or very close to 3% a year. No-one in Cambridge at that time – and certainly not thestudents that were to become part of the inflation generation – heeded the late Richard Kahn’swarning that creeping inflation was about to accelerate. The rest, as they say, is monetary history.I would like those of you revising for your final exams this month to be able to look back in thirtyyears time and recall that the year in which you graduated was when we finally laid to rest theidea that the UK was an inflation-prone economy. Inflation was the norm for most of my adultlife. It should not be in yours.
9BIS Review   63/1999Why then, you may ask, do we need to build a constituency for low inflation? There are tworeasons. First, it is important that support for low inflation not wane as the experience of high andunstable inflation of the past recedes. It would be a counsel of despair to believe that theinflationary excesses of the recent past would have to be repeated in order to retain support forlow inflation. Yet, in a recent survey of households in Germany, Robert Shiller2 found thatsupport for stability was much higher among those who had experienced hyperinflation. Of thoseborn before 1940 as many as 90% agreed with the statement that “the control of inflation is one ofthe most important missions of German economic policy”, whereas only 51% of those born after1950 agreed with the statement. Those who value health most are often those who haveexperienced sickness. There is a lesson here. The past decade has been good for central banks andcentral bankers. But that success should not blind us to the realisation that if public acceptance ofprice stability is based on no more than recent experience of the opposite, then the democraticlegitimacy of central banks requires a more solid foundation.So how can we build the constituency for low inflation? Openness and transparency of the MPC,and explanations of our actions, are an essential part of our task. But we can do more. Over thepast few months I have been chairing a working party in the Bank designed to answer thequestion of how we can build the constituency for low inflation. We have been exploring possibleeducational initiatives to increase public understanding of the benefits of monetary stability. Andwe have also been considering the way in which public opinion polls might be used to tell usabout the degree of public understanding of the inflation target, the role of the MPC in achievingit, and, more generally, about the inflation process itself. I hope we shall be able to announce theresults of those deliberations before long. The aim is to ensure that the inflation generation isreplaced by a new generation, a generation for whom economic success will depend more on theirown efforts than on the accidental consequences of high and unstable inflation for the distributionof wealth – whether in housing, pensions or financial savings.ConclusionsSo what should we make of the Monetary Policy Committee after two years? As all parents know,second birthdays are often the prelude to a difficult period: the “terrible twos”. But I am confidentthat, whatever difficulties lie ahead, the Chancellor will be able to take some pride in hisoffspring. Philip Ziegler has described the British constitution as an accumulation of “instantlyinvented precedents”. Indeed, there is a tradition in the UK of making radical reforms in such away that it is impossible, after a few years, to imagine that things were done any other way. That Ipredict will be true of the MPC.The whole monetary policy process is today systematic and professional in a way that wasunimaginable less than ten years ago. Then, meetings between the Chancellor and Governor todiscuss interest rates were often called at only a few hours notice. Now, analysis, meetings of theMPC and the publication of both the decision and the reasons for it proceed on a pre-announcedtimetable. The change has significantly reduced the uncertainty facing financial markets andenhanced the quality of the decisions themselves. It is a massive improvement, and one which hasearned the UK a good deal of respect on the international stage, as judged by the Article IVreports from the IMF and the convergence reports of the European Union.Shortly after Robert Rubin announced last week his impending departure as US TreasurySecretary, he gave the Commencement Address at New York University. In it he stated the fourprinciples for decision-making that had guided him during his career. They encapsulate exactly                                                     2 Shiller, R, “Why do people dislike inflation?” NBER Working Paper No.5539, April 1996
BIS Review   63/199910the philosophy of the MPC. First, the only certainty is that there is no certainty. Second, everydecision is a matter of weighing probabilities, or the balance of risks, as we say. Third, despiteuncertainty we have to decide and act. Fourth, decisions should be judged not only on the resultsbut also on how they were made. The first three principles guide every meeting of the MPC. Andthe fourth is one I commend to all those who wish to make their own judgment about the MPCtwo years on.Institutions matter. The Bank of England is an old institution. But its success has been based onits willingness to change and adapt. In its 300-year history, probably no change has been assignificant as operational independence and the creation of the Monetary Policy Committee. TheBank aims to be at the forefront of the theory and practice of monetary policy. But we cannot reston our laurels. There is still much to learn and to change. Economic theory moves forward andeconomic behaviour is never constant. The practice of monetary policy must keep up. But whatwe will not change is our commitment to monetary stability and to the achievement of theGovernment’s inflation target. It is that commitment which can deliver economic stability to thiscountry.
1BIS Review   62/1999Mr Trichet presents the Annual Report of the Bank of FranceAddress by Jean-Claude Trichet, Governor of the Bank of France before the President of the FrenchRepublic, Senate and National Assembly on the occasion of the presentation of the Annual Report, inParis on 21/5/99.I am honoured to present you with the report on the operations of the Banque de France, monetarypolicy and the prospects for it, as required by law. As is the custom, I also submit herewith theMonetary Policy Council’s comments on the events of the past year, which was marked by the choiceof the European Union Member States authorized to participate in Monetary Union and by thecreation on 1 June 1998 of the European System of Central Banks.The upturn in growth that started in 1997 accelerated in 1998. Annual average GDP growth stood at3.2%, after 2.3% in 1997 and 1.6% in 1996. In 1998, the expansion was fuelled by vigorous domesticdemand, particularly household consumption. Furthermore, total investment, which had stagnated in1997, posted a dynamic increase in 1998. By contrast, foreign trade made a negative contribution toGDP growth owing to the deterioration in the international environment. Although France wascomparatively less severely hit by the spread of the emerging country crisis, the economy wasaffected by weaker demand from our main European trading partners.Thanks to faster growth, the French economy created 300,000 jobs in the non-farm market sector in1998, compared with 196,000 in 1997. The unemployment rate fell from 12.2% to 11.5% from theend of one year to the next.Against the backdrop of quickening growth, inflation was brought further under control. The year-on-year rise in consumer prices stood at 0.3% in December 1998, after 1.1% in 1997, and thus met theobjective of less than 2% set by the Monetary Policy Council. This was the lowest rate of inflationrecorded since 1954. One of the main factors in the slowdown in price rises was the fall in the price ofoil and other commodities. “Underlying” inflation, which reflects the fundamental trends in theeconomy, showed a slightly more sustained progression than the consumer price index. According toFrance’s National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies, INSEE, it posted a year-on-year rise of1.1% in December 1998, the same as in December 1997.According to the harmonized index of consumer prices (HICP), which is the measure of inflation inthe euro area, France is one of the three best-performing countries in terms of inflation: Frenchinflation stood at 0.7% as an annual average in 1998, compared with 1.1% for the euro area.In the course of 1998, the franc remained constantly above its central rates vis-à-vis the other mostcredible currencies of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. The goal of a stable external valuefor the franc—which was the external intermediate objective of French monetary policy over the lastfive years—was thus achieved.This went hand in hand with the maintenance of the competitiveness of the French economy. Thecurrent account surplus totalled FRF 236 billion in 1998, or 2.8% of GDP, comparable to the levelrecorded in 1997.With regard to monetary and financial developments, and particularly growth in monetaryaggregates—which constitutes the internal intermediate objective of French monetary policy—, themeans of payment covered by M1 posted a year-on-year rise of 3.1% in December 1998, after 6.5% inDecember 1997. Sight deposits paying regulated rates of interest included in M2 –M1 showed a year-on-year increase of 5.7% in December 1998, sharply down on the 9.2% recorded at the end of theprevious year. Similarly, M2 progressed by 4.3%, less than the 7.8% rise recorded in 1997. Theaggregate M3–M2, which covers liquid investments paying market rates of interest, stabilized in 1998
BIS Review   62/19992with a 0.6% decline after the 8.2% drop recorded in 1997. This was mainly due to growth in moneymarket UCITS, which rose by 4.1% after declining by 11.3% the previous year. The year-on-yearincrease in M3 was 2.7%, compared with 2.0% in December 1997. Growth in investment incontractual savings products recorded in the P1 investment aggregate maintained a sustained pace in1998, and in all M3+P1 showed a year-on-year progression of 4.0%, against 5.1% in December 1997.Total domestic debt posted a year-on-year rise of 3.4% at the end of December. It had shown anincrease of 3.7% in December 1997. Financing raised on the domestic markets progressed vigorously,with the year-on-year advance standing at 9.2% in December 1998, after 6.6% a year earlier.Against a background marked by uncertainty surrounding the international environment and byprospects of a euro area-wide slowdown in activity, on 3 December 1998 the Monetary PolicyCouncil of the Banque de France, in close dialogue with the other members of the European Systemof Central Banks (ESCB), decided to cut its main key rate, which had been set at 3.30% since October1997, to 3.0%.This decision was inspired by three considerations:– the need to ensure the cohesion of the euro area in the best possible conditions;– the need to organize the convergence of short-term rates towards the lowest rates in the area, i.e.in particular French rates;– the need to choose the level of key rates that was most appropriate at the time of entry into theeuro.This decision constituted a further stage in the process leading to the transfer of responsibility formonetary policy to the European System of Central Banks as of 1 January 1999. In fact, the rateapplying to the first main refinancing operations of the ESCB was set at 3% on 22 December 1998 bythe Governing Council of the ECB.After five years of independent conduct of monetary policy, the Banque de France has earned a highdegree of confidence, as witnessed by the solidity of the franc and the relative level of French long-term interest rates. The Bank is proud to have been able to transmit this confidence to the euro, alongwith other central banks forming the core of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism.Nineteen ninety eight was a successful year for European integration: the remarkable convergence ofEuropean economies enabled the historic decision by heads of state and government to commiteleven countries to the road to the euro. The date of 4 January 1999 marked a first technical successin the changeover from national currencies to the euro. The major challenge now facing the euro areaas a whole is to permanently guarantee good economic and financial performances. It is no longer aquestion of victoriously overcoming an obstacle, but of efficiently managing the monetary, fiscal andstructural areas over the long term. This is naturally indispensable in order to ensure cohesion,stability, prosperity and consequently a reduction in unemployment in the euro area, i.e. in an areawith 291 million inhabitants. And this is also a contribution necessary for the stability and prosperityof the world economy, within which Europe will play a central role, like the United States.Monetary policyThe euro should be at least as solid and stable as the best currencies of the European Union andtherefore at least as solid and stable as the French franc in the past. This is what inspires the policy ofthe European System of Central Banks, the European Central Bank and its Governing Council. Thisis what is required by the Treaty and also by our fellow citizens, who want a new currency that is atleast as solid as the French franc. And it is indispensable in order to preserve the competitiveness ofthe European economy, ensure low medium- and long-term market interest rates on a lasting basisand therefore favour growth, job creation and the fight against unemployment.
3BIS Review   62/1999The stability-oriented monetary policy of the European Central Bank and of the European System ofCentral Banks is guaranteed by their independence, which is enshrined in the Treaty. It is buttressedby the support of European public opinion which, like French public opinion, is deeply attached tothe stability of the currency. In the final analysis, an independent institution is always accountable tothe public.In a world monetary and financial system characterized by totally free capital flows, confidence is themost precious asset: the confidence that we inspire in economic agents and French, European andinternational investors; and the confidence with which we are credited today, tomorrow and in thefuture. The independent Banque de France has over the last six years shown great determination inhelping to ensure that the euro inherited as much confidence as possible at its birth. This legacy ofconfidence is in good hands.Fiscal policyIn the field of European fiscal policy, the Monetary Policy Council draws attention to the followingthree points.– First, it remains essential that the mutual surveillance by euro area governments of national fiscalpolicies, within the framework of strict compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact, functionsmoothly. The European Union does not have a significant federal budget for economic policy—the European budget only represents 1.27% of Union GDP. Therefore, all the national budgets ofthe Member States combined function as the Union’ s budget. The preservation of confidence inthe euro, and consequently the prosperity, growth and creation of jobs in the euro area, willdepend on the quality of fiscal surveillance throughout the area.– Second, by adopting the Stability and Growth Pact each individual European country, and notjust the European Union, set itself the medium-term objective of achieving public finances “closeto balance or in surplus”. The Monetary Policy Council emphasizes this point, which is essentialfor the stability of the single currency and is necessary to favour growth, job creation and thefight against unemployment. One of the difficulties encountered by Europe, as by France, is thatpublic opinion is not yet entirely convinced. However, four simple arguments form the basis ofthis recommendation: preserve, thanks to the confidence of investors, low medium- and long-term market interest rates, generate the financial resources necessary for productive sectorinvestment, strengthen the confidence of the personal sector and bolster that of the corporatesector. It should be added that all Monetary Union member countries have to have budgets thatare close to balance or in surplus, precisely in order to allow public finances to act, wherenecessary, as “automatic stabilizers” when economic conditions deteriorate. This point isessential, most particularly in the event of “asymmetric shocks”, i.e. particular economicdifficulties affecting one member country, but not the others.– Last, as it has done constantly in recent years, the Monetary Policy Council calls attention to theneed to gradually reduce the ratio of public expenditure to GDP. According to OECDmethodology, in France public spending amounts to 54.2% of GDP, well above the euro-areaaverage of 48.7% and the Group of Seven leading industrialized countries average of 38.1%.Bringing this ratio back below 50% is a primary objective, even though it is timid in comparisonwith the performances of France’s partners. This greater rectitude in the management of publicfinances is a vital condition of competitiveness, growth and the development of employment inFrance. In this respect, one may note that the policy mix in the United States is based on theconviction that the resolute policy of public deficit reduction has been one of the main engines ofthe vigorous growth enjoyed by the US for many years.Structural reform
BIS Review   62/19994The effectiveness of economic policies is not simply the result of the right mix of fiscal and monetarypolicy. Structural policies themselves have a major part to play. This is particularly true in Franceand throughout the euro area, where around three quarters of unemployment is structural.As with the level of public expenditure, European public opinion is again not sufficiently convincedthat mass unemployment is very largely the unfortunate result of structural defects. When the publicis convinced, it is likely that the problem will be easier to resolve since European leaders will thenmore readily find the support essential for the successful completion of reforms that as a rule are hardto implement.The enhanced coordination between economic policies, decided at the end of 1997 by the EuropeanCouncil meeting in Luxembourg, relates in particular to “the surveillance of the structural policiesimplemented by the Member States”. This coordination should make it possible to identify andpromote the best measures in the fields of education and training, the labour market, welfareprotection, etc.The Monetary Policy Council readily suggests implementing three principles of action for structuralreform in the euro area. These would lead all euro-area countries to introduce at home reformsexperimented in another economy of the area that meet the following three criteria: first, they are thesubject of a multipartisan consensus; second, they have been implemented on the basis of anagreement between the social partners; third, they have actually helped create jobs. The Council doesnot doubt the fact that France, like all the economies of the euro area, could benefit greatly from theextension of such consensual and effective reforms.The competitiveness of the economyLast, as it has done in each of the previous years, the Monetary Policy Council emphasizes theimportance of cost containment in the economy and the need to provide an environment that favoursthe competitiveness of businesses. In Europe, before the single currency, any poorly conductednational economic policy was swiftly and severely punished by depreciation of the currency on theforeign exchange markets and rises in market interest rates. With the creation of the single currency,these indicators have disappeared along with the swiftly applied sanctions associated with them. Inthe new euro area, any economic policy errors leading to lost competitiveness would result, moreslowly and insidiously, in weaker growth and job creation. For this reason, even more so than in thepast, unit production costs and more generally the quality of the competitive environment ofbusinesses need to be very closely monitored.The reason why we emphasize the importance of competitiveness indicators is therefore not only thatcost containment is a necessary condition for low inflation. It also, and primarily, lies in the fact thatin the European economy of today, which is governed by complete freedom of choice for consumersand complete freedom for businesses to choose where to invest, jobs will be created preferentially ineconomies that manage to contain their unit production costs and offer an environment that is asfavourable as possible to business competitiveness.
1BIS Review   61/1999Mr Bäckström covers monetary policy in Sweden from 1996 to 1998Opening remarks by Mr Urban Bäckström, Governor of Sveriges Riksbank, the Swedishcentral bank, before the Standing Committee on Finance in Stockholm on 18 May 1999.IntroductionIn the period 1996–98 the annual rates of inflation, measured with the CPI, were 0.8, 0.9 and0.4 per cent, respectively. This means that in each of these years the change in the CPI notonly deviated from monetary policy’s 2 per cent target for price stability but was also outsidethe lower tolerance limit of 1 per cent inflation.The Riksbank has indeed made assessments that subsequently proved to be a bit off the mark.As a result we have also made decisions that, looking back when the outcome was known,could have been somewhat different. But on the whole, the result of monetary policy in thisperiod seems to be acceptable. In my opening remarks I intend to give this appraisal moresubstance.One major reason why CPI inflation has been low in the past three years is that the price trendhas been affected by some specific price movements that monetary policy neither can norshould aim to counter fully. If the Riksbank attempts to counter such price movements, theresult might be unnecessarily costly for the economy, that is, exaggerated fluctuations ineconomic activity as well as in the financial markets. It was against this background that thenew Executive Board of the Riksbank clarified the inflation target earlier this spring. To alarge extent, the clarification tallies with how monetary period has actually been conducted inthe period that the Standing Committee is now appraising.I therefore conclude that when inflation is measured with the CPI, deviations from theinflation target, upwards as well as downwards, in certain periods are something to which weunfortunately will have to grow accustomed. As a target variable, however, the CPI has manyadvantages, including being familiar and covering a large assortment of goods and services.Deviations from the target may sometimes even be desirable and actually benefit real factors,such as production and employment, as well as financial market stability. This conclusiondoes of course presuppose that people in general expect that in the medium term inflation willbe in line with the target.Inflation in 1996, 1997 and 1998I now want to look in more detail at the path of inflation in the three years 1996, 1997 and1998. In the period as a whole, the annual rate of price increases, measured with the CPI,averaged 0.7 per cent. As I just mentioned, however, in each of these years CPI inflation wasmarkedly affected by shocks that are fairly easy to identify and only have transitory directeffects on inflation.Lower interest ratesIn the course of these years the Riksbank lowered the repo rate from 8.91 to 3.4 per cent, or bymore than 5.5 percentage points. The five-year T-bond rate moved down from about 8 percent to just over 3.8 per cent, or by 4.2 percentage points. Falling interest rates can stimulateeconomic activity and thereby lead in time to higher inflation as the level of resource
BIS Review   61/19992utilisation rises. In the short run, however, the effect on inflation, measured with the CPI, isdownwards as a result of lower house mortgage interest payments. So although inflation mayultimately rise as a consequence of lower interest rates, the initial effect is the opposite. Inthese years, moreover, the effect on interest expenditure was substantial in that inflationexpectations dropped from high levels as the low inflation regime gradually gained credibility.The downward effect of the lower interest rates on the CPI actually averaged as much as 0.7percentage points a year.Altered indirect taxes and subsidiesIn this period there were also fairly large changes in indirect taxes. In the longer run this caninfluence inflationary pressure via fiscal policy’s impact on demand but there are also moredirect effects. In 1996 changes in indirect taxes had a downward effect on CPI inflation of 0.6percentage points, followed in 1997 by an average upward effect of 0.5 percentage points. In1998 as a whole the impact of altered indirect taxes was marginal; after the summer, however,various measures, including the reduction of tobacco tax, lowered the rate of CPI inflation by0.5 percentage points.Falling commodity pricesThe development of commodity prices has likewise affected the rate of inflation in the pastthree calendar years. The international economic slowdown meant that in the course of 1998international commodity prices began to fall relatively sharply. It can be mentioned, forexample, that towards the end of 1998 just the lower prices for coffee, petrol and domesticheating oil had a downward effect on Swedish CPI inflation of 0.4 percentage points. As inthe case of changes in taxes and interest rates, there are distinct direct effects that may deviatefrom the more long-term impact on demand.1.

5BIS Review   61/1999One approach to a more detailed separation of trend or core inflation from these types oftransitory price effects involves looking at the various indicators of underlying inflation thathave been developed at the Riksbank. Whereas annual CPI inflation in the period 1996–98averaged 0.7 per cent, inflation as measured by UND1X, which excludes interest expenditure,taxes and subsidies, averaged 1.5 per cent. As measured by UNDINHX, which also excludesgoods that are mainly imported, inflation amounted instead to 2.1 per cent. However, the latterindicator disregards a large proportion of the factors that contribute to a weaker price trend forgoods in the longer run.This review shows that in all three years (1996–98) inflation has been below the targetexpressed in terms of the CPI. However, excluding more transitory price effects that monetarypolicy neither can nor should try to counter in full, inflation has been inside the stipulatedtolerance interval. I shall be returning to the reasons why price effects of this type should bedisregarded in an appraisal of the Riksbank’s monetary policy.Permanent and transitory inflation – a schematic account1Let us now use some simplified examples to analyse how different transitory effects oninflation may arise and what they may imply for monetary policy. Note that we are nowstudying the direct effects on inflation and disregarding, at least in the second and thirdexamples, the indirect influences that act in the longer run.1To illustrate the effects of the various shocks on the picture of inflation as measured with the variousindexes, rules of thumb have been used in each example. In practice, a monetary policy situation may alsoinclude aspects that prompt the Riksbank to take other effects of its policy measures into account.6. Conclusions about inflation 1996-98nInflation - measured with the CPI - was below the target and the lowertolerance limit during 1996-1998nCPI-inflation has been markedly affected in all three years bytransitory effects that are easy to identifynExcluding more transitory price effects, inflation has been inside thestipulated tolerance interval
BIS Review   61/19996Example 1: an economic slowdownAssume that international economic activity suddenly falters. This will affect the economicsituation in Sweden. In this example, given that the repo rate is left unchanged, it is assumedto lead to the inflation rate two years ahead being 1 per cent instead of 2 per cent.In this example we assume that the repo rate is reduced by 2 percentage points (in practice theRiksbank might prefer to proceed in steps because of uncertainties in the forecast but here alarge cut is made immediately). The interest rate reduction counters the economic slowdownand UND1X inflation returns to the target two years ahead.A repo rate cut, however, lowers house mortgage interest expenditure and this has animmediate and opposite effect on the CPI. The effect is larger and shows up earlier than theimpact on inflation from the economic slowdown. In the short run, the effect via interestexpenditure accordingly smothers the effect from economic activity and there is therefore asharp initial fall in CPI inflation. In this example, the falling interest rates are assumed tolower the rate of CPI inflation by 1.2 percentage points in the first year and 0.4 percentagepoints in the second.2 It is only after that, in up to three years time, that both CPI and UND1Xinflation are back on target.The example shows that in retrospect, the Riksbank will turn out to be below the target forCPI inflation. This is a consequence of the Riksbank’s ambition to counter the shock from theinternational economic slowdown and thereby prevent inflation from falling further ahead. In2The effects are dependent on, for example, how the long-term interest rate is assumed to move when therepo rate is adjusted. In example 1 the estimates are based on the short- and long-term interest ratesmoving to the same extent, which has largely been the case in recent years.7.

7BIS Review   61/1999such a situation it is therefore reasonable to base policy on an inflation forecast that excludesthe direct effects on interest expenditure.Example 2: altered indirect taxesIn this example economic activity is stable and inflation in line with the target. Suddenly a cutin indirect taxes, for instance the tobacco tax or the property tax on private houses, isannounced and approved. The cut is assumed to have a downward effect on CPI inflation of0.7 percentage points in the current year. This, however, constitutes a one-off shift in the pricelevel, not an effect that alters inflation’s trend. All else equal, 12 months later the rate ofinflation will shift back up to the earlier level. Note, however, that inflation measured withUND1X is not affected; the rate remains stable around 2 per cent throughout the period.Neither are any monetary policy measures taken in this example, as long as inflationexpectations do not change. The reason is that by the time a repo rate cut would elicit effects,the tax changes would no longer be affecting the inflation rate. This is evident from theabsence of any effect on underlying inflation. Initially, moreover, the interest expenditure itemin the CPI would move in the ‘wrong’ direction and lower CPI inflation even more.If medium-term inflation expectations were to be influenced, on the other hand, monetarypolicy action might be called for. An adjustment of expectations in the light of the tax changehas consequences for underlying inflation, so that inflation may be below the target somewhatfurther ahead.8. Permanent and transitory inflationA schematic account012340123YearInitial positionEconomic developmentstable, underlying inflation -UND1X - in line with thetarget.Government andParliament lower indirecttaxesCPI-inflation is lowered for aperiod of twelve months butunderlying inflation,measured with UND1X,remains stable.UND1XCPI
BIS Review   61/19998Example 3: falling commodity pricesFrom the earlier examples it might be supposed that UND1X is an index of underlyinginflation that would be preferable to the CPI as a basis for the formulation of monetary policy,so that policy ought to be appraised strictly in relation to this indicator. However, evenUND1X may be affected by transitory shocks.Let us assume that the price of oil suddenly falls and then remains stable at the lower level.Underlying inflation measured with UND1X will then fall as much as the CPI. UNDINHX, onthe other hand, remains stable around the 2 per cent target. After 12 months, however, the firsttwo measures of inflation return to 2 per cent. This follows from the assumption of a one-offshift in the price of oil.In this example, too, no monetary policy measures are taken as long as inflation expectationsare not adjusted. The reason is the same as in the previous example.Could the CPI inflation target have been fulfilled?Would it have been possible, then, for monetary policy to keep the inflation rate at 2 per centduring these three years? The answer is both yes and no.Briefly, the problem with adhering to the 2 per cent inflation target, measured with the CPI,from 1996 to 1998 is as follows:In the short run, the downward and direct impact on CPI inflation from lower interest rates –the interest expenditure effect – is appreciably larger than the upward tendency associatedwith stronger economic activity: the macroeconomic effect.9.

9BIS Review   61/1999A situation in which forecast inflation one to two years ahead points to the rate being belowthe target poses evident difficulties for monetary policy. In order to bring inflation back intoline with the target further ahead, the Riksbank responds by reducing the repo rate, which hasthe effect of lowering inflation still more in the shorter run. The interest expenditure effectdisappears after a couple of years and the macroeconomic effect gains the upper hand. Theopposite applies if the repo rate is raised.This accordingly indicates that an appraisal of monetary policy must be based on a thoroughanalysis of the factors behind the path of inflation, for example by comparing CPI inflationwith other inflation indicators that exclude transitory price effects.There was, in fact, a theoretical possibility of preventing CPI inflation from being so low in1996, 1997 and 1998. The Riksbank never even considered it, for obvious reasons. Still, I canillustrate how the inflation target could have been fulfilled mechanically by avoiding the directinterest expenditure effect.If the Riksbank had left the repo rate at 8.91 per cent – its level before the cuts were initiatedearly in 1996 – then the direct interest expenditure effect could have been avoided.Economic activity would have gradually weakened, however, and this would have pusheddown the CPI excluding the interest expenditure effect. But that would have taken time and tobegin with the macroeconomic effect would have been rather small.Sooner or later, however, the macroeconomic effect would have begun to surpass the interesteffect on the CPI. In theory, that could have been prevented by raising the interest rate andthereby increasing the interest expenditure effect.Such a strategy could have been implemented for a time but in the end the economy wouldhave become so sluggish that the macroeconomic effect would still have gained the upperhand. The situation would probably have caused the exchange rate to collapse. The markeddepreciation would have led to rising import prices and perhaps CPI inflation would then havemoved back up to the targeted rate.That is what could have happened, though I want to stress that the scenario is theoretical andhypothetical. The Riksbank would have fulfilled the CPI target but at the cost of markedinstability in interest rates and the exchange rate as well as in the real economy. I find it hardto believe that such a strategy would have been supported for any length of time by either thepolitical system or people in general.In the event of a deviation from the inflation target, the Riksbank has to decide how soonmonetary policy should bring inflation back to the targeted rate. If this is done too quickly, itwill exact a cost in the form of instability in the real economy and in financial markets. If ittakes too long, on the other hand, inflation will fluctuate markedly, with the risk of a risingtrend or even genuine deflation.Against this background, early this year the Executive Board elaborated on the inflation targetand stated that, under certain specific circumstances, the Riksbank has reason to be moreflexible in its interpretation.3 When I presented this to the Standing Committee in more detail3See Riksbank memorandum: ‘The Riksbank’s inflation target – clarification and appraisal’, 4 February1999.
BIS Review   61/199910last March, I noted that it amounted essentially to a codification of monetary policy practice inrecent years. That is also what I have described today.There is another matter I want to take up concerning monetary policy and its result. It has todo with the outturn for 1998, when the annual change in the CPI was 0.4 per cent, whileUND1X rose only 1 per cent and in some months was also outside the lower band limit.Could not an alternative interest rate policy have succeeded in preventing such a low outcomefor underlying inflation?Monetary policy could obviously have been given a more expansionary turn than was the caseat the end of 1996 and during 1997, in which case UND1X inflation might have been higherand more in line with the 2 per cent target, quite apart from the interest expenditure effect onthe CPI.In this context one can, of course, discuss the Riksbank’s basic forecasts of inflationexcluding the transitory effects from interest expenditure and taxes. The Riksbank made aforecasting error in failing to foresee the economic slowdown inherent in the Asian crisis andthe ensuing fall in commodity prices. Unfortunately, you might say, we shared this error witha clear majority of observers. With the long time lag that applies to monetary policy, measuresshould really have been taken before the end of 1996 or early 1997, which was before thecrisis had even arisen. If the commodity price fall does not leave any traces in inflationexpectations, it should not affect policy either.CPI and underlying inflation in a longer perspective44 For a more thorough discussion, see Inflation Report 1999:1, box on pp 35–37, Transitory factors andother supply shocks: a model approach.Determinants of inflation:1. Expected inflation trend2. Economic situation3. Supply shocks, e.g. changes inindirect taxes, oil prices or interestrates10.

11BIS Review   61/1999There have been periods in the last three decades when CPI inflation has deviated from theindexes of underlying inflation. This happened, for example, in connection with the oil crisesin the 1970s, the fall in oil prices and interest rates in the mid-1980s, the tax reform in the late1980s and the downward shifts in interest rates in the 1990s.There is nothing new about this phenomenon, which can thus recur. It has to do with inflationbeing determined mainly by factors of three types:• long-term inflation expectations• the economic situation• transitory factors and supply shocks such as changes in indirect taxes and subsidies,interest expenditure and commodity pricesFor monetary policy it seems reasonable to assert that factors of the first two types are mostrelevant because it is mainly through them that monetary policy is capable of influencinginflation. Factors such as indirect taxes have effects on consumer prices that are transitory;they normally disappear after a time unless long-term inflation expectations have beenaffected.ConclusionThe CPI is the target variable for monetary policy. Measured with the CPI, inflation is to be 2per cent in a longer, annual perspective. There are grounds, however, for sometimes departingfrom this target. Short-run deviations from the target should not be attributed automatically toa faulty formulation of monetary policy. This presupposes, however, that clearly identifiable,transitory price movements are involved that monetary policy neither can nor should aim tocounter. It is therefore important to look at the factors behind the CPI figures when appraisingmonetary policy.7KH(cid:3)UHDVRQ(cid:3)IRU(cid:3)OHWWLQJ(cid:3)GHYLDWLRQV(cid:3)RFFXU(cid:3)LV(cid:3)WKDW(cid:3)RWKHUZLVH(cid:3)WKH(cid:3)HFRQRP\(cid:3)ZRXOG(cid:3)EH(cid:3)GHVWDELOLVHG(cid:15)OHDGLQJ(cid:3)VRRQHU(cid:3)RU(cid:3)ODWHU(cid:3)WR(cid:3)XQQHFHVVDU\(cid:3)HFRQRPLF(cid:3)FRVWV(cid:15)(cid:3)WKDW(cid:3)LV(cid:3)WR(cid:3)VD\(cid:15)(cid:3)H[DJJHUDWHG(cid:3)IOXFWXDWLRQVLQ(cid:3)ERWK(cid:3)WKH(cid:3)UHDO(cid:3)HFRQRP\(cid:3)DQG(cid:3)WKH(cid:3)ILQDQFLDO(cid:3)PDUNHWV(cid:17)
1BIS Review   60/1999Mr Stals discusses the challenges to monetary policy in increasingly volatileinternational marketsAddress by the Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, Dr Chris Stals, at a conferenceon ‘The South African Economy in a World of Volatile Financial Markets’, arranged by theBureau for Economic Research of the University of Stellenbosch in Johannesburg on 25 May1999.The contagion effectThe globalisation or international integration of the world’s financial markets brought with itnew challenges for monetary and other macroeconomic policies. The volatile conditions inworld financial markets over the past two years created new problems for macroeconomicmanagement in a number of countries. It was particularly smaller economies with partlydeveloped financial markets – the emerging markets – that were more seriously affected bythese adverse developments.Ex post analyses of the financial crisis of 1997/98 focused attention on purported deficienciesof macroeconomic policies, and of economic structures in many of the afflicted countries.From these lessons, programmes for a major reform of existing structures, particularlyfinancial structures, and of essential adjustment in macroeconomic policies, are nowemerging. At the same time, attention is given to the need for some restructuring of the globalfinancial architecture with the objective to avoid a repetition of the 1997/98 crisis. Crisisprevention, after all, is better than crisis resolution.Without going into the details of the many proposals now being discussed at the global andnational level for reforming macroeconomic structures and policies, pragmatism leads to theconclusion that the present globalised financial market structure is by its nature unstable,unpredictable and, with all its virtues and advantages, at times very disrupting for domesticnational economic policy objectives.Easy communication through a worldwide network, the instant transfer of information on areal-time basis to all destinations, economic liberalisation and the transfer of resources such assurplus saving from more developed to developing countries have changed the environment inwhich macroeconomic policies must now be framed.Recent developments exposed an important aspect of this new global environment and that isthe so-called contagion effect, or the ease with which economic problems that may develop inone country, region or functional group of countries can be transmitted to others. The conduitfor the transfer of the problem is not in all cases the same. Referring to the East Asian crisis of1997/98, at least three distinct transmission mechanisms can be distinguished in the contagionprocess:• First, there was the group of countries in East Asia, with many similarities and fairlyintimate economic relationships, where individual countries were affected almostimmediately after the Thai baht collapsed in mid-1997, partly because of perceptionsand the herd-like reactions of international investors. In the case of this group ofcountries, contagion worked mainly through the withdrawal of short-term foreignfinancing to banking institutions, trade financing, and all forms of foreign loan facilities.
BIS Review   60/19992• Second, there was a further group of countries that were affected only gradually througha decline in the flows of portfolio investments from industrial to developing countries.Emerging market economies with fledgling capital markets were mainly affected withsome time lags by the change in the attitude of the managers of major institutionalinvestment funds who at some stage decided to convert high-yielding, high-risk assetsinto low-yielding, high-quality assets. South Africa is a good example of such a countrythat suffered in the wake of the East Asian crisis, mainly as a result of a large-scalewithdrawal by nonresidents of portfolio investments previously made in the country.• Third, another group of countries representing mainly exporters of primary products,metals and minerals were affected with an even longer time lag by depressed worldeconomic conditions created by the East Asian cum global financial market crisis of1997/98.Not all countries have therefore been affected in the same way by the global financial crisis ofthe past two years, and not all countries can therefore rely on the same protective measures toprevent the same disastrous effects in future.There are, nevertheless, many commonalties in the challenge for monetary policy, despite thedifferences in conduits followed in the transmission of contagion to the various countries.Whether a balance of payments deterioration takes place through an outflow of short-termfinance and the withdrawal of loan funds, or through the repatriation of previously investedportfolio funds, or through a decline in exports, the proximate monetary effects are more orless the same:• First, the overall supply and demand conditions in the market for foreign exchange willchange and a short supply in foreign currency may develop. Some pressure fordepreciation will therefore be exerted on the exchange rate.• Second, liquidity conditions in the domestic money and capital markets will tighten, andupward pressure will be exerted on interest rates and yields on financial assets.• Third, banking institutions will lose liquidity and their capacity to provide loans to theirdomestic clients will be reduced.• Fourth, inflationary pressures will emerge within the economy, particularly in arelatively open economy where import inputs play an important part in the overalleconomic process.• Fifth, if not reversed fairly quickly, these adverse developments in the financial marketswill disperse throughout the economy and will eventually also depress real economicactivity.It should be noted once again that, as happened last year in the case of South Africa, theadverse developments were transmitted into the South African economy as part of aninternational contagion process, without any special reason or obvious explanation for it in thedomestic environment. It is true that, like a real virus, the international transmission processseeks weaknesses in the world environment and exploits structural deficiencies in theeconomies of globalised markets. Weaker economies are therefore affected more severely inthe process, and unacceptable macroeconomic policies are punished with greater venom.
3BIS Review   60/1999The contagion effect and the South African economyIt is history now that South Africa was also struck by the global financial crisis of 1997/98when nonresident investors in May 1998 suddenly started to withdraw large sums of portfolioinvestments previously made in South African bonds, mainly government bonds of longermaturity. In the first four months of 1998, nonresidents increased their holdings of SouthAfrican bonds by R16 billion; in the subsequent eight months, from May to December 1998,they reduced their holdings of South African bonds by R26 billion. This sudden switch from alarge net inflow to an even larger net outflow of portfolio foreign investment in South Africaexposed the country to the East Asian financial crisis and triggered all the predictable adversedevelopments in the financial markets referred to above.The predicament for the South African macroeconomic policymakers in the situation was thatthe adverse developments took place at a very inconvenient time if account is taken ofprevailing conditions in the domestic economy in the first half of 1998. These adversefinancial developments indeed forced an early abortion of an economic recovery that was inits infancy during the first quarter of 1998. During the rest of last year, the economy lost itsmomentum and is only now beginning to show tentative signs of a resumed recovery.South Africa and other emerging market countries learned a lot from the experience of thepast two years. For those countries, such as South Africa, that are committed to continued andenhanced participation in the process of financial globalisation, there is no escape fromvolatile international capital flows. These countries, including South Africa, are now workingtogether in the multinational forums of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the WorldBank, the Bank for International Settlements and many groupings such as the Willard Groupand the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision to create a more stable global financialenvironment. For the time being, however, they have to accept greater volatility in thefinancial markets as a fait accompli.Challenges for monetary policyThe market economy provides its own disciplines and its own mechanism for adjustmentwhen disequilibrium develops in the system. The foregoing analysis of financial developmentsin countries afflicted by the turbulence in world financial markets last year provides a briefdescription of the market mechanism of self-adjustment. The outflows of capital forced adepreciation of the currency, higher interest rates and inflationary pressures in those countriesfrom where foreign investments were repatriated.The challenge for monetary policy is to accommodate these adjustments, however unpopularthey might be at the time, and even if they come in direct conflict with the contemporaryneeds of the domestic economy at that stage. Despite the depressed conditions in the SouthAfrican economy at the beginning of 1998, we had to accept a depreciation of the rand ofalmost 20% last year; we had to adjust to a sharp rise of about 7 full percentage points in thelevel of the cost of money; banking institutions were forced to reduce the rate of lending totheir clients, and the rate of inflation increased from 5% in April 1998 to 9.3% in October1998. Painful adjustments in real economic activity were unavoidable.Monetary policy had to flow with the flood. Reserve Bank intervention in the financialmarkets became necessary to smooth adjustments, prevent a crisis situation from developingin the foreign exchange market (still subject to many exchange controls) and facilitate the
BIS Review   60/19994adjustment process by partly redistributing the cost of adjustment between private and publicsector participants. Monetary policy, however, could not avoid, and should not have tried toprevent, the painful but essential market adjustment process.With hindsight, South Africa came out of the global financial crisis of 1997/98 relatively well,but not without some scars. In three areas, the South African economy showed its strength andresilience:• Unlike in many other countries, South Africa’s financial system managed to survive theturbulences of 1997/98 without any major failure.• South Africa became an exception to the emerging market world by not approaching theIMF for any special financial assistance. At this stage, South Africa has zero loansoutstanding by the IMF.• Financial stability returned to South Africa relatively quickly after the major disruptionsin the second and third quarters of 1998. The negative flow of portfolio investmentsturned positive again towards the end of last year; liquidity conditions in the bankingsector eased; interest rates declined and are almost back to levels that applied at thebeginning of last year; inflation peaked at 9.3% and is now gradually declining again;and the country’s foreign exchange reserves are on a rising path.In the heat of the situation, monetary policy, which in the case of South Africa had to carry aheavy burden in the adjustment process, was criticised a lot and was even blamed by armchaireconomists for causing the problems. With hindsight, the policy of letting the markets workwith only smoothing-out intervention operations may not have worked as badly as the criticsof the policy predicted.Exchange rate policyOne of the elements of the restabilisation programme used by the South African monetaryauthorities over the past 30 years again elicited a lot of criticism recently, and that is theReserve Bank’s so-called forward book. There is a lot of misunderstanding about this facility,perhaps because ‘forward books’ were used by many other central banks for completelydifferent purposes. In many cases, misuse of the forward book contributed to the eventualdownfall of financial markets.In the case of the Reserve Bank, a hedge facility is made available, mainly to South Africanresidents, to protect them against exchange rate changes over which they have no control.These hedge transactions may only be entered into in respect of ‘firm, ascertained anddocumented’ commitments to make allowable balance of payments transfers within a 12-month period. The Reserve Bank’s forward book is perhaps a misnomer, and should rather bereferred to as an ‘insurance policy’ available to South African residents with foreign exchangeexposures, either because they have to make payments in foreign currency or because theywill receive payments in foreign currency within the next 12 months.The Reserve Bank’s forward book the therefore at any time represents a duplication of part ofthe stream of balance of payments transactions that will take place over the next 12 months.Analysts often make the mistake of adding a net oversold position in the Reserve Bank’sforward book to their estimates of future balance of payments streams as an additional
5BIS Review   60/1999commitment of the country to make foreign payments. This is obviously wrong and must leadto a distorted assessment of the country’s overall foreign exchange position.By making use of this hedge facility, South African residents can transfer their exchange raterisk exposures to the Reserve Bank for account of the government (that is, the taxpayers). Theconcerns we have in the Reserve Bank and in the Treasury on the forward book are not linkedto the availability of foreign exchange for the country – that will be determined by the overallbalance of payments position. Our concerns are more about the transfer of the exchange raterisk from certain sectors of the private sector (importers, exporters, borrowers of foreignfunds) to taxpayers in general (the Budget). What we must ask ourselves is whether thistransfer of risk brings on a net basis a macroeconomic social advantage to the overallcommunity, or whether the final net cost in the form of losses on the forward book willexceed the overall social advantages of the insurance scheme.The decision to provide the hedge facility through the Reserve Bank dates back to the early1960s, when South Africa introduced exchange controls. These controls prevented privatesector users of foreign exchange from protecting themselves through the market mechanismfor possible exchange rate changes. As long as South Africa still has exchange controls, albeitsubstantially relaxed in the meantime, there is some justification for the continued provisionof a government-backed insurance policy for the protection of exchange rate risks.There are many disadvantages to the scheme, most important of which must be the distortedperception in world financial markets of the use of the Reserve Bank’s forward book. In acrisis situation, such as was experienced last year, there are also indisputable advantages in theprovision of a government-sponsored hedge facility for exchange rate changes. Theavailability of this facility last year, for example:• enabled South African importers and exporters and other borrowers of short-termforeign exchange funds, to continue to make use of these facilities (note: South Africadid not experience large outflows of short-term funds as many other countries did);• prevented the exchange rate of the rand from depreciating more, and interest rates fromrising to even much higher levels;• protected the private sector, including financial institutions, from huge losses onoutstanding foreign commitments (part of the explanation, perhaps, why our bankinginstitutions survived the crisis so much easier than their counterparts in many othercountries).There is, however, a price to be paid for this protection, and that is huge losses on the forwardbook that are now being carried by the Reserve Bank for account of the Treasury. Futurepremiums on the insurance policy will, hopefully, go some way towards the recovery of part ofthese losses. The cost of financial stabilisation in the case of South Africa has been concentratedin the Reserve Bank’s forward book. In the case of many of the other afflicted countries, itremained vested in the private sector but eventually also came to book in national budgets, that isafter private sector institutions collapsed under the burden of huge exchange rate losses. Is theforward book of the Reserve Bank/Treasury really such a bad thing after all? How can it bephased out from future stabilisation programmes, that is after exchange controls havedisappeared? We South Africans should approach this challenge in a more positive andconstructive way, and should not only concentrate on the obvious disadvantages of a scheme thatalso provides very valuable protection to private sector users of foreign currencies.
1BIS Review   59/1999Mr Tietmeyer considers the impact of the single European currency on economies intransitionText of the Annual Lecture of the Liberální Institute 1999, by Prof Hans Tietmeyer, Presidentof the Deutsche Bundesbank, in Prague on 25 May 1999.IIt is a great pleasure for me to be in Prague today. I am both delighted and honoured to be invited hereto accept the annual prize of the Liberální Institute for 1999 and to hold the annual lecture. I wouldlike to express my profound gratitude for being awarded this distinction.I nevertheless have to admit that I was a little surprised to receive this prize for “an exceptionalcontribution to the development of liberal thinking”.Certainly, I stand in the tradition of liberal thinking and owe a great deal to Friedrich August vonHayek, for example, who was born one hundred years ago this month, as well as to the other greatliberal thinkers.But my specific economic beliefs have been shaped more by the concept of the social marketeconomy, which was mainly elaborated in western Germany after the Second World War, and thentranslated - with considerable success - into practical policy under the leadership of Ludwig Erhard,under whom I had the honour of working for a time. However, subsequent policy in the periodfollowing Erhard moved away in several major respects from the original concept.Certainly, the German concept of the social market economy is rooted in basic core liberal ideas. Butthe ordo-liberalism of what is known as the Freiburg School, on which that concept is based, itselfgoes beyond classical liberal thinking. In both instances, emphasis is placed on the key role ofcompetition. However, the members of the Freiburg School surrounding Walter Eucken were alreadystressing in the late forties that free competition also needs rules.They called for an overall market economic system which safeguarded competition, in particular, on alasting basis - for example, by means of a fundamental prohibition of cartels and the smashing ofunjustified monopolies, because they believed that this was the only way in which competition couldactually perform its functions of safeguarding liberty and promoting economic prosperity.In addition to these tasks of the competitive system, the German concept of the social marketeconomy expressly incorporates elements of social compromise into the overall system.One of my neoliberal university teachers, Professor Alfred Müller-Armack, who was from the start aclose associate of Ludwig Erhard, once rather pointedly expressed this as follows:“It was a momentous error on the part of economic liberalism to regard distribution by the market asalready being intrinsically satisfactory in social and political terms, and thus to combine the questionof the appropriate technical form of exchange with the question of what is socially andgovernmentally desirable.”1For me, the market economy is more than just the appropriate technical form of exchange. It alreadyincludes major elements of the safeguarding of liberty and of social compromise. But it is theconscious objective of the social market economy expressly to combine market freedom with morefar-reaching elements of social compromise, too.                                                     1Müller-Armack, A.: Wirtschaftsordnung und Wirtschaftspolitik, Freiburg 1966, p. 106
BIS Review   59/19992In saying that, social measures should nevertheless be consistent with market conditions. They mustnot impair the forces of competition or the functional viability of production in a free market.To that extent, the concept of the social market economy that was elaborated in post-war Germany isdefinitely based on core liberal values such as individual freedom, private property, competition, andthe rule of law - indeed it relies on these values for its existence.But it also stands in the tradition of Christian social ethics, which recognises personal freedom andsocial responsibility, as well as subsidiarity and solidarity, as its core principles.However, indisputably the most important liberal thinker of this century, Friedrich August von Hayek,tended to take a sceptical view of efforts to create a comprehensive economic and social system.He believed - and I share this view - that one could ultimately never be quite certain of having foundthe best solution. Hence, the social system should rather develop as the product of a spontaneous,evolutionary competitive process.There is undoubtedly much validity in that. As I see it, the concept of the social market economy, too,must always remain an open system - open to new ideas and open to new preferences in society. Thatis precisely one of the practical problems which we are facing in Germany at present.Much of what has arisen over the past few decades must now be reviewed and altered in the light ofthe new conditions set by technology and the economy. The main yardstick for this must be therestoration of the German economy’s inherent momentum and a sustained improvement in economiccompetitiveness.Hayek likewise rightly emphasised that the high liberal regard for the market applied not tocompetition per se but to competition within a suitable framework. At that framework includes, aboveall, a suitable monetary framework.IIIt is therefore no coincidence that both the advocates of classical liberalism and the advocates of thesocial market economy agree in emphasising the crucial importance of stable money for a moderncompetitive economy.For Ludwig Erhard, the first German Economics Minister in the post-war years, who is also regardedas the architect of the German “economic miracle”, stable money was a sine qua non.As long ago as 1950, he wrote:“Experience and history alike teach us that sound and stable currencies can exist only under market-economy conditions and that any centrally planned economic system therefore leads to the destructionof the currency. Even though the currency is certainly not an end in itself, we know well enough frombitter experience that economic prosperity can only be achieved on the foundation of a soundcurrency.”2At that time, the countries of central and eastern Europe were still subject to an imposed system of acommunist centrally planned economy, in which the currency played only a subordinate role.As a matter of fact - despite all the unsuccessful efforts at reform, such as the “Prague Spring” of1968 - it was to be another four decades before the planned economic system finally collapsed here.                                                     2 Erhard, L.: Marktwirtschaft und gesunde Währung, in: Industriekurier, June 26, 1950, quoted fromErhard, L.: Gedanken aus fünf Jahrzehnten, p. 232 f.
3BIS Review   59/1999The results of this, - a lack of international competitiveness, - patterns of production which failed tomeet the needs of the population - and an erosion of the domestic and external value of theircurrencies, are something from which the countries of central and eastern Europe have, to this day,only partially been able to recover. Some, however, have already travelled a considerable distancetowards creating a modern market economy. Despite all the problems, your country is one of them.A modern economy based on the division of labour undoubtedly functions best on the basis ofindividual decisions and by means of “competition as a process of discovery”.Monetary incentives give the market players the necessary information on the changing conditions ofsupply and demand and on changing requirements. But prices, wages and interest rates are reallymeaningful only if the currency is stable. Only then can investment, output and labour be channelledinto the areas which society wants and which therefore promote prosperity.By contrast, inflation leads in the long term to serious disruptions of the economic process, resultingin misallocations and expensive avoidance strategies. It is mainly the economically weaker groups insociety which suffer from that - those who are unable to evade the creeping erosion of money. Thosegroups mainly include the recipients of wages, pensions and government transfer payments, as well asthose who hold savings accounts. The safeguarding of stable money is thus also, at the same time,enlightened social policy.Ludwig Erhard made the same point as follows:“The social market economy is unthinkable without a consistent policy of price stability. Only such apolicy also guarantees that individual groups in society do not enrich themselves at the expense ofothers.”3That is one of the major reasons why price stability has played such an important role in post-warwest German history. Maintaining the stability of the D-Mark was, and has always been, an aim ofGerman policy during the past 50 years.IIIIt is for good reason that enduring stability is now also the aim and yardstick for the new Europeancurrency, the euro.For that purpose, a regulatory framework that is binding in international law was laid down inthe1992 Maastricht Treaty.The mandate to maintain price stability has been assigned as its primary objective to the EuropeanSystem of Central Banks (ESCB), which is independent of political instructions.The ESCB has been equipped with all the powers and instruments needed to pursue an effectivemonetary policy. At the same time, the ESCB is prohibited from any monetary financing ofpublic-sector budgets.This means that a regulatory framework - precisely as called for by ordo-liberalism - has been put inplace, with which - in the light of all past monetary policy experience - it may indeed be possible tosafeguard stable money on a lasting basis.Happily, the euro was launched at that start of this year in a setting characterised by a high degree ofprice stability in all the participating countries. At all events, their inflation rates were - and remain -at an all-time low. The same applies to their long and short-term interest rates.                                                     3 L. Erhard: Wohlstand für alle, Düsseldorf, Vienna 1964, p.15
BIS Review   59/19994At the beginning of April, in fact, the Governing Council of the ECB - in line with it stability-policyorientation - made a further cut in official interest rates. The reason for this was that the monetarydata and the price outlook continue to suggest a high degree of price stability in the euro area.This means that monetary policy now has an interest-rate level at a record low, which - taking dueaccount of the low longer-term interest rates and the high degree of price stability - creates a soundfoundation for sustained economic growth in the euro area. Whether - and how quickly - new dynamiceconomic activity develops and new employment is created on that basis will mainly depend onwhether the other areas of national policy, and pay policy, provide adequate scope for this, and on thewill to undertake the necessary structural reforms.By safeguarding the stability of the euro, the ESCB is also taking account of the fact that there is nowgreater responsibility for the global monetary system.That is because an internally stable euro represents a major contribution to the stability of theinternational financial markets. - It gives certainty to investors for their planning and decision-making,- it encourages longer-term investment decisions - and it can thus reduce short-term volatility.Only if the euro remains stable on a lasting basis can it also perform its role as an anchor in the newERM II (European Exchange Mechanism II) and serve as a benchmark for the countries in transition.However, a euro with a fluctuating internal value and which lacks international confidence andcredibility could easily become a strain on the process of European integration. The enduring stabilityof the euro is therefore a matter of common interest for all the countries in Europe.IVBut, in the long term, price stability cannot be safeguarded by monetary policy alone. Monetarypolicy must, above all, be supported by other policy areas.In the European monetary union, however, these other policy areas are operating in what is, from thehistorical perspective, a new kind of environment.On the one hand, in the euro area we now have a single supranational monetary policy, with identicalconditions in all the participating countries. On the other hand, there are 11 - and, in a few years,probably even more - largely sovereign nation states - with differing regulatory and social systems, -and with differing legal and tax systems.In future, even more than before, each country participating in monetary union will have to be able tocushion differing movements in the business cycle and in growth and employment by the strength oftheir own efforts and will have to be able to make appropriate adjustments.More flexibility in the product and labour markets is essential for that, particularly as the eurointroduces more transparency, and therefore more competition, for all parties involved - not just inbusiness but also in politics.Solving persistent structural problems in the public-sector budgets and the social systems, or reducingstructural unemployment, are tasks where monetary policy cannot do the work of other policy areas.In this respect, fiscal policy bears a particular responsibility in the participating countries. Compliancewith the Stability and Growth Pact is important - and not just for safeguarding the enduring stabilityof the euro. Above all, it is in the participating countries’ own interests to exercise sustained fiscaldiscipline and to regain scope for action in the public-sector budgets.
5BIS Review   59/1999The other areas of policy - economic, social and pay policies - are also faced with a challenge,however. They have to adapt the underlying conditions to the new era of the euro.VThe countries in transition, too - especially those which are preparing for EU membership and, lateron, also for EMU membership - must adapt to the euro.Without doubt, they will also be able to benefit in the long term from a successful euro that stimulatesthe economy in the euro area. After all, trade with the EU countries is of paramount importance forthe countries of central and eastern Europe. The broader and more liquid euro financial market maycreate more favourable financing conditions for those countries.Above and beyond that, persistently favourable interest-rate trends in the euro area may also reducethe cost of servicing foreign debt.However, it is difficult to assess what will be the actual impact of the euro on individual countries.That depends, not least, on the extent to which the countries manage to adapt to the more intensecompetition and the increased competitive pressure within the euro area.In the same way as the euro makes greater demands on the countries directly involved, in terms ofeliminating their structural problems, the countries of central and eastern Europe must not slacken inadvancing the transformation of their economies.That applies all the more, the sooner and the more explicitly a more extensive integration with the EUis aimed for.Without doubt, this process of transformation is not easy. That is something we, too, have learnt ineastern Germany - despite all the assistance from western Germany.In many places the restructuring and rebuilding of a globally competitive economy has proved to bemore arduous than expected. And undoubtedly, even after ten years, many people still do not find it soeasy to adapt to the new conditions and changed demands.I dare say there is scarcely anyone in western Europe who can fully understand the feeling ofexistential uncertainty which that situation evokes for many people.For that reason, I have all the more profound respect for the willingness and resolve of those whocourageously face up to those challenges and actively participate in the process of change - here inPrague, in the Czech Republic as a whole, and also in the other countries.There is no theoretical model of optimum transformation. In future practice, too, it will not generallybe possible to avoid mistakes. After all, the transformation of an economic system is one of the mostdifficult economic topics there is, particularly as neither the business sector nor the policymakerswere able to prepare for the radical historic change ten years ago.There are nevertheless a number of insights and findings which should not be dismissed lightly. Forexample, in his work this year’s winner of the Nobel Prize for Economics, Armartya Sen, hasdemonstrated convincingly that social development and functioning markets are mutually dependentand supportive.As long ago as 1982, the US economist Mancur Olson, who died last year, referred in his book “TheRise and Decline of Nations” to the growth-curbing influence of long-entrenched vested interests.
BIS Review   59/19996The experience of ten years of efforts at transformation in central and eastern Europe are, not least,confirmation that the market economy is superior to any type of “Third Way”- for which there is noclear definition in any case, by the way.Anyone wishing to reap the benefits of the market economy, however, also has to accept its functionalprinciples and ensure that there are consistent rules to follow.In the monetary sphere, this also involves the question of whether a close pegging of the exchangerate to the euro can assist the process of transformation.Admittedly, that is not an easy question to answer. It is likely that each country will have to find itsown solution.There is no disputing the fact that a linkage to other currencies can bring more credibility for thefinancial markets and can make it easier to implement domestic reforms. But the borrowed credibilitythen also has to be paid back in the form of appropriate internal adjustments and actual domesticstability policy. If that does not happen, there may well be dangerous crises one day. There are manyexamples to illustrate that.The monetary crises of the past few years have generally sharpened awareness of the risks of a toorigid exchange-rate pegging and the resultant overburdening of domestic policy. For that reason, alsoany premature decision on the adoption of the euro could have severe repercussions on a country’scompetitiveness and trigger painful economic adjustments.After all, in addition to the fundamental alternative of flexible exchange rates, there are alsointermediate solutions such as basket pegs or even crawling pegs.Given global financial markets, international investors and the free movement of capital, exchangerates are nowadays - even more than before - “bridges” between the economies.These bridges may be fixed or movable. What is crucial, however, is that they are strong andsustainable.Pegging to another currency must therefore be given very careful consideration, and the economicsetting and internal adaptability must also be taken into consideration.VIIn his novel “The Unbearable Lightness of Being”, Milan Kundera, the well-known Czech writer, alsowrote about the burden of taking decisions. In other words, people can never know what they ought towant, because they only have one life and that life cannot be compared with earlier lives nor can it becorrected in later ones. Therefore, it is impossible to tell what is the right decision because there isnothing to compare it with.There are no comparisons for the euro, either. It is a unique project in Europe’s history. And muchdepends on its lasting success.A number of nation states, which in other respects are largely sovereign, are giving up their owncurrency in favour of the euro, and thus also relinquishing a major element of national sovereignty.Given global integration, this historic change in the economic policy has an impact going far beyondthe participating countries which affects neighbouring countries and trading partners. Everyone mustnow adapt their future decision-making on regulatory policy to the changed environment.
7BIS Review   59/1999Unlike Tomas, the character in Kundera’s novel, those bearing responsibility must not avoid makingthe necessary decisions. And I am also sceptical as to whether it will be enough - after taking thedecisions in favour of monetary union and the euro - to rely on the emergence of a “spontaneoussystem”, as called for by Hayek.Certainly, the risk of “constructivist error”, which Hayek warned against with the planned economy inmind, can never be dismissed out of hand. In other words, one should not overestimate what ispossible in each given case.Nevertheless, it is precisely in the area of regulatory policy that there are sufficient lessons to belearnt from the past. This means that there are also guidelines suggesting the approach to follow, afew of which I have tried to point out.It is my firm belief that it will be possible to master the new challenges posed by the euro- with humility as well as respect for the freedom of the individual and for the decisions ofthe individual,- on the basis of open markets and economic competition,- given a stable currency and a viable price system,- and with social compromise that is consistent with market conditions.I wish your country, and mine alike, every success in that. For all of us, the ongoing integration ofEurope is an abiding challenge.
1BIS Review   58/1999Mr Macfarlane gives an overview of the Australian economy in the 1990sTalk by the Governor of the Australian Reserve Bank, Mr I J Macfarlane, to the CLSAInvestors’ Forum in Hong Kong on 21 May 1999.It is a pleasure to be in Hong Kong talking to the CLSA Investors’ Forum. This conferencehas built up quite a reputation over the years and I am honoured to be invited to address suchan impressive group of investors. I will try my best to avoid presenting you with a “salespitch”, but that is easier said than done. If you think that I am concentrating too much on thefavourable side of the Australian economy, you can always redress the balance when it comesto question time.The Australian economy has attracted a fair bit of favourable attention lately because it hasperformed so well during the Asian economic and financial crises. Whilst this favourablepublicity is very gratifying for people like myself who have been around during the lean yearsas well as the good ones, I do not intend to spend much time today talking about recenteconomic events. This is because I think the good performance of the Australian economy isnot just a recent event, but something that has been unfolding over the past decade. In otherwords, the recognition may be recent, but the underlying story has been around for a lotlonger.We have now nearly completed the decade of the 1990s, with nine of the ten years alreadybehind us. Over this period of nine years, Australia has grown faster than other comparableOECD countries (Slide 1). Only Ireland and Norway, which taken together are only a littleover half the size of Australia, have done better, and there are special reasons in each case.This is the first decade to my knowledge where Australia has put in such a strong growthperformance relative to other OECD countries. While there have been other decades - such asthe 1950s and 1960s - where Australia grew faster in absolute terms, we did not exceedOECD average growth rates in those periods. The 1990s stands out as the first decade of thepost-war era where Australia’s growth would put it in the first quartile of performers.Table 1:Real GDP GrowthAverage annual rate (past nine years)Ireland6.8Norway3.5Australia3.2Netherlands2.8United States2.5Denmark2.5Germany2.2Spain2.2New Zealand2.1Canada1.9United Kingdom1.9Belgium1.9Japan1.8
BIS Review   58/19992France1.7Finland1.2Italy1.2Sweden1.1Switzerland0.8Source: OECDI should also add, of course, that this economic growth was achieved against a background ofvery low inflation. Over the same nine-year period, Australia had an average rate of inflationof 2.8 per cent per annum. This is slightly higher than the average of OECD countries butwithin the range of 2-3 per cent as specified in our inflation target. If we deleted the first twoyears (1990 and 1991) from our comparison, our average inflation rate would fall to about theOECD average. Of course, the thing that stands out when we look at inflation in the 1990s isnot the difference between the countries, but the uniformity in that they all have achieved verylow inflation rates.The question I want to address today is this - why has Australia done so much better relativeto other countries in the 1990s than it had in previous decades? I will attempt to answer thisquestion by starting with those aspects of the economy I know most about, namely macro-economic policy, and then moving on to other areas which are a little more speculative. Bydoing it in this order, I do not wish to imply that improvements in macro-economic policy arethe main explanation. They may be, but on the other hand, it is entirely possible that thebiggest improvements have come from the structural side.Macro-economic PoliciesMonetary policy has been put on a much sounder footing in the 1990s than in earlier decades.The inflation targeting regime has been a success in Australia, as it has in other countries thathave adopted this approach. The Government’s recognition of the independence of theReserve Bank has also been an important factor. Monetary policy has, in effect, becomedepoliticised, and decisions can now be based more on medium-term considerations than inearlier decades. Low inflation, and the fact that it has been maintained without forgoingeconomic growth, is the clearest testimony to this improvement.Fiscal policy is also in much better shape. The Budget is in surplus and projected to stay thereduring the period covered by the forward estimates. Perhaps the best medium-term measure ofa country’s fiscal position is the ratio of government debt to GDP. Instead of showing oneyear’s position, this measure summarises the effect of all previous years’ surpluses or deficits.As you can see by the next slide, Australia has the lowest ratio of any OECD country, and it isstill declining.Table 2: General Government DebtPer cent of GDP, 1998Italy119.4Belgium117.3

When the Asian crisis erupted, the exchange rate fell sothat at its low point in August last year it had fallen by a very significant amount. Unlike anumber of countries in the region, interest rates were not raised to defend the exchange rate. Iwould like to make two observations about the exchange rate:• The first is that under our floating exchange rate regime, the exchange rate is allowed tovary quite a lot with cyclical developments in the world economy. One of the reasonsthat we are comfortable with this degree of variability is that we know that it takes placearound a basically flat trend. This can be seen from Graph 1 which shows the Australiandollar against the US dollar. Graph 10.50.70.91.10.50.70.91.1Australian Dollar Exchange Rateagainst US DollarUS$US$199919971995199319911989Averagesince 1986198719851983
BIS Review   58/19994• My second point is that some people have tended to exaggerate the size of the fall in theAustralian dollar over 1997/98 by looking only at the Australian dollar/US dollar rate.At least half of the story over that period was US dollar strength rather than Australiandollar weakness. This is illustrated in Graph 2 which shows the Australian dollar intrade weighted terms, where the fall was much less pronounced. Again, I would notwant to place too much weight on this measure either, because it tends to be pushed upby the large depreciation in a few Asian currencies. The truth probably lies somewherebetween the two.Graph 2405060708090405060708090199919971995199319911985IndexIndexTrade-weighted indexAveragesince 1986Australian Dollar198919871983Recent events in Asia and elsewhere have highlighted how important financial stability is indetermining macro-economic outcomes. Although there are many factors which underliefinancial stability, one very important one is the prudential supervision of the banking system.In Australia, we learnt quite a lot about that in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and thatlearning experience has served us well over the past decade. The best single measure of thisaspect of financial stability is shown by the level of bad debts of the banking sector. As youcan see from Graph 3, these have fallen from their peak of 6 per cent in 1992 to less than 1 percent at present. This is about as low as they can realistically be expected to go.Graph 3012345601234561998199619941992Banks’ Impaired AssetsShare of total assets%%1990
5BIS Review   58/1999Structural PoliciesTurning to structural policies, I would like to start by showing a graph of productivity. Thisgraph shows the average increase in productivity in each of the last three economicexpansions, i.e. the 1970s, the 1980s and the 1990s. The measure of productivity used ismulti-factor productivity. This measure of productivity cannot be increased simply byshedding labour and replacing it with capital. It can only be increased by using both labourand capital more productively. As you can see from Graph 4, productivity growth has beenmuch faster in the 1990s - nearly 2 per cent per annum - than the rates of increase achieved inearlier expansions - about 1 per cent per annum. Whilst we cannot draw very specificconclusions from this improvement, it seems to me that it tells us that we must have beendoing something right. My guess is that the main things behind this improvement have beenthe various micro-economic reforms that have been aimed at increasing the competitivenessof the Australian economy. These include:• the substantial lowering of tariffs;• the deregulation of financial markets;• the introduction of a more stringent regime for competitive policy;• the privatisation of a lot of public utilities, banks, insurance companies; and• the introduction of a good deal more flexibility into wage bargaining.Graph 4Multi-factor Productivity1996/97 = 100; non-farm economy75808590951007580859095100199819941990198619821978IndexIndex1.0 % p.a.1.1 % p.a.1.9 % p.a.I think we made a lot more progress in these areas than we were ever given credit forinternationally. Each of these changes met with resistance, and in many cases compromiseswere made which would not please the purists. But taken together, along with the privatesector restructuring that was occurring at the same time, they have amounted to a major set ofreforms, and have made the Australian economy leaner, more flexible and more competitive.
BIS Review   58/19996Whilst these measures make the economy more efficient and competitive in the longer run,they of course have short-run costs. There is always an increase in uncertainty in an economywhere change is occurring, and there are often job losses involved, such as when a large over-staffed public utility is privatised. Of course, there are also enormous benefits which are oftenoverlooked, such as cheaper electricity, cars, telephone calls, airline flights, new exportindustries, etc. But because the complaints and resistance tend to receive more publicity thanthe successes, the impression is given that there is a lot of resistance.I think this is a misleading impression and that Australians are actually very adaptable people.Some historical examples of this adaptability include:• the ease with which Australia replaced the old British system of weights and measureswith the metric system (compared with the limited success the United States and UnitedKingdom have had in the same endeavour); and• the ready acceptance of such measures as random breath testing and compulsory seatbeltwearing to reduce the road toll. These were introduced in Australia many years ago and Ithink we were the first country to do so. These measures are still resisted in a number ofcountries.Another aspect of this adaptability is the speed with which Australians have taken up newtechnology, particularly computer-based communications technology. I have two graphs toillustrate this. The first on modem usage per head of population, and the second on electroniccommerce servers per head of population. Both measures, not surprisingly, show the UnitedStates, at the top of the table, but Australia is also very highly placed, coming third in modemusage and second in electronic commerce servers. In particular, it is notable that Australia,along with Canada, makes considerably greater use of these technologies than Europeancountries, for example.Graph 5Modem Usage, 1996GreeceItalyFranceJapanUnited KingdomGermanySwedenFinlandNetherlandsAustraliaCanadaUnited States051015202530%Source: MORI LtdPer cent of population

This is partly because I amtalking to a group of international investors, but it is mainly due to the fact that the numbersthemselves have been very good ones. But the outlook cannot be perfect; every economy hassome vulnerable points. Even the Americans, who have done so well over recent years, worryabout the level of the stock market and the possibility of incipient inflationary pressures. Whatare the Australian equivalents?We think that our expansion is going to slow down at some point because that is whatbusiness cycles do. We are still forecasting a slowdown even though our previous forecasts ofslowdowns have not eventuated. But I would hardly classify a mild slowing of the economy asbeing a major problem for us. The only way we could get into a major problem on this front isif there is an outright contraction in the world economy, and that does not seem to be a likelyoutcome.We do not think that our asset markets are over-heated, nor do we see inflationary pressures atpresent. Credit growth has been very strong, but it has not interacted with asset prices as it didin the 1980s. That could all change in the future, of course, but for the present this sort ofover-heating seems a long way off.The usual area that people point to as a danger point for Australia is the balance of payments.Naturally, our current account deficit has widened over the past two years. This is what youwould expect, given the buoyancy of the Australian economy and the contraction in so manyof our major export markets. This widening is thus more a reflection of the strength of theAustralian economy rather than its weakness.If you look back over the past 20 years, you will see that the Australian current account deficithas fluctuated between about 3½ per cent and 6½ per cent of GDP. On four occasions, it hasexceeded 6 per cent, and it seems likely that when the final figures come in for the Marchquarter of 1999, this will have happened for the fifth time. In the past, this has often rung
BIS Review   58/19998alarm bells, but it is not doing so on this occasion. Why is that so? I think there are basicallytwo reasons for this:Graph 7-8-6-4-20-8-6-4-20Current Account Balance*Per cent of GDP%%Balance on goodsand servicesCurrent account199919961993199019871984* Excludes RBA gold transactions; March 1999 estimate.1981• The first reason is that in the past the widening current account deficit was partly areflection of domestic imbalances such as a large Budget deficit or a higher rate ofinflation than the rest of the world. Neither of those are present on this occasion, and thewidening current account deficit can be fully explained by differing growth ratesbetween the Australian economy and its trading partners.• The second reason is that in the 1980s the widening current account deficit raiseddoubts about its sustainability. People thought that the debt to GDP ratio would keep onrising forever and that debt servicing could become an intolerable burden. Neither ofthese two eventualities occurred. As Graph 8 shows, the debt to GDP ratio stabilised ataround 40 per cent, which is high by world standards but not excessively so (forexample, New Zealand, Canada and Sweden all have higher rates). A similar story canbe told with regard to debt servicing (Graph 9). Its ratio as a percentage of exportsreached a peak of 20 per cent in the late 1980s, but is now less than half of that level.In Australia, we always have to keep a weather eye on the balance of payments, but it does notseem to represent quite the same constraint now that it did in the 1980s. Of course, it is notreally up to me to make these judgments. It is really up to the market. It does seem, however,that the market is much more prepared to give the Australian economy the benefit of the doubtthan it formerly was. To return to my earlier theme, I think that is because the totality ofpolicies in Australia are now judged much more favourably than they were in earlier years.Virtue does seem to have its own rewards.

1BIS Review   57/1999Mr Tietmeyer looks at the euro and the challenges aheadAddress by the President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, Prof Hans Tietmeyer, at the FrankfurtInternational Banking Evening, in Frankfurt on 20 May 1999.This year’s Frankfurt International Banking Evening is a special occasion for me. It’s the lastone I shall attend as President of the Bundesbank.And what is the consequence of that to me? Well, this time I must hold the lecture myself.Up to now, I have always had the pleasure of delivering the shorter supplementary address. Itseems that the Bundesbank President was regarded - at least by the organisers of this meeting- as particularly suitable for that purpose, being the local “Frankfurt” central banker.Seen in those terms, Wim, it is noteworthy that this evening that is your privilege. Since youappear to be performing the role of the “Frankfurt” central banker tonight.I hope, by the way, that you will occupy the position of a central banker in Frankfurt for a longtime to come. I shall be watching from the sidelines of my retirement, and shall be delighted ifyou remain “in the best of health” for a long time yet.If we combine “de facto monetary union” and “official monetary union”, we can look backtoday not only on almost six months of the euro, but actually on an entire year - even if theformal launch in January marked a particular watershed.At all events, already in 1998 some crucial decisions were taken affecting the credibility of thenew currency:• on balance, a number of convincing personnel decisions,• a credible monetary policy strategy,• effective and easily comprehensible policy instruments,and some major technical preparations, not to be underrated in terms of the credibility of theeuro.And, as a matter of fact, the interest rate decision taken last December was virtually the firstinterest rate measure adopted by the Governing Council of the ECB.Not least on account of this thorough preparatory work, the Eurosystem was happily able toassume full responsibility for monetary policy at a time of low inflation rates and favourablemedium-term prospects for stability, thus linking up pretty smoothly with the monetary policypursued by the national central banks.Indeed, the medium-term price outlook appeared so favourable to the Governing Council thatwe were actually able to lower central bank rates by a further 50 basis points in April.The technical side of the transition to the euro went off better on the whole than somefinancial market players had expected. At any rate, the media expressed surprise that no major
BIS Review   57/19992mishaps were to be reported. A steep rise in equity and foreign-exchange-market pricesseemed to bear that out.Some people actually believed that the longer-term potential of the euro could be exploited infull in the first few days. A few apparently thought that• global investors would quickly switch a large proportion of their assets into euros, and that• central banks would rapidly diversify their reserves in favour of the euro.In the meantime, a rather more cautious assessment - at least, as compared with the initialeuphoria - has won through in the markets, especially as regards the pace of any suchassumption by the euro of the role of a major investment and reserve currency.Exaggerated short-term expectations have thus inevitably been followed by a certaindisillusionment, and even disappointment, which has ultimately been reflected in the externalvalue. Political developments in the Balkans have likewise played (and are still playing) arole, at least in the short run.However, there is no reason at all to write off the enormous potential of the euro - which somepeople have seemingly been tending to do of late. The potential is there. Yet the marketsshould not be too short-term in their orientation.The international attractiveness of the euro will hinge crucially on the extent to which itmanages to gain investors’ long-term confidence, and to which it succeeds in accumulatingcredibility of its own.Of course, that will owe a great deal to the economic and political setting. That has likewisebeen the case in the past six months:• in the economic setting, it has transpired that - contrary to some fears expressed during thepast year - the US economy continues to be marked by an exceptionally buoyant growthprocess.In a number of euro countries, by contrast, the impression of a certain short-lived slackeningin growth has been confirmed. In the meantime, however, there are signs of activity starting topick up again soon.And as far as the political setting is concerned, a number of euro countries are still rather faraway from the medium-term objective of the Stability and Growth Pact, namely a balancedbudget, as is mentioned in the recent Monthly Bulletin of the European Central Bank.That forms a distinct contrast to the United States, which is in the enviable position of beingable to think about what it can do with its budget surpluses. In the process, it is reaping thefruits of an investment-friendly tax system and of vigorously pursued longer-term reforms.In a number of euro countries, on the other hand, investment-friendly tax systems and resolutereforms of the labour market and social security systems remain obligations that policymakers urgently need to fulfil.
3BIS Review   57/1999Now that the Governing Council of the ECB has done its bit to create an environment inwhich price stability is largely assured on the monetary side, and in which the considerablegrowth potential of the euro area can be exploited more effectively, such reforms areparticularly necessary.A preliminary outcome therefore reads as follows: alongside a number of expectations met,particularly in the area of stability prospects, there is also a certain degree of disappointmentover some decisions still outstanding on the part of policy makers and over the stance of theparties to pay settlements in some countries.Only after the requisite reforms have been implemented is the die cast as to whether and whenthe monetary union actually culminates in a successful and durable Community of Stabilitywith an inherent dynamism of its own which can live up both to the expectations of growthand employment prospects placed in it and to the idea of an internationally attractiveinvestment and reserve currency that can stand up to competition from the dollar.Making a lasting success of monetary union is and will remain the ongoing task of, ultimately,all policy areas - not just of the single monetary policy, but likewise of fiscal and economicpolicy, which have largely remained national responsibilities.Member states must recognisably discharge their obligations and make that perfectly clear forall to see. Only in that way can lasting credibility be achieved.And credibility is the name of the game.For that will convince the markets, too, of the long-term determination and long-term capacityof the Community to ensure stability.Nobody can simply lean back, or perhaps seek to instrumentalise the euro for one purpose oranother.The yardstick of monetary policy is, and will remain, lasting internal stability. In the long run,it is on such stability that the external attractiveness of the currency will depend. Happily, thatis generally agreed in the Governing Council of the ECB. And that objective is clearlyexpressed in the monetary policy strategy we are pursuing.True enough, monetary policy has not exactly become any easier since the turn of the year.How the transmission mechanisms of monetary policy operate over the euro area as a whole isnot yet known beyond dispute. This is why we do not know very precisely just what themonetary indicators are telling us. Above all, it is not yet manifest just how far the financialmarkets and consumers have changed their habits as a result of the introduction of the euro.Altogether, therefore, monetary policy in the euro area is in a position in which it can rely lessthan it used to in the Federal Republic of Germany on the old relationships, laws andexperience familiar from national monetary policy.That, of course, confronts it with new, serious challenges. Incidentally, the Governing Councilforesaw that development and formulated its monetary policy strategy accordingly.In the light of past experience - not least that of the Bundesbank - it assigned a special place inits analysis to the money stock.
BIS Review   57/19994At the same time, however, it is also trying to estimate inflation prospects and inflation risksdirect, on the basis of an analysis of a broad range of the factors determining prices.Needless to say, these factors include (besides foreseeable movements in costs) real economictrends. They likewise include the exchange rate. We cannot, and must not, ignore either theone or the other.But we are not thereby pursuing the objective of activist demand management. Nor are wepursuing an exchange rate target.Instead, we are analysing these factors very carefully, along with the money stock, andevaluating them in the light of their implications for the objective - that is the logicalconsequence of the strategy we have chosen.Of course, I know that this seems too “discretionary” to some people; it smacks too much of“muddling through” to them, and seems to require too much confidence in persons and toolittle in rules.And I know that some people would best like a strategy that could easily be expressed interms of mathematical formulae, so that monetary policy could be forecast by computer oractually computerised.Perhaps those mathematically oriented watchers will be glad to hear that there are somepeople in the Governing Council who are pretty good at maths - for instance you, Wim. At allevents - as I have recently read in the magazine “Focus” - the Dutch Ministry of Education hasrecently been advertising for young teachers, using a nice picture of you, Wim, in your youth.The caption below the photo reads:“Wie heeft Wim Duisenberg leren rekenen? - Mooi werk, juf.”And for all those who are not so conversant with Dutch as Wim and I, here is the Englishtranslation:“Who taught Wim Duisenberg maths? - Well done, teacher.”But, to be serious: a rule-bound approach entails too great a knowledge of the relationshipsinvolved for us to be able simply to hand over monetary policy to a computer.If need be, the computer would have to be reprogrammed if the structural relationships andlaws changed over time. And considering that every player in the markets anticipates thepotential fallibility of mechanistically applied rules, such rules are beset by credibilityproblems of their own from the outset.Rules are naturally important and useful for orientation purposes, but they must notdegenerate into automatic responses. They cannot be a substitute for the responsibility ofdecision-makers in a concrete situation - although they can provide an orientation for suchresponsibility.Incidentally, the Bundesbank has never applied its monetary targeting policy in mechanisticfashion, especially not during the nineties. And the experience it gained of that approach wasexcellent.
5BIS Review   57/1999The point of properly understood strategies - not wrongly understood automatic responses - isto provide longer-term orientation. They should certainly have a binding character - in thesense that the central bank is required to justify the extent to which actual decisions arecompatible with the strategy.That gives rise to transparency. The ship needs both a course and a helmsman. Both togetherresult in credibility.Has not the strategy of the Governing Council already contributed substantially to theaccumulation of credibility by the euro?I, at all events, do not rate the criticism voiced here and there about the last interest-ratedecision as being negative. After all, it gave rise to a need for the central bank to justify howfar the decision was compatible with monetary growth. That indicates to me that the strategyhas already attained a major objective. A debate on that point cannot but foster theaccumulation of credibility by the euro.A different matter is the, in my view, mistaken criticism that the decision constituted aparadigm change. That is unequivocally wrong. Certainly, there were many arguments to beweighed up. But the crucial yardstick was the long-term safeguarding of internal stability.That was and remains the main thing that monetary policy can contribute to the movement ofgrowth and stability.One of the fathers of the Reichsbank, the member of the Reichstag from Mainz, LudwigBamberger, rightly said (back in the last century) something about the proper relationshipbetween people and rules that is no less valid today:“There is one thing that neither an Act of Parliament nor a Statute - be they never so perfect -can accomplish: namely, the right application of the right regulations. Final perfection must beensured by individual human ability. A bad rule of the road can do much damage and a goodone can prevent many mishaps, but even with the best rule of the road a good coachman isindispensable.”In the same sense, responsibility for the euro is ultimately likewise borne by those who, whilenot monetary decision-makers, shape the political and economic setting of the euro by theiractions. For what Joseph Schumpeter once rightly said about the “Nature of money” stillapplies today:“(...) that a people’s monetary system reflects everything that that people wants, does, suffers,is (...) The state of its monetary system is a symptom of all its states.”It is not immaterial for a currency’s lasting ability to be stable• whether its public finances are in good shape, whether unemployment is consistentlybeing reduced,• whether the social systems in the euro countries are based on firm foundations, or• whether the conditions for a sustained, dynamic growth process in Euroland are meteverywhere.
BIS Review   57/19996According to Schumpeter, all these factors are also reflected in the state of a country’smonetary system, implying in this country today: in the state of the euro.Thus, all those responsible in the various policy areas must constantly ask themselves whethereverything is really in order in their own sphere of responsibility, or whether improvementsare not needed, indeed, badly needed - in the interests of the currency, and also in their owninterests.To that end, there is no need for “ex ante coordination”. On the contrary, that only blurs theresponsibility, and not infrequently endangers a medium-term-oriented anti-inflation policy.What is necessary, rather, is the discharge of one’s own responsibility.And since we have to deal with eleven countries in the monetary union, the euro reflects theability of all those countries to settle the outstanding question.Nobody should adopt a “free rider” position, in the hope that his own failure will becounterbalanced by the others. That would endanger the lasting stability of the euro andjeopardise its international attractiveness. That would be bound to sap its credibility. It wouldalso result in political tensions.This is why the euro is an “ongoing challenge and task” for all those who currently bearresponsibility in business and politics.And the euro will likewise be an “ongoing challenge and task” for those who will assume thatresponsibility in the future.
1BIS Review   56/1999Mr George offers an overview of the UK economySpeech by the Governor of the Bank of England, Mr E A J George, at a dinner hosted byBirmingham City 2000 in Birmingham, England, on 18 May 1999.Thank you, Mr Chairman. I am delighted to have been invited to speak at this BirminghamCity 2000 Dinner on the evening before the first ever meeting of the Court of Directors of theBank of England at one of our Regional Agencies. We have decided to hold Court meetingsperiodically outside London for two reasons. First, we want to emphasise that we are thecentral bank for the whole of the United Kingdom and that we are very sensitive to thatresponsibility. Secondly, we want to draw attention to the existence of our twelve existingregional agencies (and, as we announced on Monday, we will shortly be opening a furtheragency in Northern Ireland) and to the important role which they play in informing themonetary policy process in particular of real-world conditions on the ground in industry andcommerce in every part of the United Kingdom.Our Agent here in the West Midlands, John Beverly, is well known to many of you. He willbe moving on, to the South West, in the autumn to be replaced by another John! John Bartlettwho is at present a Deputy Chief Cashier. I am sure you will quickly get to know him just aswell – and I am equally sure that he will represent your various views on the businessconditions here in the region to the Monetary Policy Committee just as objectively andforcefully as John Beverly has done. I’d like to thank John publicly this evening for all hiswork, on both your and our behalf, over the past three years.I thought that in my opening remarks I would talk about the state of the economy as a whole,about the substantial imbalance between the domestic and the internationally – exposedsectors of the economy and the regional impact of that imbalance, and about the difficultdilemma which that poses for monetary policy. I will then happily try to answer yourquestions.Let me start then with the overall economy. The economy as a whole has grown consistentlyquarter by quarter now for over seven years – at an average annual rate of 3.2% which is wellabove its long-term trend rate. Consumer price inflation has averaged some 2.7% over thisperiod. Employment has risen to a record level; and the rate of unemployment has fallen to anear 30 year low. All of that is very encouraging.But since the summer of 1996 our effective exchange rate has appreciated by about 12% andwe have been affected by a global economic slowdown resulting largely from the financialcrisis that began in Asia two years ago. As a result our trade balance with the rest of the worldhas deteriorated – by some 1¼% of total GDP between 1997 and 1998; employment inmanufacturing has fallen by around 2% since the beginning of last year; and businessconfidence fell sharply to levels last seen in the depths of recession – until it stabilisedfollowing interest rate cuts in the autumn, albeit to levels which are almost twice as high asthose in the Eurozone.Now you could be forgiven if you thought that all that was me describing the UK economy toan audience in Birmingham, England. In fact it is what my counterpart, Alan Greenspan,might well have said if he were addressing his fellow Americans this evening in Birmingham,Alabama, on the ‘Goldilocks’ economy of the United States! I tease you in this way to make
BIS Review   56/19992the serious point that we are not alone in facing substantial imbalance within an economy thatis performing reasonably well in overall terms.In the case of the United Kingdom – and I’m being serious now – the facts are that theeconomy as a whole has grown consistently for 27 consecutive quarters – though I admit thatduring the last six months it was a ‘damned close run thing’ – at an average annual rate of2.9%, which is well above its long-term trend rate of around 2¼%. Consumer price inflation –on the Government’s target measure - has averaged some 2.8% over this period – or 2.2%measured in terms of the European Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices. Employment hasrisen to an all-time high; and the rate of unemployment – despite a very small rise over thepast couple of months – is still close to a 20 year low. And all of that, too, is veryencouraging.But, beginning in the autumn of 1996, our effective exchange rate suddenly appreciated, byalmost 25% a year or so later. To complete the parallel with the US data, our trade balancewith the rest of the world deteriorated – by 1¾% of GDP between 1997 and 1998 – businessconfidence fell back in the Autumn to levels last seen in 1990, and employment inmanufacturing has fallen by 3.3% since the beginning of 1998.Sterling’s appreciation – largely against the core European currencies – was difficult toexplain in terms of relative monetary conditions and appeared to have more to do with marketuncertainty about the prospects for the euro. But, whatever the cause, it seriously complicatedour task of monetary management by creating a suddenly much harsher business environmentfor many of the internationally exposed sectors of the economy – including parts of industry,but also much of agriculture and some of the services sectors. Domestic demand, on the otherhand, was growing strongly, so strongly in fact that we faced the danger of overheating in theeconomy as a whole despite the dampening effect of the appreciation on domestic costs andprices and despite the restraining effect on aggregate demand of the prospective worsening ofthe external trade balance. That was the background to the tightening of monetary policy fromthe middle of 1997 designed to moderate the pace of overall demand growth. We were ofcourse well aware of the pressures on the internationally exposed sectors, and we made fullallowance for the twin effects of the strong exchange rate on the price level and on aggregatedemand in making our projections of future inflation. But if we had held off from tighteningpolicy to moderate the pace of the overall expansion at that stage – in order to try to protectthe exposed sectors – the chances were that inflation would have accelerated, and that wewould then eventually have had to bring the economy as a whole to an abrupt standstill inorder to bring inflation back under control. That would not have helped anybody.By the late summer of last year these conflicting pressures in the economy appeared to bebeginning to ease. Domestic demand growth was indeed moderating – as it needed to do; andthe exaggerated strength of sterling’s exchange rate was diminishing as the approach of theintroduction of the euro appeared to generate increased confidence in the new currency.But we were all then hit by new shocks to the world economy. Russian default, followed bythe near collapse of a highly-geared US hedge fund, led to a flight of investment into only themost secure and highly liquid assets, threatening not only a new round of financial crises inthe emerging markets of Asia, Latin America and elsewhere, but also, for the first time, acredit crunch in major industrial economies, most notably in the US. Meanwhile the Japaneseeconomy remained independently mired in recession.
3BIS Review   56/1999By the time of the annual IMF meetings in Washington last October the public atmospherewas close to panic and the media noise was of impending world recession. Businessconfidence slumped pretty well everywhere, and so too in this country did consumerconfidence. We were faced in the Monetary Policy Committee with a situation in which theoverall economic slowdown which we had been seeking to engineer, in order to preventaccelerating inflation, threatened to become an unnecessary economic downturn likely toproduce an unwanted fall in the rate of inflation to significantly below the Government’s 2½%inflation target.At the Trades Union Congress in Blackpool last September I had emphasised that ourinflation objective was symmetrical, and promised that if overall demand threatened to fallsignificantly below the supply capacity of the economy, with the risk that we would fall shortof the inflation target, then we would be just as vigorous in reducing interest rates to stimulatedemand as we had been in raising them when the risks to inflation were on the upside. So, inthe new situation, the Monetary Policy Committee promptly reversed engines to pump updemand, cutting rates by 2¼% over the next few months to as low as they have been since1971. (This relatively aggressive response was not incidentally – as is sometimes suggested –a sudden conversion to a more activist philosophy, simply a reflection of the rapid decline inthe economic prospect which required a strong response.)Since last autumn the world financial and economic situation has certainly stabilised under theimpact of the continuing strength of domestic demand in the US economy and of thebeginnings of export-led recovery in a number of emerging markets, particularly in Asia. Andworld commodity prices, notably the price of oil, have shown signs of strengthening. Butglobal imbalance seems likely to persist for some time, with domestic demand growth stillrelatively sluggish in Japan, and in the Eurozone taken as a whole. This imbalance, in turn, isa significant influence on the international pattern of interest and exchange rates. It is hugelyimportant for the future strength of the world economy that as domestic demand growth in theUS moderates – as it almost certainly will, one way or another – domestic demand growth inthe other industrial countries accelerates to take up the slack.Here in the UK both business and consumer confidence have improved since the autumn andoverall output growth seems set to recover, on the back of accelerating domestic demandgrowth, to around its long term trend by about the middle of next year. But we, too, are havingto continue to cope with the imbalance between the domestic and internationally exposedsectors of the economy as a result of continuing relative demand weakness in some keyoverseas markets and of relative price effects resulting from a renewed rise in the exchangerate, which, despite the sharp reduction in interest rates, has strengthened against the eurosince the beginning of this year. These external factors will have a continuing dampeningimpact on our domestic inflation rate – which is likely to remain close either side of theinflation target. Overall then, although the prospect is for renewed growth with continuing lowinflation over the next couple of years, the tension between the different sectors of oureconomy has not for the time being disappeared.Against the background of that brief description of recent and prospective developments in theeconomy, let me now try to draw out what we can, and what we cannot, hope to achievethrough monetary policy.
BIS Review   56/19994Monetary policy operates on the demand side of the economy, and essentially what we canhope to do – and what we are aiming to do - is to keep overall demand broadly andcontinuously in line with the underlying supply-side capacity of the economy to meet thatdemand. How close we come – on average and over time – to meeting the 2½% inflationtarget is in effect simply a measure of our success in achieving macro-economic stability inthis wider sense.We cannot directly affect supply-side capacity – the underlying rate of growth that we canexpect to sustain. But, by operating symmetrically – as we have shown that we do – we canprovide an environment in which supply-side improvements (for example, more rapidproductivity growth which apparently explains the stronger performance of the US economyin the past few years, but which we have yet to see in this country on anything like the samescale) have the best chance of feeding through into faster sustained output growth. And, to theextent that we are successful in maintaining macro-economic stability, that can help toimprove our supply-side performance indirectly by lowering real long-term interest rates andencouraging better decision–making in the economy as a whole with less distortion fromunnecessary erratic movements, particularly in nominal values.But we can only hope to maintain macro-economic stability for the economy as a whole. Whatwe cannot hope to do is to provide an equally stable environment for every sector of theeconomy or for every business enterprise, nor therefore can we hope to maintain a stableenvironment for those regions of the country with heavy concentrations of particular sectors orbusinesses.We cannot hope, for example, nor should we seek, to obstruct structural change. Consumerdemands change over time, and so, too, do technologies and management and productiontechniques. Competition, to seek out such changes and to exploit them to meet social needsmore efficiently – however unwelcome it may be to establish producers – is a vital driver ofsupply-side improvement, increasing the potentially sustainable growth rate at the macro-economic level from which we all stand to benefit.Nor can we realistically hope to avoid all shorter-term fluctuations associated with thebusiness cycle, for example, or as a result simply of random shocks - though we can aim tomoderate their impact rather than exaggerate it as we have done at times in the past.Nor, finally, can we hope to insulate ourselves from shocks originating overseas. That doesnot mean that we do not understand the painful impact of the recent state of the worldeconomy or of the strong exchange rate. Nor does it mean that we simply ignore the plight ofthe adversely affected sectors. We are concerned – as you are – with the health of every sectorof the economy, we fully appreciate the interdependence of the different sectors, and we wellunderstand the part that greater real exchange rate stability can play in promoting morebalanced economic growth. But the harsh reality is that we could only seek to achieve aparticular exchange rate in order to protect the internationally exposed sectors at the risk ofdestabilising the economy as a whole, and there would – as we have recently seen – be noassurance even so that we would be successful in achieving and maintaining a particularexchange rate. We do, as I say, take full account of the impact of world demand and of theexchange rate on the likely path of inflation, and, to the extent that these influences areexerting a disinflationary effect, interest rates are lower than would otherwise be the case.That was the reality behind the statement made after our last MPC meeting that if the
5BIS Review   56/1999exchange rate does not decline from its present high level, as we assume that it will, at least inline with interest rate differentials, then, depending on other developments in the economy,there might need to be further easing of interest rates to keep inflation on track. I stand by thattoday.But let me be quite clear. This does not mean that we have any particular target for theexchange rate. Nor can it mean that we set interest rates simply by reference to thoseprevailing elsewhere. It is naïve to complain that our interest rates are twice those in Europewithout recognising that we are operating closer to capacity than is the case in the Eurozone asa whole – or that unemployment there is running at twice the rate in this country even if – andI agree – much of that difference is to be explained by structural, supply-side, rigidities ratherthan simply cyclical divergence.No-one, Mr Chairman, is more conscious of the limits to what we can hope to achieve throughmonetary policy than I am. But operating within those limits, we have been able to achievegreater macro-economic stability, reflected in the rate of inflation, than we have seen for ageneration. And that stability, together with the improved supply-side flexibility of theeconomy, has delivered a rate of unemployment in the economy as a whole that, despite therecent modest upturn, is still close to the lowest rate we have seen in almost 20 years. Andwhat is true for the UK as a whole is true for most of the individual regions of the economy.That includes the West Midlands, where, on a claimant count basis, unemployment at 4.8% isactually only marginally above the national average and still just about the lowest it has beensince 1980.Macro-economic stability cannot solve all our problems. But it can certainly help, and is infact the best contribution that monetary policy can make to the sustained growth of output,high levels of employment, and rising living standards. It helps particularly where there issupply-side flexibility and sectoral diversification. Birmingham, and the West Midlands moregenerally, have made – and are making – considerable strides in those directions, building onexisting strengths certainly but also developing new skills and new activities. BirminghamCity 2000 has, I know, played an important role in this forward-looking approach. Icongratulate you and encourage you to persist in your endeavours – in conjunction with theWest Midlands Regional Development Agency – well into the next millennium, despite yourapparently non–Y2K–compliant title.
1BIS Review   55/1999Mr Stals discusses the impact of the international financial crisis on the South AfricaneconomySpeech by the Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, Dr Chris Stals, at the 52ndCongress of the South African Nurserymen’s Association in Johannesburg on 17 May 1999.The process of financial globalisationThe financial markets of the world are progressively becoming more integrated in a processthat has become known as “financial globalisation”. National stock and bond exchanges andmoney and foreign exchange markets are being opened up for international participation. Fundmanagers located in the major financial centres of the world operate across borders in manycountries at the same time, dealing in securities, funds and foreign currencies.The process of financial globalisation, or the integration of world financial markets, was madepossible and is being driven mainly by the following four developments of the past twodecades:Firstly, the vast improvement of communication systems that has made it possible for marketsthroughout the world to be linked through satellite communication on a 24-hour basis and onreal-time with each other.Secondly, the astounding developments in electronic data processing techniques that make itpossible to store, analyse and transmit a massive amount of information on financial markets,financial assets and financial results of individual institutions to all destinations around theglobe.Thirdly, a growing amount of saving, surplus to the investment needs of the major developedand fully industrialised countries. This development enticed investment fund managers inthese countries to look for alternative places for investment. At the same time, there is a hugerecognised need for, and big shortages of, investment funds in the developing countries of theworld.Fourthly, there is a world-wide tendency towards economic liberalisation, particularly afterthe collapse of the communist systems of Eastern Europe, and of the self-sufficiency strategiesof countries in East Asia.The process of globalisation is not restricted to the financial markets. Trade in goods andservices is also being liberalised at the same time, and cross-border labour mobility isincreasing, albeit at a much slower pace. The world-wide web network provides not only forthe introduction of electronic financial transactions and of e-mail, e-funds, and e-money, butalso for e-trade or e-commerce. Globalisation is indeed a process of overall economicintegration, and not only the integration of financial markets. However, in the financialmarkets, the process of globalisation is, at this stage, a few steps ahead and perhaps muchmore advanced than in the markets for goods, services and labour.South Africa’s position in the globalisation process
BIS Review   55/19992Particularly since 1994, South Africa has adopted a clearly defined policy of activelyparticipating in the process of financial globalisation. Recognising the low level of saving (orhigh level of consumption) in this country, combined with the massive need of funds forfinancing of economic development, South Africa must obviously encourage the inflow offoreign investment capital into the country. The low level of domestic saving must besupplemented with funds from the excess saving of the industrial countries, otherwise it willnot be possible to create sufficient jobs for the relatively large number of new work-seekersthat come to the market on a regular basis. The alternative solution, that is to reduce totalconsumption in the country, will not be easy to accomplish.South Africa has therefore over the past five years implemented a number of economicpolicies to facilitate the process of its participation in globalisation. These efforts wereparticularly effective in the area of financial integration. The measures introduced included:• The gradual phasing out of exchange controls. At this stage, non-residents are completelyfree to bring funds into South Africa, and to take funds out of the country, for whateverpurpose. Residents may invest limited amounts of their own funds outside of the country.These limits now apply to private individuals, corporates and institutional investors.• The restructuring of the capital market to provide for more specialised trading in equities(shares), bonds and derivatives. The Johannesburg Stock Exchange changed its totalcharacter by providing for corporate ownership, foreign participation, screen trading,paper dematerialisation, and for an electronically controlled centralised securitiesdepository. The volume of transactions on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange increasedfrom R117 billion in 1996 to R319 billion in 1998. In the Bond Exchange, the volume oftransactions increased from R3 trillion in 1996 to R8.5 trillion in 1998. Non-residents nowaccount for about 20 per cent of all these transactions.• The upgrading of the national payment, clearing and settlement system to provide formuch faster settlement of claims between banking institutions, and a more efficienttransfer of funds between the clients of the banks. The upgraded system has also beenlinked to international payment and settlement systems (such as SWIFT) to provide foreasier cross-border or foreign currency payments.• Finally, the more active participation by South Africa in multinational economic co-operation arrangements, such as the International Monetary fund, the World Bank, theBank for International Settlements and the African Development Bank.All these actions paid off, and South Africa is at this stage already integrated to an importantextent in the global financial markets.The consequences of globalisation for South AfricaAs already mentioned, the main advantage for South Africa in financial globalisation lies inthe opportunity it affords of attracting more foreign investment funds into the country. Fromthis point of view, South Africa was relatively successful and attracted more than R200 billionin foreign investment funds over the five-year period from 1994 to 1998. This enabled thecountry to:
3BIS Review   55/1999• relax exchange controls and allow South African residents to invest about R130 billionoutside of the country;• finance an accumulated deficit on the current account of the balance of payments of aboutR40 billion; and• add about R30 billion to the country’s official foreign reserves.These statistical aggregates, however, disguise one important weakness in the capital inflowsinto South Africa, and that is the fact that about 80 per cent of the total foreign funds investedin South Africa came in the form of portfolio investments, that is investment in paper assets,and not in bricks and mortar. The disadvantage of this type of investment is that it can be veryvolatile. Funds can flow out of the country as easily as it flows into the country, and both in-and outflows can at times be very disrupting for the domestic economy.The global financial crisis of 1998South Africa, and many other countries of the world, experienced the adverse consequences ofsuch sudden capital outflows back to the industrial countries of its origin last year.  The(cid:20)(cid:28)(cid:28)(cid:27)SUREOHP(cid:3)IRU(cid:3)WKH(cid:3)JOREDOLVHG(cid:3)ILQDQFLDO(cid:3)PDUNHWV(cid:3)VWDUWHG(cid:3)LQ(cid:3)(DVW(cid:3)$VLD(cid:3)ZKHUH(cid:3)D(cid:3)QXPEHU(cid:3)RIcountries such as Japan, Korea, Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia,experienced problems with their domestic economies. These problems led to a decline in theconfidence of foreign investors in emerging markets which led to the large-scale withdrawalof investment funds from these countries back to the countries of origin, that is back to themajor industrial countries of the West. There was a flight from more risky investments in theemerging markets into higher quality but lower yielding financial assets of the industrialcountries, in this case, mainly of the United States of America.Although South Africa did not experience the same economic problems as the East Asiancountries, the contagion effect spilled over into the South African economy in May 1998when foreign fund managers were withdrawing portfolio investments from all the emergingmarkets of the world, and not only from the East Asian countries. South Africa, with its well-developed capital markets with large turnovers and unrestricted convertibility for non-residents, provided an easy source of liquidity for the fund managers who needed to transferfunds back to their countries of origin.During the first four months of 1998, non-residents increased their holdings of South Africanbonds by no less than R16 billion. From May up to December 1998, however, non-residentsreduced their holdings of South African bonds again by R26 billion. It was indeed difficult forthe South African economy to absorb the effect of this switch-around of R42 billion withinthe same calendar year of the in and outflows of non-resident portfolio investment capital.The large outflow of non-resident funds from May to December 1998 had the followingadverse consequences for the South African economy:• The yield on long-term government bonds increased from below 13 per cent in April 1998to over 20 per cent in September 1998.
BIS Review   55/19994• The outflow of capital forced a depreciation of the rand against foreign currencies of about20 per cent.• Liquidity was drained from the South African banking sector to such an extent that thebanks had to borrow large amounts from the Reserve Bank on a daily basis, and also hadto curtail their credit extension to the private sector.• The shortage of funds in the markets pushed up short-term interest rates, including theprime overdraft and mortgage lending rates of the banks by about 7 full percentage pointsto levels of about 25 per cent.• The rate of inflation in South Africa increased from 5 per cent in April 1998 to 9.3 percent in November last year.These adverse developments in the financial markets gradually depressed real economicactivity in the country. In both the third and fourth quarters of last year, South Africaaccordingly experienced declines in total economic activity (that is, experienced negativeeconomic growth rates). On a temporary basis, the financial globalisation and South Africa’sparticipation in the process, therefore had a negative or adverse effect on the South Africaneconomy.Recovery of global financial conditionsThe deterioration in the South African economy in the second half of last year found its originin the problems of the international financial markets. Nothing changed in the South Africandomestic situation in May 1998 to justify the sudden switch-around in the non-resident capitalinflows to outflows from the South African Bond Exchange.The adverse conditions in world financial markets continued into the fourth quarter of lastyear. It was only after some stabilisation was reintroduced in East Asia and after the collapseof the Russian economy was discounted in the financial markets, and after a credibleinternational financial rescue package was put together for Brazil, that markets calmed downagain. The South African financial markets were quick to follow. Since about November lastyear, the outflow of capital through the Bond Exchange came to an end; the exchange rate ofthe rand stabilised and even appreciated slightly; liquidity of the banking sector increasedagain; the yield on government bonds declined, and short-term interest rates declined. Most ofthe banking institutions now quote prime and mortgage lending rates at the level of 19 percent. The rate of inflation also peaked in November 1998 at 9.3 per cent and has sincedeclined to 7.9 per cent in March 1999.In line with the rest of the world, the improved conditions in the financial markets have notsucceeded in improving real economic activity up to this stage. There is a growing optimism,however, that a recovery in overall economic conditions will commence before the end of this\HDU(cid:15)(cid:3)DQG(cid:3)WKDW(cid:3)QH[W(cid:3)\HDU(cid:3)ZLOO(cid:15)(cid:3)RQ(cid:3)D(cid:3)ZRUOG(cid:16)ZLGH(cid:3)EDVLV(cid:15)(cid:3)EH(cid:3)D(cid:3)EHWWHU(cid:3)\HDU(cid:3)WKDQ(cid:3)(cid:20)(cid:28)(cid:28)(cid:28)(cid:3)(cid:3)WKDW(cid:3)LV(cid:15)provided that no further major shocks will occur in the global financial markets in the nearfuture.
1BIS Review   76/1999Mr Heikensten speaks on the euro and European economic policySpeech by Mr Lars Heikensten, First Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, the Swedish centralbank, at Merita-Nordbanken in Malmö, Sweden on 16 June 1999.The single European currency, introduced at the beginning of this year, marks a major change for theeconomic policies of countries in the euro area. The clearest example is, of course, the transition to asingle monetary policy. The proper functioning of the monetary union in the long term presupposesthat the new European Central Bank succeeds in making its policy and the euro understood andcredible. Important factors in this context are how the new central bank chooses to work, howmonetary policy is continuously formed and how it is communicated to the general public and tomarkets.However, a well-constructed monetary policy and a central bank that acts wisely are not sufficient toensure that the union functions in the longer run. If growth and employment in the euro area are to beas high as possible without jeopardising price stability, all the components of national economicpolicies will have to pull together. The fiscal, structural and labour market policies of the individualcountries influence both the conditions under which the new central bank is operating and, to thehighest degree, Europe’s future prosperity.A framework exists for this joint effort. Some common rules, for example the Stability and GrowthPact, have been constructed to ensure that national fiscal policies do not pose problems for the unionas a whole. There is also a continuous discussion of economic policy in various fora, of which theforemost are the Ecofin Council, made up of the ministers of finance and economy, and itssubordinate committee, the Economic and Financial Committee, which also includes representativesof the national central banks. The euro countries’ ministers of finance and economy also meet in whatis know as the Euro 11 Council.This framework has been finalised in principle but is being reassessed continuously in the light ofnew challenges. Economic activity in the euro area this spring has been weaker than anticipated andthis has been accompanied by growing disparities between national growth rates, budget balances andinflation. As a result, a number of central questions about how the monetary union functions havequickly come to the fore in the member states’ discussions.Although Sweden is not participating in the euro area, developments there will affect us. This is alarge currency area in our immediate vicinity with which we have widespread trading relationships.As a member of the European Union, moreover, we have to observe many of the established rules andguidelines; we also participate in the European discussion on the formation of economic policy.Against this background, my talk today concerns economic policy in Europe and the new conditionsthat accompany the euro.The single monetary policyBasic featuresThe European Central Bank (ECB) has been responsible since the beginning of this year for the singlemonetary policy in the euro area, with the primary objective of maintaining price stability. Thegeneral formulation of this objective has been defined more precisely by the ECB as being a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2 percent. In that this definition refers to the rate of increase, it means that deflation is excluded in practiceand the annual rate of change in the HICP should accordingly be between 0 and 2 per cent.The single monetary policy is based on assessments of a wide range of economic and financialindicators of inflationary pressure. A prominent position is likely to be accorded to the money supply.
BIS Review   76/19992As a reference value for annual monetary growth, the ECB has initially set a rate of 4½ per cent. Thecombined strategy — focusing on inflation but with a reference value for monetary growth — ismotivated by the great uncertainty as to how the aggregate euro economy will function initially. TheECB therefore wants to avoid having to stand on only one leg in its assessments. The ECB also statesthat the objective is to be fulfilled over the medium term and thereby underscores that the singlemonetary policy is not to parry every short-term shock. Deviations from the target may be acceptableduring a relatively short period.An analysis of the economic situation is published by the ECB in a monthly bulletin, which aims to‘explain to the public the monetary policy decisions taken by the Governing Council of the ECB’. Thebulletin will also consider fiscal policies, economic structures and labour market tendencies in theeuro area. But the ECB does not publish either forward-looking assessments and forecasts of inflationor the minutes of decision-making meetings and the positions of individual members. Pressconferences with the ECB Executive will be held, however, in connection with meetings of theGoverning Council. In addition, policy will be explained continuously by Executive Board membersin speeches and appearances before the European Parliament.Inflation assessmentThe ECB and the Riksbank both have price stability as the monetary policy objective but they havegiven this objective different operational definitions. The ECB’s formulation mirrors a different viewof monetary policy’s ability to fulfil an explicit target. Presumably it also reflects a different view ofthe margin a central bank shall have for tolerable deviations from the desired price stability. TheRiksbank has specifically targeted inflation, measured by the CPI, at a rate of 2 per cent, with adeclared tolerance interval of ±1 percentage point, thereby clearly identifying the preferred level ofinflation.It is still too early to say what the differences between the formulations will signify in reality, justbecause we do not yet know how the ECB will act in practice. The conduct of monetary policy inSweden is also being developed and specified in the light of new experiences. Moreover, the ECB’starget is formulated in such a way that the level of ambition can be varied. It is perfectly possible, forexample, to strive for inflation around 1 per cent when inflation in the rest of the world is low and toaccept a higher rate when the external situation is less favourable. Historically, inflation in Germanyover the past two decades has averaged 2 to 2.5 per cent and the rate in the European Union in the1990s has averaged 3.4 per cent, as against an average of 3.7 per cent in Sweden.A common feature of the two monetary policy strategies is their focus on the medium term. TheRiksbank has expressed this in such statements as that policy is to be assessed in an annualperspective and that its full impact occurs after twelve to twenty-four months. Moreover, theRiksbank has clarified how transitory effects on inflation are to be treated. A deviation from theinflation target on a single occasion will not lead either the Riksbank or the ECB to adjust interestrates abruptly in order to achieve a rapid return to the target. Adjustments are to be gradual, whichimplies smaller fluctuations in the interest rate and thereby also in production and employment.Communication and evaluationSo far the ECB has chosen not to publish the assessment of inflation on which the single monetarypolicy is founded. This has been justified by saying that it might cause more confusion than clarityabout the grounds for the policy. That has not been the Riksbank’s experience. Our view ofinflationary pressure in the Swedish economy is published on a quarterly basis. The clear presentationgives observers a chance of understanding and questioning our assessments. As new informationbecomes available, moreover, they are in a position to relate it to our earlier assessment andcontinuously form a fairly good picture of how interest rates are likely to move in the future.
3BIS Review   76/1999The publication of our inflation assessments has also facilitated decisions in recent years to raise orlower interest rates. In that the grounds for our actions are clearer, there is less risk of our beingaccused of heeding extraneous considerations, a worry that featured in the European discussion lastautumn. It is my belief, however, that the ECB will become more open about its economicassessments as it settles more comfortably into its forecasting process and inflation assessment.Another difference in transparency concerns access to discussions at the decision-making meetings.The ECB has chosen not to publish any minutes. An important argument for this policy - and one thatI find understandable but debatable – is that minutes disclosing how individual members voted mightoccasion a greater element of national considerations. The Riksbank has chosen to publish minutes ofExecutive Board meetings after an interval of 6–8 weeks; the minutes are to reflect the discussion andindicate how the members voted.The clearly independent status that has now been assigned to the Riksbank has much to do with thischoice. The minutes make it easier for policy evaluators to follow the formation of monetary policyand assess the actions of Board members. This is a democratic interest. Moreover, the fact that thevoting will be published probably increases the members’ motivation to form a personal opinionabout the difficult matters that have to be considered. I also believe that access to the minutes can helppeople to understand the choices that have to be made in the formulation of monetary policy anddemystify what the Riksbank is doing. It is arguments of this type that made my British colleagueMervyn King declare, with reference to the work of the Bank of England’s Monetary PolicyCommittee, that ‘Divided we stand, united we fall’.I want to emphasise that these matters are by no means simple. It seems to me that a clear analyticalframework, combined with a high degree of transparency, has provided a good foundation forSwedish monetary policy in recent years. But with an Executive Board consisting of six members,each of whom is in a position to voice an opinion on monetary policy, it is probable that from time totime the Riksbank will be criticised for being indistinct. There were signs of that last week when theminutes from April showed that I had not voted with the Board’s majority. But as observers andmarket players become more accustomed to how we operate, such differences of opinion are likely toattract less attention.Still, monetary policy signalling clearly cannot be arranged in quite the same way as before and in thisrespect we will presumably become more like the ECB and the Bundesbank, where individualstatements do not automatically constitute a collective signal from the central bank. For those who areinterested in following us and our assessments, however, we strive to provide a good foundation bypublishing — at intervals of approximately six weeks — either an Inflation Report or a lengthy pressnotice on the majority view of inflation prospects.Fiscal policies in the euro areaLet me now turn to the conduct of fiscal policy in the euro area. A judicious monetary policy is notsufficient to ensure that the monetary union functions properly. The single currency will make thenational economies more interconnected than before. The formation of fiscal policy in one countrywill affect the overall picture of economic prospects and thereby monetary policy. In the MaastrichtTreaty the countries accordingly agreed on certain common rules for economic policy and these havebeen fleshed out with additional legislation and political agreements.Besides fixed and binding undertakings for each country, there are regular common processes forproducing more general guidelines and standards for economic policy. The national convergence orstability programmes each member state presents to show how it intends to follow the guidelinessupplement the latter, which can be likened to a common budget statement for the euro area. It isenvisaged that the countries will exert peer pressure to bring about a good economic development in
BIS Review   76/19994each country and thereby fulfil the common objectives of sustainable growth with high employmentand stable prices.A central issue here is the formation of fiscal policy, for which there are binding rules. In theMaastricht Treaty the EU countries agreed that budget deficits and government debt relative to GDPare to be limited to 3 and 60 per cent, respectively. In summer 1997 the EU finance ministers agreedto clarify and tighten the existing fiscal policy goals so as to guarantee a sound development ofgovernment finances in the Union. The background to this was that the rules of the game once themonetary union had been established were less clear than the criteria for participation in the euro area.More specifically, there were worries that once they had joined the euro area, countries with a highdebt ratio would implement a less vigorous policy because their incentives for exercising restraintwould not be as clear. The pressure on these countries to consolidate their budgets might also ease iftheir interest rates fell on account of ‘borrowed’ credibility from the German economy.The Stability and Growth Pact was initiated by Germany. It means that all EU countries — and thusnon-euro countries such as Sweden — are bound by the rules for fiscal policy and its surveillanceafter the move to Stage Three. Each country is to strive for budgetary positions close to balance or insurplus in the medium term. This is intended to allow the automatic stabilisers free play while keepingthe government deficit inside the 3 per cent limit. In this way the Pact provides for some flexibility infiscal policy, which may be particularly important when there is no recourse to exchange rateadjustments.If the budget deficit exceeds the 3 per cent limit, sanctions can ultimately be imposed on the countryin question if the problems are not tackled. It is only in exceptional circumstances that this may notapply. A surveillance procedure has been established for monitoring developments; national stabilityprogrammes are to be presented at regular intervals, showing how the goals are to be fulfilled. Thisprocess is perhaps as important in practice as the threat of sanctions. The establishment of clear rulesand sanctions is intended to support the forces in each country that favour a disciplined fiscal policy.The sanctions do not apply to non-euro countries and they submit convergence programmes instead ofstability programmes.So what has happened so far? The assessment of convergence or stability programmes from all the EUcountries this spring shows a mixed picture. It is clear, however, that the ambitions of most countriesstill fall short of the requirements in the Stability and Growth Pact. This is certainly attributable inpart to the economic slowdown, with Italy as the clearest example. But it is also notable that theambitions for budget consolidation are now lower than before the move to Stage Three. The relativelygood growth during 1998 ought to have left room for budget consolidation in many countries but itwas not used and in certain countries the structural deficit has actually increased. The Ecofin Councilhas in fact criticised a number of countries, including Germany, France, Austria and the Netherlands,for the low level of ambitions in their stability programmes.In Sweden, the budget position looks comparatively healthy. Our fiscal policy is likewise lessrestrictive than before but the structural deficit has been turned into a surplus that is now growing andthe ambition is still to achieve a budget surplus of 2 per cent of GDP on average over the businesscycle.At the same time it should be underscored that some variation in the objective across countries seemsreasonable. The degree of fiscal readiness — and thus the requisite size of the surplus — depends ona number of factors. One is the cyclical sensitivity of government finances and another is the level ofgovernment debt. It is then reasonable that a country like Sweden has a larger public sector financialsurplus than a country where the automatic stabilisers and government debt are smaller. But it is alsoimportant to maintain the peer pressure that has been used to ensure that the member states observethe common rules. Arguing the case for adhering to these rules in a country’s internal debate isdifficult if other member states lower their ambitions.
5BIS Review   76/1999Policy interactionEconomic policy in the euro area is accordingly formed in the interaction of the single monetarypolicy and what are primarily national fiscal and structural policies. If this interaction is to functionproperly, much is required of the parties involved in the way of clarity and a dialogue.The available structure for coordinating economic policies in the European Union consists of anetwork of different bodies and reports, with the ultimate purpose of arriving at a shared picture of theframework for economic policy. The forms for cooperation are being developed all the time and anumber of new instruments have been introduced in recent years.A schedule has been established for the continuous exchange of information and views during theyear between the member states, the Commission and other Community bodies, including the ECB.Reports on compliance with the guidelines for fiscal policy, employment and structural policy aresubmitted by each country for discussion and examination by the other member states, theCommission and the ECB. The ministers in the individual countries finally adopt the programmes,which then form the basis for the next discussion of the general economic policy guidelines, whichare adopted each summer by the heads of state or of government. In between, each country is analysedby the Commission, which is required to give early warning if countries do not fulfil undertakingsthey have made in their national programmes.The idea behind this structure is the principle of subsidiarity, that is, matters to be decided jointly bythe member states are to be limited to those for which a decision at this level is absolutely necessary;everything else is a national concern.The ECB is to guarantee price stability. Monetary policy has to be formed in the light of fiscalpolicy’s expected development. Similarly, inflation has to be assessed in the light of the existing tradepolicies and the prevailing structures in labour markets, agriculture and so on. There is no question ofcoordinating policy in the sense of the ECB undertaking to act in a certain way if policy in other fieldsis adjusted or realigned — what euro jargon refers to as ex ante coordination. This naturallyaccentuates the need for clarity in monetary policy. It is reasonable that politicians in Europe areenabled to assess what an adjustment of fiscal policy, for example, would have for consequences forthe interest rate.Against this background I now want to consider three issues to do with European economic policythat in my opinion have been illustrated by developments in the past six months and should bediscussed in the European economic policy debate. All these issues concern the need to develop theinstitutional framework so that it covers coordination problems that may arise even though the rulesare being followed.Firstly, monetary policy is naturally not fully attuned to every euro country at present. Cyclicalactivity as well as other factors that affect inflation vary over the euro area and as I mentioned earlier,these differences have become somewhat larger. By itself, this need not be a major problem for themonetary union as a whole. The differences may reflect entirely natural deviations in productivitygrowth, for instance. In these cases the differences in inflation need not be all that important in thelonger run.The differences in inflation are more of a problem if they derive from differences in the developmentof demand. But even in this case it can be argued that they will mainly lead to problems for theparticular country where inflation is higher; rising costs ultimately result in downward adjustments ofproduction, employment and inflation. There may be uncertainty, however, about the smoothness ofsuch an adjustment and its consequences for the union as a whole. Even if the development ofinflation in one country may conceivably disturb the path for the union, that country cannot berequired to tighten its fiscal policy as long as it complies with the Stability and Growth Pact.
BIS Review   76/19996Secondly, at present there is thus no mechanism whereby a fiscal adjustment could be spread over theparticipating countries. This is also a problem because the implementation of the Pact indicates thatthere is a risk of this contributing to a procyclical budget policy. To date, the Pact’s surveillanceprocess has focused on countries with a budget deficit close to the limit. There is nothing remarkableabout that: this is where the problems are most apparent and the risk of failure — with problems forthe credibility of the Pact as a whole — is most acute. But there is also the risk of the Pact having aprocyclical effect. Countries that are close to the maximum deficit on account of weak activity areobliged to follow a restrictive line, while those with good activity and a surplus do not need to tightentheir policies in this way.This problem has arisen because the Pact was actually constructed so that it only functions properlywhen all the member states have established the necessary margins. That is still not the case. For theeuro area as a whole it would presumably be best in the present situation if the countries with highactivity were to tighten their policies even more. That might create room for a somewhat lowerinterest rate in this area in the coming years and thereby ease the situation for the consolidation ofgovernment finances in the countries with the greatest problems. At present, however, there are nomechanisms for bringing such a policy about.Thirdly, even if the fiscal position in all the countries in question were now in good order, the trade-off between fiscal and monetary policy raises issues for which there are still no ready-made solutions.Let us take the hypothetical case of a falling stock market in the United States that pulls the dollardown. The recent trend would then be reversed into an appreciation of the euro. That would be liableto check the recovery of manufacturing in the euro area. What should the EU finance ministers do?One possibility would be to go for an overall tightening of fiscal policy in order to pave the way forlower interest rates and a weaker euro. As things stand, however, it is not clear how this could bedone in practice. Once again we face the question of the restriction’s distribution among theparticipating countries.These three interrelated issues are all important. The solutions are hardly self-evident, partly becausethey involve the difficult balance between national concerns and matters that should be decided atunion level.ConclusionThe euro’s introduction in eleven countries in our part of the world is the biggest economic policychange in Europe for decades. New conditions have been created not only for households and firms inthe euro area and adjacent countries but also for economic policy.Sweden is by no means unaffected by this change, even though we are outside the euro area at thestart. Economic development in the euro area is crucial for Sweden’s economy. As a member of theEuropean Union, moreover, we are involved in many of the contexts where policy is formed. We havealso undertaken to conduct our policy in accordance with the rules that have been established for theUnion.Against this background it is important that we are engaged in the discussion of economic policy inEurope. My purpose today has been to highlight a number of issues of importance for the Europeandebate. I have tried to describe how the ECB works, the rules that have been built up for fiscal policyand so on. I have also said something about events in the past six months and discussed some of theproblems as I see them.One thing is certain: the euro’s introduction does not constitute the final step in the integration ofEurope. The single currency will raise new questions that will be answered by degrees through thecooperation between the countries of Europe. It is important that Sweden takes an active part in thatdebate.

1BIS Review   75/1999Mr Ferguson looks at public information and confidence as concerns posed by the Year 2000problemRemarks by Mr Roger W Ferguson Jr, a member of the Board of Governors of the US FederalReserve System and Chairman of the Joint Year 2000 Council, at the Second Global Y2K NationalCoordinators Conference held at the United Nations in New York on 22 June 1999.Public Information and Public Confidence In Year 2000Year 2000 is a unique problem that has various dimensions. It started as a technical problem, hasprogressed to being a senior management business issue and is now becoming a public confidenceconcern. In addition, it is unique in that we all know that the century date change will occur, but whatwill occur on that date is still open to differing perspectives. This is certainly a case in which thefuture is opaque. In this environment, there are, and will increasingly be, a variety of views andanalyses. Some of them will be fact-based and responsible; others will perhaps be less analytical andmore emotional.Why is Public Disclosure Important?Public disclosure of each business’s plans, and indeed of country plans, for remediation, testing andrenovation of systems, as well as general outlines for contingency plans are all critical. This isaxiomatic, but it might be helpful to explain why. In a business context, individual counterparties, i.e.suppliers, customers, creditors and others, are all working to develop business continuity plans. Fulland comprehensive information is essential to that process. The readiness of counterparties is beingevaluated based on available information. Inadequate details in a business environment can well leadto negative perceptions in the marketplace, which may have pronounced market and/or economicconsequences. Not surprisingly, in a number of instances, earlier pessimistic perceptions have beenpositively revised with greater disclosure of information.With respect to public confidence, Year 2000 seems to be an issue in which a better-informed publicis a more confidant and calm public. For example, in the United States the financial regulators haverecently completed a survey of public perceptions on this matter. The results show that those with thegreatest exposure to the Year 2000 issue were more likely to believe that any problems that emergewill be short-lived and subject to repair. More broadly in the context of public confidence, we knowthat the public will become aware of and develop a heightened interest in Year 2000 at differingtimes. In an environment in which public perceptions emerge slowly, I believe that it is important tomaintain a steady flow of accurate information to the public domain. As the public gradually awakensto this topic, a stream of balanced, factually-accurate and timely information can potentially counterthe more sensationalist coverage that is surely going to emerge. In addition, it is important forinformation on Year 2000 to be placed in the proper context and in perspective. Accurate informationfrom reputable sources will be important in providing that context. Finally, public relations expertsindicate that public perceptions will firm at some point, and be less subject to revision. Since we donot know when that point will occur, it is important for accurate information to be always available.The frequency and volume of the more balanced messages may have to increase as we all get closer tothe date change, but information sharing should not wait until the last moment.What Has Been Done?Fortunately, those who have spent time over the last several years considering the Year 2000 problemare aware of the need for information sharing to maintain business and public confidence. The JointYear 2000 Council in January 1999 issued a Bulletin to the world’s financial regulators entitled“Focus on Information Sharing”, which called for enhanced disclosure and information sharing and
BIS Review   75/19992summarized the work of a guidance paper on the same topic. Earlier this month we reinforced thismessage with a short advisory to financial regulators worldwide. The Global 2000 Co-ordinatingGroup, a committee of banks, securities firms, and insurance companies from throughout the world,provides a tool on their web site for financial institutions to disclose their Year 2000 plans and status.Global 2000 is a member of the Joint Council’s External Consultative Committee and we endorsetheir disclosure efforts. In the United States, the financial regulators have issued guidance to alldepository institutions that includes a requirement for them to have public awareness effortsunderway to inform their customers of the steps being taken to prepare for the century date change.Similarly, regulators have reminded financial institutions that they should understand the degree ofpreparedness of their major customers. Finally, our Securities and Exchange Commission hasmandated disclosure from all companies with public shareholders. It is important for us to understandthat the information sharing being called for does not require guarantees of complete preparedness.Rather, honest disclosure of plans and progress toward completion of those plans is what is called for.What Should You Do?Given what I have said, it is clear that we each have a role to play in this unfolding event. If yourepresent a national Year 2000 authority, as most do, your role is twofold. First, I believe that youshould encourage honest disclosure from government entities on their degree of preparedness and thegeneral outline of contingency plans that they are making. Also, regulators should use the weight ofregulatory control to encourage regulated entities to engage in voluntary self-disclosure. If yourepresent the media, you have a special obligation to engage in balanced and accurate reportage, notattempting to hide important facts, but not seeking the most sensational coverage. A broad synthesisthat captures facts, not drama, is probably most useful. Finally, all of us as members of the publichave an obligation to listen to the most responsible voices. We should recall that in times ofuncertainty, many views are expressed; only the most factually accurate deserve our attention.
1BIS Review  73/1999Mr Roth discusses demonitisation of gold in SwitzerlandSpeech by Mr Jean-Pierre Roth, Vice–Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank,at the 22nd Annual FT World Gold Conference in London on 14 June 1999.I would like to thank you for inviting me to participate in this gold conference and for the opportunityto give you some insight into the present state of the discussions on the demonetisation of gold inSwitzerland. I must admit that I have accepted your invitation with mixed feelings: why play the roleof trouble shooter here among people worried about the activity of central banks on the gold market?How to communicate the SNB’s intentions when its room for manoeuvre depends on a complicatedpolitical process? All this makes me dream of the comfortable situation of my colleagues in Belgiumand Holland who were able to implement their strategy without outside interference and couldcommunicate their sales as a fait accompli. I also look with envy at the Bank of England which will beable to proceed with sales shortly after the Treasury has made its intentions public.Let me address the following issues:• Firstly, I will show you the importance of gold in the National Bank’s monetary reserves;• Then I will outline why the revaluation of our gold holdings will necessarily lead to disposals:• In a third part, I will describe the different political stages down the road, the uncertaintiessurrounding this process, and the timetable we can expect to adhere to.• Finally, I will conclude by indicating in what spirit we plan to tackle the delicate task of disposingof an important part of our gold holdings.1. Switzerland’s gold reservesThe situation in Switzerland is completely transparent. With 2590 tonnes of gold in its reserves,Switzerland is one of the major holders of the yellow metal. Its holdings are comparable to those ofItaly, slightly lower than those of France, and significantly higher than those of Great Britain (seegraph 1).Graph 1Gold Reserves of the G10 Countriesas of December 1998 in Tonnes77147296715754105225933184370081372590CanadaSwedenBelgiumUnited KingdomJapanNetherlandsSwitzerlandItalyFranceGermanyUnited Statessource: IWFIn relative terms, however, Switzerland is the largest holder of gold reserves: per capita, per GDPunit, in proportion to imports or relative to currency in circulation (see graph 2).

Thefact that the question of possible gold sales by the SNB in the market has not arisen until recently isdue to several technical and psychological factors:• Gold is still valued at its last official price of 1971 in the SNB’s balance sheet, only one-third ofits market value is shown;• In the past, the SNB was required to back 40 per cent of the banknotes in circulation with gold,which did not leave any room for action;• The sale of gold requires a fundamental reform of the Swiss monetary system, which, because ofour direct democracy, is a long and complex process;• Finally, in the public’s mind, the Swiss franc and gold were so closely linked that the idea ofselling gold seemed to be rather unrealistic.Things started to move in February 1997. At that time, a first decision regarding demonetisation ofgold was taken by the Economic Committee of the National Council, one of our two houses of ourparliament. Two months later, in May 1997, the market became fully aware of the gold issue, whenthe President of the Confederation proposed to parliament to allocate a part of the revaluation gain ongold to fund a Swiss Foundation for Solidarity which would provide assistance to persons in need inSwitzerland and abroad. It was established from the outset that the initial contribution to thefoundation would be in the form of a 500 tonnes gold donation by the SNB. It thus became fully clear
3BIS Review   73/1999that Switzerland was going to demonetise gold and to progressively transform a part of its stock intointerest bearing assets.But why did we decide to fund the Foundation with gold and not with other assets? In order tounderstand this, one must take a closer look at the structure of the SNB’s balance sheet.2. From revaluation of the gold stock to gold sales2.1. The SNB’s balance sheetIf, in relative terms, Switzerland is leading among all industrialised countries as far as gold holdingsare concerned, the Swiss National Bank is also a special case with respect to the structure of itsbalance sheet. The bulk of the SNB’s assets consist of foreign exchange and gold. Swiss francdenominated assets constitute a mere 20% of the total. Compared to the balance sheets of theBundesbank prior to the introduction of the euro, the SNB’s balance sheet exhibits only a smallproportion of domestic assets (see graph 3).Graph 3 Assets Structure of the Bundesbank andthe Swiss National Bank 14%30%30%50%54%20%BUBASNBGoldForeign ClaimsDomestic ClaimsOther AssetsOn the liabilities side, the most striking feature are the bank’s own capital and reserves to which willbe added the revaluation gain on the gold stock (see graph 4).Graph 4Simplified Balance Sheet of SNB as of 31th December 1998 in Billion Dollarswith Gold at Market PriceAssetsLiabilitiesGold Holdings & Claims on Gold24Monetary Base29Claims in Foreign Currencies41Liabilities towards the Confederation11Claims in Swiss Francs17Gold Provision15Capital, Reserve & Provisions27Total82Total82Two arguments justify a transfer of gold reserves:
BIS Review   73/19994Firstly, the existence of considerable capital resources within the SNB balance sheet shows that weare endowed with more reserve assets than necessary from a monetary point of view. There is noexample of a central bank of a G10 country with such a proportion of capital and undistributed profitsin its balance sheet (see graph 5).Graph 5Estimate of G10 Central Banks’ Net Wealth in Proportion of GDP0%5%10%15%20%CanadaSwedenBelgiumUnited KingdomJapanNetherlandsSwitzerlandItalyFranceGermanyUnited StatesThe question therefore naturally arises whether the moment has not come to allocate a part of theBank’s own wealth to other purposes than monetary policy.Secondly, our balance sheet shows clearly that any transfer of the revaluation gain or part thereofcannot take place in Swiss francs or in foreign exchange. Our domestic assets are too low and atransfer of foreign reserves would have a negative impact on the Bank’s operations:• the SNB would be impeded in conducting its monetary operations (interventions, money marketoperations)• the bank’s profitability and liquidity would diminish drastically.Consequently, a transfer in gold of a part of the valuation gain is the obvious solution. A group ofexperts has been asked to make an estimate of the excess reserve of the bank.2.2 The proposalsThe group of experts has come to the conclusion that a capital corresponding to 1300 tonnes of goldcould be withdrawn from the SNB’s balance sheet to be used for other purposes than monetary policy.Of these 1300 tonnes, 500 tonnes are to be set aside for financing the Swiss Foundation for Solidaritypreviously announced.What to do with the remaining 800 tonnes?A first idea would consist in transferring the remaining excess reserves to a public investment fundhaving more extensive investment possibilities than the SNB. Currently, our asset management policyis basically limited to fixed-income investments. The fund’s regulations should provide for investmentin shares in order to achieve a higher long-term yield.But there is usually no limit to the imagination of politicians when money is to be distributed! Otherconcrete proposals exist. Some would like the excess gold reserves to be earmarked for specific goalssuch as improving the capitalisation of our social security schemes or for educational purposes.But regardless of the projects, the aim is always to transfer our excess reserves outside the SNB inorder to manage them more effectively than within the central bank and its relatively restrictiveframework. On our side, we are not keen about the idea of being in charge of managing a large reserve
5BIS Review   73/1999portfolio. We do not wish to wear two hats, one as central bank in charge of monetary policy and thatof asset manager for the country. We could run the risk of being caught in the crossfire of criticismwhen it comes to executing a mandate which is not a part of our basic responsibility.One way or another, the transfer of excess reserves by the SNB to one or several outside entities is notjust a simple accounting problem. Even though the National Bank is independent it does not have thelegal power to dispose of a part of its own resources for other purpose than monetary policy.Legislative and constitutional steps are necessary and they are currently under way. It is important tohave them in mind because they may hold a few surprises.3. The political process3.1 First stage: demonetisation of goldThe first stage, which aims at demonetising gold, is already well under way. The demonetisation ofgold required two legal adjustments:• a revision of the Swiss Constitution• a revision of the current Coinage Act.On 18 April 1999, the Swiss voters approved a total revision of the Constitution. In this revision, therequirement that a certain percentage of banknotes be backed by gold was removed. The abolition ofthis requirement constitutes the first step in the dismantling of the old order based on the goldstandard. The new Constitution will enter into effect on 1 January 2000.In the course of the next few months the Swiss Parliament will debate on the revision of the FederalCoinage Act, which will henceforth be known as the Federal Law on Currency and PaymentInstruments. The Coinage Act vested the right to fix the gold parity of the Swiss franc in the FederalCouncil. In future, no reference will be made to a gold parity. In this respect, too, one of the chiefcharacteristics of the gold standard will disappear.Parliament is expected to pass the new Federal Law on Currency and Payment Instruments before theend of this year. The Law will enter into force in spring 2000 unless, in the meantime, 50,000 citizenswould request for a referendum on the subject. If a referendum is to be held, it would probably takeplace in autumn 2000. To my mind, however, the probability that signatures will be collected for areferendum is slight indeed. I am fairly confident that the new law will enter into effect in spring 2000without delay.By the time the law on payment instruments will be in place in early 2000, gold will have beendemonetised. The SNB will be allowed to evaluate its gold holdings at their market price, and arevaluation surplus will appear on our balance sheet. Technically, the SNB will also be able to buy orsell gold on the market.3.2 Second stage: transfer of excess reservesThe recently revised Constitution and the new Federal Law on Currency and Payment Instruments arenot sufficient as a legal basis for allowing the National Bank to transfer excess reserves for externaluse. A special constitutional basis must be created for this purpose and then specific legislation willhave to allow the realisation of concrete projects (law on the Swiss Foundation for Solidarity, forexample).
BIS Review   73/19996Consequently, a second revision of the constitutional article concerning the SNB is now beingdrafted. Among other things, this new article provides for the possibility to transfer, outside the SNB,excess reserves deriving from the revaluation of the gold stock.Deliberations on this article have just begun in Parliament. If everything goes well, the article couldbe approved by both houses before this summer. Afterwards, in compliance with Swiss regulations,the draft of the new article of the Constitution will be submitted to the voters and the cantons forapproval. In Switzerland, every amendment to the Constitution must reach two majority votes: amajority of the citizens’ vote and a majority of the cantons approving the revision. This vote couldtake place in spring 2000, i.e. at the time the Federal Law on Currency and Payment Instrumentsenters into force. If the revision of the Constitution is approved, it will become effective immediately,which means that the SNB will be able to transfer its excess reserves as soon as the implementingbills will be ready.Should the revision of the Constitution fail to pass, the excess reserves would remain on the SNB’sbooks, and the Bank would then have the responsibility of managing them with the objective ofgenerating more profit for the government. Nothing fundamental would change as far as the possibleselling of gold is concerned : gold sales would remain on the agenda.With regard to the sale of gold, the essential element is thus that the Federal Law on Currency andPayment Instruments be passed. The amendment to the Constitution is only important to the extentthat it determines where the excess reserves will be administered.4. Perspectives for the SNB’s gold policyLadies and gentlemen, I have been talking to you for twenty minutes now without actually giving youan idea what the SNB will concretely do. Given the political uncertainty which still exists regardingthe process of demonetisation of gold and the transfer of excess reserves, you will understand that thisis neither the time nor the place to set out a sales programme.Listening to my presentation, you will no doubt have concluded that the process of demonetisation ofgold is well under way and that one can reasonably expect that the gold parity of the Swiss franc willbe abandoned in the spring of next year.Formally, the demonetisation of gold will give the SNB sufficient room for manoeuvre to becomeactive on the market. Gold transactions could thus be scheduled to begin next year when the legalframework will be in place. Greater uncertainty surrounds the question of the allocation of excessreserves, but this will have no impact on our sales intentions. As no precise date for the beginning ofour sales activities could be set, I will limit myself to indicate to you in what spirit we plan toapproach this question. In my opinion, two observations seem essential:First, as a major holder of gold, the Swiss National Bank has no interest in adopting a strategy whichwould push the price down. We know that 1300 tonnes of gold cannot be absorbed by the market in ashort period of time. We therefore are considering distributing the sales over a period of several years.Second, we intend to keep important gold holdings. Once the sales programme has come to an end,gold will continue to play an important role in our monetary reserves. The recent revision of theConstitution has led to the stipulation that we should maintain “sufficient” gold reserves. The fact thatthis precision was introduced at the initiative of our parliament indicates that the Swiss people wish tokeep ample gold reserves. Consequently, we do not envisage going beyond the announced plan ofselling 1300 tonnes.
1BIS Review   72/1999Mr Hartmann outlines the Bundesbank’s preparation for the Year 2000Address by Mr Wendelin Hartmann, a member of the Directorate of the Deutsche Bundesbank andChairman of the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems, at a press conference inFrankfurt/Main on 18 June 1999.Ladies and gentlemen,Last weekend, a global Year 2000 test of the major international payment and settlement systems tookplace. On the initiative of the New York Clearing House (NYCH) nearly 500 internationally operatingcredit institutions from 20 countries participated in the test, for which they had 34 systems inAmerica, Europe, Asia and Australia at their disposal (more detailed information is contained in theInternet excerpts from NYCH which you have before you).The Year 2000 readiness of payment systems is of paramount importance to the financial sector.Every day, these global financial routes handle payments amounting to more than US$ 1,500 billionfor foreign exchange dealings alone. Disruptions to these systems impede the orderly flow of financialcapital and may spread to all areas of the economy — both nationally and internationally — in theform of chain reactions. An orderly monetary policy and supply of money to the economy may thus becrucially impaired. For the central banks, it is therefore a major concern that payment systems are ableto operate properly in the Year 2000.For the organisation of this worldwide test, the Bundesbank assumed a coordinating role for theGerman banking industry with the New York Clearing House. It initially provided for an exchange ofinformation with the credit institutions taking part in the test. Nationally, the Bundesbank, as thesystem operator, made both of its major large-value payment systems for the German and Europeanmarket “Electronic Access Frankfurt” (EAF) and “Electronic Counter” (ELS) available for the test.For an EU-wide settlement, we also incorporated the national TARGET component into the test. Thetest took place under Year 2000 conditions. The simulation was of the exchange of payments for thefirst two business days following the changeover to the Year 2000, i.e. January 3 and 4, 2000.Thirty-six credit institutions from all areas of the German banking industry, the private, public andcooperative sectors, used this opportunity to demonstrate their Year 2000 readiness in a test underrealistic conditions. The institutions:• submitted payments to the Electronic Counter, settled payments through Electronic Access inFrankfurt,• executed payments via TARGET to Belgium, France, Italy and the United Kingdom and receivedpayments from those countries,• instructed their correspondents in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, France, Italy, Japan,Singapore, the United Kingdom and the United States to execute payments in those countries,• received payment instructions from those countries and• booked the incoming payments in their own accounts, or passed on the amounts as domesticfollow-up payments via EAF and ELS to the beneficiary credit institutions.The credit institutions participating in the test are to be regarded as the main players in payments inGermany. They cover around 70% of the market (in EAF, as much as 90%) in national large-valuepayments, and a good 80% of the market in cross-border payments.The Bundesbank’s payment systems worked without a hitch and the credit institutions participating inthe test in Germany reported that their tests had been conducted successfully.We are therefore able to say with a clear conscience that payments in Germany are ready for the Year2000.
BIS Review   72/19992At a teleconference involving the European system operators and the New York Clearing House, itwas likewise reported that the tests had been conducted successfully. The initiator of the test, the NewYork Clearing House, expressly pointed out that:• this test was a one-off event, and• is also non-repeatable because of its scale.Despite all the satisfaction about the fact that the tests went extremely well, it must still be noted thatthis worldwide test was a unique and very demanding feat which demanded considerableorganisational and technical input; this was also true of the German banking industry. This can beillustrated by a single and, on the whole, rather marginal figure: on each of the test daysapproximately 100 persons were on duty at the Bundesbank alone.In saying that, however, the Global Street Test was only one milestone — albeit a very important andhighly visible one — in our entire Year 2000 project. In the German banking industry alone, the testwas preceded by extensive internal testing on the part of all participants, by interbank interface andprocessing tests, and by a preliminary national test from May 31 to June 2, 1999. These confirmed thefunctional viability and robustness of the Bundesbank’s systems and their Year 2000-compliantconnection to customer systems. As far as German large-value payments are concerned, the GlobalStreet Test concludes an intensive and successful sequence of testing and does no more thandocument the fact that preparations were running smoothly and on schedule in “FinanzplatzGermany”, or Germany as a financial centre.Above and beyond the procedures in large-value payments, the Year 2000 problem naturally impingeson all the other business areas in which the central banks are involved. I would therefore like to usethis opportunity to give you a brief overview of our Year 2000 Project.The Bundesbank is giving top priority this year to the Year 2000 problem and took steps at an earlystage to ensure the Year 2000 compliance of its in-house procedures and systems. For example, forsome years now we have been paying attention to Year 2000 compliance not only in the design ofnew procedures but also when modifying and updating existing ones. The introduction of the euro onJanuary 1, 1999 gave us a special advantage. This meant that a large number of systems andapplications were completely redesigned and put into operation by that date, with due considerationnaturally being given to Year 2000 requirements. This gave us extra time to come to grips with themuch broader Year 2000 problem.In 1997, the Bundesbank established a working group for the Year 2000 problem. This working groupinitially drew up an inventory of all the affected systems and procedures. Any required adjustmentmeasures were initiated. We contacted the suppliers and manufacturers and awarded the necessaryconversion contracts.Current activities are geared to the deadline of July 1, 1999, which was set by the Bundesbank’smanagement for completing the Year 2000 readiness of all the affected systems. An earlier datewould not have been possible on account of the priority of carrying out conversion work for StageThree of European Monetary Union. Preparations are running on schedule.Preparation work in the European System of Central Banks is also running full steam ahead. Acommittee of senior representatives of the 15 national central banks and the European Central Bank,who are experts in computer technology, is coordinating the steps which are needed to make systemsand applications throughout the ESCB — especially those used for refinancing and payments in theEMU — ready for the Year 2000. At present, the systems and applications between the nationalcentral banks and the ECB are undergoing intensive testing in order to make certain that theprocessing of data is Year 2000 compliant.
3BIS Review   72/1999Despite all the efforts which are being undertaken at our level, it should not be forgotten that theability of the entire banking industry to function depends on an adequate supply of basic amenitiessuch as electricity, gas, water and telecommunications services. Hence, our preparations must not beconfined to testing our own systems and applications. Precautionary and supporting measures have tobe conceived and developed to prevent potential disruptions during the millennium date change.The Governing Council of the European Central Bank already decided early this year that theTARGET system will be closed on December 31, 1999. This measure will enhance the security of thechangeover to the Year 2000 since, as a result, all end-of-day and end-of-year work can be performedfor all systems on that date and the backing-up of data can be concluded before midnight. The closingof the TARGET system means that the Bundesbank’s counters will likewise be closed on December31, 1999.Even with the most careful preparation of the systems for the millennium date change, isolatedproblems cannot be ruled out. For that reason, particularly great importance will be attached to thesubject of “contingency planning” in the time that remains. At present, the details of theBundesbank’s contingency plans are being finalised, with priority being assigned to the central bank’score procedures. What is important, if it comes to it, is that the basic operations in the individualbusiness areas of the central bank are safeguarded by appropriate measures.The question — one that is raised very frequently in this connection — about an adequate supply ofcurrency was taken up and investigated by the Bundesbank at an early stage. This produced theconclusion that the German reserve holdings, relative to the currency in circulation, are completelyadequate — also by international standards. No bottlenecks are to be expected, even in the event of amuch higher, unforeseen demand for currency. Any refinancing facilities that are required will beavailable on an adequate scale in the form of the standing facility (formerly: lombard loan). Thepledged collateral needed for this purpose is entirely sufficient.Furthermore, intensive work is being undertaken on national and international communicationnetworks in order to guarantee the necessary exchange of information between the market players andthe central banks as well as the supervisory authorities during the first few days of the Year 2000. Onthis point, too, the European central banks can draw on a wealth of experience in connection with thechangeover to the euro, since a network of this kind was already employed successfully at the turn oflast year.The information channels that have already been set up will be used for the changeover from 1999 to2000. Owing to its position, the Bundesbank has already been involved for some considerable time ina wide variety of discussion forums dealing with the Year 2000 problem. Nationally, it maintainsclose contact with the German banking industry through the Year 2000 Forum of the Central CreditCommittee. It is also represented in the expert group at the Federal Ministry of Economics andTechnology.In addition, the Bundesbank is cooperating closely with the Federal Banking Supervisory Authorityon Y2K issues. In May 1998, for example, a questionnaire on the progress of conversion work wassent to a total of 3,851 institutions, computer centres and selected stockbrokers and subsequentlyanalysed by the Federal Banking Supervisory Office in cooperation with the Bundesbank. Above andbeyond that, the banking supervisory authorities maintain a permanent dialogue with the majorinternationally operating institutions. Because of their key position in payments, the Land CentralBanks and the computer centres of the savings bank sector as well as the central institutions andcomputer centres of the cooperative banking sector are included in these discussions.Internationally, the Bundesbank cooperates in the committees set up at the Bank for InternationalSettlements. I would like to highlight the Bundesbank’s participation in the Joint Year 2000 Council.With the backing of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the Committee on Payment and
BIS Review   72/19994Settlement Systems (CPSS), and the area of securities and insurance, represented by the InternationalOrganization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and the International Association of InsuranceSupervisors (IAIS), the aim of this body is to improve the exchange of information on Y2K issuesworldwide. Various publications have dealt with key topics, most recently the necessity ofmaintaining contingency plans. An active dialogue with the supervisory authorities takes place at theconferences initiated by the Joint Year 2000 Council. Preparations are under way for a further roundtable under the aegis of the Bank for International Settlements at the beginning of July. Thisdiscussion, to which 200 guests from around the world are expected, will focus on the subject ofcontingency planning.In summary, it can be said that, in the time which remains, the Bundesbank, being aware of its specialposition and duties, will take all the measures that are needed to ensure that its systems undergo asmooth transition from 1999 to 2000. In its national and international cooperation, the Bundesbank ismaking a major contribution to promoting preparatory work in the public and private sectors.The Federal Banking Supervisory Office has announced just recently that the present stage of Year2000 readiness achieved by the German credit institutions meets the expectations of the bankingsupervisory authorities and that, according to the information currently available, there is no reason tofear that the transition from 1999 to 2000 will cause any major disruptions in institutions’ operations.The Bundesbank sees this press conference as an appropriate opportunity to present the relevantinformation on its own Year 2000 preparations and the status of work in “Finanzplatz Germany”.Furthermore, the Bundesbank uses its regularly updated website (http://www.bundesbank.de; “Year2000” button) to report on the progress of the work being undertaken.
1BIS Review   71/1999The Bank of Japan’s June report on recent economic and financial developments(cid:20)Bank of Japan, Communication, 16 June 1999.The Bank’s View2Japan’s economy, at present, has stopped deteriorating, but clear signs of recovery have notbeen observed yet.With regard to final demand, business fixed investment has basically been on a downwardtrend, although there was a slight improvement in early 1999. Recovery in privateconsumption continues to be weak on the whole. Net exports (exports minus imports) aredecreasing slightly at present, due mainly to an increase in imports. Meanwhile, housinginvestment has been recovering. Public works seem to be increasing rapidly against thebackground of the surge in orders in early spring.Reflecting such developments in final demand and continued progress in inventoryadjustment, industrial production has stopped decreasing. The deterioration in corporate andconsumer sentiment seems to have ceased due to this economic situation and the effects ofmeasures taken to restore the stability of Japan’s financial system. However, corporate profitsremain weak, and employment and household income conditions are deteriorating as theunemployment rate remains historically high and wages continue to be below the previousyear’s level. In corporate finance, firms’ concern about the availability of funds in the futurehas subsided, but has not completely disappeared yet.As for the outlook, with the progress in inventory adjustment gradually paving the way for arecovery in production, the government’s economic measures and the monetary easing by theBank will continue to underpin the economy. Improvements in the financial environment,such as alleviation of concern about Japan’s financial system, are also expected to exertpositive effects on the economy gradually. Moreover, the recovery of overseas economies,especially of Asian economies, is likely to have a positive effect on domestic production.With respect to corporate activities, however, firms have started taking steps toward full-scalerestructuring, facing the continued decline in profits.  Although such corporate restructuring isexpected to improve productivity, it may, in the short run, reduce fixed investment and                                                     This report was written based on data and information available when the Bank of Japan Monetary PolicyMeeting was held on June 14, 1999.2 The Bank’s view on recent economic and financial developments, determined by the Policy Board at theMonetary Policy Meeting held on June 14 as the basis of monetary policy decisions.
BIS Review   71/19992discourage household expenditure through the resulting deterioration in employment andincome conditions. Under such circumstances, it is still difficult to expect an immediate self-sustained recovery in private demand. Overall economic developments require carefulmonitoring in consideration of the above points. It is also important to promote structuralreform in order to assure the economy’s sustained growth in the medium term.With regard to prices, import prices continue to rise due to the bottoming out of internationalcommodity prices such as crude oil prices. The pace of decline in domestic wholesale prices isslowing due to a rise in prices of some products closely related to international commodities,such as those of petroleum products. On the other hand, corporate service prices continue todecline. Consumer prices remain weak. In relation to price developments in the future, there isa possibility that prices overall, which have been on a downtrend, will temporarily level offreflecting the rise in import prices. However, distinct narrowing in the output gap is unlikelyfor the time being even though the economy has stopped deteriorating, and wages continue todecline.  Thus, downward pressure on prices is expected to remain.In the financial market, the overnight call rate has stayed at nearly zero, and many financialinstitutions have become confident about the availability of liquidity. Interest rates on terminstruments have declined further, reflecting the market’s view that monetary easing willcontinue for some time. The Japan premium has almost disappeared. Furthermore, the yieldspread between government bonds and private bonds––bank debentures and corporate bonds––has narrowed.Yields on long-term government bonds have risen since late May to the current level ofaround 1.6-1.7 percent. Stock prices, which had generally been in the range of 16,000-17,000yen, have recently risen and exceeded 17,000 yen.The amount outstanding of funds in the call money market has continued to decrease. To date,this has not led to any difficulty in funds settlement, but close attention should be paid tofuture market developments.With regard to corporate finance, private banks have basically retained their cautious lendingattitude. However, constraint that had been caused by severe fund-raising conditions andinsufficient capital base has eased considerably. Under these circumstances, major banks havegradually become more active than before in extending loans, especially for projects involvingrelatively small credit risks.
3BIS Review   71/1999However, credit demand for economic activities such as business fixed investment remainsweak. In addition, firms’ moves to increase their on-hand liquidity are apparently settlingdown. As a result, credit demand in the private sector has weakened further.Money stock (M2+CDs) has recently been showing a slightly higher year-to-year growth rate,mainly because firms’ curtailment of on-hand liquidity has been less significant than that ofthe same period in the previous year.In these financial environments, credit conditions, which had tightened previously, have easedsomewhat.The following continue to warrant careful monitoring: how actively investors will take risks;how far private banks will ease their lending stance; and how these changes will affect firms’propensity to invest.
1BIS Review   70/1999Mr Remsperger evaluates the role of monetary policy in a macro policy mixA paper presented by Prof Hermann Remsperger, member of the Directorate of the DeutscheBundesbank, at the 27th Economics Conference of the Austrian National Bank in Vienna, Austria, on11 June 1999.Broadly defined topics have both advantages and drawbacks. On the one hand, they mean that thespeaker has greater room for manoeuvre. On the other hand, he is then spoilt for choice between thedifferent aspects of his topic. In order to minimise the complexity of my topic, I should like to focuson the policy mix in the euro area. In addition, the main thrust of my remarks is to be directed towardsdiscussion of the role of monetary policy.In the euro area, monetary policy is centralised, but the other fields of economic policy are not. Theyremain national responsibilities. Hence the topic “The policy mix in European monetary union” hastwo fundamental dimensions. In the first dimension, attention is focused on one policy area in each ofthe EMU member states. In the second dimension, attention is concentrated on the mutualrelationships of the individual policy areas, i.e. on the “assignment of responsibilities”. The twodimensions are frequently combined under the heading of “coordination”. Then, however, adistinction should be drawn between coordination across countries for any given policy area andcoordination across policies.I have no wish to bore you with a flood of definitions. Even so, I think it makes sense to distinguishbetween explicit and implicit coordination.1 Any form of commitment to undertake joint decisions byseparate actors should be called explicit coordination. If this coordination moves in the direction of asingle policy decided by a single institution, coordination becomes relatively strong. But there arealso less ambitious forms of explicit coordination. One form of coordination consists in the setting ofjoint rules by which the decision-making bodies have to abide. A rather looser form of coordinationoccurs when the decision-makers exchange information in a kind of dialogue. Such a dialogue can,after all, also result in “coordinated” decisions.“Implicit coordination” relates to the assignment of the individual policy areas. If the objectives andinstruments are each clearly assigned to the individual policy areas, the overall outcome of the policymix is implicitly coordinated as well.My proposition is that, under the terms of the Treaty of Maastricht, the policy mix in Europeanmonetary union amounts at bottom to the model of implicit coordination, and thus to a division oflabour in the field of economic policy. This gives rise to a number of questions of principle. I shouldlike to address two of them in more detail today, namely, first: is such implicit coordination, andespecially the monetary policy assignment, justified? And second, does implicit coordination atEuropean level necessitate a cross-border coordination of fiscal and wage policy?The role of monetary policyLet me begin with the assignment for monetary policy. The Treaty of Maastricht sets a clear objectivefor the European System of Central Banks (ESCB): “the primary objective of the ESCB shall be tomaintain price stability” (Article 105.1). As part of its “stability-oriented monetary policy strategy”,the Eurosystem has defined price stability as a “rise in the Harmonised Consumer Price Index (HCPI)of less than 2%”. In this context “price stability must be maintained over the medium term”.2 At thesame time, the Maastricht Treaty provides that monetary policy “shall support the general economicpolicies in the Community” as far as is possible “without prejudice to the objective of price stability”.                                                     1         See Artis and Winkler (1998).2 Europäische Zentralbank (1999, p. 51).
BIS Review   70/19992Alongside the specification of the objective of price stability, the formulation and announcement ofthe stability-oriented monetary policy strategy of the Eurosystem constitute a further key element ofimplicit coordination. In strategic terms, though not in tactical terms, monetary policy is calculable.The other economic policy makers know that the ECB’s policy is geared to two pillars: in the firstplace, to the reference value for the money supply and, secondly, to the broadly based assessment ofthe prospects for future price developments. The second pillar takes due account not only of themoney stock but also of other indicators. In this context, I would like to emphasise that the euroexchange rate is one of the indicators for the inflation outlook of the ECB.The inclusion of the strategic response function of the central bank may contribute to a stance offiscal and wage policy that is consistent with stability. Implicit coordination is bolstered by anintensive exchange of information between the ECB, the European Council and the EuropeanCommission (Article 109b of the Treaty).3 Moreover, the ECB is required to draw up an AnnualReport every year and to present and explain it to different European bodies. In addition, there arenumerous other channels through which information can be disseminated by the Eurosystem, not leastthe press conferences held by the ECB President. Altogether, the exchange of information not onlyensures that the actors in other economic policy areas can assess monetary policy more effectively,but the Eurosystem likewise obtains information on planned activities in other policy areas.The assignment for European monetary policy has repeatedly been criticised in the past. However, thecritics have not all adopted the same position. Whereas some critics have objected that Europeanmonetary policy is acting too much in the tradition of the allegedly overly stability-orientedBundesbank, others have deplored a supposedly too pronounced orientation towards short-termbusiness activity. Only a short time after the launch of monetary union, there was talk of a “paradigmchange” compared with the earlier Bundesbank policies.I would like to address the critics calling for a stronger orientation of monetary policy towardsbusiness activity. Three lines of argument are discernible here:A first group of advocates of a monetary policy geared to business activity regards the risks to theprevailing price stability as being negligible. That group would now like to make monetary policyresponsible for fostering growth and employment as well.A second group of critics is arguing on the basis of economic shocks. Monetary policy should respondto demand shocks. They believe that the objective of price stability should be met by the central bankonly in the medium or long term.4 The currently discernible weakness of economic activity in the euroarea serves the advocates of this approach as evidence of the existence of such a demand shock. Intheir view, it makes an expansionary monetary policy response imperative.A third group, finally, prefers quite a different assignment for monetary policy. While price stabilityshould be reached primarily by means of a productivity-oriented wage policy, monetary policy shouldactively encourage growth and employment. Hence this approach reflects the strongest form oforientation towards economic activity.5 Unlike the first two approaches mentioned, it postulates not somuch a temporary as a permanent responsibility of monetary policy for business-cycle policy.                                                     3 Article 105.4 of the Maastricht Treaty explicitly provides for a right of the ECB to be consulted on all actswithin its field of competence.4 By stressing the long-term orientation of the objective, Fischer (1996, pp. 28 and 29), for instance, seesscope for pursuing a short-term, anticyclical monetary policy: “Long-run price stability should be theprimary goal of the central bank ...” And “... emphasising the long-run ... allows ... a little leeway for short-term countercyclical policy.” Bofinger (1999, p. 7 ff.) likewise emphasises the active role of monetarypolicy in the event of demand shocks.5 The approach is based mainly on work by Flassbeck (see, for instance, Flassbeck (1998, p. 278 ff.);Flassbeck et al. (1992, p. 222 ff.); and Flassbeck and Spiecker (1998, p. 52 ff.)).
3BIS Review   70/1999To evaluate these alternative assignments for monetary policy, one might initially try to devise awelfare-theory approach. The best assignment would distinguish itself by maximising social welfare.However, since such an abstract concept cannot help very much in the practical debate, one might ask,instead, to what extent monetary policy makers are actually able to perform the role to which theyhave been assigned. At the same time, it is essential for monetary policy makers to have an incentivefor playing their role as envisaged (the criterion of incentive compatibility). Thus, it is a question bothof the “ability” and of the “volition” of those responsible for monetary policy decisions.The decision-makers are being confronted in European monetary policy with two problem complexes.Besides the problems which beset monetary policy quite generally, there are, in addition, someproblems which are due specifically to European monetary union. The advent of a completely newmonetary regime necessarily increases insecurity. Furthermore, the monetary policy makers areobliged to operate in a monetary area which is very far from homogeneous.I am convinced that it would overburden monetary policy if responsibility for business-cycle policyand employment policy were assigned to it as well. It is, for instance, to be doubted whether monetarypolicy is able lastingly to raise employment. Not only monetarists refer in this context to the “naturalrate of unemployment”, i.e. the unemployment rate that reflects the structural characteristics of thegoods and labour markets.6 In the long run, unemployment tends towards that rate. It cannot bereduced durably by “flashes in the pan” kindled by monetary policy. Besides, there would then be arisk of accelerating inflation rates.It is of course difficult to quantify the “natural rate of unemployment”. But there is a generalconsensus that a large part of the unemployment currently prevailing in Europe is structural in origin.7Overall, the scope for monetary policy to exercise an impact on unemployment is therefore verylimited. To reduce unemployment, primarily structural policy decisions by the individual memberstates of the monetary union are needed. They will have to ensure, not least, that their labour marketsbecome more flexible.Another argument against active business-cycle management by monetary policy is the long andvariable time-lags involved. They prevent any fine-tuning of real business activity by means ofmonetary policy. On the other hand, monetary policy does have appropriate instruments forinfluencing price movements over the medium or long term. One of the few facts which areuncontested among economists is the perception that inflation is a monetary phenomenon.Monetary policy affects prices by no means only through the money stock and aggregate demand butalso via the expectations of economic agents. A major advantage of a monetary policy crediblycommitted to the objective of price stability, over an active monetary policy, is that the central bankcan take advantage of that transmission channel relatively easily. If monetary policy embodies thestability objective credibly, it simultaneously fosters wage settlements that are in line with stability. Inthis way, it creates a good basis for its own success.In my view, it would be a grave error if the central bank were to be made responsible for employmentpolicy as part of a schematic two-tier approach: first the attainment of price stability, then anorientation towards employment. For one thing, that disregards the economic management problemsderiving from the time-lags involved in monetary policy. For another, it would stand seriously in theway of the accumulation of a reputation by the central bank.                                                     6 See Friedman (1968, p. 8).7 See e.g. OECD (1998, p. 172 ff.) or IMF (1997, p. 39 ff.). For Germany, see e.g. Sachverständigenrat(Council of Economic Experts) (1998, para. 422 ff.) and Dohse et al. (1998, p. 109 ff.). Regarding thePhillips curve trade-off, Weber (1994, p. 91 ff.) comes to the conclusion for the G-7 countries (other thanItaly) that they all exhibit long-term vertical Phillips curves.
BIS Review   70/19994Thus, a large part of the recent theoretical debate on the problem of the time inconsistency ofmonetary policy is based on the initial hypothesis that the central bank should pursue a (particularlyambitious) output or employment objective in addition to the goal of price stability. Without such anorientation towards two objectives, the credibility problem is less serious. It must therefore be in thebest interests of a stability-oriented central bank not to have excessive demands made on it. Theorientation towards the objective of price stability meets with widespread approval, particularlyamong representatives of central banks. Price stability does a great deal to help monetary policymakers to gain a high reputation.8 An economic policy strategy that disregards this incentive patternand, instead, commits monetary policy to rapidly effective employment successes is likely to give riseto substantial problems. In order to ensure that short-termism does not spread to monetary policy, theTreaty of Maastricht provides for the independence of the European Central Bank and of all nationalcentral banks. This crucial institutional regulation ensures a continuous monetary policy, geared to theobjective of price stability.9Yet the commitment to price stability and the independence of the European Central Bank do notimply that the Eurosystem’s monetary policy is wholly irrelevant to business activity. A medium-term-oriented monetary policy, such as has been pursued by the Bundesbank in the past, and has beenincorporated, in the form of a reference value for monetary growth, in the “two-pillar strategy” of theEurosystem, is also apt to smooth out economic activity. As part of a monetary strategy designed toachieve continuity, interest rate movements “breathe” in line with business activity; in a sense, theythus act as a “built-in stabiliser”.Central bankers may feel gratified about an increase in employment, especially if it is the fruit of aconsistent stabilisation policy. In the process, however, they must not forget the limits set to thepotential impact of monetary policy. This is why Mervyn King, alluding to a phrase coined by AlanBlinder, has written that central bankers “need soft hearts and hard heads”.10Now that I have drawn attention to the general problems associated with economic management bymeans of monetary policy, I should like to address the specific difficulties posed by the environmentof monetary union.11 In particular, those uncertainties are to be considered which are connected withthe transition to Stage Three of monetary union. The change of regime may engender severealterations in the behaviour of economic agents in the participating states. That applies not only to thefinancial sector, in which monetary union has its most immediate impact, but also to the other sectorsof the economy.It is to be expected that competition will intensify on the goods and factor markets upon thedisappearance of the currency barriers in the euro area. Consumers and investors may well behavedifferently. For instance, foreign trade between the participating states might increase. Or goods arebought which have cheapened owing to the stronger competition. Overall, it can be assumed that thepatterns familiar from the past will change. A monetary policy that, in an aggressively activeeconomic management, relied on the old patterns might well enhance, rather than mitigate, thecyclical fluctuations.                                                     8 Fischer (1996, p. 23 ff.) draws attention to opinion polls according to which the citizens of most Europeancountries, at least in the early mid-nineties, still felt inflation to be a major problem. Correspondingly,fighting inflation contributes to the accumulation of a reputation.9 It is in this sense that Alesina and Gatti (1995, p. 198 ff.) understand the justification of central bankindependence. In their view, it is only such independence that can effectively prevent monetary policy frombeing the cause of politically induced business cycles.10 King (1999, p. 93).11On the difficulties at the start of Stage Three, see e.g. Europäische Zentralbank (1999, p. 49 f.).
5BIS Review   70/1999The uncertainty surrounding the effects of the single European monetary policy on the real economywill actually be increased by possible differences in member states’ national transmissionmechanisms. It cannot, however, be said with sufficient certainty how significant these differences arefor practical monetary policy. Although the divergent financing patterns, wage-bargaining systemsand labour and goods-market regulations in the member states provide grounds for supposing that asingle central bank rate will have differing effects,12 on closer inspection it transpires that thedirection and scale of the deviations between the individual countries depend, among other things, onthe concrete method of empirical analysis used.13Moreover, it cannot be conclusively inferred from the differences that they are statistically significant.If the criterion of statistical significance is taken into account, the differences ascertained may bemodified.14 The extent to which the existing differences will diminish in the near future is likewisedisputed. On the one hand, a higher degree of specialisation and diversification is expected in the euroarea on account of the ongoing economic integration. That would tend to result in more fanning-out ofthe structures. On the other hand, a greater convergence of economic structures is expected owing tothe single monetary policy and the increased harmonisation of the other economic policies.15Altogether, however, the uncertainties surrounding both the national effects of the Eurosystem’smonetary policy measures and the persistence of such differences stand in the way of an aggressivelyactive monetary policy, especially one oriented towards the short term.However, it is now being claimed that not only the monetary policy of the Bundesbank but also thepolicy of the European Central Bank could be explained more effectively by the “Taylor rule” than byany medium-term-oriented monetary strategy. I do not share that view. The monetary policy strategyof the Eurosystem is based just as little on the Taylor interest rate as was the former strategy of theBundesbank.                                                     12Regarding this supposition, see e.g. Hughes Hallett et al. (1999, p. 6 f.). The historical differences infinancing patterns are described, for instance, by Borio (1995, p. 77). For example, in Germany, France andthe Netherlands in 1993 over 80% of the credit was extended at medium to long term. In Italy, by contrast,51% of the credit was extended at short term.13 In the literature, differences in national transmission mechanisms are analysed as part of majormacroeconomic models (especially those of central banks), structural VAR models and smallmacroeconomic models that can be reduced to a central estimating equation. Regarding the macroeconomicmodels of the various central banks, see e.g. BIS (1995). Hughes Hallett et al. (1999) and Hughes Hallettand Piscitelli (1999) use, as an alternative, specific multi-country models. Structural VAR models are usedby Gerlach and Smets (1995), Ramaswamy and Sloek (1997), Ehrmann (1998) and Holstein (1999). Simple“single-equation systems” are used by Dornbusch et al. (1998), Brookes and Massone (1998) and Brittonand Whitley (1997). For a survey of the literature, see Kieler and Saarenheimo (1998) or Baumgartner andUrl (1999).14 This is the conclusion reached by Kieler and Saarenheimo (1998, p. 23 ff.) for Germany, France and theUK. The International Monetary Fund (1997, p. 55 f.) arrives at the following assessment: “The evidenceindicates that there have been differences in the response of activity to monetary policy across the EUcountries, but they are not so significant as to suggest that substantial problems would arise in the operationof a common monetary policy.”15 While Hughes Hallett et al. (1999, p. 6 ff.) postulate strongly diverging structures on the basis of thetheorem of “comparative advantages”, Frankel and Rose (1998, p. 1009 ff.) advocate the opposite view.And that seems understandable, particularly with regard to the differences in financing patterns. Forinstance, in the course of the decline in inflation in Italy, the above-mentioned 51% share of short-termcredit has probably decreased in the past few years. As the single monetary policy also applies to Italy, aneven greater harmonisation of financing patterns is to be expected in the future. In proportion as thepressure in monetary union to effect consistent structural reforms in the member states increases, wagebargaining and market flexibilities may also converge as additional causes of the differing transmission ofmonetary policy stimuli.
BIS Review   70/19996The Taylor rule makes the short-term interest rate dependent on current inflationary and cyclicaldevelopments. Orientation to the Taylor interest rate would have implied greater interest ratemovements than the Bundesbank actually allowed on the basis of its concept.Only in the longer term are the behaviour of the day-to-day money market rate and the behaviour ofthe Taylor interest rate quite similar. At first glance, this largely parallel movement appears to be verysurprising since the output gap did not play an explicit role in Bundesbank policy. It is less surprising,however, if the similarities between the Taylor rule and monetary targeting are taken intoconsideration. The potential-oriented monetary targeting policy, too, has an automatic anticyclicalcomponent. Furthermore, monetary targeting likewise reacts to deviations of the inflation rate from“normative inflation”.In the Eurosystem, consideration is given to the fact that the monetary policy environment cannot becharacterised solely by current price movements and the output gap. Instead, the broadly definedmoney supply, as well as a number of other monetary, financial and real economic indicators, containinformation on the future trend in inflation. Ignoring these would not be appropriate for a central bankoriented towards the objective of price stability.Hitherto, I have tried to make clear that the concentration of monetary policy in the monetary unionon the objective of price stability is appropriate. That objective is to be attained by a central decision-making body, the ECB Governing Council. No problem of coordinating independent nationalmonetary policies arises in the European monetary union.Instead of a close interlocking of various policy areas, the Maastricht Treaty envisages an unequivocalgoal for monetary policy, in the shape of price stability. In the sense of “implicit coordination” in thepolicy mix it is likewise desirable to assign clear fields of responsibility to fiscal and wage policy aswell. The main tasks of fiscal policy lie primarily in the provision of services which cannot besupplied at all, or adequately, via the market, and in the adjustment of the income distributionresulting from the market process.16 Correspondingly, the key responsibility for employment shouldbe assigned to wage policy. This (neo-classical) assignment is consistent with the practicalpossibilities of the various policy areas at the national and European level, and also takes due accountof the incentive patterns of decision-makers. At the same time, it must be borne in mind that theTreaty of Maastricht envisages the cross-border coordination of economic policy. The Treaty statesthat the member states are to regard their economic policies as a matter of common concern.17 But thesingle European monetary policy remains unaffected by this coordination precept.The object of such economic policy coordination is the monitoring of economic developments andeconomic policies in the member states. That includes, besides the surveillance of budget policies,especially the observation of structural policy measures in the goods, services and labour markets, ofcost and price movements, and the promotion of tax reforms.If one enquires rather more carefully into the relationship between the single monetary policy and theother policy areas in European monetary union, it must be said, to begin with, that politicians areprohibited from issuing instructions to the ECB and the national central banks. Similarly, the ECBand national central banks are prohibited from requesting instructions from politicians. Thus,according to the Maastricht Treaty “coordination from above” is not permissible in the Eurosystem.                                                     16 See Sachverständigenrat (Council of Economic Experts) (1974, para. 397).17 Article 102a of the Maastricht Treaty provides for the gearing of the economic policies of member states tothe objectives of the Community, as defined in Article 2 of the Treaty. In the text of the Amsterdam Treaty,these are “a harmonious, balanced and sustained development of economic activities, a high level ofemployment and of social protection, the equality of men and women, sustained, non-inflationary growth, ahigh degree of competitiveness and of convergence of economic performance, the raising of the standard ofliving and quality of life, and economic and social cohesion and solidarity among member states.”
7BIS Review   70/1999Since the Eurosystem is responsible for ensuring price stability, that responsibility must not bejeopardised by any coordination, no matter of what kind.Against this background, I should now like to address the second question of principle which I raisedat the beginning of this paper: does implicit coordination between monetary, fiscal and wage policy atEuropean level necessitate cross-border coordination in fiscal and wage policy?The role of fiscal policyIn the recent debate, the necessity for the greater convergence of fiscal policy within the euro area hasusually been justified by reference to business-cycle policy. In this context it is argued that the greaterlikelihood of spill-over effects in the event of purely national stabilisation policies makes convergenceessential.18 The single internal market and the single currency facilitate imports and exports, so thatdomestically oriented stimuli on the part of individual member states spill over to their respectiveneighbours.However, if the focus of fiscal policy action is held to be less in the stabilisation function, butprimarily in the allocative and distributional function, stabilisation-policy spill-over effects carry lessweight as arguments in favour of coordination. In line with the principle of subsidiarity, which arguesin favour of the decentralised provision of the vast bulk of public spending, the balance then swingsagainst marked coordination (and centralisation) in the field of fiscal policy.Even so, in the sphere of fiscal policy there is one perfect example of cross-border coordination bymeans of joint rules. The Stability and Growth Pact defines a code of good practices for nationalbudget policies. In this connection, attention should be drawn not only to the fiscally relevantvariables of a maximum debt level of 60% of GDP and a deficit limit of 3% of GDP, which becameknown as the “Maastricht criteria”, but also to the “obligation” to reach a budget position which isalmost in balance or even in surplus in the medium term. Meeting this target will enable all memberstates to cope with normal cyclical fluctuations and to keep the public sector deficit at or below thelevel of the reference value of 3%.Although the Stability and Growth Pact can be substantiated by reference to the spill-over effects ofnational fiscal policies, when the Stability and Growth Pact was drawn up the primary intention wasnot to concentrate forces in order to perform a joint stabilisation task. The aim was, rather, to protectboth the single monetary policy and the fiscal policies of member states of the European Union fromthe unsound budgetary policies of particular member states. As it could not be taken for granted thatthe financial markets, as the sole disciplining factor, would ensure fiscal stability, the countriesconcerned agreed on a minimum standard of fiscal discipline, in the form of the Stability and GrowthPact.19 To that end, the member states must present medium-term “stability or convergenceprogrammes” once a year. If it transpires after a few months that such a programme is based more onhopes than on realistic assumptions, it comes as no surprise if the markets respond with jitters anddisappointment.The role of wage policyThe starting point of my observations on the role of wage policy in the policy mix of the Europeanmonetary union is once again the model of implicit coordination. According to that model, wage                                                     18 For this view, see e.g. Flassbeck (1998a, p. 557), who demands an institutionally based coordination offiscal policies.19 Further arguments in favour of the Stability and Growth Pact are spelled out by Eichengreen and Wyplosz(1998, p. 71 ff.). Among other things, they regard the Stability and Growth Pact as the first step towards an(in their eyes desirable) ex ante mutual coordination of national fiscal policies and of fiscal policy withmonetary policy (p. 77 f.).
BIS Review   70/19998policy is assigned to the objective of employment. The key question is whether such assignment callsfor cross-border coordination of wage policy.Concern about a pan-European wage-cutting race is one argument used in favour of a closeinterlinking of national wage policies. What is feared in this case is that the level of wages will beused as a factor to create jobs in the domestic market to the detriment of other member states, in thestyle of “beggar thy neighbour” policies. The upshot of such a “disastrous wage-cutting race” couldonly be a general process of deflation.20 To prevent such a development, the parties to pay settlementsshould be committed to wage rises that are oriented towards the growth of productivity.21 Wage policywould then be coordinated by means of a “joint rule”, i.e. by orientation towards the growth ofproductivity.However, some weighty objections can be raised against these ideas. For instance, orientation towardsproductivity growth as a guideline for wage policy appears to me to make little sense at times ofheavy unemployment. In the first place, it is reasonable to expect that, with the relative cheapening ofthe production factor labour, substitution processes in favour of higher employment are triggered.22Secondly, in the event of heavy unemployment it is essential for wage rises to lag behind the growthof productivity, if only because the statistically recorded average productivity of labour may increaseas a result of a reduction in the labour input.The notion of a distribution of given jobs among all EMU countries – such as ultimately underlies theargument of wage-cutting competition – disregards the supply-side potential improvements inmomentum on the labour and goods market. EMU-wide wage restraint aimed at making more outputprofitable on the cost side need not by any means be a zero-sum game in which one country losesprecisely the number of jobs that another gains.23Some authors believe that centralised, corporatist wage-bargaining systems are likely to exertfavourable employment effects. Such hopes are based largely on the assumption that, in the context ofcentralised wage negotiations, the parties to wage settlements will take due account of the effects ofwage rises on prices and employment, which, it is thought, is not true in the case of industry-specificwage negotiations, on account of a free-rider attitude in stabilisation and employment policy.24But the institutional regulations affecting the labour market – and thus the structure of the wage-bargaining systems as well – differ considerably between the individual EMU member states. Unlikesmall, comparatively homogeneous Austria or the Netherlands, which are often cited as examples of asuccessful corporatist approach, the euro area is a large economic zone of pronounced structuraldiversity. In addition, it is likely to be particularly difficult to implement a common European policyin those countries in which the responsibility for wage bargaining is highly decentralised, e.g. locatedat enterprise level. In macroeconomic terms, however, that is not a drawback.                                                     20 See Horn et al. (1997, p. 99 ff.) or Horn and Zwiener (1998, p. 551 ff.).21 See Horn and Zwiener (1998, p. 554). For concrete nominal wage settlements, the following formulashould be used: “nominal wage rise = productivity growth + target inflation rate of the Eurosystem.” Thatwould not only prevent the “disastrous wage-cutting race” but also protect the monetary policy of theEurosystem from inflationary pressures due to wage policy. That would create employment-policy scopefor monetary policy.22 At all events, this seems to be the case for Germany (see e.g. Lapp and Lehment (1997, p. 67 ff.) orRottmann and Ruschinski (1998, p. 10). The fact that wage restraint in Germany was unable to fulfil all theemployment-policy expectations pinned on it may owe something to very vigorous job-shedding on accountof the unavoidable consolidation of the public sector budgets, the adjustment of the economic structure inthe new Länder and the tailing-off of the construction boom.23 In the simulation account of Horn and Zwiener (1998, p. 555 ff.), coordinated cuts in nominal wages in allEMU countries exert distinctly favourable employment and growth effects.24 See in particular Calmfors and Driffill (1988).
9BIS Review   70/1999In my opinion, the road to more employment leads less via centralised wage negotiations at Europeanlevel than via structural changes on the labour markets. Programmes of wide-ranging structuralreforms have been elaborated by the OECD, among others.25 What has been lacking so far is thepolitical will to implement such reforms. Hence the main significance of the European employmentpact lies in enhancing the will to implement reforms and to initiate structural changes.Another factor mitigating against coordination in wage policy is that, owing to monetary union,monetary policy can definitively no longer function as a national “shock absorber”. Moreover, in mostmember states fiscal policy can likewise perform this function only to a very limited extent at present.Since the budget deficits and/or debt levels in most member states are still pretty high, the relevantprovisions of the Stability and Growth Pact curb fiscal policy’s scope. That is another reason why adistinctly higher degree of flexibility on the labour markets is needed. Otherwise, adverse economicshocks will be reflected directly in higher unemployment figures.Notwithstanding the calls for greater coordination, in actual fact competition between the regionsshould be used as a coordination mechanism. Issing has formulated this finding as follows: “Preciselybecause monetary policy can no longer respond to national conditions the exact opposite of greatercentralisation and harmonisation may be required in other areas. Talk of uniform European wage-setting or of an ambitious social union is going in the wrong direction; different productivity and realeconomic conditions across the euro area must be taken into account more than ever.”26Concluding remarksThe single European monetary policy is currently being accompanied both by a fiscal policy whichhas largely remained a national responsibility and by a wage policy which is coordinated, at most, atnational level. In my view, however, this policy mix should not be deplored, as there is anyway littleto be said for more far-reaching coordination across policies at European level. Any coordinationextending beyond implicit coordination would pose two problems:First, there would be a danger of economic policy engendering destabilisation, rather than economicstability, owing to a one-sided orientation towards a policy of short-term stabilisation of businessactivity. What I have said about monetary policy showed how difficult a short-term-oriented policy isin the presence of long and variable time-lags. This problem would certainly not be mitigated bygoing further than the implicit coordination of the various policy areas.Second, ex ante coordination across policies would also involve the risk of responsibilities becomingblurred and incentive patterns destroyed. Any attempt to orient all policy areas towards all objectivesmay well lead to a situation in which ultimately no area seriously tries to reach even one objective. Astrategy of “relying on someone else” may perhaps promise an easier life, and a policy of “drawingattention to the failure of someone else” longer political survival, but without an unequivocalobjective, there can ultimately be no clear accountability. This moral hazard problem may not onlyresult in a threat to price stability, but also be counterproductive in terms of employment policy.The reservations about explicit ex ante coordination in European economic policy do not imply thatthat policy should entirely forgo any form of coordination. Elements of implicit coordination andmacroeconomic dialogue are already evident at European level.For instance, a certain coordination of the single monetary policy with national fiscal policies occursunder the Stability and Growth Pact. Compliance with the fiscal standards laid down in that Pactrelieves the Eurosystem of political pressure to facilitate the financing of massive budget deficits bymeans of durably low interest rates. In that way, the Stability and Growth Pact helps to ensure that the                                                     25 See e.g. the job studies of the OECD.26 Issing (1999, p. 10).
BIS Review   70/199910Eurosystem can always exhibit the “staying power” in its stabilisation policy efforts that is requiredfor successful monetary policy.It is the mandate of monetary policy to maintain price stability in the euro area. This clearly definedobjective takes due account of the opportunities presented by, and limits set to, monetary policy. Interms of reputation, this is at the same time in line with the incentives afforded to central bankers.Finally, the clear assignment of functions facilitates accountability.Fiscal policy should, first and foremost, perform its allocation and distribution function; wage policyshould be assigned the primary employment-policy responsibility. Instead of the vague assignment offunctions and the blurring of areas of responsibility associated with explicit or ex ante coordination,this clear-cut separation of responsibilities promises effective implicit coordination.If one wonders, in conclusion, whether there is no room left at all in this approach for the stabilisationof demand, I should like to draw attention, first, to the automatic stabilisation effected by a monetarypolicy geared to the medium term. Moreover, it is in the best interests of monetary policy if the publicbudgets, too, exert smoothing effects on business activity. That, however, will not really be possibleagain until the structural budget deficits have been reduced. Provided fiscal accounts are balanced innormal times, the full endogenous reaction of national fiscal structures to downturns should not behampered by the Stability and Growth Pact, even during severe recessions. By contrast, starting fromdeficits of around 2% of GDP – about the euro area’s 1998 average – would imply eithersystematically stifling the operation of automatic stabilisers in the event of recessions, or moving intoexcessive deficits with a high probability. At all events, growing structural deficits do not help tosmooth the movement of incomes across the various phases of a business cycle.In recent decades, fiscal structures have become encrusted. They must now be broken open again.There is a need for speed. The adjustment of the deficits is an indispensable element in such structuralreforms, which should tackle the expenditure side of public budgets. Delays or dilutions areunacceptable. They will be penalised by the markets. After all, it should not be forgotten that the ratioof public spending to the gross domestic product in the euro area is still over 51%!BibliographyAlesina, A and R Gatti (1995), Independent Central Banks: Low Inflation at No Costs, in: AmericanEconomic Review, Vol. 85, No. 2 (Papers and Proceedings), 196–200.Artis, M and B Winkler (1998), The Stability Pact: Safeguarding the Credibility of the EuropeanCentral Bank, National Institute Economic Review.Baumgartner, J and T Url (1999), Gemeinsame Geldpolitik – unterschiedliche Auswirkungen?

1BIS Review   69/1999Mr Duisenberg discusses the role of capital markets and financing in the euro areaSpeech by Willem F Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, at theWaarborgfonds Sociale Woningbouw in Utrecht, the Netherlands, on 14 June 1999.IntroductionThe European capital markets have gone through a major structural change with theintroduction of the euro. Eleven national markets have received a strong impetus to integrateinto a single euro area capital market. In addition, the process of integration seems to gobeyond the euro area, with links being forged with other European markets.Capital markets represent a fundamental element of the financial system of any moderneconomy and they play an important role in the allocation of capital within the economy.Therefore public authorities responsible for economic policy as well as private sector agentswho are active in the capital markets have a vested interest in capital markets that are bothefficient and stable.Today, I would first like to discuss the role of the capital markets and the advantages ofpossessing deep and liquid capital markets. Secondly, I will turn my attention to the effects oncapital markets that we have already seen since the introduction of the euro, and the process offurther integration in capital markets that is expected to continue in the future. The emphasisof this discussion will be on the euro area bond markets. Thirdly, I will focus my attention onthe important issue of how these developments which are expected to take place are likely toshape financing in the European capital markets and in particular how they might affectfinancing through the euro area bond markets. Finally, I will turn my attention to the role thatpublic authorities have already played and will play in this process in the future.The role of efficient and stable capital marketsTurning first to the role of capital markets, it might be asked why one should be interested inthe depth and liquidity of capital markets at all. After all, capital markets are mostly in thebusiness of trading in bonds and equities that have been issued in the past. The actualfinancing or allocation of new capital represents only a fraction of the daily turnover of capitalmarkets.Indeed, from the point of view of allocating capital across productive purposes the secondarymarket is not of direct relevance. And as you know, in most financial systems there has been aphase in which markets have been more or less non-existent and financing has taken placethrough intermediaries, banks.However, deep and liquid secondary markets play a very important indirect role for financingin capital markets. First of all, well functioning secondary markets provide transparent marketprices for capital market financing. Those economic agents involved in planning physicalinvestments know at all times what the cost of capital is, and can take this into account in theirinvestment decisions. Furthermore, savers know at all times what yield they can earn fromvarious instruments. In addition, the existence of an active and deep secondary market ensuresthat savers and borrowers can be relatively confident that their decisions will not havesignificant effects on market prices.For those that provide financing through capital markets, the existence of a liquid secondarymarket provides the means to adjust portfolios without incurring large costs. In thesecircumstances investors will tend to reduce the rate of return that they demand. This clearly
BIS Review   69/19992means that the liquidity of the capital market is a key consideration for the efficiency ofallocation of capital.In short, depth and liquidity are key ingredients for capital markets that function in an efficientand stable manner, and these necessary elements can only be achieved through activesecondary markets.This background should have convinced you that I see great merit in the existence of deep andliquid capital markets alongside a stable and efficient banking sector. This is not for themarkets themselves, but for the important role they play in the allocation of capital and indeedfor investments and growth in the economy.The introduction of the euro and the European capital marketsThe introduction of the euro has already affected and is likely to affect the euro area financialmarkets in a profound manner in the future. A good example of this influence is provided bydevelopments in the euro area money markets since the beginning of this year. Following thechangeover to the euro, a highly competitive single money market has already emerged in theeuro area as banks were well prepared for the changeover to the euro and the TARGETsystem has provided an efficient means of making cross-border payments. In particular,differences in overnight interest rate spreads now mainly reflect differences in the creditstanding of banks rather than that of the country in which money market transactions occur.So, in the course of a very short period of time, the original eleven mechanisms to allocate andprice short-term financing within the respective banking sectors of participating countrieswere transformed into a single mechanism for the entire euro area.Concerning longer-term financing, we have good reasons to believe that a similar evolutiontowards a single market is already well under way. With the integration of the markets, what Imean is that market prices of the euro area will increasingly provide an accurate reflection ofdifferences in quality between various issuers as well as differences in liquidity betweensecurities. Furthermore, divergences purely related to the location of market participantswithin the euro area will have to become less and less relevant over time.It is important to remember that the capital markets of the euro area began the process ofintegration well before the start of Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union. Anindication of the pace of integration before January 1999 is provided in particular by theevolution of spreads between yields on bonds issued by the various central governments of theeuro area, which narrowed continuously from mid-1995 onwards. The factors that contributedto this favourable pattern included increased convergence towards low rates of inflation acrossthe euro area during Stage Two, the gradual reduction and finally the elimination of exchangerate risks, the commitment of governments towards improving the sustainability of publicfinances. A further factor was the improvement of the depth and liquidity of government bondmarkets themselves.The integration of the euro area central government bond market is therefore well under way.Differences in bond yields should be reflective of differences in creditworthiness of debtors,and even more so of the liquidity of a given bond. This liquidity effect is visible in the termstructure of yields across the euro area, as the lowest yields at different points on the maturityspectrum have been seen on bonds that have been issued by different countries in the euroarea that have had different credit ratings.Turning to equity markets, a similar process of integration is apparent. With regard to thebehaviour of investors, an increasing number of equity market participants already appear to
3BIS Review   69/1999be taking investment positions on the equity market of the euro area from a sectoral ratherthan a national perspective. Reflecting this development, various market participants havemade both area-wide and sectoral equity indices available, thus providing investors withopportunities to monitor area-wide equity investment positions.Furthermore the institutional set-up of stock exchanges is showing signs of an evolutiontowards more integration and greater market efficiency. As consolidation within the financialservices sector has increased the size and geographical reach of intermediaries and fundmanagement institutions, they and also some listed companies seem to be pressing for market-places to become more concentrated in order both to reduce costs and to enhance liquidity.Financing in the euro area capital marketsThe euro area bond market is the second largest market in the world after the US market.However, the euro area market is not yet as integrated as the US market, implying that someof the benefits of a large market have yet to be realised.Looking at financing in the European bond market, two groups of debtors account for thelarge majority of the outstanding stock of debt securities, namely public sector and financialinstitutions.The amount of outstanding public sector bonds in the euro area is more than 3 trillion euros,somewhat less than 60% of euro area GDP. While that amount provides the market with depthand liquidity, you will not be surprised to hear that I would like to see this ratio to GDPcoming down. The amount of public debt in the euro area is still too high. For a stable euro itis also – though not solely – of vital importance that governments should keep theircommitment to reduce their indebtedness to more sustainable levels as agreed in the Stabilityand Growth Pact. This would support monetary policy, create room in government budgets toaccommodate periods of unfavourable economic developments and make it possible to bearthe burden on the budget resulting from the imminent ageing of the population. Reducedborrowing by the public sector would also leave more room for the private sector to issue debtsecurities.In terms of issuance of bonds, the euro area financial sector ranks second to the public sectorin euro area capital markets. And indeed, longer-term debt financing by the corporate sector inEurope still takes place predominantly via financial intermediaries, which partly fundthemselves through capital markets. For this part, the European capital markets do not allocatecapital directly between savers and investors, but rather through intermediaries. In the UnitedStates, where there is a very active corporate bond market, the situation is quite different, withbank loans only forming a major source of financing for small and medium sized companies.There are a number of reasons why corporate sector financing in the euro area capital marketsis likely to benefit from integrated markets in the future.Firstly, as I mentioned earlier, the depth and liquidity of capital markets are important forcapital markets to perform their functions efficiently. With integrated markets we will seedeeper and more liquid markets than was the case beforehand in any of the euro areacountries. Private sector issuers in general and companies in particular are by definitionheterogeneous and the development of an efficient market for corporate bonds for varioustypes of companies and within various maturity ranges requires the existence of a largemarket. In order to guarantee a competitive market price for a given corporate bond, it isnecessary for there to be a large number of bonds which share similar characteristics in themarket.
BIS Review   69/19994Secondly, for large companies in particular, it makes sense from the point of view ofefficiency to have all the various means of financing at their disposal, namely bond and paperfinancing as well as bank loans and equity financing. Indeed, the credit ratings of many largecompanies in the euro area are better than the credit ratings of most banks. This should lead tosavings on the cost of capital for the most creditworthy companies, if they were to be moreactive in bond issuance.Thirdly, it is important to note that in a number of countries, the debt securities market forlonger-term maturities in their own currency was close to non-existent in the past. Forexample, 20 or 30 year debt issuance was available only in some currencies, at least with afixed interest rate. These types of debt securities are now available across the euro area.Fourthly, an increase in global demand for euro-denominated debt securities can be expected,as the euro becomes an even more important reserve currency than it already is. Moreover, thedemand for higher risk euro-denominated debt securities is likely to increase, particularly asthe current low level of sovereign yields increases incentives to search for higher yields.A factor that is not related to the integrated market but is nonetheless important for the futureevolution of the capital markets is the pattern of demographic trends in most euro areacountries. The euro area population is ageing, and this means that we have to save in order tobe able to take care of future pension payments. In the Netherlands this is already done,traditionally, on a larger scale than in some other euro area countries. Part of these savingswill be invested in capital markets. Furthermore, with ageing, we have also seen an increase inthe wealth of individuals, and this wealth is being invested more and more in financial assetsrather than in real assets.I have now listed a number of factors that suggest that activity in the euro area as well asEuropean capital markets more generally will increase in the future. And indeed, since theintroduction of the euro, corporate bond issuance seems already to have gathered pace. Duringthe first quarter of this year, the amount of new issues was high compared with previous years.According to some sources it was nearly on par with the full year of 1998 and it wasconsiderably more than in 1997. There may have been some exceptional factors that couldhave accounted for part of this development. For example some companies may have timedtheir bond issuance to benefit from the expected increased interest in euro-denominatedsecurities at the beginning of the year. Nonetheless, it seems rather likely that an upward trendin corporate bond issuance has commenced in the euro area.Public authorities and efficient and stable capital markets in EuropeI touched upon the fact earlier that public authorities also see merit in having efficient andstable capital markets in the euro area and in Europe generally. In order to contribute to afavourable development, authorities have been and are active in a number of fields. I will firstmention something about the activities of other authorities and then I will conclude mypresentation today with some remarks on how we in the Eurosystem are contributing to afavourable development in this field. When I say Eurosystem, I am referring to the EuropeanCentral Bank and the eleven national central banks of the countries which have adopted theeuro.A prudent, harmonised regulatory framework, on the one hand, and harmonised marketpractices, on the other, are key factors in guaranteeing the smooth integration anddevelopment of European capital markets. In these areas a lot of work has already beenconducted, and a lot more has still to be achieved in order to pave the way for truly integrated
5BIS Review   69/1999financial markets. Harmonisation in repurchase agreements, national company laws includingbankruptcy laws, and other aspects of the legal and regulatory framework, for example, wouldenhance legal clarity and certainty and thereby improve the efficiency and stability of thefinancial markets.At this point, I would like to draw your attention to the Action Plan recently published by theEuropean Commission. It contains priorities and timetables for measures aimed at improvingthe functioning of the single market for financial services. In particular, measures areproposed to advance the harmonisation of the legal framework and market information, aswell as to facilitate investors’ operations throughout the single market.Finally, what is the role of the Eurosystem in this whole process? I could first mention the“market-friendly” operational framework of the Eurosystem, which facilitates the efficientfunctioning of capital markets, for example, by being very transparent and accepting a widelist of securities as collateral.Moreover, capital markets trade in long-term commitments, be they equities or bonds. Whenpricing these long-term commitments, investors face many uncertainties, not only concerningthe issuer but also the future economic environment. The latter uncertainties are reduced bythe Eurosystem’s clear commitment to its primary objective, price stability.Looking at the current situation in euro area capital markets, we can see that marketparticipants consider this commitment by the Eurosystem to be credible. Yields on long-termgovernment bonds are at relatively low levels. These low levels reflect a high degree ofconfidence in the ability of the Eurosystem to maintain price stability in the euro area over thelonger term. In other words, both inflation expectations and the risk premia associated withinflation uncertainty are low at present, a situation that we wish to maintain.For the bond markets and therefore for companies financing themselves in the market, thehigh level of credibility attached to the Eurosystem is highly beneficial. In particular, the factthat inflation risk premia are low means that companies as well as housing associationsseeking long-term financing do not have to pay for the risk that the central bank may not beable to maintain price stability over the longer term.For the economy as a whole, this environment of low costs of long-term financing should beconducive for the private sector to undertake productive investments. Companies can alsotake advantage of the longer planning horizon provided by the knowledge that the cost ofcapital they employ in their investments will remain stable. I do not have to tell you that this isalso of fundamental importance in your sector, i.e. housing.For the last minutes I have focused on the developments in the European financial markets ingeneral rather than what these developments specifically mean for you. I wanted to outline toyou the European environment in which you will increasingly be operating. In Europe, we areunquestionably moving towards integrated financial markets. Clearly, this will have an impacton the financing of housing as well. I have mainly described general consequences and willleave it to you to draw your own conclusions about how this will affect the financing ofhousing associations.
1BIS Review   68/1999Mr. George gives an address on recent changes in the international financial and economicenvironmentSpeech given by Mr E A J George, Governor of the Bank of England, at a Dinner with the LordMayor for Bankers and Merchants of the City of London on 10 June 1999.My Lord Mayor, Mr Chancellor, My Lords, Aldermen, Mr Recorder, Sheriffs, Ladies and Gentlemen.When we were last here for this splendid occasion I suggested that we were living in a dangerousinternational financial and economic environment. These were strong words for a central banker – butperhaps not strong enough. That environment rapidly became worse through the autumn, so that byaround the time of the IMF Annual Meetings in October there was a good deal of talk about globalfinancial meltdown and impending world recession – which was not simply journalistic hyperbole.Since that low point things have certainly improved. The hectic scramble for financial asset qualityand liquidity following Russia’s default and the near collapse of LTCM – an exceptionally highlygeared hedge fund – failed to uncover fatal weaknesses elsewhere in the financial system, and lendersand investors have gradually regained some of their appetite for risk. Fears of a general credit crunchin major industrial countries quickly receded; and sentiment towards the emerging markets hasimproved, with growing evidence of recovery in the original Asian crisis countries and a better thanexpected outcome in Brazil. Among the industrial countries, Japan made stronger efforts to bring itslong recession to an end – through macro-economic stimulus and by strengthening its domesticbanking system – and there are now signs that those efforts are beginning to be rewarded. Meanwhilethe world economy has been effectively underpinned by continuing abnormally strong domesticdemand growth in the United States.But despite these developments we still have a long way to go. If the immediate danger of globalfinancial instability has receded, we are still stuck with slow growth in the world economy, currentlyat around 2½%, which is not much more than half the estimated trend growth rate. And we are stuck,too, with massive international imbalances, both between the emerging and industrial countries, onthe one hand, and among the major industrial countries, on the other.Without a stronger resumption of capital inflows to the emerging markets, the industrial countries willneed to accommodate an export-led recovery in those markets. That implies stronger domesticdemand, and hence import, growth in the G7 countries, if the world economy as a whole is to get backon trend in the reasonably near term. And the immediate challenge in this situation is to try to ensurethat, as domestic demand growth in the United States slows – as it probably must, by one means oranother – demand picks up sufficiently elsewhere, especially in Europe and Japan, to take up therunning. That in turn will largely determine how successfully we can achieve an orderly unwinding ofthe present imbalances.This wider international context is, inevitably, having a profound – and continuing – effect on thepattern of interest rates and exchange rates, and on economic developments, both within the Eurozoneand here in the United Kingdom, to an extent that is still perhaps not fully appreciated.A year ago, when the historic decision to go ahead with a broadly-based euro was taken in Brussels,the prospect was for a steady pick-up in overall demand and output across the Eurozone. It was ahelpful environment for the introduction of the new currency. And the constituent currencies of theeuro strengthened in the second half of last year on the back of that.The introduction of the euro at the beginning of this year was a technical triumph – within theEurozone, but also notably here in the City, which has clearly established itself from the outset as avital contributor to the development of broad and liquid euro-denominated wholesale financialmarkets.
BIS Review   68/19992But the growing impact of the global economic setback last autumn was to dampen external demandand business confidence in the Eurozone – as it did elsewhere – apparently affecting some of theparticipating countries more than others. In contrast to the United States, slower growth of externaldemand was not sufficiently offset by stronger domestic demand growth in the Eurozone, so that,instead of the expected pick-up in overall output growth, activity in fact increased progressively moreslowly. Largely as a result, the euro has depreciated in the foreign exchange market and economicperformance in individual participating countries has diverged more than might have been expected.This has been a disappointment to some proponents of the euro and has been seized upon by euro-sceptics as evidence of its risks. We need to be cautious, in my view, in interpreting this initialexperience in the present unusually difficult global economic environment. As demand strengthens inthe Eurozone – and the latest indicators from Germany are more encouraging – the likelihood is thatthe euro will recover and some of the present tensions ease. It has always been clear that there arepotential risks of economic divergence within the Euro area to be weighed against the more obviouspotential economic benefits of the single currency. The question has been just how significant arethose risks likely to be. That will, ultimately, always be a matter of judgement. But it would bepremature, in my view, to reach that judgement based on today’s abnormal circumstances.Now we, in this country, have of course been battered about, like everyone else, by the globalturbulence. There is no way that we could have avoided its impact – either through fiscal or monetarypolicy. We are an integral part of the global economy.And we had particular problems of our own. In our case, in marked contrast to the Eurozone, anddespite the dampening effect of an already exaggeratedly strong exchange rate, we were confronted,in the early part of last year, with the prospect of excess demand and accelerating inflation, and policyhad been tightened to head that off. But we, like others, were then hit in the autumn by the renewedturmoil in the global economy. That caused a sharper fall in external demand, but it also caused bothbusiness and consumer confidence to plummet – so that prospect of moderate overall slowdown we’dbeen deliberately trying to engineer quite suddenly threatened to turn into an unnecessarily sharpdownturn, with the risk that the rate of inflation would fall significantly below the Government’s2½% inflation target.So we promptly reversed gear – cutting interest rates very sharply – by 2½% to as low as they havebeen since the mid-1960s. That has helped both business and consumer confidence to recover – fromvery low levels – and the prospect now is that, after a pretty flat economic performance either side ofthe year-end, overall demand and output growth will pick up steadily to around trend by the middle ofnext year. But, despite these interest rate cuts, the pound has actually strengthened – notably againstthe euro – in part, as I suggested earlier, because of weaker overall demand pressure on the Continent.So we are again impaled on the horns of our earlier dilemma, arising from continuing imbalancebetween the stronger domestic and weaker externally-exposed sectors of the economy. Believe me – itis not a comfortable place to be.The question is what to do?Of course, as with everything else, where you stand depends on where you sit.The suffering sectors – most of agriculture, large parts of manufacturing industry and some servicessectors – are in no doubt. Cut interest rates again – they say – and again and again. They’re still twiceas high as interest rates in Europe – and they might just as well add, they are over 150 times as high asinterest rates in Japan! The many more net savers – including pensioners living off the interest ontheir savings – take the opposite view, although they do, of course, benefit from the low inflationenvironment through the protection it gives to the real value of their assets.What we have to try to do is to maintain stability in the economy as a whole, by keeping overalldemand continuously broadly in line with the supply-side capacity of the economy as a whole. The
3BIS Review   68/1999inflation target is not some abstract end in itself – it is the measure, or barometer if you like, of howsuccessfully we are managing to maintain macro-economic stability in the economy as a whole in thismuch wider sense. The reason that our interest rates remain higher than those in the Eurozone is that,despite the recent slowdown, our economy is operating closer to capacity than theirs. That’s partlywhy our rate of unemployment is almost half theirs – though the greater structural flexibility of theBritish economy is even more important in this context.The MPC sets interest rates to achieve the inflation target. We have made it clear by our actions thatwe are just as vigorous in relaxing policy when the risks to inflation are on the downside as we are intightening policy when the risks to inflation are on the upside. That’s the best help that we can givethrough monetary policy.It does not mean that we ignore the external pressures. In assessing the prospects for the overalleconomy, and for inflation, we take full account of the impact of world demand and of the exchangerate, just as we take full account of all the domestic factors bearing on inflation prospects. When, asnow, the external influences are having a powerful disinflationary effect, monetary policy is of courseeasier, and interest rates lower, than they would otherwise be. That does not – and cannot – mean thatwe are able to pursue any particular objective with regard to the exchange rate – or that we respond,Pavlov-like, to exchange rate fluctuations. But we can, and do, aim to offset the impact of persistentexternal influences on the prospect for inflation so that inflation in the economy as a whole stays ontrack to meet the inflation target given to us by the Chancellor. That is what we have been doing – andis the context of our further move today.No-one, my Lord Mayor, is more conscious than I am of the limits to what we can hope to achievethrough monetary policy. But by operating within those limits we have been able to achieve greatermacro-economic stability, and consistently lower inflation, than we’ve seen for a generation. And thatstability, together with the improved supply-side flexibility of the economy, has delivered our highestever level of employment, and a rate of unemployment in the economy as a whole that is still close toits lowest for almost 20 years.
1BIS Review   67/1999Mr Tietmeyer focuses on economic convergence and EMULecture by the President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, Prof Hans Tietmeyer, in the series “Builders ofthe Millennium” in celebration of the 750th anniversary of the foundation of University College,Oxford in Oxford on 3 June 1999.IFirst of all, I should like to express my sincere gratitude for honouring me with your invitation. I amdelighted and indeed honoured to be here. Oxford: the university, its colleges and facilities stand, onthe one hand, for achievement and competitiveness in the modern world and, on the other, for history,tradition and heritage. They are part of Britain’s history and part of its future. And that means — Iwould quite expressly like to add — that they are also part of Europe’s history and its future. GreatBritain and Europe are not separate, mutually independent entities — either economically orculturally.That leads me straightaway to the subject of Europe and its future. I am naturally aware that thiscountry is in the middle of a major process of clarification. How does it perceive its future position inEurope? How can it influence future developments in Europe? And, not least, what are the conditionsof, and prospects for, future entry into monetary union? Like many others in Europe, I am followingthis process with keen interest. And I have the impression that this debate in the United Kingdom hasmade significant progress over the past two years. Of course, it is ultimately only the Britishthemselves who can decide how they wish to shape their relations with Europe and Europeanintegration. Even so, I do not wish to conceal the fact that I have a great deal of sympathy with theidea of the United Kingdom playing a crucial role in the future development of Europe and of itbringing not only its great traditions but also its criticism and economic performance to bear in aconstructive role in Europe and, hopefully, one day also into monetary union.But that is a prospect on which the United Kingdom — its government, its parliament and its people— must take its own sovereign decision. I do not presume to be able to offer you advice on thatmatter. Instead, what I would like to do today is to draw your attention, in particular, to those aspectsof monetary union which have played — and, in some cases, are still playing — a major role in ourdebate in Germany. There will probably be very little of this that is really new to you. However, itmight be valuable for you to know the points on which particular emphasis was — and is still being— placed in the German debate. Perhaps there will be some aspects which might provide astimulating talking point for your own discussion.IILet me start with a simple, but fundamental, analysis: What does monetary union mean? What kind ofenvironment does it create? It seems to me that it possesses three essential characteristics: Firstly:membership of monetary union implies relinquishing monetary sovereignty. Monetary policybecomes European. Naturally enough, that concerns the level of the official interest rates. But it goesfurther than that. European monetary policy includes the framework in which monetary policy isconducted, embracing not only its structure and the way in which the central banking systemperceives its own role, but also the strategy and instruments used, as well as much else besides.Secondly: the monetary union is designed to last. Entry into it is a road on which there is no turningback. In monetary union, a “trial marriage” is no longer possible. Reversing that decision would entailincalculable economic and political costs. No one ought to place any faith in that being a realisticoption. And thirdly: the euro area is unlike every other currency area, which is defined — at leastusually — by the area of a single sovereign nation state. There is a single monetary policy for the euroarea. However, the other areas of policy, such as budget, tax and social policies, are still largelydecentralised. Fiscal policy, in particular, must abide by the rules set down in the Maastricht Treatyand in the supplementary Stability and Growth Pact.These three characteristics appear straightforward and self-evident. But they have importantimplications: One key implication is that the euro area requires lasting economic convergence —convergence in the sense that each single country must be able to keep up with the others on a
BIS Review   67/19992permanent basis, without recourse to national monetary policy or changes in the exchange rate. Thatnecessity of lasting convergence has to be seen against the backdrop of unrestricted capitalmovements and supranational monetary policy. A traditional nation state with its own currency hasseveral options available for fostering convergence within its own currency area. There are largelyuniform economic and taxation policies to prevent excessive deviations in politically-inducedconditions for investment. There is a national budgetary policy which can give financial support toregions which are lagging behind the general trend. And there is a largely similar and similarly fundedsystem of welfare. These are all things which the euro area does not have at a supranational level —or, at least, not to anything like the same extent.There are some — mainly on the continent — who regret this because it means that economicconvergence cannot be created or, at least, actively promoted by a centralised policy. Others — and Isuspect that the overwhelming majority of the British people belong to this camp — believe this to bea good thing. Europe should not be a dominant centralised entity, nor should it have an egalitarianpublic-sector system of adjustment. It should be decentralised, organised on the principles ofsubsidiarity and geared to competition. Your Prime Minister put this in a nutshell: “Integrate wherenecessary. Decentralise where possible.” I would add that I have a great deal of sympathy for thatposition.However, one also has to see the other side of the coin. One problem remains: how can a politicallydecentralised monetary union safeguard the necessary lasting convergence of all its member states?Ultimately, there is only one way of doing this. Safeguarding lasting convergence in a politicallydecentralised monetary union must rest on two pillars: firstly, on each country’s own sustainedcompetitiveness and on each country’s own efforts; and, secondly, on a fundamental willingness toaccept certain binding rules and abide by them on a permanent basis. That is the only way in which amonetary union with a decentralised political structure can succeed — not only economically, but alsopolitically: in other words, without excessive conflict among the participating countries.IIIThe competitiveness of each single country is obviously initially one economic condition for a kind ofoptimum currency area. Basically, an optimum currency area means that, in the longer term, there isno need for adjustment of the nominal exchange rate because other adjustment mechanisms areeffective, say, as a result of internal flexibility or a high degree of labour mobility.That is clear in theory. In practice, there is a fundamental problem: how can the ability to “keep up”be assessed? And how is it possible to safeguard that ability and the willingness to utilise it on alasting basis? Now, in some way or another, the track record and the basic situation in the countriesconcerned have to be taken into account. The Maastricht Treaty does that and stipulates convergencecriteria for that purpose. These may not have been the final pearl of wisdom in the strict economicsense, but that should not make us overlook what fundamental pillars the convergence criteriarepresent in terms of the logic of a politically decentralised currency union.I am aware of the fact that we Germans, by insisting on a strict interpretation of those criteria, havenot always been given a good press internationally in the past. It may also be the case that the debatein Germany did not always take the best possible course, especially when somewhat too muchemphasis was being placed on the decimal place in the budgetary policy for the test year, for example.But the key element — taking the convergence criteria seriously — was — and still is — correct. Thecriteria were, and remain, a test of ability and political will, at least at the time of entry. Basicconditions for passing a test are undoubtedly the abilities to keep the internal value of the currencystable and to maintain the exchange rate without tensions — an exchange rate, moreover, which isdetermined a priori as a central rate, not one which is defined at a later stage. For that reason, theTreaty calls — and, in our opinion, unquestionably calls — for a two-year membership in ERMwithout tensions.In this interpretation of convergence — which has determined the German debate — there are twoideas which play a key role: the idea of the permanence of sufficient convergence and the idea that thepresent and the past are a test of the future ability to stay the pace on a lasting basis.
3BIS Review   67/1999Perhaps you feel the debate in Germany has a different emphasis from the one here. In the UnitedKingdom, convergence is sometimes understood more in the sense of convergence in the businesscycle. By no means do I wish to disparage that. Naturally enough, I am aware of the current economicbackground in the United Kingdom. And we do already have this problem in the euro area at themoment. The cyclical position of Ireland, for instance, is obviously different from that in somecountries on the continent. There can be no question at all: if a country believes that it is in its ownlonger-term interests to enter, it will look for a time which it feels to be opportune. That is no morethan an act of human reason.I would only like to point out that what we have here is a case of the debate being weighted somewhatdifferently. And, naturally, one has to perceive the backdrop to this: in other words, the fact that thetie which is created is a permanent one. It is not least for this reason that it is right for the Britishgovernment, in particular, to place repeated stress on the subject of internal flexibility.I believe that there is unanimity in the debate both in the United Kingdom and in Germany thateconomic convergence does not imply uniformity.Firstly: it does not imply uniform structures. It is true that competition — precisely in a monetaryunion — exerts pressure to find efficient solutions, but they do not have to be the same everywhere.Even in monetary union, there will still be room for different economic traditions and styles.However, the competitiveness of all the participating economies must be ensured on an enduringbasis.Secondly: convergence does not imply uniform policies in all areas. On the contrary: a decentralisedmonetary union calls on national policy to exercise its own responsibility for maintaining competitiveeconomic structures. In key areas, too, powers can indeed remain with the nation states. Nevertheless,individual approaches, say in the area of taxes, must not lead to distortions on the markets.Thirdly: convergence least of all implies uniform living conditions or equal prosperity in all theparticipating countries and regions. It may very well be that the way in which the single market andthe single currency work will assist less well-developed regions that face up resolutely to competitionin catching up quickly and sustainably. But that must happen on the basis of competition. There canbe no a priori guarantee of that.IVLasting economic convergence based primarily on market forces is one fundamental precondition fora politically decentralised monetary union. The second fundamental precondition is that theparticipating countries agree binding rules for certain areas and are prepared to abide by them on anenduring basis. There are rules of this kind — in addition to the general rules for the single market —principally for budgetary policy, where it has a particular direct relevance to the financial markets.Some of the rules for budgetary policy are: Firstly, the central banks must not finance the budgets.Secondly, there is a no-bail-out clause. The Community is not liable for the commitments ofindividual member states. Thirdly, the governments have committed themselves to avoiding excessivedeficits and, where they exist, to reducing them immediately. Fourthly, in normal circumstances thedeficit should be close to balance.These rules are not undisputed. Some ask whether the no-bail-out clause is not sufficient. Is thereference to the inherent responsibility of national budgetary policy not enough on its own? In myview, these objections put matters too simply. Firstly, we do not know under what financial marketconditions a financial crisis in one EMU country might break out. (To be honest, I hope that issomething we shall never learn.) However, we can tell from the recent national financial crises inother regions that systemic risk can easily arise. Or, at least, the argument is advanced that there is thepossibility of systemic risk — and who would want to let it come to that? Of course, the markets areaware of that, too. For that reason, there is always likely to be a certain problem of credibility withregard to the no-bail-out clause.
BIS Review   67/19994Secondly, it is true that a single currency does not imply the same long-term interest rates for allissuers. Certainly not. The quality of the borrowers and liquidity aspects also play a role. But,naturally, the foreign exchange risk is shared equally by all the participating countries. For that reasonalone, there exists an interdependence among the participating countries. And there naturally alsoexists an interdependence in macroeconomic terms. If the budgets of individual participatingcountries — especially the large ones — have excessive recourse to the capital markets, this willobviously be a burden on the other countries. An excessive government deficit eats up private savings.That is a factor which uses up internal capital resources and/or has an impact on the euro’s externalrelations — quite apart from an overburdening of monetary policy as a result of an excessivelyexpansionary fiscal policy.For these reasons, there is undoubted justification not only for a no-bail-out clause but also fordefining limits for the national budget deficit and for the general government debt ratio. I wish thatthe national budgetary policymakers in the participating countries would perceive these rules notmerely as a constraint but also as an opportunity of pursuing a rational policy on a sustained basis.One thing is clear, of course: setting the rules is not enough. The rules also have to be accepted by thecountries involved. And they have to be enforced if the need arises. That is not an easy matter, as welearnt only last week in Brussels.VThe second area in which rules are set is within the framework of monetary policy. One of the keyelements of monetary union as provided for in the Maastricht Treaty is, without doubt, theindependence of the European Central Bank and of the participating national central banks: in otherwords, the independence of the Eurosystem. The economic rationale for a central bank which isindependent of the instructions and influence of political bodies is rooted in the finding that it isgenerally easier for such a central bank to keep the value of the currency stable on a lasting basis.That higher degree of monetary stability benefits the economy and society in various ways. Itincreases planning certainty in the economy, which fosters a culture of long-termism. It makes iteasier for enterprises to fund investment decisions in the longer term. That generally results in astronger long-term orientation in economic decision-making. Incidentally, that was one of the keyconsiderations when the new government gave greater autonomy to the Bank of England two yearsago. A stable currency is, at the same time, an element of social policy. It is often precisely those whoare not so well off in economic terms who find it difficult — or impossible — to protect themselvesagainst inflation. Finally, money which has a stable value is also a factor of political philosophy.Confidence in the currency is, to some extent, confidence in the state and its institutions. That is, atleast, the case in Germany; partly owing to our experience of galloping inflation in the first half ofthis century, but also partly on account of the ideas of economists such as Alfred Müller-Armack andLudwig Erhard, who introduced into German economic policy the leitmotif of the social marketeconomy, with a stable currency as one key element. This economic rationale has now resulted in atrend towards greater central bank independence outside of Europe as well. That is perhaps also onefactor — among others — which helps to explain the high degree of price stability that prevailsworldwide at present.One fundamental objection to central bank independence raises the question of democratic legitimacy.Is a central bank which is independent of political instructions and influence in keeping with ademocracy? I believe that there are two preconditions which have to be fulfilled for an independentcentral bank to be unquestionably compatible with a democratic system.Firstly: the assigning of independence and the mandate has to have been arrived at democratically: atthe least, by virtue of an implicit consensus and on an explicit foundation provided either by law, aconstitution or by a treaty — like that of Maastricht — to which the parliaments have given theirconsent.Secondly: the mandate of the independent central bank must be unambiguous. Political valuejudgements among various competing aims may be made only by those who have acquired directdemocratic legitimacy as a result of elections. It is precisely for that purpose that elections give a
5BIS Review   67/1999mandate. The decision-making body of an independent central bank, which is not elected directly,may not make any autonomous value judgements among various competing aims. An overridingobjective has to be specified in advance. That is precisely what the Maastricht Treaty does. Itspecifies the primary objective of price stability. Hence, the independent central bank remainsanchored in the democratic structure of the state.In my view, the limitedness of the central bank’s mandate is thus a corollary of its political,democratic and constitutional legitimacy. For that reason alone, I believe that broadening the mandatewould lead to problems for the European System of Central Banks. That applies, for example, to theidea of extending the scope of the central bank’s mandate beyond price stability to include growth andfull employment as additional objectives. That is quite apart from the fact that I do not perceive anytrade-off between those aims — at least in the longer term. Assigning other tasks can also causedifficulties for an independent central bank, however. Assigning sole responsibility for bankingsupervision or a lender-of-last-resort function, for instance, may give rise to difficulties. Such aplurality of mandates might give rise to a situation in which the independent ECB has to chooseamong different objectives, say between the objective of stable prices, on the one hand, and theconsolidation of individual financial institutions, on the other. Fundamentally, that would be apolitical value judgement. Therefore, caution — at least — should be exercised in terms of delegatingadditional tasks to the ECB.In addition to those two basic preconditions — the democratic assignment of tasks and anunambiguous mandate — tying the independent central bank into a democratic system naturallyrequires something more: it calls for transparency and accountability. Independent monetary policycannot and must not be remote from the general public.In saying that, it is essential to distinguish precisely what is meant by transparency. Does transparencymean full disclosure of the deliberations, arguments and motives behind a decision: in other words,transparency of the situation in which a decision is taken? Or does transparency principally aim atdisclosure of the process by which is a decision is made?In terms of the transparency of the overall situation in which a decision is taken, the ECB endeavoursto do this by a comprehensive disclosure of its judgements and the assessments which determine itsdecisions. Of course, I do not rule out the possibility of improvement in one respect or another. It isnot yet even six months that the ECB has borne responsibility for monetary policy. We are thereforeall still involved in a learning process. Incidentally, I personally would have nothing against alsoidentifying arguments pointing to a decision other than the one that was ultimately taken but whichhappened to be rejected after taking other arguments into account.Transparency concerning the internal process of consultation and decision-making is another matter,however. I regard that as problematic since it may ultimately imperil the efficiency of monetary policydecision-making. Why? Firstly, it puts the frankness and confidentiality of the discussion at risk. Itcan, at least, lead to confidential discussions being shifted to other circles. And that undermines theunity of the decision-making body. Secondly, it may endanger the credibility and standing ofindividual members, who are open to argument and, on account of new insights, may alter theirposition during the discussions. I therefore feel that this second approach to greater publictransparency is not without problems. And I also have doubts as to whether it really introduces moreclarity and calculability in monetary policy for the markets.I admit that my reservations also have to do with the idea that the decision-making body should have afeeling of collective responsibility. And that also includes the attempt to seek an internal consensusand demonstrate it externally. Now, it may be that some people find the desire to seek consensusstuffy and old-fashioned. In the final analysis, I believe it is not. Allow me to make a few remarks inthis connection: I come from a central bank which — together with its predecessor institution, theBank deutscher Länder — has been independent for over 50 years. During that period, it wasnecessary to fend off several attacks from the political field. In saying that, it has to be borne in mindthat a simple parliamentary majority would have sufficed for a legislative amendment to remove theBundesbank’s independence.
BIS Review   67/19996In situations of conflict, an independent central bank needs the support of as broad a segment ofpublic opinion as possible. That will also be the case for the ECB, even though its independence isanchored in the Maastricht Treaty. But to be given that support, a central bank needs more than just agood record over the longer term. What is also important is that it can demonstrate a minimum degreeof unanimity. That applies anyway in the event of a conflict. In that situation, if the central bank givesdisparate signals to the outside world, the general public does not know at all what it is actuallysupposed to be supporting. Admittedly, it is comparatively easy to create unanimity in the event of aconflict. But the central bank’s standing with the general public, which is intended to be a protectionin the event of a conflict — that is something which it has to have earned and built up beforehand.And it has that standing only if the general public is aware of what the central bank stands for. If thegeneral public asks what the bank’s standpoint is, it wants a clear-cut answer and not a responseenumerating the various possibilities of position 1, position 2, position 3, and so on. A central bankmust be identifiable by its basic stance. That can scarcely be achieved without a minimum ofcollective awareness.I fully understand the objection that this must not lead to individual responsibility becoming lost inthe decision-making bodies. There is something in that. I wish, however, that critics who have neverhad to withstand a serious attack on the independence of the central bank would have somewhat morerespect for the concepts of consensus and unanimity.VIFinally, allow me to indulge in a reflection of a fundamental nature. We are certainly all in agreementthat the euro has to be a success. And that is a permanent challenge. Whether the euro becomes asuccess story is something on which it is impossible to make a final judgement after less than sixmonths. The euro certainly has a great potential. Recent exchange rate movements have not alteredthat fact.Clearly, the decline in the euro’s external value over the last few days has not been good news. Weshall study developments carefully. Yesterday the Governing Council had a serious discussion onthat. We came to the following conclusion which was presented to the press after the meeting byPresident Duisenberg: “The euro is a currency firmly based on internal price stability and thereforehas a clear potential for a stronger external value. Since the start of Stage Three of EMU the euro hasbecome the second most important international currency in the world, and the policy of theEurosystem will safeguard its internal purchasing power, thereby also supporting the internationalrole of the euro.”But in making a reasonable assessment of the opportunities and risks inherent in the project ofmonetary union, we shall maintain a longer-term perspective. In the eyes of future generations, theultimate test of the success of monetary union will one day consist of three questions: Has monetaryunion been able to safeguard lasting monetary stability? Have the participating economies coped withthe conditions of monetary union? And: has the euro brought the people and peoples of Europe closertogether?The answers to those questions have a lot to do with convergence, although not only with economicconvergence in the narrow sense of parallel trends in the hard data on productivity, labour costs, orwhatever. It also has much to do with convergence in values, in beliefs and in aims. That is somethingwhich cannot be measured mathematically, but it is nevertheless important. I feel that it is preciselythis convergence in thinking which has increased over the past few years between the UnitedKingdom and Germany, with both sides having learnt from each other. That is not intended to be asixth test for your entry into monetary union, but no harm can come from it either.
1BIS Review  64/1999Mr Thiessen evaluates the performance of the Canadian economy at the end of the 20thcenturyAddress by the Governor of the Bank of Canada, Mr Gordon Thiessen, before the CanadaClub in London on 2 June 1999.As the curtain comes down on the twentieth century and we move on to the next millennium,it is difficult to resist the temptation to be both retrospective and prospective.Ask Canadians to think back and many will tell you that the economy and they, as individuals,have been through some difficult times.Those with longer memories, however, will recall the remarkably positive climate between theend of the Second World War and the early 1970s. Canada came out of the war with arelatively strong economy compared with the ravaged European countries. Moreover, therewere sizable and sustained gains in productivity through the 1950s and 1960s. These reflectedthe revolution in agriculture and the forced modernization and expansion of Canadian industryduring the war as well as the rapid changes in technology and industrial processes thatfollowed.All this led to a substantial rise in Canadian standards of living instead of the post-wardepression that many had feared. And despite the exodus of workers from agriculture, theoverall unemployment rate remained low. At the same time, rapid economic growth generatedrising tax revenues that governments could spend on an increasingly wider social safety netwithout taxpayers feeling much of a pinch.Compared with this post-war prosperity, our economic performance over the subsequentquarter century has been the source of some disappointment and concern.Various explanations have been advanced for this less-favourable record since the early1970s. There are four trends in particular that I would highlight in this regard: high inflation inthe 1970s and 1980s; large and rising fiscal deficits from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s; aslowdown in productivity growth; and a decline in the prices of primary commodities.Tonight, I propose to comment on these four trends and their effect on the economy over thepast 25 years. Much of the sense of economic disenchantment that Canadians have beenfeeling in the 1990s has been related to the difficult process of reversing these trends oradjusting to them. Fortunately, considerable progress has been made on several fronts. Hence,there are grounds for optimism regarding Canada’s economic future.The harmful effects of high inflationThe rate of inflation which, after getting through some of the post-war bottlenecks, averagedjust over 2 per cent in the period to 1972, more than tripled over the next two decades.This pickup in inflation was not a uniquely Canadian phenomenon. In many countries,monetary policy had become too expansionary during the late 1960s. This partly reflected amisconception among policy-makers that, by fine-tuning the economy and taking advantage of
BIS Review  64/19992a perceived trade-off between employment and inflation, overall economic well-being couldbe improved.One of the initial consequences of this accumulating worldwide monetary stimulus was asharp rise in the prices of oil and other primary products in the early 1970s. Countries, likeCanada, which are major producers of such commodities, experienced a surge in income andwealth. But they also faced strong demand pressures and rising inflation. In Canada, the surgein inflation was especially dramatic, reaching 12 per cent in 1974.Once inflation had risen to those levels, it was very difficult to reverse. With each passingyear, expectations of ongoing high inflation became increasingly entrenched.High inflation exacts a heavy toll on an economy by making the future particularly uncertain.Long-term financing becomes less available and more costly as interest rates go up because ofinflation and the higher risk premiums that lenders demand as compensation for the increaseduncertainty. Inflation diverts resources away from productive investments into speculativeventures in real estate and other financial assets. And in its interaction with the tax system,high inflation encourages businesses to increase debt. These are the very types of excesses thatlead to, and indeed aggravate, the economic busts that inevitably follow. During the 1970s and1980s, Canadians had first-hand experience with such complications.The impact of persistent government deficits and rising debtHigh inflation was also partly responsible for the move towards larger government deficits inCanada that began in the mid-1970s.Initially, inflation tended to generate increased revenues for governments, and this encouragedadditional spending. When the effects of inflation became more evident, however, publicpressure led to the indexation of the personal income tax system and the growth ingovernment revenues slowed. Unfortunately, this was not offset by a tighter grip on spending.For the government sector as a whole in Canada, on a national accounts basis, total programexpenditures (not counting debt-servicing costs), rose from 37 per cent of gross domesticproduct (GDP) in 1975 to a peak of 43 per cent in 1992 (a year of recession). Over the sameperiod, the budget deficit more than tripled to 8 per cent of GDP. And the ratio of outstandingnet debt-to-GDP soared from less than 10 per cent to 60 per cent, and by the mid-1990s it hadclimbed to 70 per cent.Increasingly, through the late 1980s and early 1990s, the growth in government spendingraised concerns about whether this represented the most efficient use of the economy’sresources.From a policy perspective, the greatest concern was that persistent large deficits were pushingCanada’s debt-to-GDP ratio to unsustainable levels and driving up risk premiums in ourinterest rates.The economic costs of Canada’s rising indebtedness became very clear after 1991, when ourinflation rate came down quickly, but medium- and longer-term interest rates were slow torespond. One important reason for that was the persistence of high risk premiums because of
3BIS Review  64/1999fears that governments might be tempted to reduce the debt burden through inflation – ineffect, by printing more money. Canada’s vulnerability to such concerns became particularlyevident during the Mexican currency crisis.High interest rates meant that we had to pay more of our income to foreign holders of ourpublic and private sector debt. This made us poorer as a nation. And these high ratesdiscouraged investment which, to some extent, relates to the third “disappointing” trend of thepast quarter century – the slowdown in productivity growth.The slowdown in productivity growthProductivity has been at the centre of many public discussions in Canada recently. For goodreason, too, since productivity is critically important to growing incomes and rising standardsof living over time.Unfortunately, such discussions are complicated by the fact that there is more than onemeasure of productivity, and there often seems to be some difficulty in distinguishing betweenthe growth and the level of productivity. Things become even more complicated as one getsinto cross-country comparisons.After a strong showing from the end of the Second World War to the early 1970s, ourproductivity growth became lacklustre. Output per worker slowed from an average rate ofabout 3 per cent in the 1950s and 1960s to 1 per cent in the 1980s and 1990s.Productivity growth also slowed in other industrial countries, including the United States,over this period. Indeed, average gains in labour productivity in the Canadian and U.S.business sectors have been roughly similar in the past 25 years. This means that the gap inproductivity levels in favour of the United States has not really widened; but neither has itnarrowed. Moreover, growth in U.S. productivity seems to have picked up strongly in the lastyear or so.I do not have a complete explanation for the productivity slowdown in Canada. But I amprepared to assert that high inflation and the large fiscal deficits through most of the past 25years were not conducive to productivity growth. They led to high interest rates andconsiderable uncertainty about the future – both of which discourage the investment intechnology and new equipment that helps to advance productivity increases.Declining primary commodity pricesThe final factor on my list is the decline in the prices of the key primary commodities thatCanada produces.Calculated from the early 1970s to the present, this decline amounts to some 45 per cent whenthe international prices of these commodities in U.S. dollars are adjusted for the increase inthe general price level during this period. A drop of that magnitude in the prices of some ofCanada’s major exports is bound to have a significant effect on our standard of living.To look at the past 25 years in isolation, however, tends to magnify the extent of the declineand leaves one with an exaggerated sense of the associated economic consequences. This is
BIS Review  64/19994because commodity prices jumped to historical peaks at the beginning of the period, inresponse to the worldwide monetary stimulus that I mentioned, and remained generally highfor nearly a decade or so, before reversing.To put things in perspective, we need to focus on the longer-run behaviour of commodityprices. For only then does it become clear that these prices were exceptionally high throughthe first decade of this 25-year period, and that a good part of the subsequent downwardmovement represented a return to more “normal” levels. Indeed, between the late 1960s andthe late 1980s, the level of inflation-adjusted commodity prices showed little change overall.We should also keep in mind that part of the decline in commodity prices has reflected newdiscoveries of raw materials, more efficient ways of extraction, and reduced production costs.Otherwise, we would have seen a much larger reduction in the importance of commodities,and in the profits and share prices of Canadian resource industries.When one allows for some of these factors, the downward movement in commodity prices inthe past 25 years is not as dramatic as it appears at first. But I can certainly appreciate that thesharp drop in these prices in 1997-98, associated with the Asian financial crisis, has had anespecially strong impact on many Canadians’ sense of well-being. Adjusted for inflation,commodity prices hit a new post-war low during this period and led to a substantialdepreciation of our currency.What does the future hold?So far, I have argued that high inflation, large government deficits, slower productivitygrowth, and lower commodity prices have tended to complicate Canada’s economic situationover the past 25 years. But as I said at the beginning, much of the greater sense of difficultyand concern that Canadians have felt in the 1990s has to do with the after-effects of the strongmedicine we have had to take to turn our economic performance around. The success we havehad so far in this regard bodes well for our future.Canada’s inflation rate has come down dramatically, averaging less than 2 per cent since1992. And there are now agreed targets between the Bank of Canada and the Government ofCanada to keep inflation low and stable in the future. More importantly, Canadians have cometo expect continued low inflation and to build that expectation into their plans.The federal government and most provincial governments now have balanced budgets or arerunning surpluses. The total government debt-to-GDP ratio, which peaked at 70 per cent in1996, has since fallen to 63 per cent. With present prudent fiscal policies, it should continue todecline steadily.Future gains in productivity are difficult to predict. Certainly, our improved inflation andfiscal situation, together with the low interest rates that they have made possible, provide thebest climate for fostering productivity that we have had in a long time. Moreover, Canadianbusinesses have undergone major restructuring during the 1990s in response to increasinglycompetitive world markets. Business investment has been rising smartly recently and morefirms have been adopting new production technologies.
5BIS Review  64/1999It is also interesting to note that, after eight years of economic expansion, productivity growthin the United States has picked up, rather than falling off as usually happens at this stage ofthe cycle. Tight labour markets seem to have encouraged a record level of investment in thatcountry and more efficient use of technology than before. While the pickup in Canadianinvestment in machinery and equipment has lagged somewhat behind that in the UnitedStates, new technology is not the exclusive preserve of our U.S. neighbours. So I hope that inCanada, too, we will see a similar payoff from the adoption of new technology and acomparable improvement in productivity.As for commodity prices, there has already been some turnaround this year, but a firmerrecovery requires a strengthening world economy – in particular, a turnaround in Japan andthe rest of Asia.The other point to note in this connection is that the relative importance of commodities in theCanadian economy has declined. The share of primary products in total Canadian exports hasfallen from about 60 per cent in the 1970s and 1980s to about half as much presently.I should also add that our flexible exchange rate system has been playing the role that itshould in helping us adjust to lower commodity prices. The decline in the value of theCanadian dollar in 1997-98 was mainly a response to the impact of the Asian crisis oncommodity prices. A weaker currency has helped to cushion the negative effect on ourresource sector. But, more importantly, it has helped to stimulate demand for other Canadianexports and import substitutes, particularly of manufactured goods. In turn, this is encouraginga shift in production from commodities towards other tradable goods.While I believe that this shift is exactly right for the Canadian economy, I do not agree withsome recent suggestions that we should somehow force the pace of the movement out ofprimary products and into the so-called more modern, knowledge-based industries. Ifcommodity prices do not recover from their current low levels and profits are squeezed as aresult, this will happen naturally. But for now, primary products are still an important sourceof Canada’s wealth and high standard of living, and they are likely to remain so for some time.To conclude, the past 25 years have not been easy. And they have been less prosperous overallthan many Canadians had come to expect, based on the experience of the 1950s and 1960s.But, as we stand on the threshold of the next century, we can take comfort from theremarkable progress we have made recently in strengthening the foundations of our economy.This gives me reason to be positive about our capacity to improve our economic performanceand to meet tomorrow’s challenges with confidence.
1BIS Review   63/1999Mr Duisenberg outlines the future development of the financial sector in the euro areaSpeech by Willem F Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, at the XXIVth IOSCOAnnual Conference in Lisbon on 25 May 1999.IntroductionThe euro area constitutes a large economy, of a size comparable to that of the United States. Thatfact alone places the euro and the euro area financial system firmly “centre stage” in the globaleconomy. Consequently, it is essential for the euro area financial system to be stable and efficient,not only for the benefit of the euro area economy itself, but also for the world economy.The introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999 had a profound impact on financial systems bothwithin and outside the euro area. Part of this impact was immediately evident in the rapidintegration of money markets and the replacement of national currencies by the euro in foreignexchange markets. The fact that the changeover to the euro progressed smoothly is a reassuringindication that the euro area financial system is able to remain stable during times of structuralchange.However, a further part of the impact on financial systems – most likely the greater part – will beexperienced over a longer period of time. The euro is likely to become one of the major factorsreshaping both the domestic financial system of the euro area and the global financial system.This process should lead to a more efficient allocation of finance within the global economy, butit will also call for the ability to adjust to structural changes in order for stable financial systemsto be maintained.Today, I should like to outline the likely future development of the financial sector and of thefinancial markets in the euro area as envisaged by the European Central Bank (ECB). To this end,I shall first briefly discuss the impact of the introduction of the euro on domestic money markets.I shall then turn my attention to likely developments in the financial markets and in the bankingsystem, before concluding with some remarks on how these likely developments might affect thestability and efficiency of the financial system in the euro area.Impact of the introduction of the euro on money marketsUntil the end of 1998 the various money markets of the euro area still displayed a certain numberof distinctive features. However, following the changeover to the euro they were integratedswiftly and smoothly at the beginning of January 1999.A highly competitive single money market has already emerged in the euro area, as banks werewell prepared for the changeover to the euro and the TARGET system has provided an efficientmeans of making cross-border payments. In particular, transaction volumes in money marketsrapidly reached high levels while typical bid/ask spreads decreased almost immediately to verylow levels. This indicates the depth and high degree of liquidity that the euro money market hasalready achieved. A feature of the current stage of the development of the euro money market,which is particularly worthy of note, is that differences in overnight interest rate spreads mainlyreflect differences in the credit standing of banks rather than that of the country in which thetransaction takes place.
BIS Review   63/19992These structural developments are, of course, positive. For the Eurosystem (i.e. the ECB and thenational central banks of the 11 countries participating in the euro area) the existence of a deepand liquid money market enhances the efficiency of monetary policy operations. In this respect, Ishould like to draw your attention to the “market friendliness” of the framework applied by theEurosystem to the conduct of monetary policy operations. By this I mean that the framework isbased on tenders in which markets decide who receives the liquidity. The standing facilities areopen and recourse to the marginal lending facility is not subject to scrutiny. In addition, the list ofeligible collateral is extensive.Prospects for the development of financial markets in the euro areaLooking now at the financial markets from a broader perspective, it is important to remember thatthe financial markets of the euro area began the process of integration before the start of StageThree of Economic and Monetary Union. An indication of the pace of integration before January1999 is provided in particular by the evolution of spreads between yields on the bonds issued bythe various central governments of the euro area. These spreads narrowed continuously from mid-1995 onwards and their volatility was also noticeably reduced during this period. Factorscontributing to this favourable pattern included increased convergence towards low rates ofinflation across the euro area during Stage Two, the gradual reduction and finally thedisappearance of exchange rate risks, the commitment of governments towards improving thesustainability of public finances, and the increase in the depth and liquidity of government bondmarkets.As I have already said on a previous occasion, I believe that the interest rate markets of the euroarea will increasingly provide an accurate reflection of the differences in credit quality betweenvarious issuers as well as differences in liquidity between bonds, while divergences purely relatedto the location of market participants within the euro area will become less and less relevant.It seems highly likely that the capital markets of the euro area will become even deeper and moreliquid over time, and hence more efficient. The number of market participants is likely to increaseas the cost of financial market transactions is lowered, and the sophistication of position-takingactivities is likely to increase further as market participants equip themselves with more refinedmethods of adjusting their portfolio exposures.One particular area of the capital market in which the markets in euro area countries havetraditionally been a lot less active than in the United States is the corporate bond and commercialpaper market. However, there are good reasons to expect that corporate bond and commercialpaper issuance in the euro area will gather pace in the future. During the first few months of thisyear we have already seen a fair amount of activity in this field.For large companies in particular, it makes sense from the point of view of efficiency to have allthe methods of financing at their disposal, namely bond and paper financing, bank loans andequity financing. Indeed, since the credit ratings of many large companies are better than thecredit ratings of most banks, this should lead to savings on the cost of capital for the corporatesector. The introduction of the euro should provide sufficient depth and liquidity for the corporatedebt market that would guarantee competitive pricing.On the demand side, the reduced borrowing of the public sector will leave more room for theprivate sector to issue debt securities. As you know, the amount of public debt in the euro area isstill high, and we trust that governments will keep their commitment to bring it down to moresustainable levels as agreed in the Stability and Growth Pact. In addition, the euro area has to save
3BIS Review   63/1999in order to be able to take care of its future pension payments, and a part of these savings is likelyto be invested in corporate debt securities. An increase in global demand for euro-denominateddebt securities is also expected as the euro becomes a major reserve currency. Moreover, thedemand for higher-risk euro-denominated debt securities is likely to increase, particularly as thecurrent low level of sovereign yields increases incentives to search for higher yields.Turning to equity markets, and first to the institutional set-up of stock exchanges, an evolutiontowards more integration and greater market efficiency is already apparent. As consolidationwithin the financial services sector has increased the size and geographical reach ofintermediaries and fund management institutions, they seem to be pressing for market-places tobecome more concentrated in order both to reduce costs and to enhance liquidity. In addition,some companies have recently announced that they are reviewing their listing practices with theaim of reducing costs by cutting back on the number of exchanges in which they are listed.However, this development towards greater concentration does not necessarily mean that tradingis concentrated only in a few exchanges. A possible pattern of development could also be fordifferent stock exchanges to concentrate on specific types of companies (“blue-chips”, specialisedindustries, small companies and new companies, for example). In any case, the physical locationof stock exchanges is becoming less relevant as screen-based trading with remote access isbecoming more widely used.With regard to investor behaviour, an increasing number of equity market investors alreadyappear to be taking positions on the equity market of the euro area from a sectoral rather than anational perspective. Area-wide equity indices have been made available by various marketparticipants, thus providing investors with opportunities to monitor area-wide equity positions aswell as, in some instances, positions in area-wide industrial sectors.The fact that the euro area (and EU) equity markets are becoming more integrated, more liquidand deeper is good for market efficiency, and a more efficient allocation of capital should meanthat equity financing becomes more readily available for companies.I should also like to mention that a prudent, harmonised regulatory framework, on the one hand,and harmonised market practices, on the other, are key factors guaranteeing a favourable outcomefor these structural changes. In these areas a lot of work is under way, and much has still to beachieved in order to pave the way for truly integrated financial markets. Harmonisation in, forexample, repurchase agreements, national company laws including bankruptcy laws, and otheraspects of the legal and regulatory framework, would enhance legal clarity and certainty andthereby improve the efficiency and stability of the financial markets.Indeed, the European Commission recently published an Action Plan containing priorities andtimetables for measures aimed at improving the single market for financial services. In the ActionPlan, measures are proposed to advance the harmonisation of the legal framework and marketinformation, as well as to facilitate investors’ operations throughout the single market.In this respect, I should also like to pay tribute to the International Organization of SecuritiesCommissions (IOSCO) for its efforts. Although I have focused mainly on the financial system ofthe euro area, we can clearly see that the euro area financial system is an integral part of theglobal financial system. With this in mind, I should like to express my support for the aims ofIOSCO to promote high standards of regulation in order to maintain just, efficient and soundmarkets.
BIS Review   63/19994Prospects for the development of banking systems in the euro areaTurning now to likely developments in the banking system, it is important to note that the euroarea financial systems in general and the banking sector in particular have, until now, beenrelatively national and fragmented with little cross-border retail activity. However, it is envisagedthat the euro will add weight to a number of fundamental factors that are increasing the pressurefor structural change. With these structural changes I mean not only consolidation, which seemsinevitable, but also increased cross-border co-operation and mergers. In short, the euro areabanking sector is expected in the future to look and behave more like the banking sector of asingle economy.In addition to and reinforced by the introduction of the euro, other factors that are leading tochanges in the financial landscape include technological development, globalisation and changesin what consumers and firms expect from the financial system and financial service providers.These factors are reshaping the business of banking as well as the financial system as a whole.Economies of scale and scope may have been changing in different areas of banking and eventaking different directions. For example, the rapid development of information technology hasmade the collection and processing of information considerably cheaper, but at the same timetechnological investments are taking a larger share of banks’ resources. Therefore, economies ofscale in some aspects of the collection of information may have been reduced, but at the same thetime investments in more sophisticated technology have increased economies of scale and scopein some areas of banking. While I do not wish to go into detail on this matter, the general picturethat emerges is that the banking industry has to be in a position to adjust to a new situation andtake these factors into consideration.Indeed, in the course of the last few months, a number of bank mergers in the euro area, includingmergers between relatively large institutions, have been announced or are being contemplated.Such “high-profile” mergers are likely to contribute to an acceleration of the pace of both theconsolidation and integration of the banking systems of the euro area.However, it should be remembered that the recent pattern of consolidation represents part of alonger-term trend in the European banking industry, as is highlighted by the large decline in thenumber of credit institutions in the euro area countries over the past decade or so. In the mid-1980s there were more than 11,000 credit institutions in the euro area countries; today theynumber around 8,000. This sharp decline in the number of credit institutions is mainly the resultof mergers among savings and co-operative banks, which epitomise what one may call“consolidating” or “defensive” mergers – mainly aimed at cutting costs and diversifying risks butalso at reaching a size of own funds compatible with a regulation that has been agreed at the EUlevel.So far, this consolidation process has taken place mainly within national boundaries, with thepossible exception of the Benelux and Nordic countries. The preference for domestic mergers (asopposed to cross-border mergers) may be explained by the fact that the relevant market for retailservices remains national rather than pan-European. Furthermore, the scope for cost-cuttingappears to be larger if the merging institutions have overlapping operations. The fact that cultural“proximity”, notably in the corporate style of governance and management, is traditionally seenas a key factor in the success of mergers may also have played a role. However, from my ownprofessional experience of running a truly pan-European bank, I could add that professionalidentity is a much stronger force for unity than national identity is a force for separation.Conclusion
5BIS Review   63/1999I have outlined the likely pattern of evolution that we envisage for the euro area financial system.Summing up the various elements, we see a pattern which leads towards a financial system thatshould perform its functions more efficiently using the advantages available to the financialsystem of a large economy. A large financial system can be more readily versatile, i.e. provideinvestors and those in need of financing with a full range of options to choose from according totheir requirements.What does all of this mean for financial stability in the euro area?First of all, I should like to remind you that the financial system of the euro area showed a highdegree of stability during last year’s period of financial turbulence as well as during the ratherdramatic structural shift connected to the changeover to the euro. In the former case, it is true thatthere was a significant spillover effect for the euro area markets, but they recovered quickly andwithout suffering any lasting damage. There was no disruption to any of the basic functions of thefinancial system, and public confidence in it remained strong throughout.Second, the foreseen structural changes require, as I mentioned earlier, the need for adjustment tobe taken seriously by all participants in the financial system. This adjustment appears to haveintensified recently: there has been an increase in merger activity, an establishment of alliancesand an introduction of new products and services, often based on modern information technology.The process of structural change contains risks, but if these risks are identified early and analysedcarefully, they do not present a threat to financial stability. After all, we are talking aboutdecision-making and planning by people who are dealing with risks every day at the highestprofessional level. In this regard, the smooth changeover of the financial system to the eurodemonstrates the virtues of efficient and careful forward planning.Third, I do not view efficiency and stability of the financial system as being contradictory. Inmany ways these qualities actually support each other by laying a firm foundation for thefinancial system. An inefficient financial system, in addition to being costly to society, can bemore vulnerable to shocks.At the ECB, we play our part in the evolution of the euro area financial system by providing itwith stable monetary conditions. By creating an environment of price stability, we allow privatesector agents to focus their attention on the questions that are most relevant to their activities andto take advantage of the benefits of this stable environment, such as the lengthening of theirplanning horizons.
1BIS Review   62/1999Mr Reddy discusses monetary policy in IndiaSpeech by Y.V. Reddy, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the Fourth SecuritiesIndustry Summit, in Mumbai, India on 26 May 1999.Chairman and friends,I thank the organisers for inviting me to deliver the inaugural address at the Fourth Annual SecuritiesIndustry Summit. Although the discussions in this Summit will specifically veer around the securitiesmarket, monetary policy strongly influences the working of the financial markets. As a central banker,I will, therefore, speak on monetary policy making, which I trust will provide some perspectives to thedeliberations at the Summit.ObjectivesIn India, monetary policy has always emphasised the objectives of price stability and growth. Whatthis, in effect, has meant in practical policy setting is, formulating a balance between the twoobjectives depending on the evolving situation but within the broad context of keeping the inflationrate within a reasonable bound.Apart from these two important goals, there has been a conscious attempt on the part of the ReserveBank in recent years to maintain orderly conditions in the foreign exchange market, and to curbdestabilising and self-fulfilling speculative activities. This has assumed strategic importance for thesustainability of the external sector in the face of growing cross border capital flows into theeconomy. With the increasing order of domestic and international financial integration, exchange rateexpectations do impact on the domestic stance of monetary policy and hence the significance ofinflation. In the transitional phase, however, given the exchange market imperfections, the exchangerate objective may occasionally predominate due to emphasis on avoidance of undue volatility. Infact, sometimes, as was the case recently, it could be the most dominant reason for short-termmonetary policy adjustments.In a broader framework, the objectives of monetary policy in India continue to be price stability andgrowth. These are pursued inter alia through ensuring credit availability, with stability in the externalvalue of the rupee as well as overall financial stability, all being reflective of pursuit of the overallobjectives. The relative emphasis among the objectives is governed by the prevailing circumstances.TargetsThe conduct of monetary policy in India has traditionally proceeded with the help of an intermediatetarget, which the central bank could influence directly and which bears a reasonably close relationshipwith the ultimate objectives. The particular mode of central bank intervention is the operatinginstrument. Macro-economic variables, which post useful information about the objectives ofmonetary policy, although they may not in themselves be amenable to central bank targeting, are‘indicators’ or ‘information’ variables.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) sets indicative broad money (M3) expansion targets in line with theexpected rate of growth of GDP and a tolerable level of inflation. Consistent with the targeted level ofbroad money expansion, is a desired level of reserve money expansion. The order of the reservemoney expansion, however, has to be consistent with the likely fiscal and external payments position,since the main sources of reserve money expansion are net RBI credit to government and net foreignexchange assets. The targeted M3 expansion is publicly announced through the Governor’s statementon monetary and credit policy. The broad money target is also supported by a number of other
BIS Review   62/19992indicators such as movement in interest rates, exchange rate and availability of credit to productivesectors of the economy.Monetary target is premised on a stable demand function for money. In the Indian context, a numberof earlier studies on the demand for money have demonstrated that it is stable. Dr.Rangarajandemonstrated that money demand equations provide reasonable predictions of average changes inprices over a medium-term horizon of 4-5 years, though not necessarily on a year-to-year basis. Inessence, the concern was with the long-run stability of the money demand function in terms of itsmost proximate determinant, i.e. real GDP, rather than its short-term behaviour. Most recent studies inRBI examined the stability of the money demand equation using a number of alternative procedures.While these tests showed parameter shifts, they did not point to parameter instability. In the 1990s,the monetary targets were set either as point targets or in a narrow range implying scope for missingpoint targets, but it has to be recognised that a wider range would question the credibility, diluting thevery objective of targeting.The pressures on monetary expansion in the earlier part of targeting exercise emanated frommonetisation of fiscal deficit and later on from capital inflows. During the period 1985-92, net RBIcredit to Central Government accounted for over 96 per cent of the monetary base, which was reducedto about 65 per cent in the subsequent period during 1993-98, with corresponding increase in netforeign exchange assets of the RBI.Although the practice of automatic monetisation of the budgetary deficit was done away with,effective from April 1997, it can significantly reduce the pressure on monetisation only if the size ofthe Central Government’s market borrowing programme is kept within reasonable limits. However,there is a qualitative difference, since the RBI has some flexibility now in respect of the extent of itssupport to Government borrowing programme.With increasing market orientation of the financial structure and international capital flows, monetarypolicy responds to developments on an ongoing basis. In an administered interest rate and exchangerate regime, the quantity variables dominated and transmitted monetary policy impulses. However,external and financial sector reforms have since enhanced the sensitiveness of quantity variables totheir market determined price, i.e. interest rate and exchange rate.It must be recognised that in recent times, the emphasis has also been on closely monitoring differentindicators apart from relying on the intermediate target. For aiming at the intermediate target (viz.,broad money) the underlying operating target is reserve money, particularly the banks’ reserves, whilethe supplementary operating target is the short-term interest rate proxied generally by the overnightcall money rates.Operating Procedures and InstrumentsThe reforms in the monetary and financial sectors have enabled the RBI to expand the array ofinstruments at its command. As already mentioned, the operational target of monetary policycontinues to be banks’ reserves which is controlled by changes in reserve requirements effectedmainly through the instruments of cash reserve ratio (CRR). However, the use of CRR as aninstrument of monetary control is sought to be de-emphasised and the liquidity management in thesystem is increasingly undertaken through open market operations (OMO), both outright and repos.In view of the overall downward movement in CRR, except on occasions of exchange rate volatility,the excess liquidity in the system is mopped up by outright sales of government securities by RBI.Over the reform period, the market absorption of government securities was facilitated by reforms inthe government securities market, which ensured market related rates of interest and thus some of thebasic conditions were provided for developing a secondary market.
3BIS Review   62/1999The short-term liquidity management is also aided by conduct of repos on a regular basis. Usually, theRBI conducts repos for a maturity of up to 14 days, which is the cycle for reserve requirements.Recently, the RBI has been conducting 3-4 day fixed rate repos to absorb very short-term liquidity andto even out money market rates, especially overnight call money rates. The repo rates and the amountstendered in the repo auctions, apart from reflecting liquidity conditions, provide a floor for theovernight call money rates. In the event of tight liquidity conditions, the RBI’ s liquidity support toprimary dealers (PDs) enables it to directly intervene in the market, thereby moderating pressures onthe overnight call money rates.The RBI also reactivated the Bank Rate in April 1997 as a reference rate and as a signalling device toreflect the stance of monetary policy. The interest rates on different type accommodation from theRBI including refinance are linked to the Bank Rate. The activation of the Bank Rate endowed theRBI with an additional instrument. It must be noted that the announcement impact of Bank Ratechanges has been pronounced on the prime lending rates of commercial banks.The refinance window of the RBI provides an additional instrument for influencing reserves. Untilrecently, the RBI provided two types of refinance facilities to banks - export credit refinance andgeneral refinance. While the former facility is formula based and is extended to banks against theiroutstanding export credit eligible for refinance, the latter facility was provided to enable banks to tideover their temporary liquidity shortages.The general refinance window has since been replaced by a Collateralised Lending Facility (CLF)within the overall framework of an Interim Liquidity Adjustment Facility (ILAF).Currently, the liquidity management at the short end is in the form of ILAF. Liquidity is injected bythe RBI through CLF to banks, export credit refinance to banks, and liquidity support to PDs. Allthese facilities are available subject to quantitative limits [formula-based] for specified duration and atthe Bank Rate. Additional limits could be availed by banks under Additional Collateralised LendingFacility (ACLF) and by PDs at two percentage points above the Bank Rate. Absorption of liquiditywill continue to be through fixed rate repo i.e., at repo rate announced on a day to day basis. These aresupplemented by OMO in Government dated securities and Treasury Bills by the RBI. OMO involvedecisions by the RBI on a daily basis or even intra-day basis in regard to the quantities and the cut-offyields at which the dated securities and Treasury Bills are operated upon. It may be noted that theseoperations are in the given framework of the CRR that directly affects liquidity and the Bank Rate.Often, the periodic Treasury bill auctions by RBI, themselves provide opportunities for the RBI tosignal its overall stance on the appropriateness of interest rate and liquidity.Thus, the ILAF provides a mechanism by which liquidity would be injected at various interest rates,and absorbed when necessary at the fixed repo rate, so that the volatility in the money market isminimised and the market operates within a reasonable range.At present, there is no formal corridor for market interest rates, but the Bank Rate often has providedan upper bound and the fixed repo rate provided the lower bound. In a sense, an informal corridorexists for short-term interest rates and the introduction of ILAF has facilitated the evolution of thiscorridor.The experience with the movements in the interest rates and exchange rate in the last two years hasincreasingly reflected the integration among various market segments. The interest rates of majormarket instruments [91-day and 364-day Treasury Bills, Commercial Paper and Certificate ofDeposit] in recent period show some correlation with reasonable speed of adjustment, which augerswell for some element of targeting of interest rates in the conduct of monetary policy.Dilemmas
BIS Review   62/19994Monetary management poses dilemmas not only at the analytical level but also at the operationallevel. In fact, some of these dilemmas have been articulated in the recent policy statements ofGovernor Bimal Jalan.First, the basic dilemma arises out of the trade off between growth and inflation. Although aconsensus has emerged on the basis of empirical evidence that in the long run there is no trade offbetween employment and inflation, it is the inconclusive evidence in the short-run that poses achallenge for monetary management. Given the deleterious effects of inflation on distribution ofincome, there is an imperative need in developing countries to keep the inflation rate as low aspossible. In the last year’s Economic Survey, it was stated that “As world inflation rates are currentlyof the order of 0 to 3 percent, 4 to 6 percent inflation rate could be regarded as an acceptable level forIndia at present.” This order of inflation has been, it may be noted, built into the monetary operatingframework of the RBI.Secondly, even a moderate inflation rate poses a dilemma in an open economy. If the domesticinflation rate of an economy, however low it may be, is higher than the average inflation rate of itstrading partners, it puts pressure on the exchange rate. In this context, the question of simultaneousbalance of the internal and external sectors becomes a major issue.Thirdly, in a dynamic setting, when the financial markets are continually evolving, and paymentsystems and technology are changing, one may not find a clear cut evidence of stability in the moneydemand, which is taken as a basis for intermediate targeting; and in such circumstances, one needs tolook also at other relevant indicators. It is not that such dilemmas are specific to us and by and large,countries follow a menu approach or a ‘check list’ to track a number of relevant variables.Fourthly, the dilemma that the central bank faces as a manager of public debt and the monetaryauthority is well known. While the former may require keeping its cost low, the latter may demand areduction in the extent of government debt that it holds, considering the impact it has on aggregateexpenditures and thus on demand. The market-borrowing programme of the government is determinedby the fiscal parameters, but the size of the government debt impacts on the interest rates in theeconomy and it should be clearly recognised that there is a limit to the extent of market borrowingthat the central bank can support. These dilemmas can be resolved through proper fiscal monetary co-ordination.Fifthly, the conflict between roles of the regulator/supervisor and as a conductor of the monetarypolicy has often been discussed. This is illustrated by the case of a central bank, as a monetaryauthority, which may require to reduce the liquidity in the system by raising the rate of interest. But,such a rise in the rate of interest could be detrimental to the interests of the weak banks. Similarly,while tightening prudential norms, the central bank has to take into account its impact on bankingsystems’ capacity to intermediate credit.Finally, in an open economy, the potential conflict between the interest rate and exchange rateobjectives could arise when short-term and volatile capital flows occur. For example, the bouts ofvolatility in exchange rate experienced by us recently necessitated that market conditions are renderedless liquid even if it meant that the interest rates are kept high. This policy has implications forpromoting domestic output growth in that the interest rates may for this purpose, be required to bekept at moderate levels. But the larger objectives of evading the likely potential disruption ofdomestic activities arising out of an exchange rate crisis should also be kept in view.ConclusionAs part of financial sector reforms, a number of steps have been taken to enhance the effectiveness ofmonetary policy, and these include, improvement in the payments and settlement systems,development of secondary market in government securities with a diversification of investor base,
5BIS Review   62/1999reduction in non-performing assets, introduction of ALM guidelines, and reduction in the overalltransactions costs. In particular, the recent initiatives of RBI to develop money market and debtmarkets should contribute to improving the transmission mechanisms of monetary policy.All the reforms in the monetary and financial sectors may not have the desired results withoutcredible fiscal adjustment. Notwithstanding the discontinuation of automatic monetisation of fiscaldeficit, the responsibility for management of a large government borrowing programme doescircumscribe the manoeuvrability of monetary policy.
1BIS Review   61/1999Mr Thiessen’s statement on the Bank of Canada’s Monetary Policy ReportOpening statement of the Governor of the Bank of Canada, Mr Gordon Thiessen, before theStanding Committee on Finance of the House of Commons on 26 May 1999.It is always a pleasure to appear before your Committee following the publication of ourMonetary Policy Report. We released our ninth Report last Wednesday. The Bank of Canadabegan publishing these Reports on a semiannual basis four years ago, as part of our effort toincrease the transparency and accountability of the Bank’s conduct of monetary policy.The main focus of every Monetary Policy Report is how well Canada is doing in managinginflation. But controlling inflation is not an end in itself. The objective of monetary policy isto help create and maintain a monetary climate that favours good economic performance, aneconomy where growth and employment are strong and Canadians feel prosperous. The Bankfeels strongly that the best thing that monetary policy can do to help long-term growth in theeconomy is to preserve low and stable inflation. Indeed, I believe the low and stable inflationrate we have had in Canada in recent years has helped us through some difficult times.However, I am also happy to report that the global financial system is much more stable thanit was at the time of my last appearance before you six months ago. The shock from thefinancial crisis in Southeast Asia, which began almost two years ago, was compounded lastAugust by Russia’s default on its external debt. The turbulence that followed has now largelysubsided and investor confidence is being restored. As a result, the outlook for the worldeconomy has become more positive than it was last November.Financial markets have steadied in Southeast Asia, and prospects are good for a gradualrecovery there. In Brazil the authorities have taken major steps to address their difficulties.Overall, global financial markets now seem better able to assess risk. Interest rate cuts bycentral banks in all major countries have helped restore investor confidence.Most importantly for Canada, the US economy has continued to outperform expectations withstrong growth and, as yet, no definitive sign of inflation pressure. Nonetheless, there is still afair degree of uncertainty about the overall external environment, given the divergentperformance of the major economies. Japan is still in recession and Europe has been slowingdown. Because of this, we are expecting only a slow recovery in world commodity prices thisyear.In Canada, the recent driving force in our economy has been exports. The strong demand inthe US economy, the relatively weak Canadian dollar and increasingly competitive Canadianmanufacturers are allowing us to sell into the United States very successfully.What we are expecting to see now, however, is an increase here at home in consumer andbusiness spending. We believe that the improvement in business and consumer confidencethat we have seen in the last few months, the better employment picture and recent reductionsin interest rates will all help support domestic spending.To be more specific, compared with six months ago, we at the Bank have raised ourprojection for growth in the economy in 1999 to between 2¾ and 3¾ per cent. We have such awide range because of the international uncertainties that I mentioned a moment ago. The highend of this range is well above the latest consensus among private sector forecasters. If the
BIS Review   61/19992economy does grow at the higher end of this range, it is likely to be because of strongerexports and more substitutions of Canadian goods for imports due to Canada’s good price andcost performance. Our economy should continue to expand next year at a broadly similarpace.On the basis of these growth forecasts, we would expect the trend of inflation to rise modestlyover the next 18 months but remain in the lower half of the Bank’s 1 to 3 per cent target rangefor inflation. There is an increasing level of confidence, both at home and abroad, thatCanada’s inflation will remain stable.Another source of uncertainty for the Bank at the present time is in estimating the margin ofunused capacity in the economy. If economic activity expands as forecast, the traditional wayof measuring these things tells us that the current margin of economic slack should be takenup in the second half of next year. However, the economy seems to have undergone somesignificant changes during the 1990s, and the traditional estimates of slack may no longer beaccurate. As a result, the Bank will be placing increased weight on a range of indicators toassess the degree of pressure on the economy’s production capacity. What we have in mindare such things as movements in inflation relative to expectations, growth of money andcredit, wage pressures, evidence of supply bottlenecks and the information provided to ourregional representatives from their business contacts.We will not know just how much the Canadian economy has changed until its capacity limitscome under more pressure. While the confidence of Canadians in ongoing low inflationallows monetary policy more room to accommodate demand pressures that test the limits ofcapacity, it will be very important for the Bank to be vigilant in following the array ofindicators I have mentioned. We must not undermine the solid basis of low inflation and lowinterest rates that has been established in Canada.
1BIS Review   60/1999Mr Noyer reviews first experiences with the euroSpeech delivered by the Vice-President of the European Central Bank, Mr Christian Noyer, atthe conference organised by Swedback in Stockholm on 26 May 1999.I should like to start by thanking you for your kind invitation to speak here on the occasion ofthis conference organised by Swedbank. It is some five months now since the euro waslaunched. The introduction of the euro has been accomplished successfully and the enormoustechnical and logistical challenges arising during the early days of monetary union have beenovercome. The first months of the euro have been successful in both political and operationalterms. With the introduction of the euro, European integration has taken a large step forwardas the new millennium approaches.The euro plays an important role in the euro area and beyond. Just after its launch in January,the euro already featured on all major financial markets around the globe. Currency trading isregularly carried out in euro and shares are denominated in euro on most European stockexchanges. Moreover, the euro has attracted new international bond issues as the currency ofdenomination. In some ways, the introduction of the euro may justify expectations of largeoverall efficiency gains. For citizens living in the euro area, two obvious gains will be thereduction of transaction costs and increased transparency across countries, as pricecomparisons between goods sold in different countries are made easier.The Governing Council of the ECB is the central decision-making body in charge of monetarypolicy for the euro area. The Treaty on European Union – the Maastricht Treaty – assigns theESCB the primary objective of maintaining price stability in the euro area. Theimplementation of monetary policy decisions taken centrally by the Governing Council restswith the Eurosystem, comprising the ECB and the national central banks (NCBs) of themember states which have adopted the euro in stage three of economic and monetary union.The respective operational tasks are to a large extent carried out in a decentralised manner bythe NCBs.For the euro to become a success story as the single currency for around 300 million people,the confidence of European citizens in the stability of the new currency and in the Eurosystemis crucial. You would probably agree that the Eurosystem has already achieved a lot in termsof building up credibility and gaining a sound reputation in financial markets for its monetarypolicy in its early days. This will certainly facilitate the establishment of a stability culturethroughout Europe. The foundation of this stability culture is a broad consensus amongEuropeans that the maintenance of price stability is of the utmost importance and is conduciveto the achievement of other objectives such as high employment.Monetary policy and other policy areasBy maintaining price stability in the euro area, we will ensure that the single monetary policycontributes as much as possible to economic growth and high employment. At the same time,national fiscal authorities and general economic policies also have to demonstrate theircommitment to the maintenance of price stability in the euro area. In this context, the Stabilityand Growth Pact adopted in 1997 is a crucial element. Its aim is to encourage the pursuit ofdisciplined and sustainable fiscal policies for the participating member states and prospectivemembers. In so doing, it can make a significant contribution to the establishment offavourable conditions for sustained economic growth and high employment in the medium
BIS Review   60/19992term. Moreover, sound fiscal policies facilitate the task of monetary policy to maintain pricestability. It would be counterproductive if national fiscal policymakers were not to continue towork towards a budgetary situation which is close to balance or in surplus in the light of theachievement of monetary union and the positive price outlook for the euro area.In this connection please allow me to briefly address the matter of calls for closer coordinationbetween monetary policy and fiscal policies. Any form of ex ante coordination that, forexample, would commit the monetary policy of the ECB to move its interest rates in a certainway in response to specific action or plans of other policymakers would provide the wrongimpetus for the conduct of sound macroeconomic policies and would not be efficient. Thisdoes not, however, exclude a constructive dialogue between the Eurosystem and governmentauthorities which clearly respects the independence of the ECB.In line with its clear mandate, enshrined in the Treaty establishing the European Communities,and for sound economic reasons, the ECB has to decide which monetary policy best serves themaintenance of price stability over the medium term and then act accordingly. At the sametime, the Treaty also emphasises the need for sound fiscal policies. This clear separation ofresponsibilities is both efficient and transparent. Obviously, monetary policy alone cannotsolve Europe’s economic problems such as the present intolerably high level ofunemployment. Appropriate structural reforms implemented by national governments are ofthe utmost importance and much progress is required in this broad area. Moderate wagesettlements in both the public and private sectors would, of course, contribute to reducing thehigh level of unemployment in many parts of the euro area. In this context, let me remark thatrecent wage agreements in some parts of the euro area do not appear to be in line with theneed to encourage higher employment.The Eurosystem’s monetary policy strategyWith regard to the Eurosystem’s monetary policy strategy, I should like to emphasise that theeuro area monetary policy is a single one and therefore indivisible – by definition. Monetarypolicy decisions must be based on area-wide rather than national considerations and hence onarea-wide indicators. Monetary policy has to be transparent so as to stabilise publicexpectations of future price developments. In order to clarify how we interpret the mandateconferred on the ECB by the Treaty, the Governing Council has announced a quantitativedefinition of its primary objective.Price stability has been defined as a year-on-year increase in the harmonised index ofconsumer prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%. This has to be maintained over themedium term. As the wording ‘increase’ makes clear, deflation – that is, a persistent fall in theprice level – would not be consistent with price stability. It would not be possible for us toannounce where exactly we would draw the dividing line between price stability anddeflation. This is partly for reasons that have been described as the measurement bias inconsumer price indices. For the United States it was estimated that measured consumer pricestend to slightly overestimate actual inflation. A bias may also exist for the euro area HICP,although its exact magnitude is as yet unknown and needs to be explored further.To maintain price stability, the Governing Council has chosen a stability-oriented monetarypolicy strategy. The chosen strategy is forward-looking in nature and also ensures as muchcontinuity as possible with the former strategies of the NCBs. In this respect and with regardto the overriding objective to maintain price stability in an environment of flexible exchange
3BIS Review   60/1999rates, our strategy is broadly similar to that of Sveriges Riksbank, although there are importantdifferences. In particular, the Riksbank follows a direct inflation targeting strategy in whichmonetary policy is almost exclusively guided by inflation forecasts of about two years ahead.In contrast, the Eurosystem relies on two pillars, thereby focusing on the medium term, anddoes not give such a predominant role to inflation forecasts as the Riksbank.In our view, the Riksbank has achieved high standards with regard to transparency andaccountability, as is for example evidenced by its comprehensive quarterly inflation report. Inmore recent years, the Riksbank has enjoyed a fair measure of success in gaining control overdomestic price developments, as supported by its strong performance in fighting inflation, andin overcoming a deep recession in the early 1990s. Its track record also demonstrates thatprice stability in Sweden was given a high priority long before this was formally recognisedby an amendment to the Riksbank Act at the start of 1999.The Eurosystem’s stability-oriented monetary policy strategy rests on two pillars, which areboth important when the Governing Council discusses monetary, financial and economicdevelopments at its biweekly meetings. The first pillar, which is a prominent role for money,takes into account the essentially monetary origins of inflation over the medium to long term.It recognises that empirical studies show a stable long-term relationship between money andprices in the euro area. Therefore, in the euro area, monetary developments constitute animportant guide for the conduct of monetary policy and it is essential to analyse and monitorthe development of monetary aggregates closely. The ECB has announced a quantitativereference value for broad monetary growth as measured by M3, the first reference value forM3 growth being set at an annual rate of 4.5%. This reference value is consistent with themaintenance of price stability over the medium term, while allowing for sustainable outputgrowth and assuming a trend decline in the velocity of circulation of M3. In setting thereference value for monetary growth, the Governing Council emphasised its medium-termorientation. Substantial or prolonged deviations of current monetary growth from thereference value will normally signal risks to price stability in the medium term.The ECB does not intend to react to deviations of monetary growth from the reference valuein a mechanistic way. In the first instance, such deviations are analysed thoroughly to inferany signals which they may give about the prospects for price developments. If the deviationpoints to a threat to price stability, monetary policy has to react in a manner appropriate tocounter this threat.Although monetary data contain information which is important for monetary policy decision-making, monetary developments alone clearly do not constitute a complete summary of all theeconomic information necessary for appropriate policy decisions to be taken. Thus theGoverning Council emphasises that it is important, in parallel with the assessment ofmonetary growth, to look at a wide range of financial and other economic indicators,including economic forecasts. The second pillar of the Eurosystem’s strategy thereforeconsists of a broadly based assessment of the outlook for price developments and the risks toprice stability in the euro area as a whole. This broadly based assessment takes into account,inter alia, the information provided by wage developments, exchange rates, fiscal indicators,real economic activity, and asset and commodity prices. Forecasts of economic activity andprices in the euro area can certainly also contribute to the success of an appropriately forward-looking monetary policy. Thus we take into account forecasts available from internationalorganisations such as the IMF and the OECD as well as internal forecasts.
BIS Review   60/19994We are aware that forecasts have to be interpreted with great caution. Given behavioural,institutional and structural uncertainties, forecasting price and other developments in the euroarea is inevitably difficult. Moreover, a forecast cannot encompass all the indicator variablesthat are important for monetary policy. Nor can it always incorporate indicators in a timelymanner. Furthermore, by the time the forecast has been finalised, the original assumptionsmay have become less realistic, requiring a careful interpretation of the results. Therefore, athorough analysis of individual indicator variables plays an important role in our monetarypolicy strategy, in addition to any role that these variables may have in the forecast.Within the stability-oriented monetary policy strategy, the Eurosystem also takes into accountthe external value of the euro as an important determinant of the outlook for price stability. Ifexchange rate developments pose a significant threat to price stability in the euro area, allother things being equal, monetary policy will have to respond. Of course, all other factorsthat impart information on price developments will also be taken into account before aninterest rate decision is taken.Monetary policy decisions and the outlook for price stabilityIn December 1998 the Governing Council announced that the interest rate on the mainrefinancing operation would be 3%. In the first quarter of 1999 the Governing Council keptthis rate unchanged. After an in-depth review of recent monetary, financial and economicdevelopments, the Governing Council decided at its meeting on 8 April to set the interest ratefor the ECB’s main refinancing operations at 2.5%. In addition, the interest rate on themarginal lending facility was lowered to 3.5% and the interest rate on the deposit facility to1.5%. These rates were left unchanged at the meeting of the Governing Council last week.The decision to lower interest rates taken at the first meeting in April has to be seen in thecontext of the stability-oriented strategy. The decision has thus been taken from a forward-looking perspective, focusing on the medium-term trends in inflation and the compatibility ofthese trends with the Eurosystem’s definition of price stability. By adhering to this strategy,the Eurosystem’s monetary policy contributes to creating the economic conditions which areessential to exploiting the considerable growth potential of the euro area and to reducinguncertainty about future economic developments.I should like to take this opportunity to explain the current assessment, which is in line withthe Governing Council’s expectations at the beginning of April. With regard to the first pillarof the Eurosystem’s monetary policy strategy, monetary growth cannot be seen as signallingupcoming inflationary pressures at this stage. Since the beginning of this year, the three-monthmoving average of M3 growth has been close to the reference value of 4.5%. For the periodfrom January to March 1999 the average growth rate increased somewhat to 5.2%. Thisobservation may, however, have been affected by special factors prevailing at the start of stagethree. Therefore, in its current assessment the Governing Council does not regard currentmonetary trends as constituting a signal of future inflationary pressures.With regard to the second pillar of the Eurosystem’s monetary policy strategy, the broadlybased outlook for price developments and risks to price stability and various indicators offuture price developments and economic activity in the euro area indicate a favourableoutlook for price stability. Financial indicators such as the very low level of long-term interestrates point to low inflation expectations and the credibility of monetary policy. Following thecut in short-term interest rates, long-term rates decreased somewhat initially, which confirmsthat the market considered the cut in interest rates by the ECB to be appropriate. More
5BIS Review   60/1999recently these rates have risen somewhat, mainly as a reflex to the strong increase in long-term interest rates in the United States.Regarding economic activity in the euro area, data available for the first two months of 1999do not yet reveal evidence of a rebound in economic growth. Labour market indicators showsigns of a somewhat decelerating level of employment growth towards the end of 1998.Meanwhile, preliminary April figures from the European Commission on confidenceindicators point towards some first signs of an improvement in industrial confidence.Recent price trends have been consistent with price stability. Inflation for the euro area asmeasured by the harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP) has been close to 1% since thefourth quarter of 1998. As has been emphasised on previous occasions, the current lowinflation rates are to some extent the reflection of the large fall in energy prices during 1998.HICP data for March 1999 show an annual increase of 1%. The slight increase relative toJanuary and February reflects the fact that goods prices are subject to some upward movementin the short term owing to the reversal in energy price trends expected by the GoverningCouncil at the beginning of April. However, the effects of changes in energy prices on rates ofHICP increase may only be of a temporary nature. More lasting effects on future consumerprices normally come from changes in the overall monetary and economic situation.To sum up, weighing all the relevant indicators and adopting a forward-looking and medium-term perspective, the Governing Council regards the current level of ECB interest rates asappropriate with a view to maintaining the outlook for continued price stability.Aspects of the Eurosystem’s communication policyThe Treaty acknowledges that it is important in a democratic constitution for an independentcentral bank to be open, transparent and clear about the reasoning underlying its actions.Therefore, a number of reporting obligations exist for the ECB which aim at making the ECBaccountable for its performance. Moreover, by communicating clearly with the public, theEurosystem reinforces its credibility. In this regard, the Eurosystem’s approach bearscomparison with the best practices of any other central bank.In practice the ECB has committed itself to exceeding the stringent requirements of the Treatyconcerning transparency and accountability. For example, the ECB releases each month abulletin providing detailed background information regarding the current assessment of theeconomic outlook. At the same time, with the more extended editions of the bulletin inMarch, June, September and December, we fulfil the Treaty requirement to publish a quarterlyreport. For the benefit of the general public, the ECB issues regular press releases and anintroductory statement by the President, which is released immediately after the firstGoverning Council meeting each month. Furthermore, the ECB submits an annual report onits activities to the European Community institutions (the Council of the European Union, theEuropean Commission and the European Parliament).With regard to the Eurosystem’s relationship with European Community institutions, theTreaty states that the President of the ECOFIN Council and a member of the EuropeanCommission may participate in the meetings of the Governing Council of the ECB, with theright to express their views but without voting power. The President of the ECB attendshearings at the European Parliament at least four times a year to discuss the activities of theEurosystem and is also invited to attend the informal euro-11 Council meetings. I should like
BIS Review   60/19996to stress that the participation of the President in these meetings serves the purpose ofexchanging information and views, while fully respecting the independence of theEurosystem.In the field of the international representation of the ECB, formal and informal agreementshave been reached with the IMF and the OECD and in the context of the G7 and the G10. Atthe end of last year the IMF granted the ECB observer status, full membership being restrictedto individual nations. Nevertheless, this observer status will allow the ECB to participate inthe relevant work and assessments by the IMF of economic policies in the euro area andbeyond.The international role of the euroClearly, the introduction of the euro has had important implications for international capitalmarkets. This has been the case not just because a number of currencies replaced by the europlayed an important international role in the past but also because the euro has become thecurrency of an economic area which roughly equals the United States in terms of economicsize and external trade, and which has the world’s second largest capital markets.Let me emphasise at this juncture that the Eurosystem has no exchange rate target vis-à-visother major currencies. We are also not participating in a formal exchange rate arrangementwith third countries outside the EU, for instance with the United States, and we believe thatthis situation will continue in the future. It is important to mention that according to the Treatythe single exchange rate policy has to respect the primary objective of price stability.As the representative of a large economic area, the Eurosystem can best meet its overridingobjective to maintain price stability in the euro area if it is not constrained by an exchange ratetarget. However, for smaller, very open economies, setting an exchange rate target may be avery reasonable decision. Against this background the ERM II exchange rate mechanism wascreated for those member states which have not yet joined monetary union but are willing todo so in the near future. Experience with the European Monetary System (EMS), thepredecessor of ERM II, has shown that participation in a system of this kind may facilitate thefulfilment of other convergence criteria. The new exchange rate mechanism may play asimilar role. In this context, we should certainly wish to acknowledge the efforts whichSweden is making to achieve sustainable convergence with the euro area. We hope that thesuccess of the euro in its early months will help to convince the Swedish population of thebenefits of early participation in monetary union. Clearly, a decision to join ERM II would beimportant for fulfilling the convergence criterion of exchange rate stability and would help tosmooth the transition to participation in the euro area.In recent months the external value of the euro has been influenced by the market view of theeconomic developments in the euro area relative to the United States. More recently otherfactors had an impact on the exchange rate of the euro vis-à-vis the dollar, in particular theconflict in Kosovo. From the beginning of the year to mid-May, the euro weakened against thedollar by about 10%. In nominal terms, measured against a trade-weighted basket of thecurrencies of the 15 most important trading partners of the euro area, the euro has weakenedsignificantly less, i.e. by about 6% since its launch. However, rather than focusing on veryshort-term developments, one should look at long-term evolution. In that respect, it has to beobserved that the current exchange rate of the euro against the dollar is not so very differentfrom the levels observed in the first three quarters of 1998.
7BIS Review   60/1999Clearly, some variability is typical for the bilateral exchange rate vis-à-vis the US dollar.Market expectations about future cyclical developments and the course of monetary and fiscalpolicy in the United States and Europe play a role in explaining exchange rate volatility. It iswidely recognised that in the medium to long term exchange rates follow a path determined byfundamental factors such as price and economic developments. In this context, it should bepointed out that recent exchange rate developments have as yet not indicated any risk forfuture price stability. Moreover, internal price stability should serve as an anchor for thedevelopment of the euro’s external value in the medium term. Indeed, a stability-orientedmonetary policy strategy protecting the purchasing power of the euro is the basis of a solidand stable currency over the medium term.Maintaining price stability in the euro area also promotes credibility and thereby enhances theinternational role of the euro. The Eurosystem neither promotes nor hinders the developmentof the euro as an international currency. We consider that the international role of the euroshould develop through the interaction of market forces. As yet it is too early to predict howlong it will take for the euro to be considered as a truly international currency similar to theUS dollar.Clearly, the disappearance of 11 national currencies and the introduction of the euro as amajor international currency had an immediate impact on the turnover and focus of attentionin the global foreign exchange markets. This has been reflected, for example, in rather activeand liquid euro/dollar trading in the foreign exchange market since the launch of the newcurrency. However, there are also indications that the euro has further potential to grow inother markets as the surprisingly slow development of euro/yen trading suggests.The euro can also be expected to become an attractive currency for the investment of officialreserves.One of the key elements to further international portfolio diversification in favour of the eurois the creation of a large, liquid and integrated capital market in Europe that began with thelaunch of the euro. For short-term instruments, we are now dealing with a broad and liquidEuropean money market that ensures very similar short-term interest rates for comparableinstruments and credit risks. The development of this market has been strengthened by theEurosystem’s operational framework of open market operations, which is mainly based onreverse transactions, and the implementation of the new TARGET real-time gross settlementsystem in participating countries. At the longer end of the maturity spectrum, marketintegration was jumpstarted by the redenomination of outstanding government debt in euroand by the convergence of interest rates to narrower spreads following the elimination of theexchange rate risk. The elimination of this main risk will also foster the development ofuniform market standards so that government bonds in the euro area will become rather closesubstitutes, creating a large and liquid bond market. Obviously, this requires sound andsustainable budgetary policies that ensure that credit risk spreads remain small.Concluding remarksFollowing a remarkable period of disinflation in most member states, the Eurosystem has hadthe good fortune to commence its operations in an environment of price stability. The successenjoyed by the euro in its first five months can be certainly attributed to a number of factors.Above all, the successful efforts of member states made possible a smooth changeover to theeuro. The independence of the ECB and the clear mandate to maintain price stability were
BIS Review   60/19998crucial for ensuring a high degree of credibility of the Eurosystem’s monetary policy. As afinal observation, I should simply like to mention that without the positive echo of financialmarkets and the permanent support of banks and financial institutions, a single currency inEurope could not have become a reality.
1BIS Review   59/1999Mr Bergström reports on why Sweden has changed its stabilisation policy regimeSpeech by Mr Villy Bergström, a Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, the central bank ofSweden, at the 140th anniversary of the establishment of Norrbärke Sparbank in Smedjebacken,Darlana on 21 May 1999.It is obvious to everyone that we live in a different economic world than we did ten years ago. Tenyears ago, registered unemployment was 1.3 per cent and inflation 7 per cent. Now inflation is non-existent while total registered unemployment is over nine per cent.Why has such a drastic change in the economy taken place?What is characteristic for the new economic conditions?Are there alternatives to the policies now being carried out?BackgroundSince the second war, Sweden, in principle, had a fixed exchange rate. However, in practice, it wasnot particularly fixed after the mid-1970s. From autumn 1976 to autumn 1982, Sweden devalued fivetimes.I will come back to the sorry history of 1982-92.In autumn 1992, the fixed exchange rate was abandoned and the krona immediately fell by 11.5 percent. Thereafter the krona declined further so that the total fall in the exchange rate to the lowestposition of 13 December 1993, was 31.5 per cent.Note that the starting point for the fall in the value of the krona in November 1992 was a cost levelthat was 25 per cent lower, measured in common currency, than it had been in 1976.This was a failure for stabilisation policy. A good illustration of this is the industrial worker’s wage in1975 and 1994. In 1975, an industrial worker earned 27 kronor per hour on average while in 1994 thehourly wage was SEK 95.However, if 1975’s hourly wage is recalculated at the 1994 price level, the 1975 wage was worth SEK107 in 1994. Thus, twenty years of trade union struggle when nominal wages rose by an average of6.9 per cent per year, resulted in a decline in real wages of 12 kronor per hour in 1994’s prices.However, it was not just trade union policy that failed. It was just as much a failure for theGovernment’s stabilisation policy.How could it have been so bad?Stabilisation policy activismThe large devaluation of 16 per cent that the newly-appointed Palme Government carried out inOctober 1982 was what could be called an offensive (aggressive) devaluation, on top of that that hadtaken place in 1981. Through the 10 per cent devaluation in 1981, the real cost situation had beensomewhat normalised and the competitiveness of Swedish industry restored.Now Sweden was to get off to a flying start. This was also the case as there was an upswing in theUSA at that time and an exceptional long boom.
BIS Review   59/19992The Social Democratic government considered that their relations with the trade union movementwere so good that the Government would be able to cope with the devaluation, and carry out thenecessary “aftercare” to prevent the benefits of devaluation being eaten up by wage and priceinflation. Sweden would “save and work its way out of the crisis” as the social-democratic crisisprogramme put it in the 1982 election campaign.However, between 1982 and 1992, the hourly cost of labour for an industrial worker rose in roundfigures by between 8 and 11 per cent per year. Inflationary expectations were clearly well rooted inthe labour market and the aftercare of devaluation was a failure.The effects of the rapid rise in costs were softened first by the size of the devaluation and then by thefall in value of the dollar, which de facto depreciated the Swedish krona between 1985 and 1987 asthe krona was partly linked to the dollar.What did the Government do then to stabilise wage and price movements after 1982?It is possible to make a list of the Government’s attempts to stabilise wage increases, a list that takesup measures in a corporative spirit, the idea that the social-democratic government could make astabilisation of prices possible by working closely together with the trade unions.1.In spring 1983, the Government launched an inflation norm of 4 per cent for 1984. Theoutcome was 8 per cent.2.In spring 1984, a crisis package was presented with a price freeze and a rent freeze and anorm of 3 per cent inflation in 1985. The outcome was over 7 per cent.3.In 1984, the so-called foreign loan norm was launched, namely that the state should notborrow abroad to finance the current trade balance deficit.4.In 1985 a tax-based income policy was introduced. State income tax was to be reduced bySEK 2 billion if the Swedish Metalworkers Union and the Swedish Engineering EmployersAssociation concluded an agreement with wage rises of at most 5 per cent.5.In 1982, 1984, 1985 and 1986 negotiations took place after discussions on taxes andcollective agreements between the Government and various constellations of labour marketorganisations.Some of these measures were inspired by the so-called norm debate. This was to establish firm normsin economic policy. In order to stabilise inflation at a low level. The most important norm wasnaturally the fixed exchange rate although the Government had regularly accommodated to counteractthe problems that arose when the fixed exchange rate led to unemployment and falling profits.The industrial sector was very competitive for a long time although public expenditure rose at a rapidrate as well. This led to the labour market overheating. As I mentioned, registered unemployment wasdown to 1.3 per cent in 1989 and 1.5 per cent in 1990. Unemployment in Mälardalen (the regionaround Lake Mälare) was 0.5 per cent.It is evident that no wage formation system can operate under such conditions. The labour marketresearcher (Bertil Holmlund in Uppsala) argued at that time that NAIRU – the unemploymentconsistent with constant inflation was between 2.5 and 3 per cent, which today appears to be verylow.The stabilisation policy problems accumulated towards the end of the 1980s. The Governmentencountered a crisis situation in 1990 and introduced a prohibition on strikes, a number of freezessuch as a wages freeze, a rent freeze, a freeze of local government tax increases among others. TheGovernment announced that Sweden was to apply for membership of the EU. On 15 February, theGovernment lost a vote in the Riksdag on the prohibition against strikes. Kjell-Olof Feldt resigned(the Minister of Finance).
3BIS Review   59/1999It can probably be said that the events of autumn 1990 were the last of the old stabilisation policyinterventionist kind. The “corporative” co-operation policy had failed. The fact that the end of theroad was reached in February 1990 was actually a result of the Government’s own actions in the latterhalf of the 1980s and its inability to restrict demand.The credit market had been successively deregulated during the 1980s. Foreign exchange regulationbegan to be dismantled in 1986 and was completely abolished in summer 1989.Foreign exchange policy formally changed course when the krona was linked to the ECU at Whitsun1991. It was an important signal to the foreign exchange market that the change, which was expected,took place without a depreciation of the krona. On the contrary, the krona was linked to the ECU at arate somewhat above the central exchange rate.A number of measures had preceded a formal change of the stabilisation policy. The most importantdocument that marks a new direction is the Government’s budget statement in January 1991. TheMinister of Finance and the Government wrote there that combating inflation was to be givenprecedence over other political goals.This decision was reflected in the budget by a 40 per cent reduction of appropriations for relief work.In spring 1993, unemployment rose month by month and it was clear that the Government was notgiving priority to full employment in the same way as before.This was the first major change of course in stabilisation policy.  Now it was combating inflation thatwas important by means of a fixed exchange rate. The change was well prepared by experiences ofprevious failures and by the intellectual debate on stabilisation policy that had begun in the USAduring the 1970s.From the beginning of 1991, a price stability goal was applied. This was given priority over fullemployment. The means was a fixed exchange rate. Employers and trade unions would be forced tobear the consequences of excesses in wage formation. The exchange rate was to be maintained. So, ifwage costs rose over the room created by the growth of productivity and price rises on theinternational markets, unemployment would be allowed to rise. The state would no longeraccommodate economic disruptions neither by devaluations nor by public expenditure.I do not need to go into more detail about the period from January 1991 to November 1992. A fixedexchange rate and free capital movements are hardly compatible. I can only draw to attention howsuch regimes have collapsed. Scandinavia and the United Kingdom in autumn 1992, the EU’s ERMsystem in 1993, Mexico in 1994-95, South-East Asia in 1997, Russia in 1998 and Brazil in 1999.With free capital movements, it is necessary to choose between a floating exchange rate and aninflation target (or a target for the quantity of money). The only alternatives would seem to be anirrevocable linking of the currency by a “currency board arrangement” or a fully implementedmonetary union.In January 1993, the Riksbank announced an inflation target of 2 per cent inflation – 1 per cent. Thetarget was to be achieved in 1995.This was the second major realignment of stabilisation policy. Sweden went in for an inflation targetand a floating exchange rate. This had been forced on Sweden by international developments withderegulation of the capital markets, in Sweden as well, and not least by failures in attempts atcorporative co-operation and stabilisation policy interventions. The Government could now look backat 15 years of unsuccessful stabilisation policy. The shift to a new policy took place between 1993and 1995.
BIS Review   59/19994However, it should be added with regard to the failed defence of the krona, that experiences of freecapital movements were not especially extensive. The Government and the Riksbank and politicalanalysts in Sweden did not have any experience of the conditions for economic policy in a globalisedworld.The new stabilisation policy regimeThe Government formulated the goal for monetary policy itself in January 1993. Inflation was to bemaintained at two per cent per year with a tolerance interval of +/- 1 per cent. The goal is symmetric.It is as important to bring inflation up to two per cent when actual inflation is under two per cent as itis to bring down inflation when it is higher than the target.This can be said but a lot of practical issues remained to be resolved and the answers are not at allobvious:1. How is inflation to be measured: by CPI, the GDP deflator, or some other measure of pricemovements?2. Shall the Riksbank have other objectives besides price stability?3. Shall policies be directed at controlling the money supply or inflation directly?4. How is confidence to be established in the Riksbank’s policy and expectations about low inflation?1. The inflation targetThe Riksbank’s objectives has been expressed in the following way in legislation:“The objective of the Riksbank’s operations shall be to maintain price stability.In addition, the Riksbank shall promote a safe and efficient payment system.”The first objective has therefore been made concrete by the Riksbank itself as 2 per cent inflation witha tolerance of one per cent upwards or downwards.The second objective, stability in the payment system requires monitoring of the “infrastructure” inthe payment system and of the major institutions that could be associated with a systemic risk for thebanking system. The second objective is hardly known although important and it will also continue tobe the Riksbank’s responsibility if Sweden joins the monetary union, the EMU.The Riksbank has opted to measure inflation by the consumer price index, CPI. This measure hascertain disadvantages, although it has the great advantage of being known and spread among thegeneral public. “Inflation” is understood by the general public as a slow rise in CPI.The disadvantages with CPI are that the measure itself is affected by the policy carried out by theRiksbank. If inflation is low and risks turning into deflation, the economy needs to be stimulated. TheRiksbank then reduces the instrumental rate to increase activity and capacity utilisation in theeconomy.However, the first thing that happens is that inflation is further reduced or even becomes deflation asinterest rates fall and housing costs become lower. These are namely included in CPI. Only after somedelay is there an effect on the level of activity and inflation in the right direction. This can lead tomisjudged policies.Another example of problems with CPI is as follows: If the Government tightens fiscal policy with aVAT increase, CPI rises, as VAT has a direct effect on inflation measured in this way. The effects of
5BIS Review   59/1999such measures, interest rate changes and tax changes are temporary. These normally result in one-offeffects on the price level.However, it cannot always be right to tighten monetary policy and increase the interest rate becauseinflation has been increased by a VAT increase which in time will dampen demand and lower thelevel of activity and capacity utilisation. In time, inflation will be dampened by the VAT increase,although this takes place by means of an increase in prices – bear in mind though that this depends oninflationary expectations not being affected. A different situation arises then.This shows that CPI movements must be interpreted and analysed when deciding on monetary policy.Temporary effects on the price level should not initiate changes in monetary policy. The Riksbank istherefore studying a number of other indexes that do not have the weaknesses of CPI in the aspectstaken up here.A harmonised index, HICP, is being designed for the entire EU area. This is used by the EuropeanCentral Bank, ECB, and this measure does not include interest rate changes, although it does includeindirect taxes and subsidies.Another index, UNDIX, measures the “underlying” inflation by excluding the direct effects ofindirect taxes, as well as interest effects.By studying such indexes and comparing with CPI, the Riksbank can obtain a view of the temporaryeffects of economic policy that should not lead to monetary policy changes.However, this means that the Riksbank should be able to say in advance that inflation will deviatefrom the two per cent target due to such temporary effects that I have spoken about.2. Should the Riksbank have other objectives besides inflation?As regards stabilisation policy, the Riksbank has one task by law, namely to strive for a stable pricelevel, that the Riksbank interprets as two per cent inflation. The Bank does not aim at constant pricesprimarily because prices and especially wages display inertia in a downward direction. It wouldtherefore be difficult to change relative prices and relative wages if the price level was constant onaverage. The Riksbank would also be forced to carry out a deflationary policy on repeated occasions,if constant prices were the objective.Moreover, we know that quality improvements, which are reflected in rising prices, are not measuredin a correct way by different price indexes. A particular (low) measured inflation can in factcorrespond to price stability, if consideration is taken to technical development continually improvingthe quality of goods and services.Monetary policy operates with a considerable lag. The current view is that a monetary policy changehas its maximum effect six to eight quarters afterwards. This involves a considerable difficulty withrespect to carrying out monetary policy as well as evaluating the policy carried out.Monetary policy must therefore be elaborated taking into consideration a view of inflation over a oneor two year period. Therefore, the Riksbank makes inflation forecasts for this time period at regularintervals. Monetary policy is therefore controlled by an intermediate goal, namely the inflationforecasts.It would be unreasonable to try to immediately bring back inflation to two per cent if inflation washigher. It would require a dramatic reduction of capacity utilisation and a deterioration of thesituation on the labour market.
BIS Review   59/19996The Riksbank therefore weighs in the situation on the labour market and the real activity in itsassessments. In the short run, there is a trade-off between stability of the inflation rate and stability inthe real economy. An unremitting stabilisation of the rate of inflation very narrowly around two percent would at times lead to real economic instability.Precisely for this reason, the target horizon is set at between one and two years, during which time theRiksbank endeavours to gradually meet the inflation target, by steering inflation towards two per cent,guided by the inflation forecasts, which have been made for this period.In the long run, however, there is no trade-off between inflation and employment. A low, stableinflation provides the prerequisites for fast growth and high employment, according to experiencesfrom earlier periods, such as the first two decades after the war. We are now seeing a developmentthat seems to confirm this hypothesis.It can therefore be said that employment and capacity utilisation directly affect the Government’smonetary policy to the extent that compliance with the inflation target only takes place graduallywithin a period of two years. This is to avoid too great fluctuations in the real economy – inemployment and capacity utilisation otherwise.However, unemployment and capacity utilisation affect inflation and are therefore included ascomponents of inflation forecasts. These circumstances therefore also play an indirect role for theRiksbank’s monetary policy.The exchange rate is not an objective for Riksbank policy although it also has a direct and indirecteffect on inflation.An appreciation of the exchange rate will have, all other things being equal, an immediatelydampening effect on import prices. As import prices are included in CPI, inflation will be reduced.The exchange rate will affect inflation indirectly by affecting demand. A higher real exchange ratereduces exports and thereby reduces the level of activity with some time lag. This indirect effect tendsto reduce inflation in the somewhat longer run.Supply is also affected by the exchange rate in time by (initially) affecting import and export prices,which eventually spreads to other prices and wages.By the direct and indirect effect of the exchange rate on inflation, the exchange rate plays a role forthe Riksbank’s policy in those cases when a change in the exchange rate is expected to be, or provesto be durable.The Riksbank is also studying various measures for changes in the quantity of money as well as banklending. These quantities also have varying degrees of co-variation with inflation, but with a ratherlong time-lag.Altogether, it can be said that capacity utilisation, inflation expectations, and the exchange rate are themost important determining factors underlying inflation forecasts.What has been said summarises the main content of the stabilisation policy regime that wasestablished after 1992. On 1 January 1999, the Riksbank was made formally autonomous of politicalinfluence and has since then been governed by an executive board of six members.
7BIS Review   59/19993. Shall policy control the quantity of money or inflation directly?Some central banks, previously the German Bundesbank and now the European Central Bank, ECB,have an (unclear) quantity of money target for their policy. These banks endeavour to meet theinflation target by trying to control the expansion of the quantity of money.In fact, there are considerable similarities between the methods of aiming at the quantity of moneyand at inflation.The banks’ means is the repo rate that can be set to affect the quantity of money or inflation.However, as in the case of inflation, the quantity of money cannot either be directly controlled by therepo rate. Both when the bank aims at the quantity of money and inflation, it works with a so-calledintermediary target, as inflation control has in view an inflation forecast that can diverge from actualinflation, just as the growth of the quantity of money can diverge from inflation.This shows that the difference is inconsiderable between the two approaches in practice. Banks withan inflation target also study changes in the quantity of money when they make inflation forecasts.Banks that say that they have a quantity of money target deviate from this without ceremony when itclearly leads in the wrong direction taking into consideration the inflation forecasts that the banks alsowork with.4. ConfidenceThere is great benefit in publishing an inflation forecast. The general public can then see how thebank assesses inflation in one or two years’ time, how well founded the forecast is, and how policy iscarried out in relation to the forecast that has been made.The Riksbank’s task has been laid down by the Swedish people through a Riksdag decision, as Imentioned to begin with, namely to maintain a fixed monetary value.To that end, the Riksbank has been made autonomous, so-called autonomy of means.However, the Riksbank is responsible to the Riksdag for its policy by presenting an account of itspolicy twice a year to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance. The Riksdag’s possibility ofsanction is to replace a member of the executive board each year, as the members of the executiveboard have varying periods of office.The Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Governing Council of the Riksbank follow the executiveboard’s work by having the right to attend and speak at board meetings.This is how it must be in a democracy. Delegation of power must be accompanied by a possibility ofholding to account. By the Riksbank being open about its objectives, its forecasts and the assessmentsthat have been made by the executive board, confidence can be established in the Riksbank’s policyamong politicians, investors and the general public. I consider that Sweden has a found a reasonableand balanced approach to implementation of the EU directive.5. Are there alternatives?We have thus noted that Sweden has undertaken a fundamental change of policy. From havingdirected stabilisation policy at full employment as the highest priority, policy has been realigned tocreate stability. Low inflation is to constitute the economic environment in which full employmentshall be restored.
BIS Review   59/19998The objective of “price stability” is delegated to an autonomous Riksbank instead of – as previously –fiscal and monetary policy being co-ordinated by the Government to achieve both full employmentand price stability. Full employment is aimed at by long-term economic growth.I have given a fairly detailed account of the failures of stabilisation policy that have led to this changeof course.Sweden is not alone in changing its approach to economic stabilisation policy. A similar change ofcourse has taken place in country after country – in fact, this took place very late in Sweden – inwhich context the deregulation of the financial markets nationally and internationally played a crucialrole.Sweden’s economic successes during this century are the result of an openness towards thesurrounding world, a large foreign trade, and the growth of large multinational companies. It wouldnot have been possible to adopt a completely different approach than liberalisation of foreignexchange legislation and the capital market without very large costs for Sweden. It can therefore besaid that the alternative to the new approach to economic policy would not have been feasible.However, this also says that when the present economic order changes, then Sweden will follow thetide. No economic policy regime lasts forever. To date we can distinguish at least five distinctregimes/epochs this century. History has not come to an end.6. ConclusionThe principles I have outlined above are illustrated by the Riksbank’s policy this spring. At thespecial monetary policy meeting on 2 November, the repo rate was at 3.4 per cent. The Riksbanknoted then that at that interest rate inflation would be less than the target of two per cent in one or twoyears’ time. The Bank considered that this was due to temporary factors such as the direct effect ofearlier reductions in the interest rate on housing costs and some adjustments of indirect taxes andsubsidies. The temporary factors were considered to correspond to 0.5 per cent inflation in 1999 and 1per cent in 2000.However, even taking into consideration the temporary transitional factors, inflation was expected tobe less than two per cent in one or two years’ time. The interest rate was therefore reduced to 2.9 percent, a bit less than the European Central Bank’s repo rate.This illustrates how the Riksbank works. Painstaking inflation forecasts are worked out. Theadjustment of monetary policy to reach the inflation target takes place successively without the Bankglancing at monetary policy in other countries, except to the extent that their policies affect theRiksbank’s own inflation forecast.By publication of forecasts, minutes from meetings and taking into account the Riksbank’s explicitlydeclared objectives, the clients, the Swedish people, through the Riksdag, can evaluate the policiescarried out.
1BIS Review   58/1999Bank of Japan’s May report of recent economic and financial developments1Bank of Japan, Communication, 20 May 1999.The Bank’s View2Japan’s economy, at present, has stopped deteriorating, but clear signs of recovery have notbeen observed yet.With regard to final demand, business fixed investment has been on a downward trend, andrecovery in private consumption continues to be weak on the whole. Net exports (exportsminus imports) are leveling off. Meanwhile, housing investment has been recovering. Publicworks seem to be increasing rapidly against the background of the large increase in orders inearly spring.Reflecting such developments in final demand and continued progress in inventoryadjustment, industrial production has stopped decreasing. The deterioration in corporate andconsumer sentiment seems to have ceased due to this economic situation as well as theimprovements in the financial environment, including the subsidence of the public’s anxietyabout the stability of Japan’s financial system and the recovery in stock prices. However,corporate profits remain weak, and employment and household income conditions aredeteriorating as the unemployment rate has been marking a historical high. Conditions incorporate finance continue to improve, but firms’ concern about the availability of funds inthe future has not completely disappeared yet.As for the outlook, with the progress in inventory adjustment gradually paving the way for arecovery in production, the government’s economic measures and the monetary easing by theBank will continue to underpin the economy. Improvements in the financial environment arealso expected to exert positive effects on the economy gradually. With respect to corporateactivities, however, firms have started taking steps toward full-scale restructuring, facing thecontinued decline in profits. Although such corporate restructuring is expected to improveproductivity, it may, in the short run, reduce fixed investment and discourage householdexpenditure through the resulting deterioration in employment and income conditions. Undersuch circumstances, it is still difficult to expect an immediate self-sustained recovery inprivate demand. Overall economic developments require careful monitoring in considerationof the above points. It is also important to promote structural reform, while preparing anenvironment that facilitates such reform, in order to assure the economy’s sustained growth inthe medium term.With regard to prices, reflecting the large output gap, domestic wholesale prices are on adowntrend, and corporate service prices are weakening. Import prices are rising due to thebottoming out of international commodity prices such as crude oil prices. Consumer pricesremain weak. In relation to price developments in the future, distinct narrowing in the outputgap is still unlikely for the time being even though the economy has stopped deteriorating.                                                     1 This report was written based on data and information available when the Bank of Japan MonetaryPolicy Meeting was held on May 18, 1999.2 The Bank’s view on recent economic and financial developments, determined by the Policy Boardat the Monetary Policy Meeting held on May 18 as the basis of monetary policy decisions.
BIS Review   58/19992Furthermore, the decline in wages is likely to continue exerting downward pressure on prices.Under such circumstances, prices are expected to remain weak.In the financial markets, the overnight call rate has stayed at nearly zero, and confidence aboutthe availability of liquidity is growing among many financial institutions. Interest rates onterm instruments are declining further, reflecting the market’s view that monetary easing willcontinue for some time. Moreover, the Japan premium has almost disappeared.Long-term interest rates, on the whole, have declined against the background of no clear signsof economic recovery and the decline in term interest rates. Stock prices have been firmreacting to the further rise in U.S. stock prices since March.The amount outstanding of funds in the call money market has been gradually decreasing. Todate, this has not led to any difficulty in funds settlement, but close attention should be paid tofuture market developments.With regard to corporate finance, credit demand for economic activities such as fixedinvestment remains weak. Firms’ moves to increase their on-hand liquidity in the face ofdifficult fund-raising conditions are settling down. As a result, credit demand in the privatesector has weakened further.Private banks have basically retained their cautious lending attitude. However, they are nolonger constrained by severe fund-raising conditions and insufficient capital base. Under thesecircumstances, major banks have started to extend loans more actively than before, especiallyfor projects involving relatively small credit risks, and their lending stance is graduallybecoming positive.As a result of these developments, credit conditions, which tightened previously, have easedsomewhat.The situation continues to warrant careful monitoring on the extent to which private bankswill ease their lending stance, and how this change will affect firms’ propensity to invest.
1BIS Review   57/1999Mr Duisenberg’s speech at the 11th Frankfurt International Banking EveningSpeech by the President of the European Central Bank, Dr W F Duisenberg at the 11thFrankfurt International Banking Evening in Frankfurt on 20 May 1999.It is indeed an honour for me to have been invited to say a few words here this evening at theFrankfurt International Banking Evening. At the same time, it is more than a challenge and arather daunting task. Speaking after Hans Tietmeyer is almost like preaching after the pope.Moreover, I believe it is well known by now that the members of the Governing Council ofthe ECB speak with one voice. So, what does that leave me to say?Some have taken this principle of “speaking with one voice” to mean that there would only beone spokesperson for the ECB. That is a misunderstanding. Each of the members of theGoverning Council of the ECB has a voice and makes use of it. It is essential for the decisionsand views of the Governing Council to be explained comprehensively throughout the euroarea as well as outside it and multiple expression is one way to do it. This is particularly so inthese early years following the introduction of the euro. After I had given a speech in German,Theo Waigel once observed, “The euro speaks German.” He was right, of course, but the euroactually speaks the languages of all the other countries in the Eurosystem. We speak with onevoice but, if need be, in eleven languages. This evening we are speaking English, althoughHans quoted an advertisement in Dutch in which I appear. I shall presently also speak twosentences in German. Incidentally, Hans could also have referred to another advertisement inwhich a puppet - according to some people, a President of the ECB look-alike - is doing somebasic arithmetic. He calculates that if 1 euro is 2 guilders and 20 cents then 2 euro are 4guilders and 40 cents. At the ECB our sums are rather more complicated than that, but Hansrightly argued that central bankers cannot be replaced by computers. Neither should thesecond advertisement be taken as an argument for replacing central bankers by puppets,especially not with their strings being pulled by Ministers of Finance.We, the members of the Governing Council of the ECB, speak with one voice, but not allvoices are identical. How can they be, since they belong to different individuals? We are notin the business of producing clones. Earlier this evening we once again had the privilege oflistening to a convincing and clearly audible voice. There is nothing in what was said withwhich I disagree, and I intend to add very little to it. In fact, on some matters I can only repeatwhat was said in my own words. Don’t worry, I shall not do this extensively. However,repetition is the mother of all genuine knowledge. I cannot therefore resist the temptation tofocus briefly on two points that Hans made. The principle of conducting monetary policywithin a longer-term framework and from a longer-term perspective is the first issue that Ishould like to address. This principle sounds simple and its logic is indeed not complicated. Itis, however, as difficult to adhere to it in practice as its logic is simple. It seems to me that ithas even become more difficult to apply in recent decades as a result of the rapid developmentin information and communication technology. Tonight is not the occasion to elaborate on thisat length, but perhaps you will allow me to share the following reflections with you.Developments in these areas have brought great benefits and have the potential to lead tosignificant additional welfare gains in the years ahead, not least in Europe. At the same timethey present challenges to economic policy-makers, since they have already fundamentallychanged the character of society and its economies. These changes are ongoing and we areonly beginning to come to terms with them. The word which characterises much of today's
BIS Review   57/19992lifestyle is “zapping”. The equivalent of “zapping” in monetary policy terms is adopting anactivist policy, with over-eager responses to all the items of daily information in the financialmarkets. I sometimes have the impression that activism is experiencing a revival in somecircles, although the past has demonstrated clearly how ill-advised we would be to followsuch policies. Hans Tietmeyer has time and again stressed the importance of taking a longer-term view. He has also pointed out - although this is perhaps less known - that economies donot operate in isolation. Historical developments and the wider social and culturalenvironment should be taken into account. Short-termism is also the name of the game beingplayed by some commentators who, barely five months after the introduction of the euro, aredrawing far-reaching conclusions about the success of the euro or, more spectacular, itsfailure. From a longer-term perspective, one can appreciate, for example, that the currentsituation of price stability is a great improvement on the situation in many countries in recentdecades. Making the euro a lasting success is of course an ongoing process and indeed, in linewith the title of Hans’ speech, “a permanent challenge and task”. This task requires the inputof many persons, firms and institutions. Of course, the Eurosystem is not the least importantin this respect.This brings me to the second point made by Hans on which I should like to focus. That is that,in the end, even the most independent central bank cannot guarantee the maintenance of pricestability if no real support for this objective is given by fiscal policies, politicians, socialpartners, good academic analysis, the financial community as present here this evening andthe public at large. Although, technically speaking, an independent central bank is able tomaintain price stability in the medium term, in the longer term the actual outcome would beradically different without the existence of what Hans would call an entrenched stabilityculture. The importance of this cannot be overstated here in Europe, where we have justintroduced a new currency in eleven countries with different histories, cultures andbackgrounds. Establishing and maintaining a European culture of stability is of the utmostimportance. This also explains why central bankers regularly express their views on otherpolicies, be it fiscal policies or structural reforms. I have done so in the past and shall continueto do so in the future - as always, on a constructive basis and in recognition of the fact that thecentral bank does not decide on these policies, but only gives its advice. The Germanauthorities have received a great deal of advice from Hans over the past six years. Perhapsthey did not always like his advice - for instance when they wanted to revalue the stock ofgold - but I am sure that they were not surprised that he gave it. They would have been reallysurprised, however, if the President of the Deutsche Bundesbank had not expressed his views.To help to establish and maintain a culture of stability is also one of the reasons why a centralbank needs to be open and communicative. We at the ECB attach great importance to thisprinciple and are making every effort to practise it. We are prepared to learn from experienceand to adjust our line of thinking wherever and whenever it proves necessary.Only the pope is infallible - central bankers are not. Communication should not beunidirectional. We are willing to listen to others and to exchange information and views withthem, while at the same time bearing in mind our own spheres of responsibility and those ofothers. Finally, I should like to mention the importance of a serious, well-informed andconstructively critical press in this communication process. For the communication process tofunction well we need to provide the press with sufficient information, clearly conveying ourviews to its representatives. It also calls for journalists who are prepared to really digest thisinformation, not just to “zap” through it in search of an eye-catching headline; they also needto study the sometimes technical background of central banking. A particular group of
3BIS Review   57/1999journalists awards the prize of European central banker of the year. Perhaps it would be agood idea to award a prize to the best European financial journalist of the year. Let me makemyself clear, I should not want to be involved in the organisation of such a competition, noreven to have a vote in selecting the winner. I have to admit, though, that I would be interestedin the outcome.Tonight Hans Tietmeyer has addressed the Frankfurt International Banking Evening for thelast time in his capacity as President of the Deutsche Bundesbank. Hans, I know that it is notover yet. However, August is drawing closer and closer. You have now entered the phase inwhich you are doing things for the last time in your present capacity. Recently, you visited DeNederlandsche Bank. It was probably your last visit, but, surprisingly, it was also your first. Isay surprisingly, because as President of the Deutsche Bundesbank you represented theDeutsche Mark, which, as we in the Netherlands used to say, was for fifteen years pegged sosuccessfully to the guilder.Tonight is not the occasion to say farewell to you. Nor am I the person to make the farewellspeech that you deserve. In this group of financial experts there is no need to go over yourimpressive career with all its highlights; they are well known. Let me just simply mentionsome of the facts: almost six years as President of the Bundesbank, your unique role in theGerman unification process, your key role in the establishment of EMU from the verybeginning (in fact, you were a member of the Werner group in the early days of planningeconomic and monetary union) and your role on the international scene, not least but certainlynot only in the central banking community. Germany, Europe and the world know you as adetermined, uncompromising and convincing teacher of the necessity and merits of stability-oriented policies. What you had and have to say was perhaps often predictable, but more oftenthan not your saying it lent it weight and inspired confidence. Moreover, what you once aptlysaid is absolutely true: “Man kann schöne Sonntagsreden halten. Die Entscheidungen fallenan Werktagen.” You are known to be a hard worker - some would even say a workaholic -and you have tremendous “Ausdauer”.You never get tired of putting your analysis and convictions across, as has again beendemonstrated tonight. We owe you a great deal of gratitude. After August we central bankerswill miss you as a colleague, although I believe we have internalised your basic principles.They will therefore still be around as if you are still present yourself. And should we tend toforget them, I am sure that Ernst Welteke will help me to remind other colleagues of them.Sometimes, I wish that we could do the same as they do in the world of sport in the UnitedStates. There, when an outstanding player retires, in order to honour him the number he wearson the back of his shirt is never again used by another player. Central bankers do not wearshirts with numbers on the back, but if we did, I am sure that we would withdraw yournumber. Retirement is the natural end of one’s career, but it should not be overdramatised.People do matter - and you have certainly shown that - but institutions generally outlast them.In fact, that is what many people work for. Luckily, I am convinced that this is the case incentral banking. So, the institutions that you have worked to build will go on. Meanwhile, as Ilook ahead to August, I know that while I will lose a colleague, I will still have the samefriend. I know that is true for many of us here this evening. I should therefore like to close bysimply expressing my thanks for your support over the years both as a colleague and a friend.
1BIS Review   56/1999Mr Greenspan offers some suggestions to improve the international financialarchitectureTestimony by the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System,Alan Greenspan, before the Committee on Banking and Financial Services of the US House ofRepresentatives on 20 May 1999.Mr Chairman, Mr. LaFalce, and Members of the Committee, we at the Federal Reserve are inbroad agreement with the approach outlined by Secretary Rubin, and expect to continue towork closely with the Treasury in this area.As I have indicated previously before this committee, dramatic advances in computer andtelecommunications technologies in recent years have enabled a broad unbundling of risksthrough innovative financial engineering. The financial instruments of a bygone era, commonstocks and debt obligations, have been augmented by a vast array of complex hybrid financialproducts that has led to a far more efficient financial system. These same new technologiesand financial products, however, have challenged the ability of inward-looking andprotectionist economies to maintain effective barriers, which, along with the superiorperformance of their more open trading partners, has led, over the past decade, to a majordismantling of impediments to the free flow of trade and capital. The new internationalfinancial system that has evolved as a consequence has been, despite recent setbacks, a majorfactor in the marked increase in living standards for those economies that have chosen toparticipate in it.Notwithstanding the demonstrable advantages of the new international financial system, theMexican financial breakdown in late 1994 and, of course, the most recent episodes in EastAsia and elsewhere have raised questions about the inherent stability of this new system.These newly open markets were exposed to a huge expansion in capital inflows that theireconomic and financial systems were not ready to absorb. These flows in turn wereengendered by the increasing diversification out of industrial country investment portfolios,augmented by huge capital gains through 1997. Net private capital inflows into emergingmarkets roughly quadrupled between 1990 and the onset of the Asian crisis. Suchdiversification was particularly directed at those economies in Asia that had been growing sovigorously through the 1970s, 1980s, and into the 1990s – the so-called “Asian tigers.” In theevent, these economies were ill prepared to absorb such volumes of funds. There were simplynot enough productive investment opportunities to yield the returns that investors in the Westwere seeking. It was perhaps inevitable then that the excess cash found its way in too manyinstances into ill conceived and unwisely financed real estate ventures.What appeared to be a successful locking of currencies onto the dollar over a period of yearsin East Asia, led, perhaps inevitably, to large borrowings of cheaper dollars to lend, unhedged,at elevated domestic interest rates that reflected unheeded devaluation risk premiums. Whenthe amount of such unhedged dollar borrowings finally became excessive, as was almostinevitable, the exchange rate broke.While it might seem that the consequences were easily discernible, they were not. Problemswith imprudently financed real estate investments emerge with chronic frequency around theglobe without triggering the size of the collapse experienced in East Asia in 1997. The size of
BIS Review   56/19992the crisis became evident only when the normal buffers that any economy builds up to absorbshocks were, in the case of the East Asian economies, so readily breached under pressure.It has taken the longstanding participants in the international financial community manydecades to build sophisticated financial and legal infrastructures that buffer shocks. Thoseinfrastructures discourage speculative attacks against a well entrenched currency becausefinancial systems are robust and are able to withstand the consequences of vigorous policyresponses to such attacks. For the newer participants in global finance, their institutions, untilrecently, had not been tested against the rigors of major league pitching, to use a baseballanalogy.The heightened sensitivity of exchange rates of emerging economies under stress would be ofless concern if banks and other financial institutions in those economies were strong and wellcapitalized. Developed countries’ banks are highly leveraged, but subject to sufficientlyeffective supervision both by counterparties and regulatory authorities, so that, in mostcountries, banking problems do not escalate into international financial crises. Most banks inemerging market economies are also highly leveraged, but their supervision often has notproved adequate to forestall failures and a general financial crisis. The failure of some banksis highly contagious to other banks and businesses that deal with them, as the Asian crisis hasso effectively demonstrated.This weakness in banking supervision in emerging market economies was not a majorproblem for the rest of the world prior to those economies’ growing participation in theinternational financial system over the past decade or so. Exposure of an economy to short-term capital inflows, before its financial system is sufficiently sturdy to handle a largeunanticipated withdrawal, is a highly risky venture.It thus seems clear that some set of suggested standards that countries should strive to meetwould help the new highly sensitive international financial system function effectively. Thereare many ways to promote such standards without developing an inappropriately exclusiveand restrictive club of participants.For example, in any set of standards there should surely be an enhanced level of transparencyin the way domestic finance operates and is supervised. This is essential if investors are tomake more knowledgeable commitments and supervisors are to judge the soundness of suchcommitments by their financial institutions. A better understanding of financial regimes as yetunseasoned in the vicissitudes of our international financial system also will enablecounterparties to more appropriately evaluate the credit standing of institutions investing insuch financial systems. There should be no mechanism, however, to insulate investors frommaking foolish decisions, but some of the ill-advised investing of recent years can be avoidedin the future if investors, their supervisors, and counterparties, are more appropriatelyforewarned.To be sure, counterparties often exchange otherwise confidential information as a condition ofa transaction. But broader dissemination of detailed disclosures by governments, financialinstitutions, and firms is required if the greater risks inherent in our vastly expanded globalfinancial structure are to be contained. A market system can approach an appropriateequilibrium only if the signals to which individual market participants respond are accurateand adequate to the needs of the adjustment process. Product and asset prices, interest rates,
3BIS Review   56/1999debt by maturity, and detailed accounts of central banks and private enterprises are among thesignals so essential to the effective functioning of a global economy. I find it difficult tobelieve, for example, that the crises that arose in Thailand and Korea would have been nearlyso virulent had their central banks published data prior to the crises on net reserves instead ofthe not very informative gross reserve positions only. Some inappropriate capital inflowswould almost surely have been withheld and policymakers would have been forced to makedifficult choices more promptly if earlier evidence of difficulty had emerged.As a consequence, the G-10 central banks and the IMF initiated an effort to establishstandards for disclosure of on- and off-balance-sheet foreign currency activities of the publicsector by countries that participate, or aspire to participate, in international capital markets.The focus of this work was the authorities’ foreign currency liquidity position, which consistsof foreign exchange resources that can be easily mobilized, adjusted for potential drains onthose resources. This work was part of a larger effort to enhance disclosure of a broader set ofeconomic and financial data under the IMF Special Data Dissemination Standard.Such transparency suggests a second standard worth considering. Countries that lack theseasoning of a long history of dealing in international finance should manage their externalassets and liabilities in such a way that they are always able to live without new foreignborrowing for up to, for example, one year. That is, usable foreign exchange reserves shouldexceed scheduled amortizations of foreign currency debts (assuming no rollovers) during thefollowing year. This rule could be readily augmented to meet the additional test that theaverage maturity of a country’s external liabilities should exceed a certain threshold, such asthree years. This could be accomplished directly, or through the myriad innovations toaugment maturities through rollover options. The constraint on the average maturity ensures adegree of private sector “burden sharing” in times of crisis, since in the event of a crisis, themarket value of longer maturities would doubtless fall sharply. Clearly few, if any, locked-inholders of long-term investments could escape without significant loss. Short-term foreigncreditors, on the other hand, are able to exit without significant loss as their instrumentsmature. If the preponderance of a country’ s liabilities are short term, the entire burden of acrisis would fall on the emerging market economy in the form of a run on reserves.Some emerging market countries may argue that they have difficulty selling long-termmaturities. If that is indeed the case, their economies are being exposed to too high a riskgenerally. For too long, too many emerging market economies have managed their externalliabilities so as to minimize their current borrowing cost. This short-sighted approach ignoresthe insurance imbedded in long-term debt, insurance that is almost always well worth theprice.Adherence to such a rule is no guarantee that all financial crises can be avoided. If theconfidence of domestic residents is undermined, they can generate demands for foreignexchange that would not be captured in this analysis. But controlling the structure of externalassets and liabilities nonetheless could make a significant contribution to stability.Considerable progress has been made in recent years in developing sophisticated financialinstruments. These developments create added complexity that all financial marketparticipants, including policymakers from emerging market economies, must manage.However, they also create opportunities that emerging market economies should seek to
BIS Review   56/19994exploit. In doing so there are lessons they can learn from advances in risk managementstrategies developed by major financial institutions.To the extent that policymakers are unable to anticipate or evaluate the types of complex risksthat the newer financial technologies are producing, the answer, as it always has been, is lessleverage, i.e. less debt, more equity, and, hence, a larger buffer against adversity andcontagion.A third standard could be a legal infrastructure that enables the inevitable bankruptcies thatwill occur in today’ s complex world to be adjudicated in a manner that minimizes thedisruption and contagion that can surface if ready resolutions to default are not available.A fourth standard is the obvious necessity of sound monetary and fiscal policies whoseabsence was so often the cause of earlier international financial crises. With increasedemphasis on private international capital flows, especially interbank flows, privatemisjudgments within flawed economic structures have been the major contributors to recentproblems. But inappropriate macropolicies also have been a factor for some emerging marketeconomies in the current crisis.There are, of course, numerous other elements of sound international finance that are worthyof detailed consideration, but the aforementioned would constitute a good start. Even so,improvements in transparency, commercial and legal structures, as well as supervision cannotbe implemented quickly. Such improvements and the transition to a more effective and stableinternational financial system will take time. The current crisis, accordingly, has had to beaddressed with ad hoc remedies. It is essential, however, that those remedies not conflict witha broader vision of how our new international financial system will function as we enter thenext century.
1BIS Review   55/1999Ms Rivlin’s view on sustaining economic growth and development in the United StatesSpeech by Alice M Rivlin, Vice Chair of the Board of the US Federal Reserve System, atMinneapolis, Minnesota, on 13 May 1999.Everyone seems to be talking about the spectacular performance of the U.S. economy thesedays and wondering how long it can stay so good. Will our economy go on performing sosplendidly into the next millennium or will the good times come to an end sometime soon?Indeed, the economic journalists’ most frequent question these days is some variant of: “Howlong will it last?”  “Is the good news temporary or permanent?” I get this question all the time,as do all members of the Federal Open Market Committee. Hope springs eternal that we maybe privy to some secret economic clues available only to readers of entrails inside the temple.Unfortunately, of course, we process the same economic information available to everyoneelse and face the same uncertainties.I don’t know the answer to how long the good times will roll, and I don’t know anyresponsible person who claims to know. Indeed, I think it’s a silly question. So I’d like toformulate a more important query, one that I think has more operational significance. Theoperational question is this: Given what we know–or think we know–about why the economymight be performing so extraordinarily effectively, what can we all do that will likely help tokeep the good news flowing? Answering this question will require: (1) sorting out the list offactors that appear to be contributing to the good performance into those we may be able tocontrol or influence and those we can’t; (2) doing everything we can to influence thecontrollable factors so that we maximize the chances that the good performance continues.By “ we” I don’t just mean the Federal Reserve, although the Fed has a role to play. I meaneveryone in this room and people like you in all parts of the country. We all make economicpolicy decisions at the household, business, community or governmental level, directly andthrough our actions, and influence as consumers, investors, producers and voters. Sustainingthe high performance of the economy depends much more on what people in Minnesota do–along with those in Maine and Louisiana and Oregon–than it does on monetary policy.What do we mean when we say the economy is performing well? The statistics usually citedare the growth rate of gross national product, the unemployment rate and the rate of inflation(for which there exist several different measures). All of these statistics have been coming uproses for some time–simultaneously. The GDP (in real terms, after inflation) has beengrowing continuously for eight years and this long expansion, instead of petering out, hasaccelerated in the last couple of years. Real GDP grew about 4.5 percent in the first quarter ofthis year and has grown about 4 percent a year for the last two years, despite the negativeimpact of the world financial crisis that began in Asia in early 1997. Millions of new jobshave been created in the last few years; and unemployment, now at 4.3 percent, has been at orbelow 5 percent for over two years. Not long ago, most economists thought growth this rapidand unemployment this low would inevitably produce inflation. However, inflation hasremained remarkably subdued, and, indeed has continued to decline over the last severalyears.All of this means rising standards of living and greater economic security for most Americans.Moreover, the strength of the economy has been spread broadly across all regions of the
BIS Review   55/19992country. A few areas with deep-seated economic problems, such as Northern Minnesota, stilllag, and parts of agriculture are suffering severely from the downward pressure of weak worlddemand on commodity prices, but growth in other sectors has taken up much of the slack.Low inflation has reduced expectations of inflation, lowered long-term interest rates,encouraged investment and housing and made planning ahead easier for everyone.Moreover, in the last couple of years, one of the discouraging aspects of this long expansionfinally seems to be reversing. Through 1996, the benefits of rising prosperity were flowing tothose with skill and education, people already doing relatively well. Those at the low end ofthe skill and income ladder were falling further behind. Recently, however, very tight labormarkets have meant that even unskilled and less educated workers have enjoyed higher realearnings, poverty rates have begun to decline, and even the bottom 20 percent of householdshave had a significant increase in their standard of living for a change.The high performance of the economy does not just mean more material possessions for mostpeople, although it certainly does mean that. It also means more enjoyment of and support forthe creative side of life–art, music, theatre, dance–and more public resources for improvingstreets, parks and schools, cleaning up pollution and preserving natural beauty. The City ofChicago, for example, is putting $2 billion into renovating its crumbling schools.Perhaps most important, strong growth and tight labor markets have opened opportunities forworkers at all levels–opportunities to move up, to get better jobs, to get off welfare, to go backto school with less fear of being unable to find jobs on completion.And it isn’t just the United States that benefits from our prosperity–indeed, the vibrantAmerican economy is contributing mightily to the revival of growth in what would otherwisebe a weak global economy. Asia is only beginning the process of recovery from the deeprecession that followed the financial crisis of 1997, and the hoped-for engine of Asianrecover–the huge Japanese economy–remains stalled. Much of Latin America is in recessionas a result of the Brazilian financial crisis and low commodity prices; Russia is struggling andexporting its troubles to its trading partners; even Western Europe, affected by all of theabove, is growing far more slowly than we are. When Americans are prosperous, we spend anincreasing portion of our rising incomes on imports. Without the income generated byexporting to us, many other countries would be in much worse shape than they actually are.In the long run, the rapid accumulation of obligations to foreigners, which pays for our excessof imports over exports, cannot be sustained. In the meantime, however, we are financingsome of our boom-times by borrowing the savings of foreigners, and they are benefiting byexporting to us. A slowdown in the U.S. economy would reduce our trade and current accountdeficits, but make it harder for the rest of the world to recover. The bottom line is, billions ofpeople, not just us, benefit from the high performance of the U.S. economy, so what can wedo to keep it functioning so well?The key conundrum is how we have managed to have such strong growth and associated tightlabor markets, with subdued, even declining, inflation. Some of the credit clearly goes toglobal forces that Americans don’t control and which can’t be counted on to continue pushingin the same direction forever. The world financial crisis has weakened demand forinternationally traded goods, especially commodities, including agricultural products, metals,and oil (although the oil price has come back up recently as producing countries cut supply).
3BIS Review   55/1999In the face of weak demand, world prices of just about everything tradable are low andcompetition is fierce. At the same time, the U.S. dollar has been strong, especially in relationto currencies of emerging market countries. In part, the strength of the dollar reflects the factthat our economy has been performing so well and has offered international investorsprofitable opportunities along with a safe haven from political and financial turmoil. Thestrong dollar has made imports cheap and has helped keep inflation low-to the benefit of U.S.consumers and the distress of some U.S. producers.We can’t count on low world commodity prices or a strong dollar continuing far into thefuture, and both have their downsides for us and for others. Some features of the globaleconomy, however, seem likely to endure. The events of the last two years come on top of ahuge expansion of global trade, competition and productive capacity–all of which have givenAmerican businesses less control over prices in the face of rising costs and benefitedAmerican consumers through low prices. Moreover, although we often think of “globalcompetition” as being associated with internationally traded goods, many of the same forcesthat have made the global marketplace increasingly competitive–especially faster, cheapertransportation and the revolutionary changes in communications and informationmanagement–also operate to make domestic markets broader and more competitive. Asbuying, selling, and comparing prices at a distance has become easier, producers of all kindsof goods and services have found themselves in a more competitive environment with lessindependent pricing power than they used to have.The increasing competitiveness of the U.S. economy–and that of the rest of the world–seemslikely to continue to reduce inflationary tendencies in the future. Further deregulation wouldfoster this competitiveness, as would further lowering of trade barriers. Conversely,reregulation or a relapse into protectionism would tend to negate the procompetitive and anti-inflationary trend.Fierce national and international competition has its cost in uncertainty, disruption of livesand settled patterns. It demands flexibility and adaptability of businesses, workers andcommunities. It requires a willingness of workers to learn new skills, to take chances, to moveto new jobs and new places. It requires nimbleness, flexibility and risk taking on the part ofbusiness. It requires communities to be adaptable, to make efforts (not all of which will besuccessful) to diversify their economic bases and to attract new jobs and residents whenexisting ones move on. It requires government to be imaginative and creative (words we don’talways associate with government) in designing transition assistance for workers andcommunities that will provide incentives to change and adapt, rather than incentives to remainstuck in the status quo.Strong growth and tight labor markets reduce the likely cost of taking chances for workers,businesses and communities. But change is hard and not everyone is willing or able to pay theprice. One of the determinants of how long the U.S. economy can continue to perform at ahigh level with low inflation is how well we all learn to adapt to the changes that go with theincreased competitiveness of the national and international marketplace that is helping to keepour economy growing and inflation low.An important part of the answer to why the U.S. economy has been able to grow so stronglywithout inflation accelerating has been the recent resurgence in productivity growth.Productivity grew strongly from the end of World War II into the early 1970s, accounting for
BIS Review   55/19994the rapid increase in American’s real incomes over that period. Then, around the time of thefirst oil shock in the early 1970s, productivity growth slowed drastically both here and in otherindustrial countries, remaining weak in the U.S. through the 1980s and first half of the 1990s.Average growth in output per hour in non-farm business was only a little over 1 percentbetween 1973 and 1995. In the last three years, however, productivity growth has accelerated,reaching an astonishing 4 percent growth in the last two quarters. The growth in productivityhas enabled business to pay higher wages without raising prices significantly or erodingprofits severely.Is the increase in productivity a temporary cyclical response to strong growth or does itpresage an upward shift in the productivity growth trend that will make it easier going forwardto continue strong growth, rising real incomes and low inflation? That’s another one of thosesilly questions to which no one can honestly claim to know the answer.Hypotheses abound about why productivity growth might have accelerated in the mid 1990s.Technology clearly has something to do with it. Although the telecommunications andinformation management revolution did not start in the 1990s, it may have been just at theright point by then to offer firms that are facing strong demand and tight labor markets a wayto increase their efficiency.In the past, when unemployment remained low for an extended period, economists expectedproductivity to suffer because firms were forced to hire less skilled workers with lessexperience–workers whose productivity was likely to be low. However, recent experiencesuggests–but certainly does not yet prove–that two factors may have combined to change theexpected impact of tight labor markets on productivity. One factor is the availability of newtechnology, especially computers and telecommunications technology. The other factor is therevolution in management attitudes and practices that has occurred since the 1980s. A wholegeneration of managers has been trained to think continuously about productivity and qualitymanagement. Buzzwords like reengineering and restructuring have not only gotten into thevocabulary of managers, but they have also infiltrated their thought processes and affectedtheir behavior. The response of many firms to shortages of skilled workers and to foreigncompetition has apparently been to reorganize what they were doing and how they were doingit, substituting efficient new equipment for employees, training workers to use new equipmentand techniques, and outsourcing to reduce costs. All of these have combined to increaseproductivity.If this hypothesis is right–or even partly right–then there are actions that many different kindsof economic actors can take to help keep a good thing going.• Workers and potential workers can acquire more skills and more education at all levels.They can take the risk of moving to new and better jobs or starting new businesses.• Companies can keep their focus on cutting costs and increasing productivity; they canfoster research and innovation; they can offer training and employee incentives to acquiremore education and skills.• Colleges and universities, community colleges and technical institutes can offer courses attimes and in places convenient for workers, for “non-traditional” students as well astraditional ones. They can put less emphasis on standard degrees and more on coursesdesigned to help students acquire not just job skills, but the broader education that helps
5BIS Review   55/1999them to become more adaptable and to acquire the intellectual self–confidence that helpsthem deal with change.• Communities, large and small, can make efforts to diversity their economic bases, upgradeand modernize their school systems, and welcome new kinds of workers and companies.• Governments can support the basic research from which applications and innovationsflow, and offer incentives to education and training and financial aid for students.• Financial institutions can offer attractive convenient ways for individuals to save andinvest. They can take chances on new ideas, new clienteles, and innovative companies–subject to sound risk management, of course.• All levels of government can manage their finances prudently, provide public servicesefficiently, build up surpluses and rainy day funds and pay down debt. This kind ofbehavior will result in government adding to the national saving rate and enhancing thechances of future growth, rather than subtracting from national saving by running publicdeficits. It is especially important to use the current and projected federal budget surplus toreduce the federal debt. The President’s budget and social security proposal would havethis effect.• Finally, the Federal Reserve can continue trying, as we have been doing, to balance therisk of allowing the economy to grow too fast for its own long-run good and begin agrowth-threatening acceleration of inflation against the other risk that the economy willslowdown too much in the near term and lose the benefits of healthy labor markets andsustainable growth.In short• No one knows how long the good news will last.• But there is a whole long list of actions that can be taken by workers, businesses,communities, governments, educational institutions and others that can, if taken together,increase the chances that this remarkable combination growth and low inflation willcontinue for a while. If we all do them together, we and our children will have a betterchance of living in a world where change is normal but most of the changes are for thebetter.
1BIS Review   54/1999Mr Latter gives an overview of the current monetary policy stance of Hong KongAddress by Mr Tony Latter, a Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority,at the CLSA Investors’ Forum in Hong Kong on 17 May 1999.I should like to say a few words about the present stance of monetary policy in Hong Kongand its relation to the broader state of the economy.Hong Kong has a fixed exchange rate against the US dollar. The pros and cons continue to bea focus of debate in some quarters, but I don’t intend to dig over that ground yet again today.Suffice it to say that over the past fifteen years Hong Kong has enjoyed, on balance,remarkable prosperity. I happen to think that the visible and trusted monetary discipline of theexchange rate link has been a decisive contributory factor to that prosperity.Of course, one cannot deny that there is some association between the strength of theexchange rate and the level of interest rates on the one hand, and the current recession on theother, but I would caution against adopting too short-term a horizon when drawingconclusions, and I would also suggest that some of the adjustment which we have experienced- for example in property prices - was both necessary and somewhat overdue. Perhaps I shouldalso add that the Hong Kong dollar’s stability after the depreciations of other regionalcurrencies in 1997 probably helped to avert what might have been a spiral of furtherdepreciations, which could have caused greater damage in the region and might even have hadmore painful eventual consequences for Hong Kong itself than we have in fact suffered.Slide 21 shows the path of the real effective exchange rate since mid-1997. This is the trade-weighted exchange rate adjusted for differences in movements of consumer price indices. It isone of several possible measures - none of them ideal - of external competitiveness. Amovement up the page denotes a loss of competitiveness. The steep loss around the time ofthe Asian crisis in late-1997 has been partly recovered. The setback in the earlier part of thisyear arose mainly from the strength of the US dollar. But let’s look at this question in a longer-term perspective. Slide 3 shows that in the 13½years from the introduction of the linked exchange rate up to mid-1997 the real rateappreciated on average by 4% a year; in the period since then the real appreciation hasaveraged 4½% a year. On this basis one might say that we are scarcely off track at all, from what appears to havebeen a secular trend of real appreciation of the currency. But others might argue that thestructural changes of the eighties and nineties which were consistent with an appreciating realrate because of much more rapid productivity gains in the tradable than in the non-tradablesectors, cannot be repeated, so that the assumption of a continuing secular uptrend is invalid.On that view, the net appreciation over the past couple of years may be deemed to havedragged us away from our preferred path. It is hard to judge where the proper balance of these views lies. I recall how, 15-20 years ago,the doom merchants were prophesying the end of Hong Kong’s long run of growth becausewe were rapidly losing competitiveness in much of manufacturing. Presumably they did not                                                     1 Slides are not included in this text document.
BIS Review   54/19992foresee the remarkable extent to which the service sector would develop as an alternativewealth-generating lynchpin of the economy. Now, the next generation of doom merchants isprophesying imminent disaster as competitiveness in certain parts of the service sector appearsto have been eroded. Will they be wrong again? Have they failed to appreciate the trueworkings of the market economy and comparative advantage? Do they not realise howdifficult it is to foretell exactly how an economy will evolve, even though the evolution istaking place right under our noses? Indeed, as we sit here worrying about it, there are peopleout there who are busy exploiting niches and opportunities which will mould the futurestructure of the economy. We can try to facilitate that process, or even to guide particularaspects which we reasonably expect to be important (eg the cyberport), but there will alwaysbe surprises. In any analysis of competitiveness there is inevitably scope for argument about theappropriateness of the statistics one is using. I believe that in the current Hong Kongconjuncture the popular measures such as the real exchange rate may have been laggingsomewhat behind the recovery of competitiveness that may have actually occurred. Businessdecisions are influenced more by marginal prices and expectations of future prices, than byprevailing average prices; yet the measure of rentals which enters the CPI is typically based onan average of outstanding contracts and not the price at which new contracts are being struck -which have over the past year or so fallen much more steeply. Thus, when thinking ofbusiness decisions, even assuming that residential rentals are a satisfactory proxy for rentalcosts affecting business, some adjustment for the marginal/average discrepancy may beneeded at times when that discrepancy is significant - as it certainly is when one is at or nearturning points in the rental cycle. Please be assured that I am not criticising the construction ofthe CPI, which is, so far as I am able to judge, absolutely appropriate in terms of arriving at anoverall cost-of-living index, but I do suggest that some qualifications may be needed if it is tobe used in other analysis, such as that of business decisions which we are discussing here. Let me turn now to interest rates. Real rates have been high, at least as measured on thebackward-looking basis in slide 4 (ie nominal rates less recorded inflation over the precedingtwelve months). This is the arithmetic result of nominal rates which are very much dictated byUS rates and recent deflation of prices in Hong Kong. US rates are being held up in part bythe extremely buoyant US economy, and you will see from slide 6 that the Hong Kongeconomy is out of phase with the US, on the downside, to a greater extent than at any timesince our exchange rate link was established. The only comparable divergence was in the1980s, and that was on the upside, when we experienced - in complete contrast to today -uncomfortably rapid inflation and negative real interest rates. But tight monetary policy is being balanced by a more relaxed fiscal stance (slide 7), asdefined by the size of the budget balance relative to GDP. This is a reversal of the morecommon position in Hong Kong of relatively loose monetary and tight fiscal policy. The chartconfirms that historically, as one might expect, there has generally been an offsetting balanceof these two policy components. I think, nevertheless, that there is a tendency to exaggerate the tightness of monetary policy atthe present time. This happens because of too simplistic an approach to measuring realinterest rates and assessing their influence. I can best illustrate this by reference to theillustration in slide 8. As at April last year, 12-month HIBOR was 8.0%. Looking back overthe preceding 12 months (ie April 1997 to April 1998), inflation had been 4.7%, so at that
3BIS Review   54/1999time (April 1998) the commonplace measure of the real interest rate would have yielded 3.3%.A more sophisticated method would have been to take the forecast for inflation over thecoming year (April 1998 to April 1999), which was then 4.2% (I have based this on aninterpolation from the annual figures from the consensus of private sector forecasters at thattime), yielding a somewhat lower real rate of 3.8%. But that forecast of inflation turned out tobe wildly wrong; the actual outturn for the 12 months April 1998 to April 1999 was minus2.6%, which means that the real rate actually realised, and thus experienced by someoneborrowing or lending for twelve months at HIBOR, was, on the CPI basis, 10.6%. On top ofthat, the marginal/average adjustment for rentals to which I referred earlier would have tendedto raise the realised real rate even further, because the prices influencing business decisionsprobably fell by more than the CPI. In sum, what started as a headline real rate of 3.3% endedup as a rate well in excess of 10½%. Businesses would have been affected by the factorsresponsible for the difference between these figures, but would not have been able toanticipate all of them. If we move on to April this year, the position is rather different. The backward-looking realrate, which tends to be the one which most people take as their guide when clamouring aboutoppressive monetary policy, is indeed high at 8.9% - again taking 12-month HIBOR as thebase. But because expectations are that prices are now going to move up rather than down, theforward-looking measure, based on consensus forecasts (from the private sector) of what thepublished CPI will show, yields much less, 5.6%. In addition, the marginal/averageadjustment may now have turned the corner, since business decision-takers may be facingprices that will rise by more than the recorded CPI, in which case real interest rates will nowbe perceived as lower than 5.6%. Perceptions may still be of a figure which is above the 3-4%range, which is often regarded as a global norm; but perceptions vary, and there may be somewho visualise a lower figure. We are of course not yet in a position to observe the actualoutcome; there may, as last year, be surprises in store. My examples have been based on 12-month HIBOR; there may, of course, be benchmarks higher or lower than this reference pointwhich are more relevant to individual decisions. I hope that I have succeeded in demonstrating that the measurement of real interest rates israther more complex than may appear at first sight, and is dependent also on the context. If you were to look at only the popular measure of the real rate - the nominal rate deflated bya measure of past inflation - then the recovery in asset prices in Hong Kong over recentmonths would seem inexplicable, because real rates would have appeared so high. Therecovery in asset prices would, however, be consistent with a reduction in perceived real rates- which is in fact what I am suggesting has occurred, on a fairly significant scale, asexpectations of inflation have probably become positive while headline recorded inflationremains negative. For those who see some downside in all of this from the implication in theconsensus forecasts that general inflation is now expected to resume, it is worth noting thatthe forecast magnitude is only very modest. I would not pretend that every piece of evidence unequivocally supports my thesis today. Forinstance, the continuing lethargy of bank lending to business in Hong Kong might suggest thathigh real interest rates remain a deterrent to borrowing and investment. However, I suspectthat, while that may well have been the case a little while ago, we are now in a period wheredecisions are being more influenced by confidence factors relating to the broader economicsituation than by interest rates per se, although interest rates do of course remain important.
BIS Review   54/19994 I have pointed to elements of the present economic conjuncture - namely, competitivenessand interest rates - where the position may not be so bleak as painted by some. But I do notdeny that we face tough challenges and I note that the consensus for the immediate outlook isfor no more than an unspectacular recovery. I have no brief today to try to talk up oureconomic prospects. My wish is rather to contribute analytically to the discussion of thoseprospects. The only certainty is that the future is always uncertain.
1BIS Review 103/1999Mr Ferguson assesses financial sector Y2K readiness in the United Statesand abroad with less than 100 days to goRemarks by Mr Roger W Ferguson Jr, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem and Chairman of the Joint Year 2000 Council, before the Wallenberg Forum at GeorgetownUniversity, Washington, D.C., on 28 September 1999.*   *   *Year 2000: ninety-four days and countingMy topic today is a timely one – the Year 2000. My comments will focus on the readiness of thefinancial services industry in the United States and the significant work and coordination that haveoccurred globally to prepare for the century change. The century date change poses considerable riskand is a major challenge for all sectors both public and private. Although US financial marketauthorities established specific and aggressive deadlines for their industries to prepare for the centurydate change, in the final analysis, the boards of directors and senior management of firms areresponsible for ensuring that their organizations are prepared for the Year 2000. We turn to them,ultimately, to ensure that their firms are able to conduct business and provide uninterrupted servicesafter the century date change.Increased confidence in readiness of US financial industry and other sectorsWith only ninety-four days remaining before the century rollover, I believe that the US financial sectoris ready. My assessment is based on publicly available facts and information developed by supervisorsand industry participants. More than 99% of the approximately 22,000 federally insured depositoryinstitutions and credit unions have demonstrated to examining supervisors that they have completedpreparations for the Year 2000, tested their mission-critical systems and put them into production.Securities and futures brokers, dealers, and markets have completed or are completing Y2K-readinesscertifications, and both industries have participated in large-scale “street” tests during which literallyhundreds of thousands of forward-dated transactions were processed on exchanges and then clearedand settled using automated systems that simulate the century rollover at their depositories andclearing houses. These tests revealed Y2K errors at a level of something less than one-tenth of 1%,and all were quickly corrected. In fact, the testing tools now being used are so thorough that in manycases non-Y2K program bugs have been identified in existing programs and systems, and I am happyto report that they have been eradicated as well.Retail and wholesale payment systems – a vital part of the financial sector and one in which theFederal Reserve is a major service provider – are engaged in a similar process. I can assure you thatthe Federal Reserve has not spared any effort in preparing its internal systems and the financialservices and products we provide to financial institutions for the Year 2000. We have completed Y2Kpreparations for our services and products, and in June 1998 we opened a testing facility for ourcustomers. To date, more than 9,000 financial institutions have tested the services they use with theFederal Reserve. These represent all of our major customers in terms of transaction volume and dollaramount of the items processed through the Federal Reserve. We also have tested the automatedpayment services we provide to federal agencies such as the Social Security Administration to ensurethat banks can receive government payments and then post the deposits to their customers’ accounts.The New York Clearing House, in particular, and other private commercial entities that processwholesale and retail payments have followed testing programs similar to ours.No one can say with certainty that there won’t be any problems or disruptions during the centuryrollover. However, based upon the information I have shared with you, we expect that any disruptionsor glitches in the United States that do occur will be minor and of limited duration. Moreover, because
BIS Review 103/19992there is an expectation that something somewhere will go wrong, the financial sector – from theregulators to the markets and payment systems to the smallest introducing broker or bank branch – ispreparing contingency plans.I would also like to emphasize that a percentage of automated systems are down every day withoutcausing serious disruptions to commercial transactions and markets. For example, 1–2% of ATMmachines in the United States are down at any given moment – some simply because they are out ofpaper – yet consumers know to go down the block to another machine or into the bank branch or localsupermarket to obtain the cash they need. Even more serious disruptions periodically occur: The NewYork Stock Exchange and, only last month, the Chicago Board of Trade computers have experiencedglitches that caused their markets to close temporarily without causing serious disruption to the USfinancial markets. In all of these situations, Americans react with typical aplomb: they prioritize andaddress the most serious safety and well-being issues first, and they usually are willing to toleratesome inconveniences and delays related to less-critical needs.Increase in readiness information and readiness of other domestic sectorsAs I said earlier, my assessment of the financial services sector is based on publicly available facts andinformation. Even as late as this spring, Y2K information about firms and industries was largelysketchy or incomplete throughout the world. In many countries, few firms or sectors were willing toprovide information about the Year 2000 process or their status relative to national and internationalbenchmarks. Failure to disclose caused considerable concern in markets. Market participants began toassume that firms and sectors that were not making some type of self disclosure probably wereseriously behind in their preparations for the Year 2000. This assumption engendered the potential foroverreaction by market participants and consumers, including the potential for withdrawal frommarkets and commercial relationships and other rational and irrational risk-mitigation techniques.I believe that the potential for overreaction has been greatly reduced in recent months because of adramatic improvement in disclosure and confirmation of readiness through multiparty testing.First, in the United States, the President’s Council on Year 2000 Conversion, led by John Koskinen,forged unique and successful cooperative partnerships between critical public agencies and relatedprivate sectors and made those sectors accountable to the American public through the quarterlyrelease of sector assessment reports. The President’s Council, established in February 1998, is madeup of more than 30 major federal agencies that act as sector coordinators in promoting Year 2000public and private sector action within their respective policy areas. Quite simply, the President’sCouncil has spurred the government and whole industries to coordinate Y2K preparations, setbenchmark dates for readiness, and organize and report the results of inter and cross-industry tests.The electric power and telecommunication industries, which are critical to the operation of thefinancial services industry, are excellent examples of this achievement. Neither industry is supervisedin the way that the financial services industry is, yet their umbrella agencies – the Department ofEnergy and the Federal Communications Commission – were able to energize industry-led groupssuch as the North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) and the Network Reliability andInteroperability Council (NRIC). The results of their efforts can be read in the assessment reportreleased by the President’s Council last month. As of June 1999, electric power distributioncompanies’ serving 96% of the nation’s electricity needs were ready for the Year 2000. Similarly, asof July 1999, long-distance telecommunications carriers controlling 92% of domestic calls were 99%Y2K compliant.Second, regulators and private-sector firms have been exerting pressure on market participants andcommercial firms to provide information about Y2K readiness. Banks and broker-dealers have beenrequired by their regulators to communicate with customers about their Y2K programs and readiness.Moreover, financial institutions, which have a duty to assess and manage the Year 2000 risk, havebeen seeking Y2K disclosure from major customers and counterparties. If these entities are publiclytraded companies, they are required by the SEC to address Y2K readiness in their quarterly filings.Private-sector groups, such as the Global Year 2000 Co-ordinating Group made up of global banking
3BIS Review 103/1999and financial services firms, have been very active in prodding market participants to publishinformation about their own readiness. The Global 2000 Group has also been instrumental inencouraging countries to produce information about the readiness of key sectors within their borders.Third, we’ve seen increasing efforts by the media to provide factual and balanced reports on the Year2000. I think you’ll agree that the press is now reporting the good news as well as the “what if” pieces.The Federal Reserve and our sister agencies plan to engage the media in an ongoing conversationabout the financial services industry through the rollover period. We expect intensive media coverageduring the rollover period, and the President’s Council will be running a national InformationCoordination Center, supplemented by reports from agencies and industry members, that will providethe public with accurate, timely, and complete information about the operation of critical sectors in theUnited States.These disclosure initiatives, assisted by legislation that avoids liability for Year 2000 disclosurestatements made in good faith, literally have opened the gates of information and offer a powerfulantidote to any Y2K gloom-and-doom stories generated by the media.Year 2000 market indicators and Federal Reserve monetary preparationsOver the next few months and through the first part of the new year, the Federal Reserve, like othercentral banks, may be facing some unusual, but not unmanageable, challenges in carrying out itsresponsibility to meet market demands for currency, reserves, and liquidity more generally. Wealready have seen signs of heightened demands for liquidity and safety in the United States. TheFederal Reserve expects banks and other financial intermediaries to have reasonable plans in place tomanage cash and liquidity and provide for contingencies over the century date change. However, wealso recognize our responsibility to assure that adequate overall levels of liquidity are available and toprovide a backstop to the financial system.The Federal Reserve has a number of tools available to effectuate monetary policy and to satisfymarket liquidity needs. For example, we use our open market operations to provide liquidity byentering the market to buy or sell government and agency securities. Recently, we created several newtools to help fine-tune our open market operations and reassure market participants that adequateliquidity will be available when needed. First, we lengthened the maximum term of our repurchaseagreements, up to ninety from sixty days; this is a permanent change in our operations. Second, we arewilling to accept a broader range of collateral in repurchase transactions, such as pass-throughmortgage securities of government-sponsored enterprises. Third, we will be selling options onovernight repurchase agreement transactions for exercise on specific days in December 1999 andJanuary 2000; the details on this are still being worked out. These latter programs have beenauthorized only for the Y2K period. We have seen recent butterfly spreads and other measures of Y2Kpressures in US markets respond positively to the announcement of these tools.Even with the flexibility provided by these tools, if the markets become more volatile, it may bedifficult to forecast aggregate reserve demand and supply, engendering the potential for an unexpectedshortfall in reserves. Moreover, it is possible that the distribution of liquidity will become uneven –some banks may receive increased deposits and be flush with funds while others may experienceunexpected shortfalls. And many banks could experience unusual loan demands related to the Y2Kneeds of their customers. Broadly speaking, uncertainties about Y2K have given rise to a generalreluctance among lenders to extend unsecured credit over the year-end. At the same time, borrowersare trying to lock-in funding now for the year-end rather than face the possibility of high interest ratesor market disruptions. To help meet unusual funding and liquidity needs during the period around thecentury date change, the Federal Reserve has created a special liquidity facility as an adjunct to itsdiscount window programs.The special liquidity facility will be open from 1 October 1999 through 7 April 2000. It will beavailable to depository institutions operating in the United States and in sound financial condition.Loans must be adequately collateralized and will be made at a penalty rate of 150 basis points abovethe FOMC’s targeted federal funds rate. In contrast to subsidized adjustment credit, which will still be
BIS Review 103/19994available, borrowers under the SLF will not be required to first seek credit from market sources, andthe usage of borrowed funds will not be limited or monitored. Moreover, loans can be outstanding forany period while the facility is open. The Federal Reserve’s special liquidity facility is similar to theso-called “Lombard” credit facilities offered by a number of European central banks. We do not intendfor any supervisory or market stigma to be attached to use of the facility; if it does, then the potentialfor this facility to ease Y2K liquidity needs may not be fully realized. If banks are willing to utilize thefacility, it should help to maintain orderly markets and to cap the federal funds rate in those markets.One final point about liquidity – as I said above, we expect payment mechanisms to functionsmoothly. However, it is possible that currency demands will increase over the next few months. TheFederal Reserve is prepared to meet any currency demands that may arise, and we are taking a numberof steps to ensure that cash is stored at numerous sites around the country to allow banks to meet anysudden or unexpected spikes in the currency needs of their customers.International efforts and readinessAbroad on the international front, we have seen tremendous progress in the awareness of the Year2000 issue. Most countries now have Y2K national coordinators and are providing more informationabout their efforts. Again, the financial services sector abroad leads all others in preparedness. Theinternational telecommunications industry also appears ready, and service should be reliable betweenmajor cities. This progress again can be traced to a number of public and private-sector initiatives.United Nations Cooperation CenterEarlier this year, the United Nations Committee on Informatics held two highly successful meetingsfor national Y2K coordinators. The meetings were designed to promote awareness and provide toolsfor coordinators to use to organize domestic Year 2000 programs. At the second meeting held in June,more than 170 countries were represented – more countries than have ever attended a special UNmeeting. The UN is encouraging countries to issue disclosures about their Year 2000 programs andprogress and has established a Year 2000 Cooperation Center, which is publishing readiness countryreports disclosed by countries on a website. The Center will also publish reports on the impact of thedate change on critical sectors within countries during the rollover period. The website providesinformation on the status of key sectors within a country including the public infrastructure. Joint Year2000 Council In April 1998, a group of authorities on international financial market – the Joint Year2000 Council – was established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the Committee onPayment and Settlement Systems, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, and theInternational Organization of Securities Commissions. The council has provided the key forum forY2K communications among financial market authorities around the globe. To date, more than 100countries have participated in our activities. I chair the Joint Council, and I am very proud of what wehave achieved over the past year.The Joint Council has issued a number of guidance papers to assist regulators in organizing the Year2000 efforts of the financial services industries within their countries. These papers address the scopeand impact of the Year 2000 challenge, the independent assessment of the preparedness of financialinstitutions, testing, information sharing, and contingency planning. In addition, the Joint Councilissues bulletins summarizing recent developments and best practices for supervisors. Most important,the Joint Council is completing a second round of regional meetings that focus on contingencyplanning, event management, and public communications strategies. These meetings provide anexcellent opportunity for supervisors to discuss common interests within specific geographic areas, toshare information, and to coordinate regional plans in anticipation of the rollover.The Joint Council also serves as a point of contact for various national and international private-sectorinitiatives. In this regard, it has established an External Consultative Committee to enhanceinformation-sharing between the public and private sectors. The ECC includes representatives ofinternationally oriented organizations, including the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank,and the major cross-border financial utilities, such as S.W.I.F.T., for making international payments
5BIS Review 103/1999and settling transactions. The council is now in the process of establishing information sharingfacilities for financial market authorities to use during the rollover period.Private sector activityIn the international financial community, we have a highly active private sector that has been effectivein promoting the readiness of financial services firms and markets around the globe. As I mentionedearlier, private sector groups, such as the Global 2000 Coordinating Group, have been educatingprivate sector executives and public sector officials about the international interest in the readiness ofkey sectors in their countries that are critical to international commerce, such as telecommunication,power, financial service, shipping and transportation.No one can declare with certainty how the millennium rollover will unfold internationally, and muchof my information is anecdotal. However, the financial service sector is generally perceived to bebetter prepared than other sectors in almost every country. In general, I can report that the financialfirms of the developed countries, like those in the United States, either are, or appear to be makinggood progress toward being, prepared. Similarly, the financial institutions of a number of transitionaleconomies are well advanced. The financial institutions that are thought to have the furthest to go, ingeneral, are those in countries that are least dependent on technology. They have the greatestexperience with frequent disruptions of the type that one might expect during the changeover periodand can most easily return to manual workarounds or other contingency plans.During 1999, the financial community organized a series of very successful cross-border paymentsystems tests. Thirty-four separate national and international payments systems in nineteen countriesparticipated. More than 500 financial institutions successfully completed simulated Year 2000transactions on systems that were forward dated to simulate the rollover. For these tests to besuccessful, the participants had to have completed all necessary Year 2000 preparations to theirinternal systems. It therefore seems highly unlikely that the payment systems will be the source ofinstability during the century date change.ConclusionAlthough much work has been done within the United States and around the globe in anticipation ofthe century date change, we should not be complacent. There is still work to be done in terms ofcontingency planning and public communication. The Federal Reserve will continue its ongoingmonitoring of progress. We also intend to have close contact with the markets and financialinstitutions through the date change. While we cannot know with certainty what the century rolloverwill bring, we should, based on what we know today, experience a smooth transition, perhaps evenbusiness as usual.
1BIS Review 102/1999Mr Meyer highlights several issues on theFed’s agenda for bank supervision and regulationRemarks by Mr Laurence H Meyer, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem, before the Institute of International Bankers Annual Breakfast Dialogue, held inWashington, D.C. on 27 September 1999.*      *      *I am delighted to have this opportunity to join with the other distinguished members of this panelbefore the Institute of International Bankers. My goal this morning is to highlight several issues on theFed’s agenda for bank supervision and regulation.The first item never seems to leave the agenda: financial modernization. The issue has two sides: themarket process and the legal framework. In the market-driven process, financial institutions areincreasingly competing with each other – with banks seeking to expand the financial services theyoffer within banking organizations and, at the same time, non-bank financial institutions offeringmany bank-like products. This process has been under way for years, though constrained by theprevailing statutory limits. Legislation would allow the market process to evolve further and would, inaddition, refine the supervisory and regulatory framework for the diversified financial services firmsthat would emerge as a result of the legislation. Many of you know the details of the disagreementbetween Treasury and the Federal Reserve over what that supervisory framework and permissiblestructure should look like. Rather than restating those details, let me simply express the hope that theefforts of the regulators and Congress will ultimately be successful – in this millennium – in movingthe bill to passage.Being optimistic by nature, I turn to the challenges for both the banking system and the supervisors inadapting to the changes in banking and financial services that the passage of legislation would set inmotion. Developing cooperation and coordination among the multiple supervisors of financial servicesfirms would be one of the first.Financial modernization envisions a blend of functional and umbrella supervision. Depositoryinstitutions would continue to be supervised by their current bank or thrift regulators, with functionalregulation of the new non-bank activities by their specialized regulators and umbrella supervision ofthe diversified financial services holding company by the Federal Reserve. This approach has a lot torecommend it but requires a high degree of cooperation and coordination between and among the banksupervisors and the functional regulators, specifically securities and insurance. This cooperation isessential to limit the regulatory burden otherwise associated with multiple regulators. Banksupervisors need to be well informed about the risks to the banking organization – and the depositoryinstitution in particular – from activities taking place in affiliates and, perhaps also in some cases, inoperating subsidiaries. The umbrella supervisor will have to keep other regulators informed so theycan do their job as well.We have had some experience as bank regulators in managing these kinds of communications. TheFederal Reserve has worked hard with state banking authorities and with the OCC to increase thecoordination of our examination and supervisory efforts, and we will continue to look for ways toimprove this coordination as we also move to improve communication and coordination withfunctional regulators of the non-bank activities.The proposed blend of functional and umbrella supervision is one of several models for thesupervision of diversified financial services firms that include a bank. The United Kingdom, Australia,Switzerland, and some other countries have moved to a very different structure that relies on a singleconsolidated financial services regulator and eliminates supervisory and regulatory responsibilities atthe central bank. In this approach, the single regulator supervises bank and non-bank activities alike.
BIS Review 102/19992Some see this structure as the wave of the future, given the blurring of distinctions between financialservices.I wish our colleagues abroad the best of luck, but I think their legislatures have made a mistake. Theargument is that in a market that has increasingly eroded differences among and between financialinstitutions, the uniqueness of banks has declined and the combining of financial institution regulatorsand adoption of similar, if not identical, regulations makes sense. Adding a powerful single regulatorto a powerful and independent central bank would create an entity with significant authority outsidethe day-to-day direct purview of government, so governments have opted to combine the regulatorsand strip the supervisory and regulatory power from the central bank.But please note that they have continued to make their central banks responsible for financial stability.While macro financial tools and monetary policy may be sufficient to do that job most of the time,supervisory and regulatory policies have important economic and stability implications. Particularly ina crisis, a central bank without knowledge of the way markets actually operate – knowledge that cangained only by experience and hands-on contact with banking organizations – will be, if you willexcuse an ex-professor’s metaphor, at risk of failing its final exam. As a result, I think the separationof central banking and supervision and regulation is dangerous.The supervisory and regulatory approach in the United States, as embodied in financial modernizationlegislation that the Federal Reserve supports, is quite different from the trend abroad. It provides animportant role for the central bank in the process as an umbrella supervisor. It also makes an importantdistinction between the insured depository institution in the banking organization and its non-bankaffiliates (or perhaps in some cases, its operating subsidiaries). Specifically, this approach envisions aless intense degree of supervision and regulation of the non-bank activities than for the depositoryinstitution itself. This reflects the role of the safety net in undermining market discipline of depositoryinstitutions and the role that supervisors must play to discipline risk-taking by them as a result.On the other hand, market discipline appears to operate more effectively with respect to non-bankfinancial institutions and, if the regulators do their job right, to non-bank activities within bankingorganizations. As non-bank activities grow within banking organizations, regulators must be alert tomarket inferences that non-bank activities within a banking organization are covered by an expandedsafety net. Regulators must establish appropriate expectations with respect to the limits of the safetynet, and confirm these expectations by their actions, to maximize market discipline of the non-bankactivities and minimize the level of intrusion. The alternative, to impose bank-like regulation on non-bank activities, is exactly the wrong direction. We would rather work towards enhancing theeffectiveness of market discipline on banks. I will return to the task of enhancing market discipline ina moment.While President McDonough will discuss the ongoing work of the Basel Committee on BankingSupervision to reform the Basel Accord, I want to emphasize its importance on our agenda. Mostobservers think, quite correctly, of the Basel Accord exclusively in terms of minimum capitalstandards. But the Basel consultative paper is consistent with the Federal Reserve’s long-standingemphasis that minimum capital standards are just a part of the framework for enhancing the safety andsoundness of the banking system. Indeed, the paper encourages a rebalancing of emphasis towardssupervision and market discipline.With respect to minimum regulatory capital standards, the most important task is to make the capitalrequirements for the banking book more risk sensitive. Banks are increasingly estimating the risk oftheir individual loans and allocating their economic capital accordingly. When internal capitalallocations result in decidedly lower capital than required under the Accord, the choice is either to stopmaking such loans or to find ways to lower the capital charges applied to them, taking advantage of avariety of transactions, including securitizations and credit derivatives. Their capital arbitrageactivities have shown banks to be much more adept in shedding capital requirements than in reducingrisks. The solution is to reform the capital standards so they are more consistent with the underlyingrisks in the banking book and to reduce – if not eliminate – the incentive for and the ability to conductregulatory capital arbitrage. That is the principle. The question is how to achieve this end. We lookforward to the comments from the banking industry on proposals to use external ratings or banks’ own
3BIS Review 102/1999internal risk-rating systems to produce a more risk sensitive assessment of minimum capitalrequirements for the banking book.As useful as a more risk sensitive minimum capital standard would be, the fact is that most banks holdcapital well in excess of the regulatory minimum. Therefore, one of the most important directions forbank supervision – at least with respect to the largest and most complex banks – is to place moreemphasis on the supervisory assessment of the appropriate economic capital for a bank. The Baselconsultative paper points in this direction, and the Federal Reserve is already moving to implementsuch an approach. Recent supervisory guidance stressed that banks should set a target for capital thatshould be appropriately aligned with the risk profile and risk-management capability of the bank.Bank supervisors will assess the adequacy of this target level of capital in their examinations of banks,and banks should defend their target level of capital to the market.This approach will give further impetus to the advances already well under way in the bankingindustry to refine the measurement of risk and the allocation of capital using internal risk ratings andinternal models. This will hopefully yield an important synergy between banks and their supervisors:the better the risk measurement and management of banks, the better the opportunity of bankregulators and supervisors to lever off these practices in the setting of regulatory capital standards.Another part of the rebalancing is towards increased emphasis on market discipline. I have noted thatthe safety net dampens the incentive of the market to assess risks in banks. The solution is not toignore the potential for market discipline, but rather to find ways to enhance its role in banking.At the Federal Reserve, we are beginning to pay closer attention to market measures of risk, includingmeasures derived by comparing uninsured deposit rates, equity prices, and subordinated debt yields.These measures may prove useful in alerting supervisors to changes in the market perception of risk. Ihave on previous occasions discussed the potential of a mandatory subordinated debt requirement forincreasing the incentive of market participants – in this case subordinated debt holders – to monitor therisk-taking of banks. While we have no plans to move forward with such a requirement at this time, Icontinue to find this proposal intriguing, and we will continue to study its potential usefulness.Market discipline is reinforced by enhanced public disclosure of risk positions and risk-managementcapabilities. We have recently assessed the adequacy of disclosure and believe there are opportunitiesfor banks – especially the large, complex banking organizations with a large share of their assetsfunded by uninsured liabilities – to reveal more information. One possibility would be to have anindustry-led task force identify best-practice with respect to bank disclosure and provide banks with anincentive to move towards this best practice frontier. Any such effort should be flexible, notnecessarily dictating the same disclosures for all banks but allowing banks to choose the mosteffective ways to disclose – through both qualitative and quantitative information.In our supervisory practices and regulatory standards we draw a distinction between the largest andmost complex banking organizations (what we refer to as LCBOs) and the overwhelming majority ofsmall and medium-sized banks. For example, while I applaud the direction in the Basel consultativepaper towards a more sophisticated and more risk sensitive minimum capital standard, I do not believethis more complex system is warranted or appropriate for the overwhelming majority of US banks. Weare therefore thinking about what the banking agencies are calling bifurcation, using a simpler capitalstandard for the thousands of smaller and medium-sized banks as we adjust our capital requirementsfor the large complex organizations to better fit their risk profiles. We already have differentintensities of supervisory oversight at large complex banks and at small and medium-sized banks, andhave singled out a very small number of the largest and most complex banks for a program thatfeatures an enhanced focus on risk management and internal controls, the use of internal credit-ratingsystems, and internal analyses of capital in relation to risk. This trend will continue.Let me close with a comment about a possible relaxation in credit discipline that our supervisoryreviews have detected at some banks. Now, don’t mistake me; loan portfolios remain sound overall.But loans falling into criticized categories have been rising modestly at some banks over the pastseveral quarters. That’s troubling because the increase has surfaced despite the continuation offavorable economic and financial conditions in the United States. It appears the vulnerability of theseloans was heightened in some cases by weak underwriting practices. In these cases, a recurring theme
BIS Review 102/19994has emerged. Lenders are relying too much on the continuation of good times. They’re assuming avery optimistic view of their borrowers’ operating prospects and that their borrowers always will haveready access to financial markets. And sometimes they’re failing to subject loans to meaningful “stresstests” that would, for instance, tell them if their borrower could withstand an unexpected shock tooperating revenue. These are the kinds of developments that tend to get the attention of banksupervisors, and ought to get the attention of banks and other lenders.I have raised a number of questions and perhaps answered a few. Thank you for the opportunity to doso.
1BIS Review 101/1999Mr Haferkamp focuses onEuropean capital markets in the first year of EMUKeynote address given by Mr Dieter Haferkamp, Member of the Directorate of the DeutscheBundesbank, at the conference on “The Pfandbrief: Global Perspectives for Europe’s Biggest BondMarket” in London on 28 September 1999.*      *      *1.I am delighted to have been given this opportunity to speak at this now almost traditionalPfandbrief conference. Keynote speakers at a Euromoney conference have the privilege of choosingtheir own topic. I am not a “Pfandbrief” specialist. As a representative of the central bank of a countryparticipating in monetary union, I feel more at home making some comments on the monetary andcapital market policy environment, which is likely to have a major impact on the development of theEuropean bond markets and thus also on the fate of the Pfandbrief.In many ways, the liberalisation of investment services in the European Economic Area, the creationof electronic markets and the internationalisation of financial portfolios did away with thesegmentation of Europe’s capital markets even in the years prior to monetary union.But then, overnight, the start of European monetary union brought about major structural changeswhich forced all the market participants to undergo the appropriate processes of adjustment. Thisapplies also, and especially, to the market for Pfandbriefe.The German Pfandbrief goes back more than 200 years. However, only during the past few years havethe international capital markets discovered it. The Pfandbrief’s success story is attributable to twofactors. The Pfandbrief has an excellent credit quality, and it firmly embodies the principle of investorprotection. Admittedly, neither of these advantages would have sufficed by themselves for thePfandbrief to hold its own in intensified European and global competition. It was only the efforts madeby German mortgage banks to market these bonds internationally which enabled this traditionalGerman product to achieve a breakthrough in the markets.The most important milestone in these efforts was undoubtedly the introduction of Jumbo bonds inMay 1995. With the characteristics of the Jumbos the Pfandbrief was also equipped with the liquiditywhich globally operating investors expect of today’s capital market instruments. And allow me, as arepresentative of the German central bank, to add that the stability of the D-Mark, which was the mostimportant currency of issue for Pfandbriefe up to the introduction of the euro, contributed more andmore to attracting international investors to the Pfandbrief product.Like German government bonds up to the end of last year, the Pfandbrief, too, enjoyed the competitiveadvantage of having a strong domestic currency. Now, nine months after the start of monetary union,it can be stated that both products, Pfandbriefe and German Federal bonds, have successfully made thetransition to the age of the euro. Even without the seal of quality of the D-Mark as the issuingcurrency, the German Pfandbrief was not only able to maintain its position but also to continuouslyimprove it. Thanks to a thoroughgoing and consistent process of modernisation, it has become aninternational brand-name product which has prompted issuers in other countries to considerintroducing similar products. Spain and France are two current examples here.I would now like to comment on two questions:• What were the most important changes in the Pfandbrief environment caused by theintroduction of the euro? What is the shape of the “new” European capital market in whichthe Pfandbrief has to stand up to competition?• And what are the global perspectives of the Pfandbrief market, the subject of today’sconference?
BIS Review 101/199922.What changes have now taken place in the capital markets following the introduction of theeuro?The most important consequence of the introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999 has certainly beenthe elimination of the exchange-rate risk, which, up to the beginning of the monetary union, was animportant reason for the segmentation of European financial markets. The euro area has now becomethe second largest bond market after the US. The euro area countries have a share of slightly less thanone-quarter of the worldwide bond markets.The reasons for this were the conversion of bonds in circulation at a very early stage and very buoyantissuing activity in the first few months of monetary union. The distinction between domestic, foreignand Eurobonds has become largely meaningless. The single currency offers issuers a broader financingbase and allows investors to choose from a much wider range of bonds and stocks in which they caninvest without an exchange-rate risk.The convergence of the national markets to form a large and liquid European capital market, however,is a process which is not yet complete. Many private investors still prefer to invest nationally. It isprimarily large enterprises that have benefited so far from the freedom of the enlarged markets whentaking up funds.Even so, competition is well under way. Issuers are compelled to gear their issuing policy moreclosely to the requirements of international investors. Banks and European stock exchanges andfinancial centres are also feeling the higher wind speed of competition in the euro area. The euro zonehas accelerated the change engendered by the advance of globalisation; in a sense, European financialmarkets are undergoing a dual process of radical change.Many enterprises are finding that the larger and more liquid Euro capital market offers morefavourable financing conditions than traditional financing via a bank loan. Therefore, powerfulborrowers are reconsidering their method of refinancing and are more and more taking the direct routeto the capital market and the financial service providers operating there. The disintermediation of thebanks in the wholesale market is increasing. Securitisation is intensifying competition among thebanks and is having a crucial impact on the structure of the banking system.Competition among financial centres has become harder as well. In securities business, the costs andthe transparency of the trading platforms as well as the efficiency of the settlement systems havebecome increasingly important in choosing which financial centre to use. Thus, competition amongfinancial centres is increasingly also becoming a competition among systems. Now that the triumphantprogress of computerisation has become unstoppable, the race for the establishment of electronictrading systems has become more heated. Fiercer competition, in terms of both products and costs, hasnecessitated concentration and cooperation. The splitting up of the trading platforms for the spot andfutures markets into individual markets and the fragmentation of settlement systems with inefficientand cost-ineffective settlement procedures, especially those for cross-border securities trading, are nolonger suited to the age of the single currency.3.Addressing the issue of the global perspectives of the European financial markets, in general,and the Pfandbrief market, in particular, requires a brief review of the developments in the Europeanfinancial markets since 1 January 1999.In the money market, the changeover to the euro and to the single monetary policy has taken placerapidly and smoothly. The development of a single European money market made such progressduring the first nine months of monetary union that it can now be described as integrated and liquid.This is a crucial factor both for the ECB’s monetary policy, which is geared to the stability of the euro,and for the development of the European capital market.A key factor contributing to the rapid integration of the Euro money market is the TARGET system.TARGET’s main objectives for the monetary policy of the Eurosystem and the Euro money markethave been achieved; the provision of a safe and reliable mechanism for the settlement of cross-borderpayments and a rapid and effective increase in the efficiency of cross-border payments within the EU.In July, a daily average of slightly more than (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:7)(cid:6)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:4)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:4)(cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:11)(cid:9)(cid:12)(cid:11)(cid:15)(cid:13)(cid:16)(cid:17)(cid:4)(cid:18)(cid:6)(cid:11)(cid:4)(cid:13)(cid:19)(cid:16)(cid:4)(cid:20)(cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:23)(cid:24)(cid:20)(cid:4)(cid:12)(cid:25)(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:16)(cid:26)(cid:27)
3BIS Review 101/1999The Eurosystem’s monetary policy instruments are working smoothly. The main refinancingoperations are fulfilling the functions assigned to them, which is to signal the monetary policy stance,to steer the money market rates and to supply the banking system with the bulk of liquidity.Supplying the banking system with liquidity on a more sustained basis through the longer-termrefinancing operations is not posing any problems either. The standing facilities have effectivelylimited the overnight interest rates. The averaging provision applying within the minimum reservesystem has contributed to smoothing out daily fluctuations of liquidity. Previous experience has shownthat the Eurosystem’s operational framework constitutes an effective set of instruments for steeringmoney market rates and limiting their fluctuations.By the way, it seems remarkable to me in this context that the dispute over the benchmark rate in theEuro money markets was resolved in favour of the EURIBOR far more quickly than many marketparticipants had expected. The day-to-day money market rate for the euro (EONIA), which isascertained by the ECB, has established itself as a representative picture of the market conditions inthe euro area. EONIA and EURIBOR cover the whole range of the Euro money market reference ratesin a consistent manner.For the Pfandbrief market, it was crucial in connection with the decisions on the monetary policyinstruments that Pfandbriefe were included in the list of tier-one assets and were thus treated“neutrally” in monetary policy terms relative to government bonds. This status has certainly benefitedthe competitive position of the Pfandbriefe by increasing its liquidity.The bond markets had already partly anticipated the introduction of the euro, although, in the finalanalysis, the euro bonds issued prior to the start of monetary union were nothing other than ECUbonds with the pre-announced conversion rate of 1 to 1.The decision taken by the major issuers to redenominate bonds in circulation from the nationalcurrency to euro at the beginning of January this year and to standardise the very different marketpractices in Europe on internationally consistent market conventions resulted almost overnight in theemergence of a large and liquid Euro-bond market.In this context, all the market participants were focusing their attention on the question of who wouldset the benchmark for the euro area. Even in the run-up to monetary union, competition among publicissuers had increased owing to the forthcoming abolition of the exchange-rate-induced yielddifferentials. The German Federal Government positioned itself at an early stage for the changedcompetitive situation and, in cooperation with the Bundesbank, took a number of measures to enhancethe attractiveness of its bonds. These measures included, in particular, concentrating the instrumentson the five major maturity ranges (six months, two, five, ten and 30 years), increasing the volume ofindividual issues, concentrating the Federal Government’s and its special funds’ borrowing on theuniform issuer’s name “Federal Republic of Germany”, introducing the stripping option in order tocapture the yield curve as completely as possible, and introducing a transparent and efficient issuemethod.Further improvements are currently under discussion, for example, with respect to the five-year“Bobls”, whose present dual role as paper for small private investors and for institutional investors iscriticised by major market players.These measures have enabled Germany to set the benchmark in the important ten-year maturity range.At the same time, the Bund future has risen to become the most-traded futures contract in the world.Incidentally, the market for “Jumbo Pfandbrief Bonds” has also benefited from the benchmark role ofthe German Federal bonds. This market seems to have good prospects of assuming the benchmarkfunction within the Euro-spread markets in terms of liquidity, credit standing and the stability of thespread over Federal bonds.The equity markets cannot yet keep up with the Europe-wide performance of the money and bondmarkets. The stock exchange environment in Europe with its differing rules and regulations is stillheavily fragmented. With more than 30 stock exchanges, Europe has an enormously high density ofsuch places. The associated fragmentation of liquidity is naturally not conducive to an efficient and
BIS Review 101/19994transparent price formation process. Different underlying legal and tax conditions as well as differentaccounting rules also hinder the process of growing together to form a single European equity market.Integration and/or harmonisation is a slow-moving process in this instance, because company, tax andbalance sheet laws are integral parts of each national legal system with its own history and tradition.Adjustments and amendments are bound to have an impact on other areas of legislation, too.Regulations which differ from country to country therefore constitute major obstacles to theintegration of the markets.The European Commission recently pointed out in a note to the Council and the European Parliamentthat the differing taxation of investment income, differing accounting standards and differing rules forsupervision are major obstacles to a complete integration of the European capital markets.There are signs of progress, at least in some areas; a case in point are the efforts being made by theForum of European Securities Commissions (FESCO). But the stock exchanges themselves are alsocalled upon to play their part in the necessary consolidation of the market structures and to set asidenational interests; today, no European stock exchange can any longer afford to pursue “go-alone”strategies. It now seems foreseeable that the infrastructure of a European stock exchange network willbe an electronic one. Local stock market centres are diminishing in significance to the extent thatmodern technologies are increasingly allowing market participation from any desired location. Itappears that all parties involved have now recognised these developments and started to actaccordingly.4.What are the conclusions to be drawn from this brief review of the European financialmarkets nine months after the start of monetary union?The integration of the money markets may be regarded as almost completed. It is far advanced in thebond market. The stock market still has the largest need for adjustment. As a result, it is primarily inthe stock market that market forces are currently working for change. The recent decision made byEuropean stock exchanges on the creation of a “virtual” cross-border-market is evidence of this. Thecommon market model presented last week should be an interim solution only. It is in the interest ofthe economy as a whole that efforts to create a single European stock market with a single tradingplatform make progress. In the long term, investors and issuers will not be content with fragmentedmarkets.An efficient and competitive stock exchange in the euro area also needs efficient clearing andsettlement. Experience gained in the United States shows that concentrating on a comprehensivesettlement system with a settlement platform which is also competitive worldwide is necessary forthis. The trend is already clearly towards a consolidation of the many different existing clearingsystems in the euro area, which will then also permit closer links between trading and settlement.An initial major step towards the necessary concentration of clearing and settlement systems has beenmade with the merger of Cedel International and Deutsche Börse Clearing. It would be desirable thatat the end of the integration process, there would be a European stock market with a single Europeansettlement system. In all cases, the central banks are closely watching the continuing developments.Although the harmonisation efforts in the bond markets are more advanced than those on the stockmarkets and stock exchanges, this does not mean that the developments triggered by monetary unionhave already come to an end there. The rapid rise in cross-border capital flows continues to boostcompetition. In addition, in view of the still relatively low level of interest rates, investors areincreasingly looking for spread products which offer a higher yield than government bonds. Despitethe considerable progress made in convergence during the run-up to monetary union, Europeangovernment bonds are still showing yield spreads which are mainly due to the different levels ofliquidity and credit standing. But these have now become so small that they offer investors hardly anyinteresting opportunities for diversification in terms of spreads.This may be unsatisfactory for the smaller member states of monetary union which have difficulties inensuring sufficient market liquidity over the entire range of the yield curve. However, I believe thatthe proposal of conducting joint securities issues of the EU countries through a single issuance agency
5BIS Review 101/1999has little chance of success. Experience of corresponding issues by German federal states has shownthat even minor differences in credit standing between the individual debtors behind the single creditfinancing lead to a divergence of interests and make any agreement on a single issue project virtuallyimpossible. In addition, there are legal and practical problems, such as the lack of a legal basis forjoint liability for such single issues which make a proposal of this kind appear not very realistic.Competition should therefore be maintained among public sector issuers. In the interest of efficientmarkets, competition ensures that public sector debt management has to strive continually forborrowing at the lowest costs possible. This is the only way of maintaining the discipline which themarket imposes on the public sector through country-specific spreads.The situation is no different in the market for Pfandbriefe. Foreign Jumbo mortgage bonds, which relyheavily on the legal basis of the German Mortgage Bank Act, have been forcing their way into theinternational capital markets for the first time during the past few weeks. The market for spreadproducts, into which yield-oriented investors can diversify their investments, is hence becomingincreasingly diverse and competition for German Pfandbriefe is intensifying.The market for corporate bonds has been growing strongly in Europe but not as strongly as predictedby optimistic forecasts. In the longer term, however, financing via bonds is likely to become aworthwhile alternative for enterprises. The market for corporate bonds might receive an additionalboost from the persistent wave of mergers in Europe. Financing of corporate mergers is often onlypossible through borrowed funds which are likely to be increasingly financed by the issue of corporatebonds. Finally, investors who are looking for new yield and diversification opportunities will possiblystep up demand for higher-yielding bonds.There are hence signs that, from a spread point of view, corporate bonds might become the mostimportant investment category competing for investors in the future European bond market alongsidegovernment bonds, Pfandbriefe and bank bonds. Other products, such as asset backed securities orhigh-yield junk bonds, are also likely to gain in importance.The German Pfandbrief market offering high creditworthiness and liquidity as well as high-yieldpremiums compared with government bonds has good prospects of becoming the most importantspread market in the euro area. The example of the US agency market has shown that high marketliquidity, representation of the entire yield curve and the transparency of the issuing policy are crucialfactors for a successful positioning in the spread market ranking. The German mortgage banks havealready successfully tapped this potential over the past few years by a corresponding expansion oftheir product range and a commensurate marketing strategy.5.Up to the end of last year – as I have already mentioned – the German capital market and itsmost important products, the Federal Government bonds and the Jumbo Pfandbriefe benefitedcrucially from the stability of the D-Mark. In the same way, the development of the European capitalmarket will hinge on the stability of the euro and on international investors’ confidence in the stabilitypolicy of the European Central Bank.To a certain extent, monetary policy and the capital markets are mutually dependent: the capitalmarket needs a stable currency, since monetary stability is the foundation on which the capital marketscan flourish. It encourages savings and makes a crucial contribution to long-term capital formation. Itimproves the real performance of financial assets and thus makes a flight into material assetssuperfluous.Conversely, efficient, highly competitive and stable financial markets are of great importance for theimplementation of monetary policy. It is true that the capital market is not the direct area of operationsfor monetary policy. That is the money market. But a successful central bank policy depends on thepredictable and rapid transmission of its measures through efficient and stable financial markets as awhole, which means the money and capital markets.The independence of the European Central Bank, its commitment to a stability-oriented monetarypolicy and the strict criteria of the Maastricht Treaty are a sound basis for an enduringly stable singlecurrency. It is true that the euro has lost in value against the US dollar on foreign exchange markets
BIS Review 101/19996since the beginning of the year. I will not make any comments on this here. Enough has been said onthis subject by competent and sometimes not-so-competent commentators. The rapid growth ofEuropean interest-rate markets and the high buoyancy of the European capital market in the first ninemonths of monetary union do not suggest that there is a very pronounced lack of confidence in theeuro.The future development of the euro as an international investment and issuing currency will bedecided primarily by the markets. The preconditions for continued growth of the euro financialmarkets are good. The euro capital market offers private issuers of debt securities and equitiesconsiderable advantages. The greater number of issuers and investors who settle their transactions inthe same currency enhances liquidity and allows larger issue volumes. This reduces refinancing costs.The larger currency area will in the future also attract new investors and issuers to the capital marketsin the euro area. German mortgage banks have positioned themselves early for this development, thejumbo Pfandbrief is outstandingly well-suited to the changed environment of monetary union. Theglobal perspectives for Europe’s biggest bond market therefore hold out a great deal of promise.
1BIS Review 100/1999Mr Schieber looks at the stability of the euro as an economicand political challenge from the perspective of the Deutsche BundesbankLecture given by Mr Helmut Schieber, Member of the Board of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at theinvitation of the America-European Community Association in London on 23 September 1999.*      *      *At first glance, the title of my lecture seems to be a “non-subject”, or at least a completelyanachronistic subject: given an inflation rate of 1.1 percentage points in July, the absolute limit ofunder 2% set by the ECB Governing Council still looks far away. Hence, despite a number of riskfactors (such as the steep upturn in oil prices) the stability of the euro is presumably not currently injeopardy. This optimistic conclusion is suggested by the following factors:(1) the low interest-rate level by historical standards. The recent rise in longer-term interest ratesno doubt mirrors more favourable expectations for business activity; it is rather to beregarded as a rejection of the spectre of deflation than as a reflection of latent inflationexpectations;(2) the keen competition on the factor and goods markets (due to globalisation and the launch ofthe euro) results, on the one hand, in a substantial growth of productivity but, on the other,also in strong downward price pressure in some sectors (in Germany, for instance, in theareas of telecommunications and electricity);(3) In view of the substantial unutilised capacity, the emerging revitalisation of business activitymay well make non-inflationary growth possible for the production factors capital and labouralike.Regardless of the prevailing macroeconomic setting, the excellent underlying institutional conditionsfor the euro should always be borne in mind in any discussion of the stability of the euro: to enable itto perform its primary task of maintaining monetary stability, the ECB was endowed, under the Treatyof Maastricht, with a high degree of independence. Notwithstanding a number of dissenting voices,especially from the English-speaking area, the ECB has a convincing monetary policy strategy. Inaddition, the Eurosystem possesses a comprehensive, up-to-date and market-oriented range ofmonetary policy instruments, which have already proved their worth in the short period since the eurowas launched. Finally, it is worth pointing out that the ECB Governing Council has swiftly grown intoa body with common convictions and perceptions; in the process, it has increasingly generated aEuropean “stability culture” distinct from particular national interests.In view of these auspicious underlying economic and institutional conditions, it appears completelymisplaced to worry about the stability of the euro. And yet, it is a long-standing experience of theBundesbank that inflation has often been declared dead, but has never actually died. Nothing is moredangerous than complacency and slackening vigilance.Where might any future risks to the stability of the euro lie? Well, in the first place, a number ofunavoidable problems arise in connection with the transition to a larger common monetary area.It is doubtful, for instance, whether the demand for, and the velocity of circulation of, money in thenew monetary area will be sufficiently stable from the outset. What will be the impact of, say,structural changes in the financial sector (catchwords are: the trend towards securitisation and towardsdisintermediation)? What will be the implications for the monetary policy of the ECB of the differingmonetary policy transmission channels within the eurozone?These transitional difficulties should not be made light of, by any means. Even so, they will diminishin significance – albeit not in the short run – as increasing experience is gained within the Eurosystem.
BIS Review 100/19992It will certainly be interesting to see how the ECB responds the first time that it feels a “head wind”. Itis a long-standing experience of the Bundesbank that the acid test of monetary policy comes when arestrictive policy stance has to be pursued. In this context, the prevailing structure of the Eurosystemnaturally raises a variety of special questions:1.Will the ECB Governing Council act quickly and resolutely even if it were to be confrontedwith massive political opposition?2.Will the general public in Europe support the ECB just as unreservedly as German citizensbacked the Bundesbank, i.e. will the ECB enjoy comparable backing for its stabilisationpolicy?3.Will the ECB Governing Council abide by its orientation towards the euro area even if thatpolicy no longer seems appropriate for particular parts of that area?4.How will the monetary policy of the ECB respond if the ECOFIN Council exercises itspowers under Article 111 of the EC Treaty, for instance by formulating general orientationsor exchange-rate policy? Will the stability reservation laid down in that clause actually holdup?In my opinion, the ECB deserves our full confidence in all of these questions. But on the other hand, itis obvious that the ECB, as a new institution, initially has to earn public confidence (and thus at thesame time due scope for the formulation of current monetary policy), even though it is likely to haveinherited a certain “advance” of confidence from the Bundesbank.But the crucial issue affecting the stability of the euro will be that of how the relationship betweennational fiscal, economic, structural and wage policy, on the one hand, and supranational monetarypolicy, on the other, will evolve in the euro area.The fundamental problem is the same as in every country. A central bank can control the expansion ofthe money stock, at least over the medium term. But it depends on the other policy areas whether theleeway thus gained is exploited• for real economic growth at stable prices, or• for raising prices, accompanied by stagnating or even declining economic performance.Thus, for preserving monetary stability, a central bank is always dependent on the cooperation of thegovernment in power and of the parties to wage settlements; it is only by means of a policy-mix that iscompatible with stability that non-inflationary growth can ultimately be achieved.In the euro area we are now facing a special problem: a single monetary policy for eleven memberstates is accompanied by national responsibility for wage policy, fiscal policy and economic policy.It is true that a closer coordination of fiscal and economic policies is envisaged by Articles 98, 99 and104 of the EC Treaty, and by what is known as the Stability and Growth Pact (i.e. above all: decisionson common features of economic policy and mutual budget surveillance), but these coordinationmechanisms still have to prove their worth in practice. A great deal will depend on policymakersbehaving with sufficient discipline in the interests of the stability of the single currency.In order to shed more light on this dilemma, permit me briefly to address a particularly ticklishproblem: assuming that a restrictive policy is being pursued, an increase in interest rates would havewidely differing effects on the budget situations of the various member states, since the levels andmaturity patterns of public debt diverge vastly. As this naturally also affects compliance with the rulesof the Stability and Growth Pact, a restrictive monetary policy also involves additional conflictpotential.In this context, the important question of the durability of the internal cohesion of the euro area mustnot be disregarded, either.On the one hand, in view of the continued convergence and integration of the eurozone, optimismcertainly seems warranted: that is suggested by the increasing cyclical synchrony, the progressiveintegration of the financial markets (and especially of the European money market), and the
3BIS Review 100/1999completion of the single European market. On the other hand, substantial regional differences anddivergences cannot be ruled out (just think, for instance, of the North/South divide in Italy, and theEast/West divide in Germany due to reunification). The range of possible causes could not be wider,for example• asymmetric external shocks,• divergent pay settlements,• differing national policy priorities, or• diverse national structural conditions.Generally speaking, it is true to say that, the more flexible national goods, services and labour marketsare, the lower will be the demand for compensatory measures on the part of national fiscal, economicand structural policies. But precisely market flexibility is a weak link in many European member states(and that goes particularly for Germany). In many cases there is a considerable need for reform, e.g.with respect to reducing the government expenditure ratio, deregulation, restructuring of socialsecurity systems or adjusting tax legislation.There are, however, good grounds for hoping that the pressure exerted by the single currency willgreatly foster the reform process. Yet even if major steps are taken towards flexibility, the risk ofnational or regional special developments can never be ruled out altogether.Whereas it used to be possible, at least to a certain degree, to respond to special national problems bymodifying the interest rate and/or the exchange rate, this option is no longer available in the monetaryunion. The consequence is that the demands made on political compensatory measures, on thewillingness and ability of national policymakers to respond, and on the European coordination processhave definitely risen. National failure, especially on the part of a major country, may have apronounced impact on the common interest-rate level and/or on the external value of the euro.Finally, this state of affairs also gives rise to the question of the suitability of the underlyinginstitutional conditions, i.e. of the EC Treaty. Considerable doubts exist as to whether, in the light ofthe demands described above on a policy compatible with the euro, the demarcation of responsibilitiesbetween the European level and the national level, the rules for coordinating Community decisionsand the structures of the European institutions are appropriate and efficient. That is particularly true ifthe planned enlargement of the EU, and also of EMU, is taken into account. There is a lot of evidencesuggesting that the latest amendment of the EC Treaty by the Treaty of Amsterdam (known as theMaastricht II Treaty) has failed to solve these major problems.All this makes two things very clear:1.The launch of the euro is a political act, and far more than a mere technical development. Ithas substantial implications for economic and political structures and responsibilities inEurope.2.The stability of the euro is a major challenge not only to the Eurosystem but likewise to theeconomic and fiscal policies of member states and to the coordination of those policies.To sum up, I should like to emphasise once again that, all in all, the euro has got off to a good start,also in the light of the counterinflationary policy setting. But the acid test still lies ahead. The majoropportunities afforded by the euro are accompanied by corresponding risks and challenges. The fate ofthe euro in the years ahead will hinge crucially on whether member states become aware of this task,and on how they address it. This issue will certainly also play a major role in the forthcoming debatesin the UK and other countries on joining the Eurosystem. I very much hope that the behaviour of theeuro member states will make it easier for the nations and governments in question to reach afavourable decision.
1BIS Review 99/1999Mr Ferguson asks whether information technology is the key to higherproductivity growth in the United States and abroadRemarks by Mr Robert W Ferguson Jr, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem, before the 2000 Global Economic and Investment Outlook Conference at the Carnegie BoschInstitute, Pittsburgh on 21 September 1999.*      *      *The last few years have seen an explosion in the uses of information technology throughout theAmerican economy. At the same time, trend US productivity growth appears to have risen to itshighest rate since the 1970s. Casual empiricism would suggest a connection – that the enormousinvestment in computer technology that has been going on for at least twenty years has finally startedto bear fruit. But although information technology is available, at least in theory, to the whole world,the recent surge in productivity growth appears to have been stronger in the United States thanelsewhere, including the other industrialized countries. This raises the interesting questions of whatelse besides simple availability is needed to translate the promise of information technology into realproductivity gains and whether – whatever it is – the United States has more of it?These questions are impossible to answer with precision, so the purpose of my talk this afternoon is toidentify particular features of the American economy that might contribute to an especially hospitableclimate for translating the potential gains from information technology into actual productivity growth.I also want to be careful not to suggest that gains from the use of information technology can safely beassumed to go on indefinitely at their recent pace. The recent technical advances represent acontinuation of a long string of fundamental leaps in technology that have worked their way throughthe economic system over many years, boosting productivity growth in the process, but how long aparticular innovation has a beneficial effect on productivity growth is difficult to say. That depends onthe rate of investment in the equipment that embodies the new technology, the rate at which the laborforce is able to acquire needed skills, and, of course, on the fundamental potential of the technologyitself. History demonstrates that the boost to productivity growth from a particular technologicaladvance is not unlimited and eventually will be fully exploited. Just as “trees do not grow to the sky”,so, too, increases in the rate of productivity growth from any given advance are not without limits.One should be cautious in extrapolating from past trends.What we do knowWhat we do know is that the use of information technology, at least in the United States, has beengrowing by leaps and bounds. For example, personal and business Internet sites have proliferated at anastounding rate and a wide variety of tasks that used to require person-to-person contact, such asmaking airline and other travel reservations and choosing and ordering merchandise, can now be donevia the Web. Search engines have cut the time needed to track down a person or an item to a fractionof the amount previously required, clearly raising productivity. Improved communication andinformation flow are only part of the story; increases in computing power also allow workers tocomplete a variety of tasks more quickly.Although it sometimes feels as if these changes are taking place at lightning speed, most of us knowthat this is partly an illusion. Much of the basic technology has been around for decades. In fact, asproductivity growth slowed in the 1970s and continued to languish in the 1980s, many observerswondered whether the supposed benefits of cheaper and more powerful computers would ever berealized. This highlights an important facet of the innovation process: the benefits of a new technologyare in no sense automatically conferred on the economy, but will show up only after the technology iswidely adopted, capital facilities are refitted and adapted to it and workers learn to use it. For instance,
BIS Review 99/19992Paul David, a Stanford University economist, notes that electric motors did not boost productivitygrowth appreciably until more than forty years after Edison installed the first dynamo in 1881.Though a new technology typically will not be fully incorporated overnight, the speed of its adoptioncan be faster or slower depending on the institutional and other features of the economy. Forinformation technology, the process of incorporation appears to be taking place at a considerably fasterrate in the United States than in other parts of the industrialized world. For example, there are morethan 23 million Internet hosts in the United States – roughly one for every 11 people. Canada is secondamong the major industrial economies with 1.6 million, one for every 19 people. In contrast, the ratiosare about 1 to 128 people in France and 1 to 174 people in Italy.These statistics suggest that technology is being used more widely in the United States, but is its usepaying off? The answer appears to be “Yes.” One pertinent piece of evidence is a recent study of costsof managing cash flow in American versus European firms. The study showed European costs to beroughly 30% above those of US firms, largely because of the slow adoption of information and othercomputer-based technologies. This is pertinent because finance operations of this type are an essentialactivity in every firm.If it is the case that the United States, at least at this juncture, is somewhat ahead of the rest of theworld in realizing the benefits of information technology, does this indicate that our economy orsociety possess certain characteristics that are particularly conducive to rapid diffusion of technicalchange? A recent study of innovation by the Agamus Consulting firm provides some interestinginsights. The United States placed second to the Netherlands out of thirteen countries in a survey thatasked companies to rate the “innovation climate” in their home countries. A second and possibly moreobjective ranking, based on a measure of innovative success developed by Agamus, placed the UnitedStates first. The most important factor cited as conducive to innovation was the overall educationalstandard. Given various cross-country comparisons of educational systems, I assume that this findingmust be based on our broad-based attainment of higher education.Additional possible relevant factorsI would like to suggest several other factors that might also make some difference. This is not meant tobe either a comprehensive or a definitive list. Instead, it is an attempt to advance some hypotheses thatmight help to explain the recent dynamism of the American economy compared with some of its majortrading partners – in particular its link to technological change – and to see to what extent the evidencesupports them. The particular features that I would like to discuss (not necessarily in order ofimportance) are corporate governance and, especially, a focus on maximization of shareholder value asopposed to other objectives; flexibility of labor markets and the willingness to accept high rates oflabor turnover; willingness on the part of labor to continue to invest in human capital over a lifetime;the regulatory environment; and the friendliness of the institutional environment to entrepreneurship.Corporate governanceClearly, the effectiveness of the system of corporate governance is important in overall corporateperformance. Adoption of new technology may require considerable effort and short-term expense,and it is important that managers have the appropriate incentives to search for improvements thatreduce costs over the longer-term. In recent years, aggressive cost-cutting in the United States hasbeen linked to greater emphasis on maximization of shareholder value and less on growth anddiversification which was more prominent in the 1970s and 1980s. This shift in perspective appears tohave been driven, at least in part, by the increasing dominance of large institutional investors in USfinancial markets.In the past, maximizing shareholder value had not been as widely embraced abroad although there areindications that views are changing. For instance, members of corporate boards in Japanese companiesoften have been promoted from within, fostering control by allied industrial concerns, family interests,banks and holding companies which may be more motivated by concerns other than maximizingshareholder value. In Europe, a reason sometimes cited for the delay in the adoption of shareholder
3BIS Review 99/1999value as a motivating factor for corporations is the greater involvement by the public sector in theeconomy, with a strong emphasis on job preservation. Another important incentive for managers tomaximize shareholder value is pay-for-performance through avenues such as stock options. Althoughnow commonplace in the United States, such instruments were not legal in Germany and Finland until1998.However, pressure for change clearly has started to emerge. Financial market liberalization hasincreased the importance of equity and publicly traded debt as sources of finance. Anecdotal reportssuggest that the concept of maximization of shareholder value has been gaining greater acceptance asfirms turn more to stock and bond markets for financing and as governments, particularly in Asia,have increased disclosure requirements. If the trend continues and other countries move furthertowards the US model, it will be interesting to see whether improvements in productivity growthfollow.Labor market flexibilityAnother factor that is often cited as a major element in the dynamism of the US economy is theextraordinary flexibility of our labor markets, especially in contrast to those of continental Europeancountries. Although much European regulation has been directed at saving jobs, it can be argued, infact, to have had the opposite effect on the aggregate, as evidenced by the marked upward drift incontinental European unemployment rates over the past two to three decades. These jobless rates arenow much higher than those in the United States and the United Kingdom which has also undergone aperiod of substantial labor market deregulation. It is also noteworthy that the unemployment ratedifferential is particularly large in younger age groups; youth unemployment rates were around 30% in1997 in France and Italy, for example. To the extent that younger people are likely to have had moreexposure to information technology in the educational process, this bias by itself could potentially bean important obstacle to the incorporation of technology into business processes. In addition, workerswho are unemployed for long periods of time are likely to see their technology skills deteriorate.But why might regulations designed to protect jobs have such a perverse effect? The evidencesuggests that new technology often results in more growth in employment in innovating industries.However, it also tends to shift demand from unskilled to more highly skilled workers, potentiallydisplacing unskilled workers in the process. Job protection regulations that affect a firm’s flexibility torecruit and dismiss workers can interfere with this process, making it difficult both for newcomers tofind jobs and for firms to adopt new technologies. The inability to adjust hours flexibly through theuse of overtime, part-time and temporary work may also stifle innovation. According to the EuropeanCar Assembly Association, similar research projects take much longer to complete in Germany than inthe United States because of shorter working hours and less flexible working conditions. As a result,they argue that German automobile manufacturers are less able to exploit the shorter product lifecycles associated with more fashionable and high-tech cars.It is axiomatic that in a truly flexible labor market everyone who wants a job can find one – at someprice. As technical change increases demand for skilled relative to unskilled labor, the unskilledworkers must acquire new skills, find new jobs at lower relative wages or become unemployed. OECDdata suggest that the United States and Canada have been more successful than the other industrializedcountries in achieving these adjustments and, therefore, in maintaining aggregate employment growthon a par with labor force growth in the face of differential rates of job growth by occupations. White-collar, high-skilled employment increased at a much faster rate than employment in the othercategories in nearly all cases in the G7 countries over 1979-95. In the United States and Canada,white-collar, low-skilled employment also rose at healthy rates while blue-collar employment waslittle changed. In contrast, blue-collar employment fell sharply in most of the other countries.Human capitalOf the three choices facing an unskilled worker in a fast-changing economy, acquiring new skills –that is, increasing one’s human capital – would seem, in general, to be preferable to either taking a paycut or becoming unemployed. To what extent do American workers take advantage of such
BIS Review 99/19994opportunities relative to the rest of the world? Here the evidence is somewhat mixed. The US adultpopulation has the highest rates of completion of upper secondary or higher education of any of themajor industrialized countries. However, educational attainment rates are only part of the story asskills need to be continually upgraded in a world of rapid technical change. This does not suggest thateducational attainment is unimportant; in fact, there is a clear interaction between educationalattainment and continuing education as more-highly-educated people are also more likely toparticipate in continuing education.Nevertheless, it is hard to make the case that the United States is ahead of other countries in terms ofparticipation in continuing education. In an OECD study of the role of continuing education andemployability, the rate of participation in these programs in the United States was about average forthe six countries in the sample. However, one noteworthy result was that rates of participation intraining programs were below average among the young but above average among older workers inthe United States. This suggests that American workers tend to keep improving existing skills oracquiring new ones as they age to a greater extent than do their counterparts in other countries.Other business regulationsIn addition to job protection legislation, other forms of business regulation may also have an impact onthe climate for innovation. A 1994 survey of more than 2000 European companies by the Union ofIndustrial and Employers’ Confederations of Europe found that regulations made it more difficult tominimize costs, organize production in a flexible way, reduce time to market and reduce uncertainty.The incidence of product market regulation is lower in the United States than in continental Europe. Across-country comparison of macroeconomic performance in terms of productivity growth andutilization of resources with the OECD’s index of the overall regulatory environment suggests that acountry’s performance does improve as the regulatory environment becomes less restrictive. On amicro level, differences in the regulatory regimes of the biotechnology industry in Europe and theUnited States have been cited as playing an important role in explaining why US firms are ahead ofEuropean firms in important measures of innovation such as R&D expenditures and patents. Surveysof the European biotechnology industry suggest that regulatory restrictions tend to push productdevelopment towards existing technologies and force firms to conduct research abroad, although Ishould note that it is also claimed that American pharmaceutical companies are conducting anincreasing amount of research abroad as well because of regulatory obstacles at home.In addition, regulatory regimes that promote competition foster innovation and diffusion oftechnologies. According to an OECD study, the United States has policies that are effective inpreventing anti-competitive behavior, but Germany is not far behind. Why does a more competitiveenvironment foster innovation? One hypothesis is that competition forces firms to innovate and adoptnew technologies and, therefore, it increases the speed of diffusion of technology. In contrast,monopolists may have little incentive to innovate because they already control most of the market.Competition will also tend to result in the failure of unproductive businesses and facilitate the entryand success of more innovative ones. In addition, more heavily-regulated firms may be less motivatedto choose an efficient technology.In recent years, industries such as telecommunications, transportation, electricity and banking haveundergone privatization, deregulation and increased competition in a number of countries. In manycases, these reforms were in fact prompted by technological change which reduced large fixed costsand thus the scope for natural monopolies. Furthermore, in some of these industries, there is evidencethat the move towards a more liberalized regulatory regime induced further innovation.A good example is the telecommunications industry. Evidence on patents (one measure of innovation)and measures of productivity suggests that those countries that have extensively liberalized (such asJapan, the United Kingdom, Finland and the United States) have experienced greater innovation andlarger gains in efficiency. Evidence from the telecommunications industry also suggests that thetechnological diffusion rate is faster under a more competitive regulatory regime. For instance, bothgrowth in cellular phone usage and the penetration rate for Internet hosts is much higher in morecompetitive market structures.
5BIS Review 99/1999This is not to suggest that regulation is necessarily a bad thing. Regulations that protect intellectualproperty rights reward those with creative ideas and therefore can act to stimulate cost-reducinginnovations. From a broader perspective, productivity growth is obviously not society’s only priority –worker health and safety, pollution control and other societal values are important as well. Although ithas been argued that regulations requiring mandated approaches to pollution reduction or workersafety tend to divert managerial energies from pursuing cost-reducing innovations, studies have shownthat some regulatory changes can in fact enhance productivity by forcing a firm to develop new andmore-efficient production techniques. For example, the cotton dust standard mandated by OSHA isclaimed to have led to the adoption of new and more cost-effective technologies utilized by the textileindustry.What I think this suggests is the need, as with so much in economics, to recognize trade-offs. Weshould recognize the broad range of society’s interests and continue to seek balance by striving forregulation that serves well-defined purposes with minimal burden.Other institutional featuresOther institutional features are also important to the climate for innovation. For instance,entrepreneurship is fostered by access of small firms to capital markets. A lack of breadth and depth offinancial institutions and markets can inhibit the financing of innovative projects by small firms.Again, the United States appears to have an advantage in this regard relative to Europe and Japan. Inparticular, venture capital markets here are both more developed and more geared to financinghigher-risk projects, mainly in technology-based sectors by start-ups with prospects of rapid growth.Furthermore, the range of investors is wide and includes pension funds, insurance companies and evenprivate individuals. In contrast, in Europe, venture capital is geared towards more mainstream projectsand banks dominate lending. In Japan, a venture capitalist is typically a subsidiary of a large financialinstitution and invests mainly in established firms.ConclusionObviously, the United States does not have a monopoly on technological advance. We should not besmug nor complacent because certainly the US experience will be adopted and adapted by othercountries. Although the United States arguably has led the way into the information technologyrevolution, there is evidence that others are following. Scandinavia in particular appears to beembracing computer-based technology; Sweden has begun to market itself as Europe’s “SiliconValley.”Adoption of new technologies in the United States may also have been spurred in recent years by thecyclical strength of the economy in combination with strong domestic and international competitivepressures. With new workers increasingly difficult to hire in a tight labor market, firms have anincreased incentive to find new and more-efficient ways to use existing labor resources. I might addthat the current low inflation environment also helps this process. In the presence of subdued inflationexpectations, the first inclination of firms in the face of rising demand for their output, thus far at least,appears not to have been to raise prices but rather to find ways to expand output via more efficientmeans of production.It is clear that other countries, many of which are less far along in reaping the benefits associated withthe revolution in information technology, have the potential to gain more over the period ahead. Theextent to which they do realize these gains will depend on how successful they are in adapting to theirunique circumstances policies that foster efficiency and competition in labor and product markets. Iwish them well.
1BIS Review 98/1999Mr Carse discusses the importance of ethics in bankingSpeech given by Mr David Carse, Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, atthe Banking Conference on Business Ethics in Hong Kong on 15 September 1999.*      *      *Ladies and gentlemen,I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak today at this important conference on business ethics.This is an area that is becoming a growth industry, and it is one that it is particularly relevant to banksgiven the position of trust that they occupy. Indeed, this is one of the daunting things about giving aspeech about the importance of ethics in banking. It all seems too obvious. After all, what do we meanby ethics in business? It means, I would suggest, trying to be a good corporate citizen; trying as anorganisation to adhere to certain ethical values; and trying to do the right thing by all the variousstakeholders – customers, employees, suppliers and shareholders – that any business organisation has.It means, as one writer has put it, “choosing the good over the bad, the right over the wrong, the fairover the unfair”.Put this way, is there any respectable bank that would claim not to attach high importance to coreethical values such as honesty, integrity, fairness, responsible citizenship and accountability? Is thereany bank that would claim that it was right to accept bribes in return for loans, to lend to connectedparties and to cheat customers? Unfortunately, it is not as simple as this. If it were the case thatbusiness ethics simply represented values which everyone accepted and put into practice, thisconference and my speech would both be superfluous. However, there is sometimes a gap betweenwhat banks claim and what they do. As the Asian crisis has demonstrated, ethical values are still notfirmly entrenched and followed in many banks in the region. Bribery and corruption have been one ofthe root causes of the banking problems, and the Bank Bali scandal has shown that the process ofreform still has a long way to go.However, leaving aside such blatant examples of unethical behaviour, even the most well meaning ofbanks are going to confront moral dilemmas in the course of business. These dilemmas are morecomplex than the simple: “should I lie, cheat or steal variety?” They pose difficult choices that havethe potential to damage reputation and lead to financial losses. The problem is that in an increasinglycomplex business environment the choice is not always the simple one between what is right andwrong. It is more often between what is right and less right – in other words between shades of grey.This increases the need for organisations to adhere to a strong set of values to steer them through theminefield of ethical choices with which they are faced as they make business decisions. It is alsonecessary to ensure that the behaviour of the organisation is in practice aligned with these values andthat employees buy into them, so that the organisation actually practises what it preaches.Let me try to put some flesh on these arguments with some practical examples of ethical dilemmasinvolving banks that have been in the news recently. I have said that banking business is becomingmore complex. One aspect of this is the globalisation of business activities which may be summed upas the tendency of the world to become one market place. As banks reach out beyond their homemarket, they become exposed to unfamiliar business environments and customers whose ethicalstandards may be very different from their own. This puts extra strain on the “know your customer”policy upon which regulators are so insistent. Business dealings with Russia are a case in point. Hereyou have the situation of a country that is making the transition from a communist to a capitalisteconomy. This naturally creates profit opportunities for Western banks. It could indeed almost beargued that these banks have a moral responsibility to assist in transforming the Russian economy.Unfortunately, somewhere along the line, this transformation has gone wrong, and the borderlinebetween what is legitimate and illegitimate business in Russia has become blurred, to say the least.In this situation, what should a bank do? The decision can obviously be viewed in strictly commercialterms. But there is an ethical dimension as well. Is it right for the bank to do business with Russian
BIS Review 98/19992customers and to handle funds flowing out of Russia where it cannot be sure about the origin of thefunds? No doubt many banks are asking themselves these questions, in the wake of the stories of hugeamounts of Russian money being laundered through Bank of New York and possibly other Westernbanks. Note that there is no suggestion at this stage that the banks actively participated in moneylaundering. Indeed, it is not yet clear if money laundering, as opposed to capital flight, is what wasgoing on. However, difficult questions are going to be asked, not least by the US Congress, and thebanks concerned are going to have to cope with the negative publicity.Ethical dilemmas can also arise when banks try to innovate, particularly when they stray outside theirhome territory. Take an example from my own country, in the form of the Bank of Scotland’sproposed joint venture in telephone banking with the American evangelist Dr Pat Robertson. This wasdesigned to enable the bank to expand abroad with the help of new technology and to attractUS$3 billion in deposits. On the face of it this appears to be a reasonable business decision, so wheredoes the ethical dimension arise? The problem, as you may be aware, is that Dr Robertson is notsimply a religious leader, he is also a right wing politician with controversial views on a variety ofissues, including gay rights. News of the Bank of Scotland’s proposed business link with such a persondid not go down very well with gay activists or trade unionists in Scotland or indeed with shareholdersand the public generally. Matters were not helped when Dr Robertson was highly critical of moralvalues in Scotland. The bank was forced to pull out of the deal, to pay compensation to Dr Robertsonand to issue a public apology in which it stressed its “long-standing commitment to ethical values”.Despite the apology, the whole episode was widely regarded as a public relations disaster.What lessons can be learned from this episode? The first, I suppose, is that banks need to be carefulabout business relationships with controversial politicians, whether of the right or left wing variety.The second is the increasing power of the media and social pressure groups to throw the spotlight onwhat they regard as “unethical” business activities. In the case of banks, such activities might includefinancing the arms trade or industries that damage the environment. The third is the way in whichethical values change and how they can differ between societies: anti-gay attitudes are no doubtacceptable in the Mid-West of the United States, but they were clearly felt to violate modern notionsof fairness, equality and non-discrimination in modern-day Scotland. The final point is how small theglobal market place has become and how events in one country can impinge on others. The chairmanof the bank commented that they had not foreseen how the controversy surrounding Dr Robertsonwould cross the Atlantic to Scotland where he has no political constituency or business. This provokedthe comment that the bank did not appreciate how new technology has shrunk the world.The moral of the story is that banks need to consider how their actions – anywhere in the world – willaffect their customers or be perceived by them. But customers are not the only people the banks haveto worry about. They also need to take account of regulators in the various jurisdictions in which theyoperate and the fact that regulatory standards may shift over time. The Credit Suisse Group has, forexample, recently run into problems with the Japanese regulators because one of its subsidiaries inJapan was accused of engaging in window-dressing transactions with Japanese banks. Thesetransactions are now deemed by the current regulators to be “inappropriate”, though they wereapparently not so regarded in the past. This illustrates that banks may encounter what has been termed“regulatory risk” not simply when they break the law. It also shows the problems they face in decidingwhich transactions are indeed “appropriate” where the rules of the game in the various markets inwhich they operate may not be clearly defined, or where the rules are shifting in line with changingstandards of what is right or wrong.The global reach of many businesses creates practical problems of control and of enforcement ofcompliance with regulatory and ethical standards, as the collapse of Barings Bank clearly showed. Butthese issues also arise in domestic markets as the banks diversify into fee-related businesses such asthe sale of insurance and investment management and advice. Leaving aside the possible risks fromrogue fund managers, these activities can raise conflicts of interest and the issue of whether particularproducts are suitable for the needs of their customers. The classic case of how things can go wrong isthe recent pension mis-selling scandal in the UK. Hundreds of thousands of employees werepersuaded by pension salesmen and the companies they represented (including major banks andinsurance companies) to switch from occupational pension schemes provided by their employers into
3BIS Review 98/1999personal plans provided by the companies. It turned out that in many cases, the employees were muchworse off than if they had stayed in their original schemes. The banks and other pension providersstood accused of failing to give their customers suitable advice and sufficient information on the costsand benefits of making the switch. The end-result is that the offending companies have been “namedand shamed” by the Government and pressurised into paying billions of pounds in compensation. Thereputation of these firms, many of whom are household names in the UK, has suffered as a result. Thiscomes at an awkward time when banks in the UK and elsewhere are attempting to expand theirbancassurance activities and to persuade the public to trust them with their long-term savings.Banks in Hong Kong will need to bear this lesson in mind as we embark upon the MandatoryProvident Fund Scheme. They will also have to be alive to the other types of ethical conflict that mayarise as the banking environment becomes increasingly competitive and there is even more focus onthe bottom line. The HKMA has already pointed out that as a result of interest rate deregulation thatthere will be both winners and losers among bank customers. Those with small balances and relativelylarge volume of transactions may find that increased fees outweigh the benefit of any increase in theinterest paid on their deposits. As has happened elsewhere, banks may also become more selective intheir choice of customers and the level of customer service may be affected if the number of branchesis pruned to save costs.A move towards a user pays approach and a reduction in cross-subsidisation are manifestations of thegreater efficiency that deregulation is intended to produce. But banks will need to be careful that thisprocess is handled with tact and sensitivity. Otherwise, they may be open to accusations from sectionsof the community that they are neglecting their social responsibility by curtailing or increasing the costof basic banking services to the economically disadvantaged. This was certainly the accusation madeagainst the Australian banks after deregulation there. A further aspect is that the possibility of higherand more extensive charges for banking services will make it all the more important for the banks todeliver sufficient information to their customers about these charges.Let me clarify at this point the HKMA’s attitude to ethical matters and particularly the issue of“fairness” to customers. Our main responsibility under the Banking Ordinance is to promote thegeneral stability and effective working of the banking system. In common with banking regulators inother countries, we interpret this to mean that our principal concern should be to determine thatindividual banks are financially sound and prudently managed. The aim is to reduce the risk of bankfailure that would result in depositors losing money and threaten the stability of the banking system asa whole. We concentrate therefore on checking that the banks have adequate capital and liquidity andeffective management and internal controls.However, this is not all that we do. Section 7 of the Banking Ordinance goes on to say, among otherthings, that our functions include the following aspects that have a distinct “ethical” flavour:• taking reasonable steps to ensure that authorised institutions operate in a “responsible, honestand business-like manner”;• promoting and encouraging “proper standards of conduct and sound and prudent businesspractices” ;• suppressing “illegal, dishonourable or improper practices”.These specific functions can be related to our general function of promoting the stability of thebanking sector. Clearly, if banks are involved in illegal or improper activities (such as fraud or moneylaundering) this may threaten the reputation not only of the bank concerned but also of the bankingsystem as a whole. This in turn may lead to a loss of public confidence in the banks.I believe however that our functions also imply a broader interest in the concept of “fairness” in theprovision of banking services. This is not to say that the HKMA should act as a “consumer watchdog”in investigating and adjudicating on disputes between banks and their customers on matters such as thecost or quality of banking services. But at the same time we should not be indifferent to how bankstreat their customers in general. If banks consistently provide a bad or unfair service, this may damagethe reputation of the banks and destroy customer loyalty and confidence. Taken to extremes, the
BIS Review 98/19994system as a whole could be brought into disrepute. This is why we promoted the Code of BankingPractice issued jointly in 1997 by the two industry associations. The Code is intended to be observedby authorised institutions in dealing with their personal customers, and it provides an extremely usefulmechanism for the promotion of fair and transparent banking services in Hong Kong.What tools can banks use to manage ethics in their own organisations? No doubt you will have beendiscussing this during the course of the seminar and I will not go into a lot of detail in this speech.Clearly, the first essential is for the bank itself to be clear about the key ethical values to which itsubscribes. It then needs to ensure that the organisation and the employees act in accordance withthese values. This can be done through the adoption of codes of conduct. The former Commissioner ofBanking issued a guideline in 1986 which requires all authorised institutions in Hong Kong to preparea code of conduct for their staff setting out the standards to which they are expected to adhere. It isalso necessary to have policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the standardsspecified in the code of conduct. For example, many companies now employ “ethics officers” and givetheir staff specific training and advice on ethical issues. The guideline issued by the Commissioner ofBanking recommends that all institutions should appoint at least one senior officer to handle queriesfrom staff and other matters relating to the code of conduct.Codes of conduct and the means to enforce them are important tools. But I would caution against toonarrow a compliance-based approach towards ethics management. It appears from survey responsescarried out in some US companies that the most important factor in controlling unethical conductwithin companies is how staff perceive the value that senior management attaches to ethical behaviour.What matters in other words is the general culture of the organisation and the example that is set bythose at the top. An important way in which behaviour of staff can be influenced is, for example,through remuneration policy, and senior management needs to be careful to ensure that rewards arenot given to staff who uses dubious practices to gain business.This brings me round to the role of the board of directors in banks. As you will recall, we commentedin our recent Policy Response to the Banking Sector Consultancy Study on the need for high standardsof corporate governance within the banking system as the environment becomes more competitive.We had in mind particularly the need to enhance systems of risk management, and we noted that theprimary responsibility for ensuring this rested with the board of directors. We could equally make thesame point in relation to the promotion of high ethical standards within banks. The board of directorshas an important role to play in establishing the overall culture of an organisation. It is also theultimate body for resolving the type of complex ethical dilemmas I referred to earlier, and ensuring inparticular that the reputation risks in new business strategies or products are carefully addressed.I hope that this conference and my speech, have demonstrated that high ethical standards in banks areneither a luxury nor an abstract ideal. Rather, they are a vital aspect of protecting and enhancing thebank’s brand image, and ensuring its long-term business survival. Behaving ethically is not only theright thing for banks to do, it also makes sound business sense.
1BIS Review 98/1999Mr Mboweni considers the role of the South African Reserve Bankin economic integration in the Southern African Development CommunitySpeech by Mr Tito Mboweni, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, as a contribution to theAfrica Dialogue Lecture Series presented by the University of Pretoria’s Department of PoliticalSciences, the Institute for International Affairs and Accord, in the Senate Hall at the University ofPretoria on 21 September 1999.*      *      *1.IntroductionThere are many buzzwords in today’s world. One of the most recognisable ones in the economicvocabulary is globalisation. Many people define themselves as being either for or againstglobalisation. My own view is “good luck” to those who want to demonstrate against globalisation. Iwould rather people spent time on how they can maximise the benefits of globalisation.But today our discussion is about the role of the Reserve Bank in economic integration of the SouthernAfrican Development Community (SADC) which obviously has to be placed within the context ofglobalisation.Some people blame globalisation for many of the problems confronting the world today, ranging fromwidening income disparities in the industrialised world to financial crises in emerging markets. Buteven some of the most vociferous critics acknowledge that globalisation can be a powerful andpositive force for generating wealth and reducing poverty, as rising trade volumes create opportunitiesfor entrepreneurs, and developing countries may gain greater access to capital from the rich countriesof the world.Globalisation seems to be encouraging economic regionalisation as many big and small economiesestablish economic blocs to maximise their collective competitive advantage. The advantages ofregional economic integration are well known, but it is worth pausing, for the purposes of thisdiscussion, to mention a few. Among others, economic integration enables entrepreneurs to take upnew business opportunities by cutting red tape and facilitating the flow of transactions. Integrationwith neighbouring countries can produce economies of scale when competing with other regions in theworld and can be one of the ways that countries ensure that the best use is made of the resources,capabilities and abilities within their region.Economic integration means that individual nations are becoming less important internationally asregional groupings gain in significance, especially when it comes to investment and trade in goods andservices. To name a few examples, regional free trade initiatives have either been implemented or arein the process of being implemented in North, Central and South America, East Asia and in theEuropean Union where full financial integration is not far off. Africa also has a number of economiccooperation initiatives, including the Southern African Development Community (SADC) which has14 member states.The SADC member states are: South Africa, Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius,Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe, the Democratic Republic of theCongo and the Seychelles.The forerunner of the SADC was a regional grouping of nine Southern African states which startedworking together in 1980 with a view to reducing their economic dependence on the then apartheidruled South Africa. Over time, more members joined and by the time South Africa entered the foldafter the democratic elections of 1994, the aim of the regional grouping was to work towardseconomic integration.
BIS Review 98/19992Whilst it is factually correct that South Africa is the largest economy in our region, accounting forsome 65% of the region’s gross domestic product in dollar terms, we are, however, on a per capitabasis, the third best off — behind Mauritius and Botswana. Mauritius has a GDP per capita of morethan $3,500 while South Africa’s is less than $3,000. In the rich countries of the world, per capitaincomes are about eight times as high as they are in this subregion of Africa.As part of the process of promoting regional economic integration, each SADC member country wasallocated an economic sector to coordinate, based on the country’s actual or potential capacity. SouthAfrica has been allocated responsibility for the coordination of the finance and investment sector ofthe SADC. The coordination of the sector is led by the Minister of Finance of South Africa. Thefinance and investment sector was given to South Africa in recognition of its developed financialmarkets and institutions.The Committee of the SADC Central Bank Governors which meets twice a year, forms part of thefinance and investment sector and is chaired by the Governor of the South African Reserve Bank. TheCommittee of Governors met for the first time in November 1995. Its terms of reference focus, amongother things, on closer cooperation among central banks in the SADC in the areas of monetary policyand policy instruments, bank supervision, money and capital markets, international financial relations,payment, clearing and settlement systems, training, and money laundering.Information technology is one of the most important areas of cooperation. The concerns with properlyfunctioning financial and banking systems naturally made Year 2000 preparedness one of ourpriorities this year.More generally, it is crucial to note that financial and banking issues cannot be looked at in isolation,without reference to other SADC concerns such as trade, industrial and fiscal policies and politicalfactors too.2.South Africa prepares to open its marketsCompared with other regional groupings, the idea of a European Union-like economic union is stillsome way off for the SADC, although progress is being made towards implementing a free tradeagreement.A target implementation date has been set for January next year to begin the process of lowering tradebarriers, streamlining customs and border procedures, and harmonising external tariffs. SADC tradeand industry ministers are due to meet soon for negotiations on the trade protocol in the run-up to thestart of implementation next year. There have been suggestions that South Africa might extend marketaccess concessions on a unilateral basis after certain key agreements have been reached.We understand that South Africa plans to eliminate most duties on imported goods from other SADCcountries by 2004 and the region could ultimately develop into a free trade zone.The free trade discussions and negotiations have received some attention in the media. Generallyspeaking, it seems that people welcome the progress made by the SADC as a sign that it is finallygetting down to business. Also in the development programmes are infrastructure developments in theregion, such as the Maputo Corridor which has spurred investments into various economic sectorsestimated at R35bn. One example of a big investment is the Mozal aluminium smelter, which hastriggered the renewal of the Maputo Harbour. A very welcome development indeed.Far less immediately newsworthy, but also very important for the establishment of a regionaleconomic bloc, has been the work done by the Committee of Central Bank Governors. The work is animportant building block towards the creation of a free trade zone.One cannot implement free trade in goods and services without having the proper financial systems inplace; the work of the Committee of Central Bank Governors can be seen as providing the oil thatmakes the wheels of commerce turn faster in the region.The implementation of a free trade agreement is made easier if national payments systems functionproperly and are compatible with individual states in the region. In addition, investors who want to
3BIS Review 98/1999take advantage of the liberalisation of trade will feel more comfortable if there is a high and uniformstandard of bank supervision; in other words, legal familiarity, certainty and a good sense of a stable,well regulated and properly supervised banking system. Similarly, investors and potential businesspartners usually want easy access to reliable basic macroeconomic information of countries in theregion.For goods to flow smoothly across borders, it is also important that capital should flow smoothly in theregion, while bearing in mind that potentially destabilising and volatile capital swings must beavoided.These are a few examples of how the Committee’s work fits in with the overall concept of economiccooperation and free trade. The Committee’s work has mainly been focussed on the following areas:development of payment, clearing and settlement systems; the impact of exchange controls on thecross-border flow of goods, services and capital in the SADC region; the development of a monetaryand financial data base; coordination and training of central bank officials within the region and thecollection of information on the legal and operational frameworks of central banks within the region.Cooperation in the field of information technology has been an important focus area for theCommittee which has resulted in improved communication and collaboration.3.Development of the payment, clearing and settlement systems in the SADC regionIn support of the SADC objective of establishing free trade within the region by 2004, the Committeeof Central Bank Governors decided at its inception to develop the payment, clearing and settlementsystems of SADC countries.The benefits of improved payments systems include: promotion of economic activity, both regionallyand internationally; improved control of monetary aggregates resulting from reducing float levels andminimising delays; a more productive use of resources as a result of lowered transaction costs;improved management of both credit and systemic risk as financial transfers are completed efficientlyand quickly; facilitation of financial sector development; improved trust in the security and reliabilityof payment instruments and international acceptance.One aspect of the SADC payments system project has been an awareness campaign to sensitise a largecross-section of stakeholders in each of the countries about payments system issues. Workshops onpayments system issues have been held in most SADC member states.Now that the awareness campaign is complete and information on the existing payments systems incountries has been collected, the next step is to develop a strategic framework for each country – andfor the region as a whole. Capacity building is, as always, an important theme.Mauritius has already decided that it is feasible to implement the South African Multiple OptionSettlement (SAMOS) system in that country, in line with its goal of real-time gross settlement. OtherSADC central banks have also indicated they would like to implement SAMOS to their bankingsystems.4.The impact of exchange controls on the cross-border flow of goods, services and capitalin the SADC regionExchange controls may be, in the case of many countries, a necessary mechanism in a world in whichvolatile capital swings can wreak havoc on small economies, as we saw last year. However, controlswithin a region which is working towards greater economic integration can be a stumbling block in theway to smooth and effective cooperation, as well as a deterrent to investors.The Committee of Central Bank Governors has a subcommittee on exchange controls. Existingcontrols in each country in the SADC region have been analysed with a view to gradual harmonisationand the removal of controls for transactions within the region. However, the region’s central bankofficials recognise that the sequencing and speed of exchange control liberalisation depend on thecharacteristics of each individual economy and also on the political realities.
BIS Review 98/19994The target date of 2004 for the creation of a free trade zone implies that all intra-regional exchangecontrols should be abolished by then. However, the subcommittee on exchange controls feltliberalisation should be completed more rapidly. Controls that directly inhibit the cross-border flow ofgoods, services and capital should be tackled first. The subcommittee asked that central banks in theregion formally report on the progress made on easing exchange controls when the Committee ofCentral Bank Governors meets again next month.Some countries like Zambia, Mauritius and Botswana have liberalised their exchange controls in ashort time. However, rapid easing might not be the correct speed for other countries.Zimbabwe reintroduced exchange controls in the wake of last year’s global financial turmoil.However, the country has indicated that the controls will be reversed as soon as the balance ofpayments position improves and inflationary pressures subside. Information at our disposal indicatesthat Zimbabwe will continue to liberalise capital flows gradually.South Africa’s exchange controls favour investment in the SADC region, as requirements for theseinvestments are less onerous. Although foreign direct investment (FDI) in the SADC region accountsfor a relatively small portion of the total planned FDI by South Africans, it is nevertheless growing inimportance.From March 1995 until mid-September this year, approvals by the exchange control department of theReserve Bank for direct investment by South African companies in the SADC region totalled R7.85bn.Globally, South African companies have received exchange control approval for a total of R74.5bn inforeign direct investment, or FDI, all over the world.The investment appetite of South African companies in SADC countries has been on the rise. Theirgrowing interest is apparent from the steady rise every year in exchange control approvals for FDI inthe SADC region – from less than R500m in 1996 to R1.5bn in 1997, R2.5bn last year and almostR2.9bn so far this year.Based on net asset value, actual foreign direct investment – which differs from approved FDI whichhas not necessarily taken place yet – by South African companies in the SADC region stood at R3.2bnat the end of December 1997, the latest available figure. The net asset value of total South Africaninvestments in the SADC region, including portfolio and fixed investments, was almost R6bn.The investment flows to South Africa from other countries in the region are also fairly sizable. Basedon net asset value, total investment from SADC countries in South Africa was valued at R7bn at theend of December 1997. So there is a good two-way flow in the relationship between South Africa asthe largest economy and the region as a whole.5.Gathering of informationA database comprising monetary and financial statistics of individual countries has been establishedand is freely accessible on the Internet at the website www.sadcbankers.org. Each central bank takesfull responsibility for the updating and accuracy of its own data. The International Monetary Fund isproviding technical assistance for further development of the database.In addition, an information bank has been compiled on the structures and policies of central banks inthe region as well as on the financial markets of member states. This information paves the way forfuture cooperation on monetary policy in the region.A project has also been undertaken to summarise the legal and operational frameworks of each of thecentral banks in the region, analysing differences in their structures and then proposing measurestowards greater compatibility.6.Cooperation in the field of informationThe committee of central bank governors established an IT Forum which, among others, aims todevelop a common application architecture for bank supervision. The Forum which has obtained
5BIS Review 98/1999funding from the World Bank plans to begin developing common bank supervision models early nextyear.The Forum has also been keeping track of Year 2000 readiness in member states. Information on theY2K bug has been shared, and bank supervisors have been encouraged to participate in Y2Kcertification of financial institutions in each country.7.The development of financial marketsThe SADC Committee of Stock Exchanges, which reports to the SADC Ministers of Finance throughthe Committee of Central Bank Governors, is set to announce the harmonisation of listingrequirements in the region. Other projects include the introduction of automated trading into all SADCexchanges, electronic clearing and settlement as well as education and training.On the development of bond markets, agreement was reached that trading in equities and bonds shouldbe accommodated on the same exchange rather than that new bond exchanges be established. It wasalso decided that stock exchanges that wished to implement bond listings requirements would use thenew listings requirements of the South African bond exchange.The South African bond exchange has submitted a proposal for the establishment of a centralised debtsecurities market for the region. The proposal argued against allowing the development of separatelicensed bond exchanges and was in favour of building on existing infrastructure.The Committee of Central Bank Governors has studied the characteristics of money markets inindividual states, but no decision has yet been taken on further development of money markets.A SADC Banking Association was established in July last year aimed at encouraging member states toimplement internationally accepted banking standards and uniformity of banking legislation. TheSouth African Banking Council is a member of the Association which is chaired at present by Malawi.8.ConclusionFrom my report-back to you today on the work of the SADC Committee of Central Bank Governors itshould hopefully be clear that the vision of full economic integration, with free and unfetteredmovement of goods and capital, is still a long way off. However, slowly but surely we are laying thefoundation for a robust regional economic bloc. The central banks of the region are working togetherto put in place a common financial architecture which can form the basis of closer economicintegration.Before full economic integration can be attained, we need to have sound financial systems that canwithstand sudden international shocks and which can accommodate increased economic activity. Weneed efficient and coordinated financial markets and reliable and compatible clearing and settlementarrangements between our countries.The SADC finance and investment sector is convinced that it has already laid the foundation formacroeconomic convergence and integration.As the new chairperson of the SADC Committee of Central Bank Governors, I will make every effortto ensure that we continue with the construction of a strong financial infrastructure for the region, sothat globalisation can work to the advantage of the Southern African region.In conclusion, I would like to express the hope that the region will have confidence in its ability tomake globalisation work in its favour. To illustrate this point, I would like to quote from a speechmade last year by President Thabo Mbeki, in which he talked of an African Renaissance and about theweight that past enslavement has placed on Africans’ confidence:“It continues still to weigh down the African mind and spirit, like the ton of lead that the African slavecarries on her own shoulders, producing in her and the rest a condition which, in itself, contests anyassertion that she is capable of initiative, creativity, individuality and entrepreneurship.”
BIS Review 98/19996Initiative, creativity, individuality and entrepreneurship – we in the Committee of Central BankGovernors know the people of the SADC region possess these qualities in abundance. We know thatSouthern Africa has the potential to become a lasting success story.
1 BIS Review 97/1999Mr Kelley remarks on Y2K readiness in the United StatesRemarks by Mr Edward W Kelley Jr, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem, before the Banking Regulators’ News Conference on Y2K Readiness at the National PressClub in Washington, D.C. on 16 September 1999.*      *      *I’m appearing here today in my role as Head of the Federal Reserve’s Year 2000 project. As youknow, the Fed provides the crucial infrastructure that undergirds the nation’s banking system. Itdistributes currency and coins and processes checks and electronic payments. It’s vitally important tothe nation that this infrastructure functions smoothly through the rollover to the new century. We areconfident it will.System readinessBy 30 June, 100% of the Fed’s mission-critical systems were certified as Y2K-ready. That is, theywere fixed and are now in daily use. This includes all of the systems that support electronic fundstransfer, book-entry securities transfer and check payments.Not only are we ready, but the major users of our most critical payments services – depositoryinstitutions serving millions of Americans – are ready too. They have tested their systems with oursystem, using the Year 2000 date. The results of these tests, involving more than 9,000 institutions,have assured us that the nation’s banks will be able to send and receive funds through the FederalReserve on 1 January and thereafter.Now, I don’t want to imply that this effort has been easy. We estimate we have reviewed and certified90 million lines of code. As a result of this tremendous amount of very good work, I am convincedthat we are as ready for business on 1 January 2000 as we are for business tomorrow.Internationally, a test in June of 34 separate national and international payments systems in 19countries showed a high level of readiness. More than 500 financial institutions successfullycompleted simulated Year 2000 transactions on the systems.Liquidity issuesIn addition to fixing our computer hardware and software, we have taken a number of actions toensure that both consumers and businesses have access to liquid funds during the rollover.As most of you know, the Fed increased its 1999 currency order to the Treasury Department’s Bureauof Engraving and Printing to make sure we had enough cash in our vaults to meet any additionaldemand related to the date change. We have stressed that we see no need for the public to holdadditional cash. We feel strongly that the most sensible thing to do with your money is to leave itwhere it is, but our responsibility is to make sure the public knows that currency is readily available.And it is. We finished building up our currency inventory in August, and depository institutions arearranging to have a large amount of extra cash in their vaults as well.Separately, the Board has taken several steps to ensure bank and thrift customers continuous access tofunding. First, we advised the industry to make the advance arrangements necessary to borrow at thediscount window, and many have already done so. And we created an administrative structure to moreeasily serve the backup needs of credit unions.We also created a special liquidity facility to provide banks and thrift institutions access to funds at apredetermined price. This borrowing arrangement will be available as from 1 October. Its creation
BIS Review 97/19992sends a clear message: the Fed will be there to provide liquidity should banks need it. That, in turn,will enable banks to offer their customers similar assurance.Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York announced several changes to its dailyopen-market procedures intended to ensure the smooth operation of financial markets around thecentury rollover.All of these actions have a common theme. They are meant to build confidence that the Fed isdetermined to play its traditional role as a provider of liquidity in uncertain times.SummaryIn sum, our systems are ready. We are working to build public confidence. We will be on the jobconstantly during the rollover period and we will be prepared for any problems that may arise. No onecan guarantee the complete absence of isolated glitches, but Americans should feel confident theFederal Reserve and our depository institutions have done everything that can be done to make thetransition to the Year 2000 as smooth as possible.
1BIS Review 96/1999Bank of Japan’s September report ofrecent economic and financial developments1Bank of Japan, Communication, 13 September 1999.*      *      *The Bank’s View2Japan’s economy has stopped deteriorating, and there are some activities improving such as exportsand production. However, clear signs of a self-sustained recovery in private demand have not yet beenobserved.With regard to final demand, business fixed investment has been on a downward trend. Recovery inprivate consumption continues to be weak on the whole. Housing investment, which had beenrecovering, has recently peaked out. Meanwhile, public works have been rising, and net exports(exports minus imports) have started growing due to an increase in exports.Reflecting such developments in final demand and continued progress in inventory adjustment,industrial production is turning to an increase. Against this background, corporate and consumersentiment has seen an improvement. The improvement in corporate sentiment, however, has notnecessarily stimulated business activities, because firms strongly feel that they have excess capacityand employees and their profits remain weak. Meanwhile, the improvement in consumer sentiment isunderpinning household expenditure even under the worsening employment and income conditions,but is not strong enough to push up overall private consumption.As for the outlook, improvements in the overall financial environment partly due to the monetaryeasing by the Bank, along with a series of economic measures taken by the government, are expectedto continue underpinning the economy. Moreover, the positive impact on domestic production of therecovery of overseas economies, especially of Asian economies, is likely to continue for some time.By contrast, leading indicators suggest a high probability of a moderate decrease in housinginvestment from this autumn. In addition, under cautious sales plans, firms are implementing furtherrestructuring to improve their profitability. Although such corporate restructuring is expected toimprove productivity, it is likely, in the short run, to reduce fixed investment and discouragehousehold expenditure through the resulting deterioration in employment and income conditions.Moreover, it seems that the recent appreciation of the yen will have an adverse effect on corporateprofits in the near term. Under such circumstances, it is still difficult to expect an immediateself-sustained recovery in private demand. Overall economic developments require careful monitoringin consideration of the above points. It is also important to promote structural reform in order to assurethe economy’s sustained growth in the medium term.With regard to prices, import prices have recently fallen slightly due to the appreciation of the yen,despite the rise in international commodity prices such as crude oil prices. Domestic wholesale pricesare leveling off due to the progress in inventory adjustment as well as an increase in prices of someproducts closely related to international commodities, such as those of petroleum products. Consumerprices continue to be unchanged. Corporate service prices are still falling, although the pace of thedecline is slowing. For a while, movements of overall prices are likely to be flat, as the decline in1This report was written based on data and information available when the Bank of Japan Monetary Policy Meeting washeld on 9 September 1999.2The Bank’s view on recent economic and financial developments, determined by the Policy Board at the Monetary PolicyMeeting held on 9 September as the basis of monetary policy decisions.
BIS Review 96/19992domestic commodity prices has come to a halt reflecting the rise in import prices to date. However,substantial narrowing in the output gap led by a recovery in private demand is unlikely for the timebeing, and wages continue to decline. Thus, downward pressure on prices is expected to remain.In the financial market, the overnight call rate has stayed at nearly zero and financial institutions havebeen confident about the availability of overnight funds. As for interest rates on term instruments,short-term rates such as those of three months have weakened. However, longer-term rates maturingbeyond the year-end continue to be relatively high partly due to market participants’ concern over theYear 2000 problem.The Japan premium has continued to be nearly zero for short-term transactions.Yields on long-term government bonds rose to 2 percent in late August, but have recently fallen to1.8-1.9 percent. The yield spread between government bonds and private bonds (bank debentures andcorporate bonds) has stopped narrowing.Stock prices recovered the 18,000 yen level in late August, but subsequently declined against thebackground of the appreciation of the yen and the weak tone in US stock prices. Currently, the pricesare around 17,500-18,000 yen.The yen has appreciated further against the US dollar since mid-August to the current level of around110 yen.The amount outstanding of funds in the call money market has remained generally stable since themiddle of June. To date, this has not led to any difficulty in funds settlement, but close attentionshould be paid to future market developments.With regard to corporate finance, private banks have basically retained their cautious lending attitude.However, constraint that had been caused by severe fund-raising conditions and insufficient capitalbase has eased considerably. Under these circumstances, major banks have gradually become moreactive than before in extending loans, while carefully evaluating the credit risks involved.However, credit demand for economic activities such as business fixed investment remains weak. Inaddition, some firms have recently been repaying their loans using their on-hand liquidity. As a result,credit demand in the private sector has continued to be weak, and thus private banks’ lending hasremained sluggish. Furthermore, the pace of issuance of corporate bonds and CP has generally beenslowing.Money stock (M2+CDs) has shown a year-to-year increase of about 4 percent partly due to an increasein fiscal expenditure.In this financial environment, credit conditions have eased somewhat.The following continue to warrant careful monitoring: how actively investors will take risks; how farprivate banks will ease their lending stance; and how these changes will affect economic activities.
1BIS Review 96/1999Mr Duisenberg reports on the outcome ofthe latest meeting of the ECB Governing CouncilIntroductory statement given by Mr Willem Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, tothe Press Conference, Frankfurt, on 9 September 1999.*      *      *Ladies and gentlemen,The Vice-President and I are here today to report on the outcome of today’s meetings of the GeneralCouncil and the Governing Council of the ECB, which were attended by Mr de Silguy, EuropeanCommissioner.The Governing Council reviewed the outlook for price developments and the risks to price stability inthe euro area, in line with its monetary policy strategy. As a result, the Governing Council decided notto change the prevailing ECB interest rates. The interest rate on the main refinancing operations of theEurosystem will thus remain 2.5%. In addition, the interest rate on the marginal lending facility willcontinue to be 3.5% and that on the deposit facility has been kept at 1.5%.Let me give you some details about our review of the latest information on monetary, financial andother economic developments, as well as about our latest assessment of the monetary policy stanceand thereby explain the decisions taken today.With regard to monetary developments in the euro area, the 12-month growth rate of the broadmonetary aggregate M3 increased from 5.3% in June to 5.6% in July 1999. The latest three-monthaverage of M3 growth, covering the period from May to July 1999, rose to 5.4%, compared with 5.3%in the previous three-month period from April to June 1999. Overall, the annual rate of growth of M3has been moving away from the reference value of 4.5% since the start of the year. This upwardmovement may be explained to a large extent by the very low opportunity costs of holding monetaryassets, especially the most liquid components, but perhaps also by the gradually improving economicconditions in the euro area. At the same time, the annual growth rate of credit to the private sectorremained high, even though it declined by 0.5 percentage point in July, to 10.4%.The monetary policy strategy of the Eurosystem assigns a prominent role to the behaviour of M3.Accordingly, recent monetary developments merit close attention. At the same time, taking intoaccount the fact that we are still in a very early phase of Monetary Union and that figures for broadmoney growth have been subject to some revisions in recent months, shorter-term monetarydevelopments need to be interpreted with caution.Concerning financial market indicators, the upturn in long-term interest rates in the euro area, seensince early May, continued in August and early September. Domestic factors seem to have played adominant role, as indicated by the fact that differentials between US and euro area bond yields havenarrowed further. In particular, market participants appear to be increasingly optimistic about theprospects for economic activity in the euro area. At the same time, expectations for inflation, asreflected by, inter alia, the signs emanating from index-linked bonds issued in the euro area, tend toindicate that markets still expect an evolution of consumer prices, which will remain compatible withprice stability.Developments in the world economy continue to show signs of improvement. Growth in the USeconomy continues and some positive economic signals have been recorded for Japan. While theoutlook for stronger growth in the global economy is also supported by recent developments in otherregions, notably South-East Asia, some risks remain, primarily in relation to the strength of therecovery in Latin America.As regards economic activity in the euro area, industrial production data up to June point to a furtherimprovement in output growth in the second quarter of this year, as has already been indicated by
BIS Review 96/19992various survey data. Moreover, available evidence in terms of retail sales data and consumerconfidence, while somewhat more mixed, suggests broadly sustained consumption growth. Thesedevelopments are consistent with recently published forecasts which foresee an upturn in economicgrowth in the course of this year. The downside risks pertaining to these projections have tended torecede and real GDP growth might eventually turn out to be somewhat higher than currently forecast.As generally expected, consumer price increases, as measured by the Harmonised Index of ConsumerPrices (HICP), picked up in July, with the annual rate of change rising from 0.9% in June to 1.1% inJuly. This effectively reversed the downward movement in the overall HICP rate which had beenevident since April 1999. While prices for unprocessed food declined further in July, this downwardeffect on the overall HICP rate was more than offset by a stronger increase in energy prices, resultingfrom a continued rise in oil prices. We expect consumer price increases to rise somewhat further fromtheir July levels, mainly as a consequence of higher oil prices. However, at this stage we also expectthis further increase to level out below the ceiling we have defined as being compatible with pricestability over the medium term.In conclusion, the prospects for a sustained economic upturn in the euro area are good, as are thechances of continued price stability. However, we remain vigilant taking into account the upward risksto price stability. In particular, with a view to conducting a thorough assessment of the risks to pricestability in the medium term, the increase in monetary growth over recent months and the high growthrate of credit to the private sector need to be monitored very carefully. In addition, the short-termupward pressure on consumer prices, which stems from the increase in oil prices over recent monthsand the lagged pass-through of developments in the exchange rate, have to be taken into account. Ifaccompanied by continued wage moderation, these factors alone should not be expected to threaten thecurrent outlook for price stability. Accordingly, the results of the wage bargaining round for the year2000 will play a particularly important role for the further assessment of price developments in theeuro area.The only way to prolong a non-inflationary recovery, and hence to substantially re-absorb the still veryhigh unemployment, is for all responsible parties to act decisively, in the near term, to increaseflexibility in the labour, product and service markets. This would also be the best way to allow theeconomy to take full advantage from the present stance of monetary policy.Taking all this information into account, the Governing Council decided to maintain the prevailingECB interest rates. In addition, it stressed that low inflation and therefore low interest rates shouldencourage higher investment, helping to prevent the emergence of capacity constraints duringeconomic expansion. At the same time, the expected improvement in economic activity offers greateropportunities to cut fiscal deficits further and to enhance structural reforms. Indeed, the creation of thisvirtuous circle depends on all policymakers playing their part.Let me now give the floor to the Vice-President to introduce three additional topics which wediscussed during our meetings.In addition to reviewing the main monetary, financial and other economic indicators, we discussedissues relating to the transition to the Year 2000.We are now approaching the final phase of testing activities in connection with preparatory work forthe Century Date Change. On 25 September 1999 the ECB and the EU national central banks willconduct a demonstration of the TARGET Year 2000 compliance in which – according to currentinformation – several hundred EU credit institutions will participate. Prior to this, the ECB and thenational central banks have already successfully tested their TARGET components first at the nationallevel and thereafter in cross-border tests. To a large extent, credit institutions have already taken partin these tests.In parallel, as announced a few weeks ago, on 29 June 1999 the ECB together with the national centralbanks successfully completed the bilateral testing of the ESCB applications that are necessary for theconduct of monetary policy operations. The testing exercise, together with the parallel remedialactions, has proved that these systems are Year 2000 compliant.
3BIS Review 96/1999You may recall that on 15 July 1999 we decided to close TARGET on 31 December 1999 in order tosmooth the transition not only for the ESCB institutions, but also for the other financial institutions.This day can thus be kept free for end-of-year operations and for making full back-ups of the relevantsystems.In the area of TARGET, as well as in the area of monetary policy implementation and liquiditymanagement, we are also reviewing our contingency procedures to minimise any potential Year2000-related impact. It is worth noting that general contingency procedures had already been put inplace shortly before the launch of the euro.In addition, we will use an efficient communication infrastructure between the ECB and the nationalcentral banks to monitor developments over the Year 2000 transition period. The ECB will also shareinformation with the Joint Year 2000 Council and will thereby extend its monitoring capabilitiesbeyond the Eurosystem to a global perspective.As far as our monetary policy framework is concerned, we are convinced that it is flexible enough andhas built-in mechanisms designed to deal with any level of liquidity demand that might arise in theeuro markets. Indeed, should any adaptation be advisable, this would be of limited importance andconsistent with the overall set-up. We have analysed different scenarios and have come to theconclusion that the Eurosystem will be in a position to cope with any potential increase in the demandfor liquidity. The stock of banknotes held by national central banks is sufficient to allow for aconsiderable additional demand for banknotes in circulation and the amount of collateral available inthe Eurosystem will be sufficient to allow for the corresponding increase in refinancing needs of thebanking system.We are therefore confident that the Eurosystem will continue its operations smoothly on 3 January2000 after the Century Date Change.We also reviewed cross-border retail payment services which are essential for the smooth functioningof the Single Market. We believe that citizens and businesses can only benefit fully from thefundamental principles of the free movement of goods, services, capital and people if they are alsoable to transfer money as rapidly, reliably and cheaply from one part of the European Union toanother, as is now the case within each Member State. Despite the introduction of the euro, however,there is still a clear gap between the service levels of domestic and cross-border retail paymentsystems in terms of quality, efficiency and pricing. The substantial disparities between domestic andcross-border services ought now to be reduced, and should ultimately disappear. In order to encouragethe development of cross-border payment systems enabling the public to benefit more fully from thesingle currency, the Eurosystem has drawn up a set of objectives for cross-border retail payments inthe euro area. These will be detailed in a separate press release which will be issued in the comingdays. The Eurosystem calls on the banking and payment service industry to fulfil these objectives by1 January 2002 at the latest.Finally, I would like to inform you that we also discussed issues related to fraud prevention. I wouldlike to emphasise that the ECB shares the concerns of the European Parliament, the EU Council andthe Commission about the protection of the Communities’ financial interests against fraud and otherdetrimental activities. Consequently, for the sake of transparency, efficiency and accountability, theGoverning Council decided to establish an external Supervisory Committee to enforce an Anti-FraudScheme at the ECB. This Committee will establish a cooperative relationship with the EuropeanAnti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
1BIS Review 94/1999Mr Meyer focuses on the implications for theconduct of current monetary policy in the United StatesRemarks by Mr Laurence H Meyer, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem, before the Philadelphia Council for Business Economics, Federal Reserve Bank ofPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania on 8 September 1999.*      *      *Often the most interesting part of a presentation on a challenging subject – such as the economicoutlook and the implications for monetary policy – is the Q&A after the formal remarks. This isespecially the case when the audience is well informed and has strong views about the subject – as isalways the case with a NABE group. This suggested an innovative approach: dispensing altogetherwith the formal remarks and going directly to the Q&A.My initial reaction to this insight was: wow – no paper to write, what a relief! My second responsewas, on the other hand – and isn’t there always an “other hand” when economists start talking – Ialways remind my audiences at the end of my talks that I am now prepared to “entertain” theirquestions. They soon learn that can be rather different from answering them. This distinction isimportant because there are some questions to which I am not prepared to respond.Today I will try to resolve this tension by proceeding directly to the Q&A, but, at the same time,orchestrating the Q&A by first identifying the questions that I am prepared to answer and thenanswering them. When I have completed this exercise, you are welcome to offer your own answers tomy questions or, of course, raise additional questions for me to entertain.I will ask and answer two sets of questions – the first related to the economic outlook and the secondto the strategy for monetary policy. In each case, I will focus on the implications for the conduct ofcurrent monetary policy. Let me also emphasize that both the questions and the answers reflect myown views and should not be interpreted as the position of the FOMC or the Board of Governors.I.Outlook Q&A1.Has there been an upturn in productivity growth?What we can confidently say is that, since late 1995, actual productivity growth has increased and,indeed, moved still higher at the end of 1998 and through early 1999. In addition, this improvementcannot be fully accounted for as a normal cyclical improvement because productivity growth increasedfurther after GDP growth stabilized at about 4%. This supports the view that there has been anincrease in trend productivity growth. In addition, the recent improved productivity performance iseven more remarkable, given that the decline in the unemployment rate to almost a 30-year low mighthave been expected to result in employment of lower-skilled and hence less-productive workers.Before discussing possible sources and implications of this development, let me clarify what I meanby trend productivity growth. First, I use it to refer to the maximum sustainable rate of growth inproductivity, once the economy has reached capacity. Looking backward, it can be measured byde-cycling actual productivity growth or by computing actual productivity growth over periods longenough to wash out the effect of the business cycle. Extrapolating the trend rate forward, it is the rateof actual productivity growth that would be expected if the economy remained at full employment.Trend productivity growth has varied widely over the post-war period, from more than 3% in the1960s to close to 1% in the decade preceding this expansion. Because actual productivity is highlypro-cyclical and because there is considerable noise in quarterly observations, it is not easy to discernimmediately changes in the underlying trend. This analytical problem has been further complicated inthe current episode by unexpectedly weak productivity growth earlier in the expansion. Recent data
BIS Review 94/19992are consistent with an increase in the productivity trend, but given that the evidence for an upturn inthe productivity trend is so recent, considerable uncertainty remains about what the underlying trendwill be going forward.Many forecasters, myself included, have been revising upward their estimate of trend productivitygrowth in response to recent unexpectedly strong productivity growth. Many of these estimates arenow about 2% or slightly higher. Part of the increase – about ¼ percentage point – from the earliertrend of just above 1% reflects improved measurement and is not in fact an acceleration of trueproductivity. Beyond that, an estimate of a 2% trend implies the trend rate of productivity growth hasincreased more than ½ percentage point. I do not, however, want to put too much emphasis on thatpoint estimate, given the uncertainty that I believe surrounds the calculation. But an incrementalchange of even ½ percentage point is really enormous if it is sustained over several decades.The source of such an improvement is some combination of capital deepening and a faster rate oftechnical advance. It appears that the ratio of capital services to labor has been rising appreciably inthe past few years as a result of the prevailing high level of net investment. This likely accounts forsome portion of the recent improvement in labor productivity. In addition, some portion of thisimprovement may also reflect a higher rate of technical advance, related to the rapid pace ofinnovation in information and communication technology and other high-tech contributions toproduction.The implications of such an acceleration in productivity are profound, at least if the increase issustained going forward for a considerable period. Productivity is, of course, a close relative of realincome per capita, a widely used measure of living standards. Higher productivity growth thereforemeans a faster rate of improvement in living standards. It also means increased tax revenue to thegovernment and enhanced ability of the country to meet its longer-run spending obligations, includingSocial Security.Of course, at the Federal Reserve, the key question is, what does higher productivity growth mean formonetary policy? First, monetary policy never should target a specific rate of growth in output butrather should adjust to changes in resource utilization rates and inflation. This is because growth itselfdoes not cause inflation; it is excessive utilization rates that are a proximate source of inflationpressures. We sometimes try to capture this by saying that monetary policy should foster themaximum sustainable growth that the economy is capable of achieving. More precisely, once at fullemployment, monetary policy should accommodate the maximum growth that does not push theeconomy beyond that point.A monetary policy focused on maintaining price stability has to be careful to avoid stifling unexpectedincreases in trend growth, specifically by confusing higher trend growth with above-trend growth. Inaddition, monetary policy cannot accept responsibility for raising trend growth. The only contributionmonetary policy can make in this regard is through promoting price stability and thereby reducing theallocative distortions and possible biases against saving and investment associated with inflation.Another reason for avoiding growth as a target for monetary policy is that the preferred growth rate, atany time, depends on prevailing utilization rates. If the economy is at full employment and at thepreferred rate of inflation, trend growth will indeed be the preferred outcome. However, if theeconomy is initially at utilization rates high enough to result in rising inflation over time, the preferredgrowth outcome will be below trend, allowing some unwinding of the initial excess demand.Therefore, it is always more precise to characterize the monetary policy response in terms ofadjustments to changes in prevailing and projected utilization rates rather than in terms of a responseto prevailing and projected growth. Unfortunately, it is sometimes difficult to gauge the degree ofexcess demand associated with a given utilization rate, a subject I will return to later.What are the implications for monetary policy of a step-up in trend productivity growth and, hence,trend real GDP growth? First, such a development would ultimately call for an upward revision to thetargets for money growth, so that the money growth targets would remain consistent with anunchanged target for the inflation rate. As a practical matter, however, this is not a serious policy issuebecause the monetary aggregate targets play only a minor role in the conduct of monetary policytoday. At any rate, such an adjustment might be premature today, given the uncertainty about the
3BIS Review 94/1999underlying trend. However, if the apparent higher trend productivity and GDP growth persists, at somepoint the money growth ranges should be appropriately adjusted.Under the prevailing operational regime of setting a target for the federal funds rate, money growthwould automatically adjust to accommodate the higher rate of trend growth, at an unchanged nominalfederal funds rate target. Over the longer run, the challenge under an interest-rate regime is to align thereal federal funds rate with its new equilibrium value, which is likely to increase with a higher trendrate of productivity growth (due to a higher return on capital that underlies the new equilibrium realinterest rate in the economy).The principal challenge to a monetary policy focused on utilization rates is that an unexpected shift inproductivity growth, in effect lowers the unemployment rate consistent with stable inflation (theNAIRU) for a while. This allows the economy to operate at a higher utilization rate withoutinflationary consequences, at least until the higher productivity is fully anticipated in wage bargainingor until productivity growth stops accelerating.Let me explain the source of the decline in the effective NAIRU. Assume that the increase inproductivity is not anticipated and therefore does not immediately raise workers’ real wage demands.With unchanged nominal wage demands and higher productivity, firms will experience a decline inunit labor costs. This will initially boost profits. But competition will quickly force the lower costs tobe passed through to consumers in lower prices, lowering price inflation relative to nominal wagechange. This decline in inflation, in turn, will put some downward pressure on nominal wage gains.The net result is that an unanticipated increase in the rate of growth of productivity is another exampleof a favorable supply shock, temporarily lowering inflation. It is useful, nevertheless, to distinguishprice shocks – such as declines in energy or non-oil import prices – from productivity growth shocksthat have their initial effects on costs rather than on prices.During a transitional period following an unexpected increase in the productivity trend, untilproductivity growth stabilizes and the higher rate becomes anticipated it will be possible to operate atresource utilization rates beyond what is sustainable over the longer run without inflationaryconsequences. It is perfectly reasonable to take advantage of this opportunity, as long as care is takento return to more sustainable utilization rates as the disinflationary force of the upward shift inproductivity growth dissipates. Of course, policymakers must also weigh the option of “opportunisticdisinflation” in such a circumstance – the possibility of reducing inflation toward their long-run targetwithout depressing, even temporarily, resource utilization rates. However, if inflation is already at itstarget, the option of permitting temporarily higher output and employment clearly dominates.The apparent increase in the productivity trend probably has been an important disinflationary forceover the last few years. Some of the benefits in this case have been taken in the form of lower inflationand some in the form of temporarily higher resource utilization rates. An important issue therefore iswhether current utilization rates are sustainable, once productivity growth stabilizes. This issuemotivated my next question and answer.2.Is the economy overheated, or is there a threat of overheating?An overheated economy is one operating beyond the point of sustainable capacity and thereforeexperiencing excess demand in labor and product markets. The importance of the concept followsfrom the reasonable expectation that excess demand in labor and product markets is a proximatesource of higher inflation.So, is the economy overheated? There are two ways to identify such a condition. The first is to findsome proxy for excess demand in labor and product markets. We have to satisfy ourselves withproxies because excess demand is not directly measurable. The second is to look for the consequencesof overheating, in the form of acceleration in wage gains or prices.Proxies for excess demand are utilization rates in the labor and product markets – such as theunemployment rate in the labor market and capacity utilization in the product market. Capacityutilization is measured only in the “industrial” sector, so it is a narrow measure of generalized excessdemand in the product market. Nevertheless, it remains an important proxy for the balance of supply
BIS Review 94/19994and demand in the product market. At any given time, a lower unemployment rate or higher capacityutilization rate implies greater demand relative to supply in the respective market.But we are also searching for an absolute concept, the point of balance between supply and demand inthe respective markets that divides excess demand from excess supply – in effect, the origin in adiagram relating inflation to excess demand and supply. That’s the difficult part, because we observeonly absolute unemployment and capacity utilization rates and have to estimate their respective“natural” rates, the levels consistent with balance between supply and demand in the respectivemarkets. Worse still, the balance point we want to identify is not fixed, but shifts over time.Obviously, the more stable the natural rates are, the more useful is the concept in forecasting andpolicy analysis. The less stable they are, the more uncertainty we will have at any point about theunderlying degree of excess demand.We have no choice but to estimate the natural rates from equations that try to capture inflationdynamics. That’s all the Phillips Curve is – an equation that relates nominal wage change to expectedinflation and excess demand in the labor market, proxied by the unemployment rate relative to animplicit estimate of the NAIRU, derived directly from the estimation of the equation.We have encountered several difficulties in applying this framework in the recent period. First, basedon equations for wage dynamics, the evidence suggests some decline in the NAIRU and moreuncertainty about its current value. Second, the signals about excess demand coming from labor andproduct markets – that is from unemployment and capacity utilization rates – have diverged to anunusual degree, making an assessment of the overall degree of excess demand in the economy stillmore difficult. Third, the economy has been subject to powerful price shocks in this episode –including significant swings in oil prices and exchange rates. Such shocks are a second proximatesource of movements in inflation, and their presence further complicates the identification of the signalfrom excess demand as well as the assessment of what utilization rates will trigger rising inflation inthe near term. Fourth, it appears that there has been an upturn in the productivity trend, which, asnoted above, acts as a disinflationary force for a period of time, further masking underlying excessdemand and further complicating the assessment of sustainable utilization rates.So, where does all this put us in terms of proxies for excess demand? The answer is that it leaves uswith considerable uncertainty. We’re in an environment where reasonable people can disagree aboutwhether or not there is currently excess demand in the economy and, given that uncertainty, whetheror not we ought to use evidence based on estimates of excess demand directly in the conduct ofmonetary policy. It also puts a priority on developing a strategy that takes account of possible shifts inand uncertainty about both productivity growth and the NAIRU.Although it appears that there is excess demand in the labor market, its effect has been diminished bythe combination of the absence of corresponding excess demand in the product markets, the residue ofthe long period of reinforcing favorable price shocks, and the force of the unexpected acceleration intrend productivity. As the favorable price shocks dissipate or reverse and once trend productivitygrowth stabilizes, there is a risk that excess demand in the labor market will put the economy on a pathof rising inflation, unless growth slows enough to unwind the excess demand before inflation begins tomove upward.Given the momentum in sales and expectations for a stronger pace of inventory building in the secondhalf, the consensus is that growth will rebound in the second half to trend or above, though we havenot yet seen the effects on spending of the rise in bond rates and the flattening of equity prices sincethe spring. This should help to slow the growth of domestic demand. Although there is some risk thatgrowth could remain above trend and therefore aggravate any initial excess demand, a major concernremains that the prevailing balance of supply and demand in the labor market might put upwardpressure on inflation, even if growth slows to trend ahead.Let me briefly comment on the second indicator of excess demand. Instead of trying to measure thestate of balance or imbalance between supply and demand, we could focus on observing theconsequence of excess demand – specifically, increases in prices – or, for a given initial inflation rate,increases in inflation. Unfortunately, because of supply shocks, we cannot always make thisidentification so easily. I read the recent inflation data as at least suggesting that the underlying
5BIS Review 94/1999inflation rate is stabilizing, after a period of decline, without any evidence of a broad-based upturn ininflation. Nominal wage increases have moderated since the middle of 1998, likely reflecting thedecline in inflation associated with a combination of favorable supply shocks, including theunexpected increase in the productivity trend. Some of the most recent data suggest that the growth ofnominal compensation is no longer declining, and there are hints in the data and in anecdotes thatwage pressures may be building.How should monetary policy respond to increasing utilization rates? Should real interest rates be heldconstant until utilization rates increase above some threshold, for example, or should real interest ratesbe more smoothly pro-cyclical, gradually increasing in response to rising utilization rates? That issimply a question of what systematic policy response works best to promote the dual objectives ofmonetary policy: promoting price stability and damping fluctuations around full employment. Myjudgment is that a regime in which there is a gradual, systematic pro-cyclical response of real interestrates is the one that produces the best trade-off between inflation and output variability. This is thekind of response embodied in the Taylor Rule, for example, though in practice, as we have seen,implementation of this approach is complicated by uncertainties about the level of the NAIRU or itscousin, the output gap. I will return to this problem when I take up the question of how preemptivemonetary policy can and should be.3.Are equities overvalued, so that the economy is threatened with an asset market bubble?This is perhaps the most-asked question I get, so I thought I would preempt you and answer this onedirectly – though you may decide that I chose to entertain this question!Equity prices have increased enormously over the past four years, to levels that challenge previousvaluation standards. Let me make clear at the outset that I honestly do not know whether or notequities are fairly valued or overvalued. I have nothing to share with you about this question. What Ido want to share with you is how the equity market fits into my thinking about monetary policy. Thoseof us fortunate enough to attend this year’s Jackson Hole Conference, sponsored by the FederalReserve Bank of Kansas City, had plenty of opportunity to think about and discuss this issue.Most important, policymakers should reflect the higher value of equities in their forecasts foraggregate spending and adjust monetary policy as necessary to remain consistent with the broadobjectives of monetary policy. The key here is to remain focused on broad macroeconomicperformance, responding indirectly to the movements in equity prices – whether the higher value ofequities appears driven by fundamentals or otherwise – rather than to use policy directly to influencethe value of equities. If policy is disciplined in pursuit of its broad macroeconomic objectives, this willreduce (though not eliminate) the prospect that equities will become significantly overvalued.There are, nevertheless, several steps that policymakers might consider if they have suspicions thatequities might be overvalued. They could build some assumption about a market correction into theirforecast. That would seem reasonable but could be a mistake. Specifically, it could discourage themfrom tightening in response to robust demand driven in part by past increases in market values,counting instead on an autonomous correction in equity values, the degree and timing of which has tobe extremely uncertain.On the other hand, given such suspicions, policymakers should be alert to the potential that atightening of policy could have a disproportionate effect on demand, if it induces a reassessment ofmarket fundamentals. This does not mean, however, that policymakers are trapped and cannot respondto robust demand and rising inflation risks. It does suggest that they should appreciate that there willbe more uncertainty about the magnitude of the effect of a given policy tightening and that the effectcould be disproportionately large.While the stock market should not be a target for monetary policy, policymakers should pay attentionto the signals from the market. An aggressive rise in equity prices can be a sign of highly favorablefinancial conditions in general and a highly accommodative monetary policy in particular. If thisoccurs when the economy is already near potential, policymakers should re-evaluate the
BIS Review 94/19996appropriateness of their policy setting in terms of promoting price stability and damping fluctuationsaround full employment.Finally, policymakers should be alert to the need to respond appropriately to a significant marketcorrection. It is important to note that policymakers should not target the level of equity prices on theway down any more than on the way up but, in both directions, should take the movement in equityprices into account in their forecast and hence in the setting of monetary policy.II.Monetary policy Q&A1.Does prevailing uncertainty about the structure of the economy and the recent forecasterrors diminish the ability of monetary policy to be preemptive?Without doubt. But that does not mean that there cannot be a preemptive element in monetary policy.It means only that policy is likely to be less preemptive – and hence more reactive – than it otherwisewould be. The critical questions are just how preemptive can and should monetary policy be today?Let me begin to answer this question by defining what I mean by reactive and preemptive policyapproaches. First, policy is reactive if it responds only to the incoming data and preemptive if it alsoresponds to a forecast. This is the distinction between backward-looking and forward-looking policy.Second, with respect to inflation, policy can still be preemptive if it responds to incoming data onutilization rates, given the link between current utilization rates and future inflation. Of course, thedegree of confidence that policymakers have in this link (and specifically in their measure of excessdemand) will determine how preemptive they are prepared to be.The greater uncertainty about the level of excess demand should, I believe, diminish theaggressiveness with which monetary policy responds to changes in utilization rates. The difficulty inforecasting should, in addition, encourage more emphasis on responding to incoming data anddiminish (though not eliminate) the role of the forecast in the policy decision. This is sensible andprudent. To sever this relationship of monetary policy either to incoming data on utilization rates or tothe forecast altogether, however, would remove the key elements of preemptive monetary policy withrespect to containing inflation and leave policy entirely reactive. If the uncertainty were great enough,this would be a reasonable response. But I do not believe that such an extreme position is warranted.There are, however, a couple of constructive policy responses in light of prevailing uncertainties aboutthe level of excess demand and the forecast. First, policymakers could update their estimates of theNAIRU and the output gap (assuming, in the first place, that they find these concepts useful, as I do)in light of realizations of unemployment, output, inflation and other variables. This has, in fact, beenone response that many, including myself, have taken in response to recent developments. Infollowing this approach, policymakers would become less responsive to declines in the unemploymentrate, to the extent that estimates of the NAIRU are revised downward as unemployment and inflationdecline together.Second, policymakers could attenuate the response of the real federal funds rate to declines in theunemployment rate in a region around their estimate of the NAIRU. But once the unemployment rategets far enough below (or above) the estimated NAIRU so that confidence returns that the labormarket is experiencing excess demand (or supply), then the more normal response of real interest ratesto incremental declines in the unemployment rate would again become appropriate.But you have to be careful about overdoing caution as well as overdoing aggressiveness. If you takecare to adjust your estimate of the NAIRU and the output gap in response to incoming data, you wouldbe unwise to ignore these revised measures of the unemployment and output gaps in setting policy.
7BIS Review 94/19992.What is the meaning of symmetric and asymmetric directives?I think that it has become clear that symmetry/asymmetry is a subtle concept.I believe that there are two interrelated dimensions of the so-called tilt or bias in monetary policy. Thefirst dimension relates to the balance of risks going forward. The second relates to the probability of anear-term policy change.The tilt provides the market with an indication of the Committee’s balancing of the risks related toemerging excess demand or supply and inflation going forward and hence in what direction policy ismore likely to move. In a symmetric directive, the risks are viewed as evenly balanced, so that the nextrate increase could as easily be up or down. In an asymmetric directive, the risks are viewed as tilted inone direction or the other, so there is, for example, a greater likelihood of an increase than a decreasein rates.A symmetric directive also indicates little prospect that a near-term move will be required if theeconomic outlook evolves roughly as expected. An asymmetric directive, in contrast, alerts the marketto the greater possibility, though not the certainty, of a move in a particular direction over somenear-term policy horizon.At the December 1998 meeting, the FOMC decided, going forward, to announce the tilt and explainthe reason for such a policy change in those cases where the change in the Committee’s views of thebalance of risks was “significant” and when announcing this change to the public was viewed as“important.” This made the announcement of the tilt, in effect, another policy tool because anannounced change in the tilt would move market rates, though to a lesser degree than a change in therate itself. This decision should be understood as an effort to increase the transparency of monetarypolicy and to allow the Committee to communicate more clearly its views of the balance of risks andthe prospects of further policy actions going forward. Underlying this effort is the view that financialmarkets operate more efficiently when they have more complete information and the preference forsignaling markets about prospective policy actions rather than surprising markets.The early experience with its use suggests that announced adjustments in the tilt sometimes haveunexpectedly large effects on financial markets and on the reaction of markets to subsequent data orstatements by FOMC members. It has also become clear that it is not easy to communicate some of thesubtleties and complexities of monetary policy intentions in a single word. When the signaling is, as aresult, imperfect and the Committee’s intentions are misperceived, market rates may moveinconsistently or faster than is justified by the balance of risks and the likely course of policy. Therecent experience suggests that the use and announcement of tilts should be viewed as a “work inprogress,” rather than a well-tuned and final product.3.Does the response of the bond market to evolving economic developments reduce oreliminate the importance of activist monetary policy?A theme we sometimes hear is that the FOMC can take a permanent vacation, leaving the conduct ofmonetary policy to the bond market. I have heard this referred to as the “gyroscope” theory, in that itportrays the bond market as the gyroscope of the economy, sensitively responding to developments soas to stabilize the economy. Were it only so simple!It is sometimes said at the Federal Reserve that when we look at the bond market we are really lookingat ourselves in the mirror. This means that market participants are responding to the data, theirchanging forecast, and their understanding of our policy reaction function. Long-term rates are, afterall, based on current and expected future short-term rates. Expected future short-term rates, in turn, arevery much a function of the Fed’s policy response.What this means is that when bond rates rise in the expectation of future monetary policy tightening(that is, in the expectation of higher short-term rates), we have a choice. We can confirm theexpectations by tightening, preserving the higher bond rates. Or we can contradict those expectationsby leaving policy unchanged, likely resulting in some reversal of the initial movement in bond rates
BIS Review 94/19998(as the bond market comes to better understand our policy reaction function). There is, however, alsothe possibility that the failure to tighten when such a move is widely expected may leave in placehigher long-term rates (or raise them further), if our failure to act is viewed as inconsistent with ourcommitment to price stability.Such preemptive pricing in the bond market is the private sector analogue to preemptive moves in thefederal funds rate. When the bond market is correct, its preemptive pricing should be rewarded by theexpected movement in the federal funds rate. To fail to so reward it would be to undermine the abilityand willingness of the bond market to engage in such preemptive pricing. On the other hand, when thebond market is viewed as having inappropriately built in expectations of higher rates, monetary policyought to provide an anchor, in the form of an unchanged funds rate, to which the bond market canreturn as incorrect expectations are unwound.The bottom line is – no vacation for the Fed. But preemptive pricing in the bond market can makemonetary policy more effective by speeding the response of long-term rates to changing economicconditions. There is a potential synergy here between monetary policy and the bond market. The moretransparent monetary policy is, the more effective preemptive pricing in the bond market will be. Themore effective preemptive pricing in the bond market is, the shorter the lag from a change in monetarypolicy to the effect on aggregate demand, and hence the more effective monetary policy is.III.ConclusionSum it all up! First, clarify the logic of the recent Fed tightenings and then provide some insight intothe prospects for near-term monetary policy in light of the comments above on the outlook and thestrategy of monetary policy.In my view, the current monetary policy problem has two dimensions. The first dimension is to adjustthe federal funds rate so that it is appropriate in terms of prevailing utilization and inflation rates, withappropriate regard to the uncertainty about the measurement of utilization rates. I have called this thereassessment issue because it involves a reassessment of the desirability of the full amount of easingsimplemented last fall. The second dimension involves the adjustment in the funds rate going forward,in response to incoming data and changes in the forecast.The easings last fall were implemented at a time of sharp dislocations in financial markets and sharpdownward revisions to the forecasts of both global and U.S. growth this year. I view the recenttightenings as the partial reversal of the earlier easings, in response to the reversal of the factors thatmotivated them. Financial markets have clearly improved. The global economy looks stronger and theUnited States is now projected to expand this year at a multiple of the rate projected last fall. Indetermining how much of the easings to reverse, one also has to take into account the decline in coreinflation since last fall, as well as uncertainties about translating the current utilization rates intomeasures of excess demand.What can and will I say about monetary policy going forward? I always like to point out that I amprepared to be quite explicit about the course of policy going forward. The answer to the question,what policy changes do I expect going forward, is simple: “It depends.” Specifically, it depends on theincoming data and the evolving forecast.
1BIS Review 93/1999Mr Lee examines some of the major themes for strengtheningthe global financial system against the background of the financial crisis in AsiaOpening address by Mr Lee Hsien Loong, Chairman of the Board of Directors of The MonetaryAuthority of Singapore and Deputy Prime Minister at the fifth meeting of Finance and Central Bankdeputies on the Manila Framework at Shangri-La Hotel on 29 August 1999.*      *      *IntroductionI am happy to address the Manila Framework Group.Prospects for the region have brightened considerably since your inaugural gathering in November1997, in the depths of the regional economic turmoil. The worst of the crisis is now well past. Most ofthe crisis-countries are seeing growth again. Investor sentiment, while edgy, is generally upbeat.Equity markets have surged, some beyond pre-crisis levels. Currencies have stabilised; indeed somegovernments have had to temper the appreciation of their currencies.But financial markets are notorious for their short-term memories. An upturn does not necessarilymean that basic problems have been solved. It remains important for financial regulators andpolicymakers to remain mindful of the lessons thrown up by the crisis and to tackle them beforeanother storm blows up.No two Asian economies are the same. During the crisis, hardly any were spared the panic andcontagion. But how each was struck, how external problems interacted with internal weaknesses andhow each government responded, varied from country to country. These diverse experiences offer richmaterials for study and contrast. Lessons learnt at great cost of human suffering and political upheavalmay help us formulate sounder policies for the future. A thorough comparative study would occupyseveral PhD theses. But a brief review of what happened in each country will be a useful basis forexamining some of the major themes for strengthening the global financial system.Asian crisis – what happenedThailandThe crisis began in Thailand after a long boom. The establishment of the Bangkok InternationalBanking Facility or BIBF and the implicit guarantee of a fixed exchange rate encouraged unhedgedborrowing in foreign currency by Thai companies. This led to a build-up of external debt and an assetbubble.As the Thai economy weakened, the balance of payments deteriorated and the baht came underpressure. Attempts to defend the baht were costly and ultimately unsuccessful. When the baht wasfinally allowed to weaken, its sharp fall triggered the collapse of many Thai corporations as well as thebanking system. The Thai economy contracted sharply.The aftershocks of the Thai problem affected many other Asian economies. Confidence in the wholeregion was shaken. Both domestic residents and foreign investors alike rushed to hedge or reduce theirexposure to the region.MalaysiaMalaysia was among the next to be affected. Its economy was fundamentally sound although therewere concerns over a property boom and over investment in infrastructure. An acute loss of
BIS Review 93/19992confidence, partially prompted by Thailand’s problems, led to a sell-off of Malaysian shares and theringgit. The stock market and exchange rate crashed.Unlike other countries, Malaysia did not have excessive external borrowing. However, domesticborrowing was very high as banks had lent large sums, often against share collateral and to largeproperty projects. The crash exposed these weaknesses in the private sector. On 1 September 1998,Malaysia decided to impose capital controls.IndonesiaIndonesia was also believed to be fundamentally sound, even well after the initial outbreak of theregional currency turmoil. In late 1997, analysts continued to be upbeat on Indonesia’s economicprospects, expecting, on average, a strong 6-7% GDP growth in 1998. But as regional problemsstacked up, Indonesia too could not escape the progressive erosion of confidence.The Indonesian economy had two domestic weaknesses: unsound banks and companies that hadborrowed excessively abroad in short-term loans unbeknown to the government. These companiesstarted hedging their exposures, sending the rupiah into a downward spiral. The companies becameinsolvent, badly affecting the banking system. Policy errors by the Suharto government compoundedthis. Grave social and political difficulties eventually led to a political crisis and a political transitionthat is still not completed.KoreaKorea’s dynamic economy had certain weaknesses, but these were long-standing and well known:chaebols were very highly leveraged and banks often made lending decisions on government directioninstead of commercial viability. Like Indonesia, Korea’s short-term foreign debt was high. When thecrisis broke, foreign creditors refused to roll-over credit lines. Korean banks which had borrowedheavily overseas came under severe pressure.However, unlike in Indonesia, the major creditor countries, particularly the United States, got togetherand agreed on an orderly roll-over of Korean banks’ short-term debt. This stabilised the situation andenabled the Korean economy to resume growth quickly.Hong KongHong Kong and Singapore were the two economies with the least structural problems or foreignborrowings, yet neither could escape the contagion. Hong Kong’s economy benefited from its linkageswith China which was relatively unaffected by the regional currency turmoil. But the Hong Kongdollar’s (HK$) peg to the US$ caused Hong Kong’s real exchange rate to appreciate significantlywhen all the other regional currencies fell. The full adjustment to the changed external environmenthad to be borne internally, through nominal prices of assets and wages. The result was a sharprecession from which Hong Kong is just beginning to emerge.At the same time, the high HK$ led the markets to assess the risks of a devaluation. Interest rates rose,further squeezing the economy. After several speculative attacks on the currency and “double-play” onthe currency and share markets, the HKMA intervened directly to buy shares in August 1998. Thespeculative attacks were successfully beaten off, but the Hong Kong Government remains extremelyconcerned over the dangers posed by speculators, and particularly hedge funds, to their economicstability.SingaporeSingapore was more directly affected by the crisis than Hong Kong because of our close economiclinkages to Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia. Our growth slowed down drastically, turning negativefor several quarters. However, unlike Hong Kong, the S$ exchange rate could and did adjust down
3BIS Review 93/1999relative to the US$, in line with its trading partners. This extra degree of freedom helped to soften theimpact of the sharp regional slowdown and depreciation of its neighbours’ currencies.In addition, the Government sought to make prompt and direct adjustments to the real economy,cutting taxes and levies, reducing the CPF contributions with the support of unions and workers andbuilding capabilities for the longer term. These measures helped see Singapore through the storm andare now enabling Singapore to recover, together with the rest of the region.Lessons from the crisisWhen the Asian currency crisis first broke out, many observers blamed the “Asian model”. But thenother emerging markets, even the developed world, came under fire. It became clear that the problemwas not just Asia, but also weaknesses in the structure of the global financial system.There is general agreement on what the key weaknesses were, but not yet on their solutions. Verybroadly, I identify five issues:• Capital controls – can they help?• Exchange rate regimes – fixed or floating?• Hedge funds – what do they imply for global systemic stability?• Global financial supervision – is this possible?• Strengthening domestic institutions – a prerequisite to participation in the global system.Capital controlsThis crisis has prompted a reconsideration of the merits of capital controls. In an ideal world, theglobal capital market should be one integrated whole, with no restraints on the movement of capital.Then savings could be channelled to their most productive uses and countries could fund theirinvestment needs at the lowest possible cost.But in reality many economies still lack the institutional framework to deal with free capital flows.Furthermore, investors are prone to herd behaviour which can result in large surges of capital into andout of countries. These surges cause bubbles and crashes which can do great harm to economies,especially small and vulnerable ones.The liberalisation of capital accounts must thus be treated with caution. It must not proceed faster thanthe strength of countries’ domestic financial systems and institutional capability. Controls on “hotmoney” are difficult to administer and subject to evasion, but they can help make countries lessvulnerable to volatile financial markets.For instance in Indonesia, following the liberalisation of the banking sector in the late 1980s,companies made large short-term borrowings in foreign currencies. They circumvented rules intendedto prevent this. When the crisis struck, the Indonesian government did not know how much thecompanies had borrowed. Yet the total was almost US$ 50 billion1, more than double Indonesia’sgross foreign reserves.The effects of the capital controls which Malaysia imposed in September 1998 are still being debated.But even Malaysia, which is implacably opposed to speculators out to make a quick profit, stillwelcomes foreign investors including portfolio investors buying Malaysian shares. Ultimately, allcountries still hope to enjoy the benefits of global capital markets such as more foreign investmentsand transfers of technology.1External debt of the non-bank sector totalled US$ 47 billion in FY1997, accounting for 83% of total private external debtand 41% of Indonesia’s total external debt.
BIS Review 93/19994In Singapore, our currency is fully convertible. We abolished exchange controls in 1978. We have norestrictions either on the inflow or outflow of funds. Because we are a financial centre, these flows arelarge relative to the size of our economy. Hence we want to be careful not to let them overwhelm ordamage our real economy.This is why we have maintained a policy of non-internationalisation of the Singapore dollar (S$). Thisis not a form of exchange or capital control. It is a monetary policy measure to deter speculationagainst the S$. It prevents non-residents from borrowing the S$ for purposes unrelated to our economyfor example to fund a short position in the S$.We believe that the S$ exchange rate should be appropriate to prevailing economic conditions and theunderlying state of the Singapore economy. Indeed in the long term, keeping the currency in line withfundamentals is the best way to avoid offering speculators too tempting a target.Exchange rate regimesMassive speculative attacks on exchange rates are a common element in financial crises. Misalignedfixed exchange rates have figured prominently in financial crises throughout the 1990s, even the 1980sand 1970s.In the post-crisis era, the conventional wisdom is that emerging markets should choose either afree-floating or fixed exchange rate system.But neither is a panacea. Fixed exchange rates are hard to sustain in a world of global capital mobility.Furthermore, they tend to be viable only when supported by large foreign reserves and stronginstitutional arrangements. Even then, the exchange rate can still become misaligned and vulnerable,as has happened in Argentina.In Hong Kong, strong foreign reserves and well-developed financial authorities and institutions madeits currency board workable and credible. But even the Hong Kong dollar came under fierce attack inthis crisis. In other countries a fixed exchange rate may be completely infeasible. Thus Professor SteveHanke’s proposal to set up a currency board system to stabilise the rupiah was viewed with deepscepticism by policymakers both in Indonesia as well as the IMF and the World Bank.Neither does a free-floating exchange rate always work. Even developed countries do not remainimpassive when capital flows overwhelm trade flows and threaten the competitiveness of the country’sexports. A prime example is Japan. And despite a free-float, the exchange rate may spiral downwardsif there is a loss of confidence. This happened in Indonesia and Brazil after they abandoned theirexchange rate pegs.Singapore operates a managed float. This policy has prevented the currency from getting too far out ofline and rendering our exports uncompetitive as a fixed rate might have done. A managed float has nottotally eliminated speculative pressures on the S$, but for our circumstances it is the most appropriateapproach.The best exchange rate regime depends on the specific circumstances of each economy. While it isimportant to get this right, the exchange rate does not exist in a vacuum. Ultimately, it is the strengthof the country’s economy, the soundness of its fiscal and monetary policies and the confidence of bothforeign investors and its own citizens in the country that determines whether or not the currency isstable. If these fundamentals are out of kilter, no technical fix of the exchange rate regime will avert acrisis.Hedge fundsPerhaps the most controversial issue to have arisen from the crisis is that of hedge funds. Theyundoubtedly took positions successfully against the Thai baht. The Malaysian Government is certainthat hedge funds were behind the collapse of its stock market and currency. Hong Kong and Australiaare similarly convinced that hedge funds led attacks on their currencies.
5BIS Review 93/1999On the other hand there is some evidence that except in Thailand the hedge funds may have beenwrong footed in the crisis. George Soros has denied being short on the ringgit, during and severalmonths before the crisis2. A spokesman for Soros Fund Management said in October 1997: “Recentvolatility in world financial markets is reflected in the volatility of the Quantum Group’sperformance”, a nice cryptic way to say that they had incurred substantial losses.While the facts are still hotly disputed, they are ascertainable. What role hedge funds played indifferent countries is an empirical question and not a matter of opinion. A Working Group on HLIs hasbeen set up under the Financial Stability Forum. I hope it will settle the facts unambiguously so thatthe debate can move on to consider what, if anything, should be done.In deciding whether to restrict the activities of hedge funds, there are three considerations. First, whoare the shareholders of hedge funds? They do not represent the retail public. Typically, hedge fundsinvest on behalf of wealthy individuals and institutional investors who do not need consumerprotection. From this point of view, the activities of hedge funds are private business and need not besubject to the same strict regulations and disclosure demands as financial institutions that collectmonies from the public.The second is a prudential concern. Are financial institutions that lend to hedge funds beingsufficiently prudent and provisioning enough capital in relation to the lending? Hedge funds are notrated by commercial rating agencies, unlike most large banks and corporations. They often keep theirportfolios and strategies secret which hampers a proper assessment of their financial soundness. Theexisting regulatory framework is not tight enough in this respect. As LTCM showed, creditors oftenlent independently of one another and were not setting aside sufficient capital to cover their lending tohighly leveraged funds.The third is a systemic consideration. Are hedge funds a source of instability in the global financialsystem? While their role in the Asian crisis remains controversial, the LTCM incident shows clearlythat on occasion hedge funds can be destabilising, through their sheer size and leverage.Banning hedge funds altogether is not the solution. Many other institutions make similar plays as thehedge funds. Indeed hedge funds can play a positive role in international financial markets. Theirsignature contrarian and arbitrage strategies can help to stabilise and even enhance the efficiency offinancial markets. However, checks are necessary to prevent them from accumulating excessivepositions, unknown to the market and to regulators.Directly regulating hedge funds will also not work. There is the practical problem of regulatoryarbitrage – such players can easily relocate if regulation is forced on them. Besides, not all hedgefunds are large and highly leveraged. There is no need to regulate all of them in the same way.One possible approach is indirect regulation, through their lenders and other counterparties. Thismeans bringing the private sector into the surveillance picture. We should create incentives in thesupervisory framework for the counterparties of hedge funds to become more vigilant and prudent.Lenders must strengthen their own credit assessment systems, while regulators should find ways toencourage risky borrowers to disclose more, voluntarily, to their creditors. For example, we couldintroduce a higher risk weighting for borrowers who are large and highly leveraged and who do notdisclose enough to either their creditors or the credit rating agencies. This would spur hedge funds todisclose more or to obtain a credit rating.Global financial supervisionThe crisis has set off debate as to whether the global capital market needs a global regulator. I doubtthis is workable, or even desirable. A global financial super-regulator requires countries to give upnational sovereignty. This is politically unrealistic; witness how carefully the IMF had needed to2George Soros in The Crisis of Global Capitalism, Ch. 7 The Global Financial Crisis, p. 136.
BIS Review 93/19996canvas its major shareholders to support its prescriptions and how closely the US Congress scrutinisesthe IMF’s actions.A more practical, albeit modest, solution is the establishment of the Financial Stability Forum. Thisbrings together both the G7 countries as well as non-G7 financial centres and internationalorganisations such as the IMF, World Bank and the BIS to discuss the vulnerabilities of the worldsystem. The Forum should be able to get best practices and supervisory standards implemented morewidely and effectively.The FSF has set up three working groups to study areas of vulnerability highlighted by the crisis:capital flows and exchange rate regimes, highly leveraged institutions and offshore financial centres(OFC).Singapore has been invited to participate in the FSF, together with Australia, Hong Kong and theNetherlands. We are also in the OFC working group. OFCs have attracted considerable attentionbecause of the significant capital flows they generate. They are a weak link in the maintenance ofglobal best practices and regulatory and supervisory standards. If OFCs do not meet internationalstandards they will provide an opportunity for regulatory arbitrage. Financial institutions may betempted to migrate to such OFCs. This would make it very difficult for other jurisdictions to maintainor raise their own standards.There is work ahead to understand the roles and uses of OFCs and their implications for financialstability. Singapore, together with the other members of the OFC working group, will involve OFCs inthis study. We aim to find ways to get them to meet international standards of cooperation incross-border information exchange and enforcement. We must create incentives for OFCs to play bythe rules or at least not disregard the rules. Bringing OFCs under the global regulatory umbrella willhelp raise prudential standards and enhance the stability of the global system.Strengthening domestic institutionsThe most important and reliable safeguard for economies which open themselves up to the globalmarket is a strong domestic institutional framework. Governments must strengthen domestic financialinstitutions and companies by adopting best practices of financial supervision and corporategovernance. Banks need a strong credit culture while other companies too need a rigorous businessculture.In the helter-skelter growth before the crisis, Asian governments had neglected these institutionalunderpinnings. While this was not the sole cause of the crisis, in many countries weak domesticinstitutions undoubtedly made things much worse. What Indonesians have termed KKN – corruption,collusion and nepotism – is now generally recognised to be a serious problem to be combated and notjust accepted as the way business is done.Strengthening domestic institutions will enable Asian countries to sustain long-term recovery andgrowth. Governments must restructure the financial and corporate sectors. Insolvent financialinstitutions need to be closed down or merged with stronger ones. In the corporate sector, unviablecompanies must go while weak, but viable companies must restructure their balance sheets andrationalise their operations. This calls for deft handling and sensitive political judgement as to how fastand far to go and how to trade off between social and political objectives on the one hand andeconomic efficiency on the other.A sound banking system is fundamental. This starts with the adoption of high standards of financialsupervision and regulation supported by a sound legal system. More importantly, regulators andgovernments should not neglect the establishment of a strong credit culture. This is the “software” ofgood banking governance. Banks must lend in a disciplined way, based on commercial viability ratherthan “relationships”. A relationships-based system undermines competition and disclosure. It results atbest in misallocation of resources and at worst in a collapse of the whole financial system.Banking governance must be complemented by strong corporate governance. Poor corporategovernance practices have allowed massive unreported losses and hidden liabilities to develop.
7BIS Review 93/1999Upgrading corporate governance means raising the quality and influence of boards of directors,protecting shareholder rights and raising and enforcing accounting and audit standards. All thesepreconditions are necessary before market discipline can work properly.It is encouraging that most of the crisis Asia countries have declared their intention to work towardsinternational best practices in corporate governance. But business environments cannot be changedovernight. It involves changing entrenched social relationships and norms that vary from country tocountry. This will take time. The best hope for individual countries to restore long-term growth in theglobal village lies in their succeeding in this transformation.ConclusionThere is no escaping the process of globalisation. In theory, countries can opt out, but in practice theprice is prohibitive.While the globalisation of trade flows undoubtedly benefits all countries, the globalisation of capitalflows carries much greater risks. Ideally, capital markets should be self-stabilising and should promoteeconomic efficiency by directing capital to its best uses on a global basis. But whether this alwayshappens in reality is an open question. The frequent crises, of which this is just the most recent, giveus reason for doubt.The Asian crisis has wrought grievous harm on many countries. But one positive consequence is that ithas provided a fresh impetus for reconsidering and strengthening the global financial system.Countries will not want to dismantle the existing structure and start from scratch, as happened inBretton Woods after World War II. More likely and prudently, they will pursue incrementalimprovements to strengthen the structure and remedy the flaws which have been uncovered. We mustfind ways to make bubbles and crashes less likely and make countries less vulnerable to such mishapswhen they occur.While we can strengthen the global financial system, we can never eliminate bubbles and crashescompletely. Manias, panics and crashes are inherent to capitalism dating back to the tulip mania andSouth Sea Bubble of the 17th century and probably before. In theory, investors make independentdecisions which collectively result in a stable and efficient market outcome. In reality, uncertainty dueto incomplete information and a basic human instinct to herd can prove destabilising and disastrous.For small open economies, the best defence against an uncertain and sometimes dangerousenvironment is to pursue prudent macroeconomic policies, strengthen their financial systems andimprove their governance framework. Sound domestic policies and institutions cannot eliminate panicand contagion. But they can cushion the adverse effects and make the economies more resilient to thefinancial shocks when they occur.Thank you.
1BIS Review 93/1999Mr Duisenberg focuses on the possible future impact ofthe unique monetary unification in the European Union and sharessome observations on the challenges facing the ECB and the EUSpeech given by Mr Willem Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, at the Villa d’EsteWorkshop in Cernobbio on 4 September 1999.*      *      *Ladies and Gentlemen,A great number of you are clearly familiar with the political and economic developments which led tothe introduction of our new currency, the euro. I should therefore like to look ahead and focus myremarks on the possible future impact of this unique monetary unification and share with you someobservations on the challenges facing the European Central Bank and the European Union as a whole.Since 1 January 1999, the euro has been the common currency for eleven Member States of theEuropean Union. This was rightly described as a historic event, since the completion of Economic andMonetary Union indeed marks an unprecedented degree of economic and political integration amongthe European countries participating in this endeavour. I am sure that the introduction of the singlecurrency will help to further realise the efficiency and welfare gains of the Single Market, althoughthis will probably be a gradual process, and will become apparent only over time. However, with theestablishment of Economic and Monetary Union, the integration process has certainly gained a newquality. The significance of the complete and voluntary transfer of a core competency of the modernstate, namely monetary policy, from the Member States to a truly European and independentinstitution such as the European Central Bank, can hardly be overestimated. While the years oftechnical preparation certainly required great efforts on the part of all involved, it is the longer-termimpact of EMU which holds the prospect of the most momentous change.The first few months of the existence of the euro have set the scene for a positive outlook. Eventhough external developments such as the depreciation of the euro against the dollar have attractedrather pessimistic headlines, there are, in fact, several reasons for some satisfaction. The changeover tothe single currency ran smoothly, largely thanks to the diligent preparation of all involved. TheEuropean Central Bank and the Eurosystem have assumed their new responsibilities, and the monetarypolicy instruments and decision-making procedures are functioning well. A unified euro area financialmarket is developing as operators re-orient their activities beyond the borders of their previousdomestic markets.However, it is altogether natural that not all facets of the complex EMU project are as yet complete.Setting up the technical and operational framework for EMU – even if it is proving to function to fullsatisfaction – is not sufficient. Economic and Monetary Union cannot simply be reduced to themechanics of a functioning single monetary policy – however important this may be. EMU also hasimplications for policy fields beyond those explicitly related to the management of the single currency.The interdependencies generated and reinforced by the introduction of the euro entail a sharedresponsibility for the common currency on the part of all euro area Member States. Inappropriatepolicy choices in one country can have an immediate impact on the common currency, for example,via the exchange rate.For the euro to be a lasting success – and to win the support of all citizens – national policymakers,businesses and trade unions will have to adapt to the conditions of a single currency. Even though thiswill be a gradual process, facing up to the challenges of the single currency will demand a steeplearning curve for all involved.Allow me to elaborate: the European Central Bank as the single monetary authority within the euroarea will have to build up and maintain a “stability culture” among the politicians and peoples ofEurope. This is no easy task, despite all our efforts to explain monetary policy decisions to the public.
BIS Review 93/19992Most importantly, the ECB must communicate the fundamental nature of, and justification for, itsTreaty mandate to maintain price stability, not least since certain misperceptions of the goals andeffects of monetary policy continue to exist.It will only be possible to fully gain the crucial support of the public for the new and so far untestedcurrency if the ECB manages to retain its value over time. It is my firm belief that fulfilling its primaryobjective to maintain price stability is not only the best service which the ECB can deliver to thecitizens of Europe, but also the most appropriate way of fostering the legitimacy of our newinstitution. In the first few months of the euro’s existence we have indeed provided an internally stablecurrency, although the public perception of this accomplishment has often been confused by too muchattention on developments relating to the euro’s external value. In this context, allow me to reiteratethat the ECB’s monetary policy objective is the internal value of the euro and that in the longer termthe euro’s internal strength will also be reflected in its external value.Our task of maintaining price stability will certainly be made easier as the ECB acquires a track recordand further builds up its credibility with the markets inside and outside the euro area. In my view, thisprocess will be greatly facilitated by a monetary policy strategy oriented towards guaranteeing pricestability in the medium term, rather than responding to short-term considerations. I should emphasisethat it is the ECB’s independent status which will continue to allow it to stand above day-to-daypressures, to pursue a stability-oriented policy to the benefit of all citizens without the interference ofshort-term political objectives and to ignore short-term market developments if they are deemed to beexcessive.The ECB is a novel and unique institution and in the performance of its tasks it is still navigatinguncharted waters. Take, for example, the differing impact of monetary policy on economic activity inthe different euro area Member States, which demands a well-balanced and comprehensiveconsideration of the precise timing and magnitude of interest rate decisions. The ECB must formulatea single monetary policy for an economic area made up of 11 distinct national economic policyjurisdictions. Our monetary policy decisions must thus always be oriented towards the conditions ofthis currency zone as a whole, since monetary policy by its nature is one and indivisible. Precisely thisis our Treaty mandate. The ECB must develop into a truly European institution and we are makinggood progress in that direction.However, developing a wider perception of the euro area as an entity appears more complicated.Certainly, there are some areas where awareness of a single “euro area economy” is well developed.The financial market operators, for instance, appear to have adapted very quickly to the reality of theeuro. The extensive recourse to the more favourable financing opportunities in the now more unifiedfinancial market or the ongoing consolidation in the banking sector bear witness to this shift ofperception from the national to the European level. In this context, allow me to add the followingobservation. The development of a highly integrated euro area financial market and the ultimateestablishment of a pan-European banking industry will raise the issue of the optimal organisation ofsupervision of the European financial sector. Today supervision is organised on a national level;financial markets are not yet fully integrated and we do not as yet have a genuinely pan-Europeanbanking industry. However, the situation is clearly dynamic.While it remains to be seen how quickly the situation will change, this example highlights the fact thatthe euro area is not yet an entity itself and not yet perceived as such in some respects. Looking back onthe first few months of the existence of the euro, we have witnessed that singular and isolated newsand data releases from individual economies within the euro area have sometimes inappropriately beeninterpreted as indicators for the entire currency zone. Such inadequate analysis can produce realdifficulties, especially when the markets magnify and exaggerate the effects of these misconceptions.This phenomenon may possibly be explained by insufficient information about the new Europeanframework. However, another reason might lie in the conduct and presentation of Member States’economic policies. It appears that Member States are still learning to communicate adequately that, ineconomic terms, they also consider themselves constituent parts of a larger entity and thus also regardtheir domestic economic policy decisions “as a matter of common concern”. It is, however,encouraging to see that these deficiencies are being addressed and that efforts are being made to render
3BIS Review 93/1999the impact of economic decision-making on the euro area as a whole visible and transparent for themarkets and the public at large. Moreover, the recognition that Europe’s performance depends to alarge extent on its ability to take on the task of implementing real structural reforms appears to begaining ground.There is no alternative to orienting the conduct and the presentation of economic policies to the newframework of EMU in order to explore its full potential. It remains to be seen whether theseadjustments will have institutional implications, either motivated by functional necessity or inresponse to the demands from our partners and interlocutors.I should add that institutional changes will in any case be on the agenda of the EU in the coming years,not least in order to endow Europe with a capacity for decisive external action. This is a consequencenot only of the momentous changes in the wider Europe, but also the projected expansion of the EU.The European Union has launched an enlargement process of unprecedented dimensions, with 12countries from central, eastern and southern Europe currently involved in, or preparing, entrynegotiations. The prospect of EU membership and the eventual participation in EMU has galvanisedthese countries into pursuing economic reforms, re-orienting their trade and embarking on a difficultand sometimes painful process of disinflation.In this context, there should be no denying that the European Union too will have to reform itsinstitutions and decision-making structures in order to cope with a larger number of Member States.By agreeing to convene an Intergovernmental Conference next year, the Member States have taken thefirst steps in this direction.So far the progress of negotiations is encouraging, and the applicant countries should be applauded fortheir great efforts towards meeting the economic and political entry criteria set by the CopenhagenEuropean Council in 1993. Beyond that, it appears that the very prospect of eventual participation inEMU has also helped to establish clear policy orientations. Naturally, the ECB takes a keen interest indevelopments in the future Member States and has established the relevant contacts.I should like to conclude that the ECB is well aware of the challenges ahead, and that we are still farfrom “business as usual” – despite the smooth and successful launch of the euro. With theestablishment of Economic and Monetary Union, the EU has recorded an outstanding historicalachievement, but the task of making EMU a success will be an ongoing one, and perhaps even moremomentous challenges in the wider Europe are awaiting our response.Thank you very much.
1BIS Review 92/1999Mr Heikensten discusses whether Sweden should join the euro areaSpeech given by Mr Lars Heikensten, Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank to Stockholm City’sfinancial staff on 3 September 1999.*      *      *Besides being one of the most momentous changes in the continent’s economic policy for manydecades, the introduction of the single European currency at the beginning of this year was a majorstep in the political process that has been bringing the countries of Europe closer together since the1950s. When EMU is debated in Sweden, the latter aspect tends to be neglected in favour of more orless short-run economic advantages and drawbacks.In 1997 the Government and the Riksdag (Sweden’s parliament) decided that Sweden would not beadopting the single currency from January 1999. A lack of popular support was given as the reason.Euro area participation at a later date was not ruled out, however, and it was underscored that Swedenmust therefore have its options as open as possible. For true freedom of action there are certaindefinite requirements. Policy must remain focused on stability so that we can fulfil the jointly agreedcriteria for entry. Sweden must follow developments in Europe and make practical preparations so thatparticipation is feasible when we want to join.Freedom of action also requires that we are knowledgeable about the monetary union and activelydebate its issues. Today I intend to make a contribution to that discussion.What I have to say starts from the report that Lars Calmfors and his colleagues presented in 1996 –one of the most extensive and penetrating studies of EMU membership’s pros and cons. When thereport was circulated for comments, the Riksbank had the opportunity of submitting an opinion andstated that Sweden ought to participate in the monetary union right from the start.I shall be reminding you why the Riksbank came to this conclusion and commenting on howsubsequent developments have influenced my own view of the matter. The foundation for my personalopinion includes my working experience as a close monitor of economic developments and debates,both in Sweden and internationally. This has involved participation in the European discussion overthe past three or four years as Sweden’s representative in the EU’s Economic and FinancialCommittee (formerly the Monetary Committee).Arguments for and againstCalmfors and his colleagues considered that Sweden ought to join the monetary union but that therewere good reasons for waiting. The arguments for and against were presented in the report under threeheadings: stabilisation policy, economic efficiency and political reasons. In view of thisclassification’s educational merits, I shall be using it here.The report’s arguments from stabilisation policyThe arguments from stabilisation policy focus on ways in which EMU membership could be expectedto affect the possibility of achieving a balanced economic development in Sweden, with goodeconomic growth, high employment, price stability and external balance. The report considered thatthe arguments in this respect were not clear-cut either way but that the advantages of staying outsidefor the time being predominated. With a national monetary policy at a time when the economy stillhad major imbalances and was highly vulnerable to shocks, Sweden would then be in a position toparry any negative repercussions that might hit the economy while leaving the euro area relativelyunaffected.
BIS Review 92/19992A radical change in conditions for the forest industries is the standard example of such a shock. Buteven a more general worsening of conditions for growth in the rest of the world might haveparticularly adverse effects for a small economy with a high level of foreign trade. Moreover, with anindependent monetary policy, interest rates can be increased to counter effects of a specific domesticpolicy failure, for instance an excessively weak budget policy or inflationary wage settlements. Atpresent some observers might perhaps regard this as the greatest risk.According to the report, the high unemployment that had occurred in Sweden since the early 1990smade constraints on Swedish monetary policy particularly risky. In the situation at that time, a shockcould have serious consequences for unemployment, with a further increase from a level that wasalready high. Experience in other countries, moreover, pointed to a major risk of an increase inunemployment becoming permanent. Swedish monetary policy could then provide support for thenecessary labour market reforms that were advocated in the report. Swedish participation should waituntil these reforms had been implemented and unemployment had fallen. For similar reasons, the weakpublic finances might also heighten the risks associated with Swedish membership.In the ensuing debate, the stabilisation policy argument against EMU participation came to be calledthe insurance argument. By retaining a national monetary policy, Sweden could insure itself againstthe potentially major negative effects of a macroeconomic shock.At the same time, the report pointed out that participation in the monetary union could confer benefitsfrom a more stable exchange rate. But the authors did not believe that such benefits would outweighthe advantages of retaining a national monetary policy.The Riksbank’s opinionThe Riksbank did not agree with the report in every respect. The Governing Board considered, forinstance, that it exaggerated the risks of an external shock hitting the Swedish economy alone. TheBoard noted that to a large extent the shocks in Sweden since the 1970s could be said to have beenself-inflicted. The divergent cyclical pattern probably had to do with the direction of economic policy,where strong fiscal stimuli and repeated devaluations had generated high inflation and problems withcosts.The Board also stated that the report exaggerated policy’s freedom of action in reality in an outsiderposition: it would not be possible for Sweden to implement a monetary policy that differed markedlyfrom that in the monetary union. This was evident from Sweden’s history of uncertainty aboutgovernment finances and high inflation were Sweden to choose the outsider alternative on the groundsof the insurance argument, this could be perceived as a signal that Sweden’s economic policy wouldagain become accommodating. This risk was also mentioned in the report.The Riksbank fully agreed, on the other hand, that unemployment is a serious problem in the Swedisheconomy. But we did not consider that this problem could be resolved by remaining outside themonetary union. As the report had indeed pointed out, other measures were needed to improve theworkings of the labour market and wage formation. The Riksbank underscored that the necessarystructural measures for the labour market would be easier to implement if we had established thecredibility of an economic policy for sustainable growth.Does the stronger economy warrant different conclusions?In the light of all that has happened in the past two or three years, the assessments presented in thereport and by the Riksbank should perhaps be modulated.The case for an insurance policy and freedom of action was argued at a time when public financeswere weak and unemployment was still at a record level. The measures of economic policy hadadmittedly begun to build up public confidence in a more stable future after the profound crisis in theearly 1990s but the outlook was still uncertain.Today the situation is better, with a central government budget surplus and high ambitions for fiscalpolicy. In both these respects Sweden does well in a comparison with euro countries. Also, for several
3BIS Review 92/1999years now inflation has been at least as low as in the euro area. It is no less important that a number ofurgent institutional changes have been made, with major consequences for the implementation ofstabilisation policy. The budget process has been tightened and a new legal framework has been set upfor a more independent Riksbank. Recently, moreover, unemployment has decreased appreciably,though the extent and duration of the reduction are still uncertain. This will ultimately depend onfuture wage settlements.So all in all, the economic situation in Sweden is more stable than I had at least dared to hope for acouple of years ago. This in turn is reflected in, for example, a level of interest rates that is onlymarginally different from that in the euro area.From this it might be concluded that Sweden can now stand on its own two feet – we can evidentlycope without EMU. However, one reason for being a little cautious about this conclusion is that, tosome extent, the lower interest rate probably has to do with many people’s expectations that by and bySweden will in fact join the monetary union. Personally, moreover, I have never considered thatSweden ought to adopt the single currency primarily in order to tackle problems of stabilisation policyor reap the benefits of a lower interest rate.The question of whether or not to join the monetary union mainly has to do with long-term aspects ofeconomic development and how we in Sweden view our future political role in Europe. In thisperspective, today’s stronger Swedish economy is an argument in favour of adopting the euro nowrather than for remaining outside. Some of the Calmfors report’s arguments against participation havebeen weakened. A decision to join – based on long-term, strategic considerations – is now associatedwith smaller short-term risks than it would have been some years ago.The report and the Riksbank on economic efficiencyThe next step of the analysis in the Calmfors report concerned the consequences of membership forresource utilisation, that is, how the long-term output trend might be affected by the impact ofmembership on, for example, investment, foreign trade and transaction costs.The report focused on the effects that are easiest to measure and assess. The decreased costs forcurrency exchange and covering foreign-exchange transactions were seen as definitely positive. Thereport was uncertain both about the magnitude of this effect and about the effects on foreign trade andinvestment but came to the overall conclusion that they were not particularly large.The Riksbank considered that the report underestimated participation’s effect on efficiency. Onereason for this was the report’s assumption that firms could reduce the costs associated with exchangerate movements by covering them in financial markets. The Riksbank believed this expenditure wouldbe higher than estimated in the report and that small and medium-sized firms in particular would findit difficult.The Riksbank also drew attention to the risks of Sweden being discriminated against in variousrespects. One example was the disadvantageous terms for outsider countries in TARGET, theEuropean payment system. Moreover, an outsider position for the time being would involve additionalcosts in various parts of the economy. Financial institutions, for instance, would have to operate twinsystems in order to remain competitive.Negative long-term effects of remaining outsideSuch is the nature of the long-term effects that assessments of them are unlikely to changefundamentally in the course of a year or two. Still, there is new and additional information that maycast a somewhat different light on certain aspects.One major issue concerns the link between EMU and the single market. There is empirical evidencethat the single market is exerting downward price pressure in the European Union. Some assessmentssuggest, moreover, that EMU may lead to a further price fall; figures as high as 10 to 15% have beenmentioned. If the effects were to be of that magnitude, the welfare gains would be substantial.
BIS Review 92/19994In practice, however, it is not easy to distinguish the parts that EMU and the single market are playingin price formation. Empirical data therefore have to be treated with caution. At the same time, EMUand the single market are linked at another level; as an American colleague recently remarked, “IfEMU would help to secure the single market’s survival, it’s worth all the other risks.”Another important long-term consideration is the structure of Europe’s business sector. I believe weare now experiencing a formative phase. European manufacturing and services companies are beingrapidly restructured, with effects that are likely to be considerable. Many forces are contributing to thisprocess; the globalisation of production is one and another is the single market. But there can behardly any doubt that EMU is also playing a part, particularly for the financial sector. Participation inthe euro area would give Sweden and Swedish companies access to a larger capital market that isexpanding rapidly. Assessing what being outside the monetary union entails in this phase is not easy.Personally I believe the effects are negative. I also think they may turn out to be considerable.A related matter is the location of companies. Representatives of large Swedish groups, as well as theFederation of Swedish Industries, for example, frequently state that euro participation would result inhigher investment in Sweden by both Swedish and foreign companies. This argument has also beenheard recently in connection with some of the relocations of large companies. Decreased exchangerisks would be one of the reasons. Another, it is sometimes suggested, would be that the economicframework for firms would be perceived as more secure and stable if Sweden adopted the singlecurrency. Once again, the strength of these arguments is difficult to assess, partly because they haveevident political purposes. But opinions of this type may clearly have effects if they are current amongcentral decision-makers in the business sector.Political arguments favour participationThis brings me, finally, to the political arguments for and against adopting the single currency. TheCalmfors report discussed the implications of participation for Swedish policy and its legitimacy, aswell as the consequences for Sweden’s voice in Europe and the world. On the first point I shall simplysay that I agree about the importance of any decision to participate having a high degree of legitimacy.This in turn calls for an animated discussion of the EMU issue.Having said that, I shall now concentrate on the other aspect. The report considered that if Swedenparticipated in the monetary union, we would be in a better position to influence EU decisions. Themore countries that participated, the greater would be the strength of this argument.The Riksbank agreed but found the argument unduly cautious as regards the political advantages. Wesaw major political benefits from participation and considered that an outsider position would clearlyweaken Sweden’s voice in the European debate and decision-making process.As I see it, since the report was presented and the Riksbank submitted its opinion, the politicalargument has gained appreciable weight. The initial participants number 11, instead of the 6 to9 countries that seemed most probable to Calmfors. That by itself means a great deal. It is a matter ofsimple logic: if you belong to a club in which 6 out of the 15 members make a move, there is no causeto feel an outsider; matters are different when 11 members decide on a course of action and support itwhole-heartedly, leaving only 4 on the sidelines.It is perfectly clear that EMU is a major project – perhaps the most important at present – in theprocess of European integration. A great deal is being invested in it and the EMU process also affectspolicies in other areas. But let us not exaggerate: experience differs from area to area and Sweden’svoice is naturally not shorn of all its weight just because we are outside the euro area.As regards economic policy – the only area of which I have direct experience – the pattern is clear. Itsurprised me how quickly the euro countries saw themselves as a single unit and the ways in whichthis altered the agenda for our committee meetings. In that the finance ministers of the euro countrieshave formed a separate group, Euro 11, to some extent Sweden is excluded from the interestingdiscussions.
5BIS Review 92/1999The Community agenda is being constructed in the light of needs among the eleven members of theeuro area. The matters of economic policy that are up for EU discussions are also more specific thanbefore. How is economic policy to be formulated? How can the labour market be made to functionbetter?At the European Central Bank we have missed the train on which the participating central banksdesigned their monetary policy strategy and decided how the functions of the system of central banksare to be performed. If we join the monetary union in the future, influencing the procedures of theECB and the formation of monetary policy will be more difficult.In the economic domain the European Union is also increasingly tending to establish joint Europeanpositions, for example on such matters as the crises in Russia and Brazil, the role of the IMF, etc.Here, too, I consider we are in a formative phase. Guidelines are now being drawn up for how Europeis to be represented on international bodies and in the work of developing a new international financialstructure. The questions include the future status of the G7, G10, G33 and other informal groups. Inthese contexts we are now becoming rather isolated.ConclusionNow for a brief summary and some conclusions.EMU is a part of the effort that has been in progress for more than five decades to bring the countriesof Europe closer together. Today the monetary union is perhaps the most important EU project and asa member of the Community we cannot disregard it. If Sweden chooses to remain outside, it willultimately be difficult to get the participating countries to understand our actions.The fact that the monetary union is a major component of a larger process of integration means that wecannot expect to get simple answers to our questions by adopting an attitude of wait-and-see.Assessing the project over a complete business cycle certainly has its advantages but the prevailinguncertainty is costly. Investments are postponed or shelved. Twin systems have to be maintained. I amconvinced, moreover, that new questions will arise all the time. We shall never be able to tell just howEMU will develop. This is something that those who participate decide as they go along.In the event of turbulence in the world around us, participants in the euro area have extra protection.This was evident last autumn, when the financial market turbulence hit the Swedish krona moreheavily than the Finnish markka. On the other hand, as euro participants we would be in the same boatas at least eleven other countries. That naturally implies greater dependence – we would be clearlyinvolved in problems that arise in the euro area. The only way to counter that would be by activelyinfluencing developments in the euro area in the right direction.An insurance argument can be put for remaining outside the euro area. If we continue to manage theeconomy properly, there should be freedom of action in our economic policy. But this is not a simplematter. On the contrary, we must convince the rest of the world that we have not refrained fromadopting the euro so as to be able to devalue the krona if the going gets tough.The long-term positive effects of joining the monetary union should not be played down just becausethey are difficult to measure. The participating countries and markets are drawing closer to each other.This probably affects competition, investment flows and prices to a greater extent than traditionalmodels are able to show. I believe that the costs of staying outside are particularly great at present andin the coming years, for instance as EMU generates far-reaching structural changes in the businesssector.To this should be added the political arguments. Sweden has already lost influence in the area I ambest able to assess, economic policy. This is particularly serious today as the global financial map isbeing redrawn and we need to assert our position as a small country in Europe. Others are betterplaced to pronounce on other areas but it seems logical that our positions there are also beingweakened because we are not seen as a fully-fledged participant in EU cooperation.
BIS Review 92/19996Finally it is a matter of weighing all these arguments against each other. The assessments involved,economic as well as political, are naturally difficult. But in the interval since the Riksbank submittedan opinion on the Calmfors report, I have not changed my opinion: Sweden ought to join the euro areaas soon as possible.
1BIS Review 91/1999Mr Mboweni’s address on the occasion of theseventy-ninth ordinary general meeting of shareholdersof the South African Reserve BankAddress of Mr T T Mboweni, Governor, at the South African Reserve Bank’s seventy-ninth ordinarygeneral meeting of shareholders on 24 August 1999.*      *      *IntroductionThe South African economy has recovered remarkably from the contagion effect of the financialturbulence in Asia and Russia. After being seriously affected by the volatility in global financialmarkets during the four months from May to August, tentative signs of a return to financial stabilityalready began to appear during the last few months of 1998. The recovery of the financial sector was,however, attained at the cost of lower economic growth because of the restrictive measures that theauthorities were forced to apply, the impact of a slowdown in international economic activity in manyparts of the world and a slump in international commodity prices. Currently the economy seems to bepoised for higher growth in production, provided that it is not again affected by setbacks in othercountries.At the beginning of the financial turmoil the thinking was that it would only have a limited impact ondomestic economic conditions through a lower demand for South African exports from the Asianregion. Later it became apparent that the crisis would not only be restricted to certain countries inAsia, but would affect many countries around the world. The international financial system was dealt afurther blow when Russia de facto devalued the rouble, imposed a moratorium on foreign creditrepayments and unilaterally restructured public debt in August 1998.As a result of these circumstances, international investors lost confidence in emerging markets andwithdrew investments from developing countries to higher quality, but lower yielding, financial assetsof industrialised countries. Interest rates rose to high levels, equity and bond prices fell sharply and thecurrencies of many economies depreciated considerably. Many banks and other financial institutionssuffered losses, especially on highly leveraged investment positions, which induced systemic risks inthe financial sectors of some emerging-market economies. The financial turmoil spilled over to realeconomic activity, with serious consequences for growth in world production and trade.All these developments once again demonstrated that in a globalised financial system the mobility ofcapital has serious consequences for financial stability. In a closely integrated financial world it hasbecome even more important for monetary policy to be focused primarily on financial stability. Thelack of a credible commitment to that objective by the monetary authorities could intensify the risk ofmarket overreaction and systemic instability. Such a policy approach does not, of course, provideunconditional protection against speculative capital outflows. Decisions by international investors towithdraw capital from a country, based on developments in other emerging-market economies, arebeyond the control of any central bank. The best approach that the South African Reserve Bank canfollow is to pursue financial stability in a transparent way so that it can forestall uncertainties.Monetary policy will be more successful in avoiding imbalances and disruptive capital flows ifmeasures are in place to address structural weaknesses in the economy. Crisis prevention requiresclose coordination between the various spheres of macroeconomic management to ensure marketconfidence. In addition, domestic financial systems should be closely monitored and made moretransparent and thus more robust.
BIS Review 91/19992While it is essential for South Africa to maintain these disciplines, the recent crisis has illustrated theneed to adapt the international financial system to the realities of global markets to reduce thefrequency and size of crisis situations. International organisations have made considerable progresswith the improvement of the financial architecture. Standards or codes of good practice have been orare being developed in many financial disciplines to allow market participants to compare thepractices of countries with internationally agreed benchmarks. The Reserve Bank regards this work asessential for the creation of more stable conditions and is accordingly willing, wherever possible, toparticipate in these endeavours.If a financial crisis does occur despite the efforts of the monetary authorities to prevent it, monetarypolicy has to accommodate the market. Intervention in financial markets can assist in smoothing theadjustment process, but should not oppose market trends. The authorities have to allow interest ratesand the exchange rate of the currency to move to new levels. Such adjustments increase the cost ofspeculation, reduce inflationary pressures and contribute to an improvement in the balance ofpayments position of a country.Unfortunately, the adjustments required in a crisis also adversely affect real economic activity.However, experience in many of the emerging-market economies during the recent financial crisis hasshown that where monetary policy had not been tightened quickly and sufficiently, instability persistedwith an even greater negative impact on those economies. Pursuing a tighter monetary policy led to aquicker return to currency stability and market confidence. This, in turn, provided room for a loweringof interest rates which helped to mitigate the negative results of the earlier tighter measures.The efforts of individual governments and the international financial community to re-establishfinancial stability are proving successful. The implementation of flexible exchange rate regimes andother structural adjustments in emerging-market economies seemed to have stabilised financialmarkets during the first seven months of 1999, and are also improving the prospect of a gradualeconomic recovery. Interest rate cuts by central banks in virtually all major industrialised countries arehelping to improve liquidity and to rebuild investor confidence. Although there are still risks anduncertainties in the world economy, conditions are far better now than they were during 1998.The contagion effects of the international financial crisis on South AfricaThe effects of the international financial crisis spilled over into the South African economy in May1998 when foreign fund managers began withdrawing portfolio investments. The well-developedcapital markets and the relatively free convertibility of capital in the country provided an easy sourceof liquidity for fund managers who wished to reduce their exposures to emerging markets. From Mayto December 1998 non-residents reduced their holdings of South African bonds by R26 billion. In thefirst four months of the year they were net buyers on the South African Bond Exchange to the amountof R16 billion.This reversal of portfolio investments in bonds by non-residents was difficult for the South Africaneconomy to absorb because it occurred at a time when South Africans were also making direct andportfolio investments in other countries following a relaxation of exchange controls. Moreover, thereversal created leads and lags in other foreign payments and receipts related to an expecteddepreciation of the rand. However, non-residents continued to invest large sums in the equity capitalof South African enterprises, with the result that the net outflow of capital not related to reservesamounted only to R0.4 billion in the second half of 1998, compared with an inflow of R8.3 billion inthe first half of the year.The international developments also affected the current account of South Africa’s balance ofpayments because they brought about a substantial drop in international commodity prices anddepressed world trade. The volume of merchandise exports declined in the second half of 1998, whilehigher rand proceeds for exports mainly reflected a depreciation of the currency. In addition, the goldprice in terms of United States dollars declined further and the value of imports rose steeply becauseof infrastructural investments by public corporations. These developments led to an increase in thedeficit on the current account of the balance of payments and a marked decrease in the gold and
3BIS Review 91/1999foreign exchange reserves of the country. As could be expected under these circumstances, theexchange rate of the rand depreciated to a level at the end of 1998 that was nearly 20% lower than itsweighted value at the end of 1997.The volatility in international financial markets generated substantial increases in the turnovers offinancial markets in South Africa, including the markets in foreign exchange, shares, bonds andderivatives. The large outflow of foreign funds on the Bond Exchange contributed to an increase in thedaily average yield on long-term government bonds from a low of 12.67% on 17 April 1998 – itslowest level since May 1994 – to 20.09% on 28 August 1998. So much liquidity was drained from theSouth African banking sector that the banks had to borrow large amounts from the Reserve Bank on adaily basis. The liquidity shortage in the market pushed up short-term interest rates by about7 percentage points, forcing the banks to raise their prime overdraft and mortgage lending rates tomore or less the same extent. These higher lending rates had a dampening effect on real-estatetransactions. Share prices also dropped sharply, even though the market was supported by a strongdemand from foreign investors.The high turnovers in the financial markets and a desire for precautionary money balances resulted inan exceptionally strong growth in the money supply. The growth over twelve months in the broadlydefined money supply (M3) reached 19.4% in June 1998 and declined only fractionally to 18.9% inAugust 1998. These high rates of increase were recorded despite a slowdown in the growth of nominalgross domestic product and apparently formed part of the rise in the nominal value of financial assetportfolios. This latter factor, together with an increased demand for working capital by the corporatesector and some borrowing by companies to tide them over a period of slack demand in the economy,were prominent forces behind a continued steep rise in total bank credit extension. The increase in thedemand for bank credit was reinforced by speculative opportunities in a period of heightened volatilityin the securities markets.The international financial turmoil halted the downward movement in the rate of increase in bothproduction and consumer prices from the beginning of 1997. Over the six months to September 1998,growth in production prices accelerated considerably as the rand depreciated. The consumer priceindex, in turn, was strongly influenced by a sharp rise in the prices of consumer services, notably therise in mortgage lending rates. Core inflation, which excludes certain food prices, interest costs, value-added tax and municipal rates, was far more subdued, rising from 6.9% in March 1998 to only 7.7% inSeptember 1998.In comparison to other emerging-market economies, the South African banking sector provedremarkably resilient during the global financial turmoil. Banks were able to weather this storm betterthan some of their counterparts in other countries because of good management, strict legislativerequirements, low international credit exposures and diligent risk management. The level of the netexternal liabilities of banks is low, in other words their exposures to exchange rate risks are minimal.In addition, our banks eased the increased burden of high interest rates on borrowers by extending therepayment period.The non-performing loans of banks nevertheless increased by more than R8.2 billion over one year toR27.4 billion at the end of June 1999, but the gross overdues of banks as a percentage of total loansand advances amounted to only 4.7% on this date; a level which is still low enough not to be ofconcern. Many of the banks have in any case also increased their provisions for bad and doubtfuldebts, which amounted to 2.7% of loans and advances at the end of June 1999.The banks in South Africa are well capitalised. The average risk-weighted capital-adequacy ratio forthe system as a whole reached 11.6% at the end of June 1999, compared with the required minimumratio of 8% stipulated by the Basel core principles. Moreover, more than half of the banks had acapital-adequacy ratio of 15% or better. The disruptions internationally did not materially affect theprofitability of banks, and their return on equity reached approximately 15% at the end of June 1999.Cost control and an expansion of the business of banks into new areas helped to sustain profit levels.Banks have successfully developed alternative non-interest-bearing sources of income, andtransaction-based fee income and investment income now represent nearly half of their net revenues.
BIS Review 91/19994The return to financial stabilityThe way in which the banking sector coped with the international financial crisis, together with aprudent monetary policy approach, were important factors that contributed to a relatively quick returnto financial stability in South Africa. By the fourth quarter of 1998 there were signs that the storm wasabating. The strain on the South African situation slackened so much in the last part of 1998 that theexchange rate of the rand against the United States dollar eased from about R6.66 on 28 August 1998to R5.70 early in January 1999. Domestic interest rates declined by about 3 percentage points over thesame period.Although problems in Brazil temporarily created new pressures in the South African market forforeign exchange in January 1999 and interrupted the decline in interest rates, the nervousness in thefinancial markets gradually evaporated when it became apparent that the contagion effects of Brazil’sproblems would be limited. Non-residents again became net buyers of South African bonds, whilethey continued to invest large amounts in shares listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. In thefirst seven months of 1999 the portfolio investments of non-residents in South Africa amounted to noless than R33.8 billion, compared with disinvestments of R3.2 billion in the last eight months of 1998.Direct investment by foreigners in domestic enterprises came to R3.7 billion in the first half of 1999.These investments were neutralised to some extent by South African investments in other countries,with the result that the net inflow of capital not related to reserves, or the surplus on financialtransactions with the rest of the world, totalled R7.4 billion. At the same time, a lower level of finaldemand, significant further reductions in inventories and an increase in the cost of imported goods,depressed the value of imports. By contrast, exports rose strongly as the Asian economies began torecover, the decline in international commodity prices levelled out and domestic producers beganexpanding into other markets. Expressed in terms of seasonally adjusted and annualised rates, thecurrent account of the balance of payments accordingly turned around from a deficit of R19.1 billionin the last half of 1998 to a surplus of R0.6 billion in the first half of 1999.The improvement in South Africa’s overall transactions with the rest of the world led to a sizableincrease in the international reserves of the country. The total gross gold and other foreign reservesimproved steadily from a lower turning point of R40.9 billion at the end of November 1998 to R47.2billion at the end of June 1999. The nominal effective exchange rate of the rand nevertheless decreasedsomewhat in the first seven months of 1999. At the end of July 1999 the weighted average level of theexchange rate of the rand was no less than 38.4% below its level at the end of 1995, clearly indicatinga marked strengthening of the international price competitiveness of domestic producers.The greater stability in the exchange rate of the rand and the containment of domestic cost increasesrelieved inflationary pressures. As a consequence, a slowdown in inflation in consumer prices wasobserved from the end of 1998. However, higher oil prices contributed to a rise in production pricesfrom the very low levels reached in the first half of 1998, while core inflation increased from 7.1% inApril 1998 to 8.2% in July 1999.The surplus balance on South Africa’s transactions with the rest of the world eased the total liquidityrequirement of banking institutions and prompted a steady decline in money market rates in the firstseven months of 1999. Sentiment in the market for fixed-interest securities became more positive inview of the slowdown in the inflation of consumer prices, an easing in money market conditions anddeclining short-term interest rates, a conservative fiscal policy which reduced government’s fundingrequirement for the fiscal year ending 31 March 2000 and positive credit assessments by internationalrating agencies. Consequently, the yield on long-term government bonds declined from 20.09% on28 August 1998 to 15.18% at the end of July 1999.As normality returned to financial markets and the turnovers on these markets came down from theexceptionally high levels that they had reached during the international financial turbulence, growth inthe monetary aggregates finally started to decline after four years of high rates. The general downturnin economic activity, lower inflation and a decline in liquidity preference, were other factors thatcaused the growth in M3 to move within the guideline growth range of between 6% and 10% fromFebruary 1999. The growth in total domestic credit extension by banks also slowed down significantlyin the first half of 1999. Despite these favourable developments, it is important that monetary policy
5BIS Review 91/1999takes into account that the ratio of the money supply to gross domestic product was still very high at53.5% in the second quarter of 1999.All in all, the financial markets have rallied remarkably during 1999. Internationally, the turbulenceprevailing during 1997 and 1998 seems to have calmed down. Provided that there are no serioussetbacks in the international economy, we are confident that real economic activity in South Africashould begin to recover.Adverse financial conditions depressed economic growth and employmentAt the beginning of 1998 it was expected that the downswing in economic activity experienced duringthe preceding year would come to an end and that the economy would turn around before moving intoa recession. However, the measures that the authorities were forced to take to stabilise financialconditions led to sharp declines in the components of domestic demand that are sensitive to interest-rate costs, such as inventories, consumption expenditure on durable goods and private-sector fixedinvestment. Domestic production was also harmed by a lower demand for exports, with the result thatreal gross domestic product contracted sharply in the third quarter of 1998. Fortunately, this setbackwas short-lived and aggregate output began to increase again, albeit at low rates.The downturn during the middle of 1998 spread to most of the economic sectors, with the notableexception of financial services which benefited from price volatility and high turnovers in financialmarkets. From the fourth quarter of 1998 the secondary sectors and some of the other tertiary sectorsstarted to record small positive growth, but the value added by agriculture and mining continued tocontract. Gold production, in particular, decreased sharply in reaction to the effect that increased goldsales by some central banks had on the price of gold.The gold mines have had to contend with rising costs of production and a generally depressed marketprice since the mid-1980s. This has not only had serious consequences for the domestic economy, butalso affected developments in neighbouring countries through the loss of employment opportunities.From the beginning of the 1980s the number of people employed on the gold mines has been reducedby almost 250,000 because of mine closures and the introduction of cost-saving production methods.The substitution of capital for labour in other sectors of the economy further contributed to highunemployment in South Africa and other negative social effects. The low production growth in thepast year aggravated this problem as employment was slashed further.The decline in employment was accompanied by a marked increase in labour productivity. At first thegrowth in output per worker could not contain an acceleration in the rate of increase in nominal unitlabour costs. From the beginning of 1999 the growth in unit labour costs has slowed downsignificantly, which could help to curtail inflation because labour is still the single most importantcomponent of overall production cost in the economy.Unlike the decline in production, the domestic demand for goods and services continued to expand in1998, but the rate of increase in aggregate expenditure slowed down. The main reason for theexpansion in final demand was the solid growth in fixed capital formation, largely owing toinvestment expenditure in telecommunication and transport activities by public corporations. Contraryto these developments, the rates of increase in the consumption expenditure of both the public sectorand households slowed down considerably during 1998, while private-sector real fixed investmentdeclined sharply. Inventory levels were reduced significantly in response to the slowdown in domesticeconomic activity and the high costs of carrying stock.In the first half of 1999 the real domestic final demand for goods and services declined markedly whenthe capital spending of public corporations contracted. In addition, a decline in interest-rate sensitivehousehold expenditure on durable goods and the strict discipline applied to government expenditureresulted in a decrease in consumption expenditure, while private-sector fixed investment continued tomove to lower levels. Real gross domestic expenditure contracted even more sharply than finaldemand, due to a reduction in inventory levels as businesses economised further on inventoryholdings.
BIS Review 91/19996The reduction in consumption expenditure and efforts of households to bring down high debt levelsled to a marginal improvement in the savings ratio of households in the first half of 1999. Moreover,the resolve by government to adhere to sound fiscal policies was reflected in a decline in the netdissaving by general government as a ratio of gross domestic product from 5% in 1997 to 3% in thefirst half of 1999. The corporate sector succeeded in lifting retained earnings by more than the growthin production over the same period. As a consequence, the ratio of gross saving to gross domesticproduct rose somewhat from a low of 13% in the fourth quarter of 1998 to 15% in the first half of1999. Although this is a welcome change in the declining trend of the savings ratio, it is still wellbelow the levels needed for sustained higher economic growth. Serious attention will have to be givenin economic policy deliberations to promoting saving and inward direct investments in order to createjob opportunities.Prudent public financeThe government persisted with a well-managed conservative fiscal policy stance. The public-sectorborrowing requirement, i.e. the deficit before borrowing of the central government, provincialgovernments, local authorities, non-financial public enterprises and public corporations, has beenbrought down systematically from an upper turning point of 9.3% of gross domestic product in thefiscal year 1993/94 to a ratio of 3.4% in the fiscal year 1998/99.In the past fiscal year there was a decline in the absolute value of the public-sector borrowingrequirement. What made this an even more remarkable achievement was the fact that the revenue ofthe government increased at a lower rate than in the preceding year. Total expenditure by generalgovernment, however, rose at a rate of only 5.3% in the fiscal year 1998/99, i.e. significantly belowthe inflation rate. General government successfully contained growth in expenditure mainly through adecisive slowdown in current spending on goods and services.The financial turbulence and monetary policyThe conservative fiscal policy stance assisted in countering the contagion effect of the internationalfinancial turbulence during 1998. However, the brunt of the adjustment process fell on monetarypolicy, as it takes a long time to make changes in fiscal and other policy measures. The strains thatdeveloped in the foreign exchange market in 1998 caused the exchange rate of the rand and domesticinterest rates to adjust automatically to the changed supply of and demand for foreign exchange andthe impact of these developments on bank liquidity. In these volatile and uncertain circumstances, themonetary authorities could only influence the speed of the adjustments required by the market.The Reserve Bank’s response was to underprovide in the liquidity requirement of the banks and tointervene in the foreign exchange market so that financial stability could be restored at the least cost interms of inflation and economic growth. As a result, the repo rate moved sharply upwards by about7 percentage points from the beginning of May to 21.85% on 28 August 1998. The accommodationsystem was made more effective to cope with the crisis by phasing in a wider spread from 1 to 20percentage points between the repo rate and the marginal lending rate. These measures led tocorresponding steep increases in other short-term interest rates, which eased the adjustment in theexchange rate of the rand.In tandem with the rise in interest rates, the Reserve Bank at first intervened heavily in the foreignexchange market in May and June 1998 in an attempt to create some order in a market that hadbecome extremely sensitive to any negative news or rumours. The intervention consisted mainly ofswaps in the forward market, which increased the Bank’s net open foreign currency position fromUS$ 12.8 billion at the end of March 1998 to US$ 23.2 billion at the end of September 1998. TheBank returned this foreign exchange liquidity to the market which had been obtained previously fromlarge inflows of portfolio investments.In view of the large risks and potential costs associated with a net open exposure, the Reserve Bankstopped using this intervention technique when it became apparent that the contagion impact of the
7BIS Review 91/1999emerging-markets’ crisis would be more severe and longer lasting than originally expected and whenthe purchases of foreign exchange preceding the crisis had been fully reversed. This decision wasvalidated when it became known that highly leveraged funds had built up speculative positions againstthe rand through forward foreign exchange transactions. Later, when these leveraged funds incurredlosses in emerging markets and were forced to buy back their short rand positions, these transactionscontributed to the retracing of some of the rand’s earlier losses.As indicated, financial conditions became more stable from the fourth quarter of 1998. Generalnervousness continued to prevail among international investors, and they withdrew funds fromemerging-market economies whenever there were signs of any pressure on exchange rates. In thesecircumstances, the Reserve Bank deemed it prudent to guide the repo and other money market interestrates gradually down to lower levels. With brief interruptions, the repo rate then moved lower from itsupper turning point of 21.85% on 28 August 1998 to 13.65% on 31 July 1999. Over the same period,the net open foreign currency position of the Reserve Bank was reduced by US$ 5.6 billion toUS$ 17.5 billion at the end of July 1999.Despite the initial wide fluctuations in the repo rate, the repo-based accommodation system that theReserve Bank had introduced in March 1998 is proving of considerable value in general and duringperiods of instability in financial markets in particular. Most of the difficulties encountered shortlyafter the implementation of the system were due to general nervousness in the market and teethingproblems. The system was flexible enough to be adjusted easily to solve these problems. Changes toenhance the efficiency of the repo system included the shortening of maturities, the introduction of“square-off auctions” at the end of the daily settlement period, administrative adjustments to themanagement of cash reserves and a refinement of the signalling procedures of the Reserve Bank. Afterthese changes had been made, short-term interest rates became more flexible without being too volatileor too slow in reacting to signals.The way forwardThe liberalisation and international integration of financial services make it imperative for SouthAfrica to bring domestic inflation in step with that of the rest of the world and to maintain sound andefficient financial institutions and markets. If these goals are not achieved, the economy could besubjected to sudden reversals in international capital flows, exchange rate instability and volatileinterest rates. The thrust of monetary policy in these circumstances should therefore be to establish andmaintain financial stability, i.e. stability of prices, financial institutions and financial markets.This does not mean that monetary policy ignores other objectives of economic policy, such aseconomic growth, employment creation and improved social conditions in the country. On thecontrary, we regard financial stability as a precondition for balanced and sustainable economic growthand improved living conditions, because it improves the efficiency of the pricing system and economicdecision-making; enhances the efficiency of financial intermediation; minimises the inflation riskpremium in long-term interest rates; reduces the incentive to hedge against inflation; promotes a moreequitable distribution of wealth and income; and facilitates investment decision-making. A monetarypolicy that maintains financial stability in a credible and lasting way will accordingly make the bestoverall contribution to improving economic growth, employment and living standards.A market-oriented strategy will be followed to achieve this overriding goal of monetary policybecause financial institutions and markets function best in the national interest if they are competitive,active and liquid, and if interest rates and exchange rates are flexible. The Reserve Bank willaccordingly continue to discuss with government the relaxation of exchange controls when underlyingconditions are conducive to taking such steps. The eventual removal of exchange control restrictionsshould contribute towards dismantling the oversold forward book and reducing the net open foreigncurrency position. Once residents have accumulated large amounts of foreign assets, they could usethese assets to counterbalance short-term currency volatility if they perceive this to be an opportunityto profit from a temporary undervaluation of the exchange rate.
BIS Review 91/19998In pursuit of the primary objective of price stability it is essential, as stated in the Constitution, that theReserve Bank performs its functions independently and without fear, favour or prejudice. The Bankwill maintain an attitude of economic-professional objectivity, but will, of course, at the same time beaccountable to Parliament and the general public for its actions. Transparency in the interpretation ofeconomic data and the monetary policy stance will be promoted further. Regular reporting oneconomic conditions and Reserve Bank operations to Parliament and the general public will receivehigh priority.Although the Bank will strive to achieve closer cooperation and coordination with the authoritiesresponsible for policy decisions in other macroeconomic and microeconomic fields, the autonomy ofthe Bank will be preserved. There are structural deficiencies in the economy which impair saving,investment, production growth and employment creation and increase the level of real interest rates. Anumber of initiatives announced by the President at the opening of Parliament are aimed at easingthese supply-side constraints. The implementation of these structural changes could create furtherscope for lower nominal and real interest rates. Closer cooperation and coordination between theReserve Bank and other national official bodies may expedite this process.The Southern African Development Community (SADC) provides an opportunity for member states toface jointly the challenges of global financial integration. Considerable progress has been made overalmost four years in promoting interaction in Southern Africa through the Committee of Central BankGovernors of the SADC. This committee has enhanced cooperation among central banks; forged closeties between bank regulators and supervisors in member countries, promoted the expansion of trainingfacilities for employees of central banks, enhanced the payment, clearing and settlement systems ofmember countries, established closer consultation between private banking institutions and stockexchanges operating in the region, analysed exchange control restrictions in Southern Africancountries with the aim of gradually removing or harmonising these restrictions and collected anddisseminated macroeconomic statistics.The South African Reserve Bank will continue to promote the effective cooperation and integration ofthe financial systems and markets of Southern Africa. Where needed, banking institutions andfinancial markets should be established in conjunction with effective payment, clearing and settlementarrangements within and between countries in the region. For the time being this will be doneinformally before attempting to achieve officially sanctioned harmonisation and integration offinancial arrangements.In applying monetary policy in South Africa it is advisable to move away from the “eclectic” orinformal inflation-targeting framework to formal inflation targeting. The eclectic monetary policyapproach has been a useful framework for containing inflation, but at times it created uncertaintiesabout Reserve Bank decisions and actions which were perceived as being in conflict with intermediateobjectives. The guidelines on the growth in money supply and bank credit extension have constantlybeen breached in recent years as a result of financial deepening. To the extent that a formal or explicitinflation-targeting framework would be more transparent than the previous framework, it ought toallay some of these uncertainties.With the adoption of inflation targeting, it will become clear that the containment of inflation is notsolely a Reserve Bank responsibility. Inflation targets should be set jointly by the Reserve Bank andgovernment. Inflation targeting will be more effective when economic policies are well coordinated.Before inflation targeting is introduced, this coordination should be clearly spelled out and allstakeholders must be consulted, including business and the trade union movement. We are convincedthat the government will ensure that the policy measures are properly coordinated.Our considered view is that a policy target agreement should be drawn up that would be signed by theMinister of Finance and the Governor of the Reserve Bank to define precisely the coordinated effortneeded to contain inflation in pursuit of the broader economic objectives of sustainable high economicgrowth and employment creation. In this agreement the instrumental independence of the ReserveBank must be guaranteed. This stipulation and the rest of the agreement will, of course, have to beratified by Parliament.
9BIS Review 91/1999Inflation targeting is a complicated monetary policy framework that requires careful preparationsbefore an announcement is made to apply it in practice. To facilitate the implementation of inflationtargeting, the Bank is currently revising and reorganising the functions of the Economics Department,now renamed the Research Department. As the new name implies, the activities of the department willconcentrate on research, i.e. analysing monetary issues and coordinating research in the Bank.Although an important part of the Research Department’s work will still be devoted to the compilationof economic statistics that can be used in economic analysis, greater attention will henceforth be givento monetary policy assessment, econometric modelling, international economic developments,international relations and labour and social research.The Research Department is developing the technical support systems that are essential for theimplementation of an inflation-targeting framework, namely the development of additional and moresophisticated inflation-forecasting models, the investigation of the transmission mechanism betweenchanges in policy instruments and inflation and the design and implementation of a survey-basedassessment of inflation expectations.Although these steps are necessary for the implementation of inflation targeting, this new frameworkshould not in any significant way affect the conduct of monetary policy. Policy actions will still beguided by a medium-term inflation outlook, albeit in a more transparent manner. In order to arrive atan inflation outlook, the Bank will continue to monitor a wide range of economic indicators, includingdevelopments in money supply and bank credit extension. In this new framework the Bank’s mainoperational instrument will continue to be the repo mechanism. The same fine-tuning and structuraloperational instruments will be used to influence interest rates and the level of the exchange rate of therand will be determined primarily by the impact of these actions on the supply of and demand forforeign exchange.Price stability depends not only on monetary operational procedures, but also on stability in thefinancial sector or the degree of confidence in the ability of financial institutions and markets to meetcontractual obligations without interruption or outside assistance. Any signs of weakness in thefinancial system could disrupt price stability. Conversely, stability in the financial sector could beseriously disturbed by sharply rising inflation and interest rates, and a resultant increase in non-performing loans and a fall in asset prices and collateral values. An appropriate balance between riskand reward in the financial system is a major challenge to any central bank.In view of these considerations, the Reserve Bank will continue to monitor financial conditionscarefully as part of its objective to maintain financial stability. Where unavoidable pressures do arisein the financial system, the Bank may have to carefully contain them directly as “lender of last resort”.The lender-of-last-resort facility will not, however, automatically be made available to all banks indistress, but only in cases where the failure of a bank would pose a serious threat to the financialsystem as a whole. Criteria will be established to specify the exit strategy of the Reserve Bank. Adeposit-insurance scheme is being developed to cover retail depositors. This scheme could providemore latitude in deciding whether to close an ailing bank, without the concern that depositors infinancially healthy banks may lose confidence in the banking system as a whole.Sound financial supervision is a prerequisite for financial stability and warranted the debate during thepast year on the feasibility of establishing a single financial regulatory authority in South Africa. Mostcountries have securities commissions responsible for the regulation of investment services and inmany countries there is still a separation of banking and insurance supervision. Current opinion inSouth Africa is influenced strongly by recent developments in the United Kingdom and Australiawhere banking supervision has been moved out of the central bank into a single financial regulator.There are convincing arguments both for and against a single financial regulator. Arguments for such asingle regulator include issues such as the blurring of functional dividing lines between differentinstitutions, the development of financial conglomerates, the exploitation of gaps in financialregulation and the achievement of economies of scale and a uniform style of regulation. Arguments forthe retention of bank supervision as a Reserve Bank function are based on the characteristics ofbanking, the special relationships between the Bank and the banking sector, the high systemic risks inbanking, the importance of a healthy banking system for effective monetary policy and the Bank’s
BIS Review 91/199910ability to compete for scarce human resources. It is important that all these arguments be carefullyconsidered by government to find an appropriate approach to this issue that can continue to assist inthe execution of monetary policy.A well-organised decision-making process is another important factor in the conduct of monetarypolicy. All monetary policy decisions are currently made by the Governors’ Committee (consisting ofthe Governor and deputy governors), while the Monetary Policy Implementation Committee (MPIC)is responsible for carrying out monetary policy. Although this decision-making process works well,monetary policy issues demand more attention. It has therefore been decided to create a MonetaryPolicy Committee (MPC) for the formulation of monetary policy. The MPC will consist of theGovernor and deputy governors as voting members and senior officials of the Bank as non-votingmembers.The MPC will consider and evaluate the state of the economy, the current stance of monetary policyand the operational procedures in the conduct of monetary policy and formulate the changes deemednecessary in monetary policy and operational procedures. The final decision-making power onmonetary policy matters will nevertheless still vest in the Governors’ Committee.In order to provide opportunities for public involvement in the monetary policy decision-makingprocess, it has also been decided to create a Monetary Policy Forum (MPF). The Governor of theReserve Bank will chair the MPF, and representatives of private business enterprises, labour and otherinterested institutions and organisations will be invited to participate in the meetings of the MPF. TheMPF will meet twice a year to discuss macroeconomic developments and monetary policy issues.Internal administration of the BankThe internal decision-making process of the Reserve Bank will be changed in the coming year. Inaddition to the existing Currency, Payment and Financial Systems Committee and the ManagementCommittee, a Budget Committee will be formed. The Budget Committee will have the authority tocompile and monitor the implementation of the Bank’s annual budget. Through a Subcommittee onProcurement, the Budget Committee will also be responsible for the procurement, management andcontrol of supplies, services and assets of the Bank.In a further attempt to achieve greater transparency, the Bank has decided to establish a fully fledgedMedia Office. This office will be primarily responsible for focusing external communication, thusassisting the media, national and provincial legislative structures and the general public to gain a betterunderstanding of the Bank’s policies, decisions and activities.During the past year, considerable progress has been made with a number of other administrativeprojects in the Reserve Bank. These projects included the certification of year 2000 compliance of thebanking system’s information technology infrastructure and applications, as well as the South AfricanMultiple Options Settlement (SAMOS) system. Operational contingency plans have been prepared tohandle any problems that may arise over the year-end, including plans for the provision of additionalcash, the management of liquidity and for continued clearing, payment and settlement through theSAMOS system. Simulations of the clearing arrangements were conducted on the public holiday on9 August 1999 and the results were successful. Moreover, the Registrar of Banks has issued a numberof regulations to ensure that the banking sector is year 2000 compliant and, in collaboration with theFinancial Services Board, has prepared a booklet to inform the public of the preparations to overcomethe year 2000 problem.Further progress was made in enhancing various national payment system principles, practices andarrangements in preparation for same-day settlement by June 2000. These enhancements included theintroduction of settlement risk-reduction measures, the adoption of a legal framework and thedevelopment of a risk and research database.The Reserve Bank and the banking industry have also agreed to collaborate in improving the nationalnotes and coin management system. The wholesale cash processing services performed by SBV
11BIS Review 91/1999Services (Pty) Ltd. will revert to the Reserve Bank. A study is currently being done on ways ofimproving the infrastructure of the branches of the Bank to cater for these changes.The Bank completed comprehensive recalculations of national accounts and balance of paymentsstatistics during the past year. The estimates follow the conventions and guidelines of the latest Systemof National Accounts 1993 and the Balance of Payments Manual, prescribed by the United NationsOrganisation and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), thus complying with the IMF’srequirements for the Special Data Dissemination Standard.Human resource development is regarded as an important element of the Reserve Bank’sresponsibilities because the Bank’s staff is its major asset. Considerable effort has accordingly beenmade in the past financial year to develop the skills of the Bank’s staff. In addition, several courseswere presented to trainees from other African central banks at the Reserve Bank’s Training Institute.The Institute, and the Bank of Tanzania Training Institute also jointly compiled a report on thecoordination of training and development in the SADC region. In a further attempt to promotetraining, the Reserve Bank established a task force to review the training currently provided to staffand to make recommendations on ways of optimising the existing training facilities.In the past financial year, a beginning has been made in drawing up a human resources plan which willdeal with progressive employment equity in the workplace by promoting equal opportunities and fairtreatment. The plan will propose the implementation of affirmative action measures to redress thedisadvantages of designated groups to ensure their equitable representation in all occupationalcategories and levels of the workforce. A renewed focus will be placed on recruiting from the targetgroup and enhancing the skills profile through development and monitoring. This plan will, however,be put into effect in a manner that will ensure that the institutional memory does not drop below thecritical level required for national and international excellence. To achieve these goals, aSubcommittee on Human Resources will be established under the auspices of the ManagementCommittee to oversee the execution of the human resources plan.Concluding remarksEvents over the past year illustrate that the thrust of monetary policy in an integrated financial worldshould clearly be to pursue financial stability. Although such a policy stance does not provideunconditional protection against volatile international capital movements, it improves the country’sability to withstand international financial turbulence. When international financial disruptions affectthe South African economy, adjustments will inevitably have to be made to the exchange rate of therand, domestic liquidity and interest rates. The objective of the monetary authorities should not be toresist such changes, but rather to ease the adjustment process by pursuing consistent and transparentpolicy measures. Financial stability is a precondition for sustained economic growth and employmentcreation.The changes to the monetary policy framework and the monetary policy decision-making process thatare proposed in this address should assist the authorities in this difficult task. Inflation targeting is nopanacea, but it should help to anchor inflation expectations and minimise the inevitable, but short-term, social and economic cost of achieving price stability. A more transparent decision-makingprocess will further assist in reaching this goal.The financial crisis over the past two years showed that globalised financial markets and volatilecapital movements create new challenges for supervisors to maintain stability in the financial sector.Various incidents revealed the extent to which participants took advantage of a wide variety ofleverage methods to enhance returns on investments in emerging-market economies. The extensive useof derivatives and short sales of securities compounded losses and increased the need for liquiditywhen asset prices declined. In view of such developments, credit risk management becomes extremelyimportant because of the dangers of default and large bad debts in the banking sector. In the recentcrisis South Africa was fortunate to have had efficient and well-run banking institutions. Continuedattention will have to be given in the coming years to sound risk management and to devoting evenmore resources to the maintenance of stability in the financial sector.
BIS Review 91/199912In conclusion, I wish to thank the President and Deputy President of the Republic for their support andappreciation with regard to the functions of the South African Reserve Bank and its governors. Ifurther wish to thank Mr Trevor Manuel, Minister of Finance, Ms Maria Ramos, the Director-Generalof Finance and the staff of the Department of Finance for their support of the Reserve Bank over thepast year. I should like to thank the directors of the Reserve Bank, including the deputy governors, fortheir undivided loyalty to the Bank. On this occasion, it is also fitting to pay further tribute to Dr ChrisStals for his term of ten years as Governor, and just more than 44 years in the service of the Bank.Dr Stals made numerous valuable contributions to the work of the Bank and for the benefit of SouthAfrica during his career, for which we are deeply grateful. Dr Chris de Swardt, Deputy Governor foralmost ten years, also retired recently after a distinguished career of nearly 44½ years in the Bank. Wewish both Dr Stals and Dr de Swardt, as well as their wives, a happy retirement and fulfilling yearsahead. Finally, I wish to thank the staff of the Reserve Bank for the professional manner in which theyperformed their duties in the past year. I am confident that with their continued loyal support, the Bankwill meet the challenges that lie ahead.
1BIS Review 90/1999Mr Greenspan discusses new challenges for monetary policySpeech given by the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, Mr AlanGreenspan, before a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City in JacksonHole, Wyoming on 27 August 1999.*   *   *I should like as a backdrop to this conference on the challenges confronting monetary policy to focuson certain aspects of one of the issues that will be more broadly discussed later this morning: assetpricing and macroeconomic performance.As the value of assets and liabilities have risen relative to income, we have been confronted with thepotential for our economies to exhibit larger and perhaps more abrupt responses to changes in factorsaffecting the balance sheets of households and businesses. As a result, our analytic tools are going tohave to increasingly focus on changes in asset values and resulting balance sheet variations if we are tounderstand these important economic forces. Central bankers, in particular, are going to have to beable to ascertain how changes in the balance sheets of economic actors influence real economicactivity and, hence, affect appropriate macroeconomic policies.At root, all asset values rest on perceptions of the future. A motor vehicle assembly plant is a pile ofjunk if no participants in a market economy perceive it capable of turning out cars and trucks of use toconsumers and profit to producers. Likewise, the scrap value at the end of the plant’s service life willbe positive only if it is convertible into usable products.The value ascribed to any asset is a discounted value of future expected returns, even if no marketparticipant consciously makes that calculation. In principle, forward discounting lies behind thevaluation of all assets, from an apple that is about to be consumed to a hydroelectric plant with ahundred-year life expectancy.On such judgments of value rest much of our economic system. Doubtless, valuations are shaped inpart, perhaps in large part, by the economic process itself. But history suggests that they also reflectwaves of optimism and pessimism that can be touched off by seemingly small exogenous events.This morning, I plan to address some of the problems that arise in evaluating the prices of equities. Ishould like to first focus on some significant difficulties of profit accounting that impede judgmentsabout prospective earnings. In particular, there are some difficulties that have become more severe as aconsequence of the recent acceleration of technologies, which, in turn, are markedly altering patternsof economic organization and production. And then I will discuss a different set of forces that moldthe development of discount factors which, together with earnings projections, produce estimates ofmarket value.First, the rapid shift in the composition of gross domestic product towards idea-based value added ismuddying our measures of current earnings and, hence, our projections of future earnings.The key definitional question that must be confronted is, what is a capital outlay? Conversely, what isan expense that, by definition, is consumed in the process of production and deemed an intermediateproduct? This issue is most immediately evident in accounting for software outlays, but it is rapidlyexpanding to a much broader range of activities.Software that is embedded in capital equipment, and some that is stand-alone, is currently beingcapitalized and consequently amortized against current and future earnings. But a substantial portionof software spending is expensed, even though the equity prices of the purchasing companies areclearly valuing the software outlays as contributing to earnings over their useful economic lives – therelevant criterion for capitalizing an asset.
BIS Review 90/19992There has always been a fuzzy dividing line between what is expensed and what is capitalized. Thishas historically bedeviled the accounting for research and development, for example. But the majortechnological advances of recent years have exposed a wide swath of rapidly growing outlays that,arguably, should be capitalized so that the returns they produce would be more accurately reflected asearnings over time. Indeed, there is even an argument for capitalizing new ideas, such as differentways of organizing production, that enhance the value of a firm without any associated outlays. Someanalysts judge the size of undercapitalized outlays as quite large.1The important point, however, is that decisions about which items to expense will have importantconsequences for reported earnings. In general, if the trend of expensed items that should becapitalized is rising faster than reported earnings, switching to capitalizing these items will almostalways accelerate the growth in earnings. The reverse, of course, is also true.But the newer technologies, and the productivity and bull stock market they have fostered, are alsoaccentuating some accounting difficulties that tend to bias up reported earnings. One is the apparentoverestimate of earnings that occurs as a result of the distortion in the accounting for stock options.The combination of not charging their fair value against income, and the practice of periodicallyrepricing those options that fall significantly out of the money,2 serves to understate ongoing laborcompensation charges against corporate earnings. This distortion, all else equal, has overstated growthof reported profits according to Fed staff calculations by 1 to 2 percentage points annually during thepast five years. Similarly, the rise in stock prices, which reduces corporate contributions to pensionfunds is also augmenting reported profits. These upward adjustments in reported earnings, of course,are a consequence of rising stock prices and, hence, may not be of the same dimension in the future.Nonetheless, it is reasonable to surmise that undercapitalized expenses have been rising sufficientlyfaster than reported earnings to have more than offset the factors that have temporarily augmentedreported earnings. It does not seem likely, however, even should all of the appropriate accountingadjustments to earnings be made, that such adjustments can be the central explanation of theextraordinary increase in stock prices over the past five years.However we calculate profits and capital, shifts in the stock market value of firms will doubtlesscontinue to remain important influences on our economies. It is thus incumbent on us to improve ourunderstanding of the process by which projections of future earnings are translated into asset marketvalue.Even our most sophisticated analytic techniques have difficulty dealing with the interactions amongtime preference, risk aversion and uncertainty, and with the implications of these interactions for therisk premiums that are embedded in asset prices. It is our failure to anticipate changes in thisdiscounting process that much of our inability to accurately forecast economic events lies. Forexample, the dramatic changes in information technology that have enabled businesses to embrace thetechniques of just-in-time inventory management appear to have reduced that part of the businesscycle that is attributable to inventory fluctuations and, accordingly, may well have been a factor in theapparent decline in equity premiums that has characterized the latter part of the 1990s. Whether thedecline in these premiums themselves may foster activities that could result in wider business cycles,as some maintain, is an open question.As model builders know, all economic channels of influence are not of equal power to engendergrowth or contraction. Of crucial importance, and still most elusive, is arguably the behavior of assetmarkets. More broadly, there is an increasing need to integrate into our macro models more completedescriptions of the responses of households and businesses to risk – behaviors that are generallymodeled separately under the rubric of portfolio risk management.1For example, Erik Brynjolfsson and Shinkyu Yang, “The Intangible Costs and Benefits of Computer Investments:Evidence from the Financial Markets,” MIT Sloan School, mimeo, April 1999.2The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) will require that the cost of repricing of options be charged againstincome starting later this year.
3BIS Review 90/1999The translation of value judgments into market prices is, of course, rooted in how people discountuncertain future outcomes. An individual’s degree of risk aversion may vary through time andpossibly be subject to herd instincts. Nonetheless, certain stable magnitudes are inferable from theprocess of discounting of future claims and values.One of the most enduring is that interest rates, as far back as we can measure, appear trendless, despitevast changes in technology, life expectancy and economic organization. British long-term governmentinterest rates, for example, mostly ranged between 3% and 6% from the early eighteenth century to theearly twentieth century, and are around 5% today. Indeed, scattered evidence dating back to ancientRome and before reflects the same order of interest rate magnitude, not a 1% interest rate nor 200%.This suggests that the rate of time preference underlying interest rates, like so many other aspects ofhuman nature, has not materially changed over the generations. But while time preference may appearto be relatively stable over history, perceptions of risk and uncertainty, which couple with timepreference to create discount factors, obviously vary widely, as does liquidity preference, itself afunction of uncertainty.The impact of increasing uncertainty and risk aversion was no more evident than in the crisis thatgripped financial markets last autumn, following the Russian default.That episode of investor fright has largely dissipated. But left unanswered is the question of why suchepisodes erupt in the first place.It has become evident time and again that when events are unexpected, more complex, and move morerapidly than is the norm, human beings become less able to cope. The failure to be able to comprehendexternal events almost invariably induces fear and, hence, disengagement from an activity, whether itbe entering a dark room or taking positions in markets. And attempts to disengage from markets thatare net long – the most general case – means bids are hit and prices fall.Modern quantitative approaches to risk measurement and risk management take as their starting pointhistorical experience with market price fluctuations, which is statistically summarized in probabilitydistributions. We live in what is, for the most part, a stable economic system, where marketimbalances that produce unusual outcomes almost always give rise to continuous and inevitable movesback towards longer-run equilibrium. However, the violence of the responses to what seemed to berelatively mild imbalances in Southeast Asia in 1997 and throughout the global economy in Augustand September 1998 has illustrated yet again that the adjustments in asset markets can bediscontinuous, especially when investors hold highly leveraged positions and when views aboutlong-term equilibria are not firmly held.Enough investors usually adopt strategies that take account of longer-run tendencies to foster thepropensity for convergence toward equilibrium. But from time to time, this process has broken downas investors suffer an abrupt collapse of comprehension of, and confidence in, future economic events.It is almost as though, like a dam under mounting water pressure, confidence appears normal until themoment it is breached.Risk aversion in such an instance rises dramatically, and deliberate trading strategies are replaced byrising fear-induced disengagement. Yield spreads on relatively risky assets widen dramatically. In themore extreme manifestation, the inability to differentiate among degrees of risk drives tradingstrategies to ever-more-liquid instruments so investors can immediately reverse decisions at minimumcost should that be required. As a consequence, even among riskless assets, such as U.S. Treasurysecurities, liquidity premiums rise sharply as investors seek the heavily traded “on-the-run” issues – abehavior that was so evident last fall.History tells us that sharp reversals in confidence happen abruptly, most often with little advancenotice. These reversals can be self-reinforcing processes that can compress sizable adjustments into avery short time period. Panic market reactions are characterized by dramatic shifts in behavior tominimize short-term losses. Claims on far-distant future values are discounted to insignificance. Whatis so intriguing is that this type of behavior has characterized human interaction with little appreciabledifference over the generations. Whether Dutch tulip bulbs or Russian equities, the market pricepatterns remain much the same.
BIS Review 90/19994We can readily describe this process, but, to date, economists have been unable to anticipate sharpreversals in confidence. Collapsing confidence is generally described as a bursting bubble, an eventincontrovertibly evident only in retrospect. To anticipate a bubble about to burst requires the forecastof a plunge in the prices of assets previously set by the judgments of millions of investors, many ofwhom are highly knowledgeable about the prospects for the specific companies that make up ourbroad stock price indexes.If episodic recurrences of ruptured confidence are integral to the way our economy and our financialmarkets work now and in the future, it has significant implications for risk management and, byimplication, macroeconomic modeling and monetary policy.Probability distributions that are estimated largely, or exclusively, over cycles excluding periods ofpanic will underestimate the probability of extreme price movements because they fail to capture asecondary peak at the extreme negative tail that reflects the probability of occurrence of a panic.Furthermore, joint distributions estimated over periods without panics will misestimate the degree ofcorrelation between asset returns during panics. Under these circumstances, fear and disengagementby investors often result in simultaneous declines in the values of private obligations, as investors nolonger realistically differentiate among degrees of risk and liquidity and increases in the values ofriskless government securities. Consequently, the benefits of portfolio diversification will tend to beoverestimated when the rare panic periods are not taken into account.As we make progress, hopefully, towards understanding asset-pricing mechanisms, we need also toupgrade our insights into the effect of changing asset values on GDP – the so-called wealth effect.Although many aspects of this issue deserve attention, let me cite a few open questions of particularimportance. Efforts to differentiate between realized and unrealized gains, and the propensity toleverage both, may afford a deeper understanding of the consequences of asset price change. Anddifferentiating between gains that arise from enhanced profitability and those that reflect changes indiscount factors may also be useful. The former may be more likely to be sustained, given thetendencies of discount factors to revert back to historic norms.Moreover, it is evident that borrowings against capital gains on homes influence consumer outlaysbeyond the effects of gains from financial assets. Preliminary work at the Federal Reserve suggeststhat the extraction of equity from housing has played an important role in recent years. However, stockmarket values and capital gains on homes are correlated and, hence, their separate effects are difficultto identify. This is an area that clearly warrants further examination.Finally, in the business sector, questions remain about the influence of equity prices on investmentspending. In particular, do all equity price movements – whether related to fundamentals or not – havethe same effect on investment spending?In conclusion, the issues that I have touched on this morning are of increasing importance formonetary policy. We no longer have the luxury to look primarily to the flow of goods and services, asconventionally estimated, when evaluating the macroeconomic environment in which monetary policymust function. There are important – but extremely difficult – questions surrounding the behavior ofasset prices and the implications of this behavior for the decisions of households and businesses.Accordingly, we have little choice but to confront the challenges posed by these questions if we are tounderstand better the effect of changes in balance sheets on the economy and, hence, indirectly, onmonetary policy.
1BIS Review 89/1999Mrs Akhtar Aziz discussesthe international financial architectureOfficial speech entitled “International Financial Architecture - The Challenge of Change” by Dr ZetiAkhtar Aziz, the Deputy Governor of Bank Negara Malaysia, the Malaysian central bank, at theMalaysian Capital Market Summit on 11 August 1999.*      *      *IntroductionThe significant fundamental changes that have taken place in the international financial environmenthas brought with it new challenges and consequences to the global community and individualeconomies at large. Change has become the only constant. The evolution of the changes in theinternational financial environment has been facilitated by the significant advances in technology,market innovations, financial liberalisation and the consolidation process in the financial servicessector. These developments have resulted in the intensification of the process of globalisation andintegration of financial markets. As a consequence, there has been a widespread transformation in theinternational financial landscape reflecting the changes in the relative significance of players in themarket, the nature of the financial instruments and the volume of activity in the market.This process of globalisation is supposed to result in enhanced opportunities for the world economythat would lead to a more efficient allocation of resources across borders and thereby result in highergrowth and development across countries. The experience however, has shown that globalisation hasalso brought with it risks that can lead to highly destabilising consequences that can result in costs thatfar outweigh the benefits. The challenge facing the international community is how to ensure anefficient functioning financial system, a system that is not vulnerable to market failures, a system thatwould lead to an efficient allocation of resources across borders and provide enhanced prospects forthe world economy. At the individual country level, the challenge is how to participate in this changedenvironment, how to be an integral part of the world economy without being vulnerable to violentdestabilising developments. The challenge for individual countries is to be able to be in a position toexperience the benefits of these changes while at the same time enhancing the potential for survival.Changing trends in the world financial environmentAs a result of the changes that have facilitated globalisation, financial flows have now far exceededworld trade flows by four times. Such flows have now become the dominant factor in determiningexchange rate movements. While previously, exchange rate developments reflected the performance ofthe balance of payments current account position, in the current environment, the capital accountperformance has become the dominant factor in determining exchange rate movements. In particular,the developments in the short-term capital account have become the important factor. In this currentenvironment the expansion of international financial activities has resulted in internationaldevelopments having a greater influence on the domestic economy.The increased cross border flows also reflects the increased institutionalisation of savings and the nowrelative importance of institutional investors in financial markets. In efforts to diversify risk andenhance returns participation in foreign markets by institutional investors have increasedexponentially. This trend should in theory improve the allocation of world financial resources andincrease competitiveness and efficiency of the financial markets as well as open up new avenues forenhancing prospects for growth.In this process of globalisation the domestic financial conditions of individual countries have becomesignificantly influenced by international capital movements and external economic and financialconditions and policies. The extreme form of this has been demonstrated by the contagion that has
BIS Review 89/19992occurred during the financial crisis that has been experienced in recent years, in particular during theERM crisis, the Mexican crisis and the East Asian crisis. The challenge has therefore been to operatein an environment that has become more susceptible to greater uncertainty and volatility. In suchperiods of excessive volatility and wide swings, market failure is seen to result as markets becomeunstable, moving further and further away from equilibrium levels following over reaction andirrational market behaviour amplified by herd behaviour. At the extreme, these eventually becometrigger factors for domestic outflows resulting in total collapse and devastation.The sudden nature of capital movements also imply the increasing short-termism of the global market.Such flows have tended to focus on short-term and immediate gains rather than having a moremedium-term perspective, taking into account structural elements for investment decisions. This hasled to excessive risk taking, reflecting the intense pressure for high returns. Market behaviour underthese circumstances has been characterised by sudden shifts from extreme exuberance to overpessimism. These flows, in effect, do not reflect the underlying fundamentals.In this environment, the challenge has been for enhanced access to information to allow for betterdecision making. There have been calls for greater transparency and disclosure. Scrutiny andsurveillance by multilateral agencies, rating agencies and the market have intensified. At the sametime, however, there has not been adequate surveillance on short-term flows to allow greaterunderstanding of their nature and the dynamics of such flows. The increasing degree of sophisticationof the financial instruments and the complex nature of their operations has not allowed for a trueassessment of the implications of these developments. Of equal importance on the issue oftransparency, is the need to also ensure appropriate utilisation of the information.In the context of these developments, the regulatory structure has lagged behind the financialinnovations and their internationalisation. It has been widely recognised that there is a widening gapbetween outdated regulatory structures and advanced market instruments and developments. Given theglobal dimension of the forces of change, the call for the strengthening of individual nations’ financialsystems also needs to be matched by efforts to strengthen the international financial system.In the past, changes in the financial environment have been met with corresponding changes in theinternational financial system. Since the Plaza Accord in 1985, however, the changes in the financialenvironment have not been matched by a parallel change in the management of the global financialsystem, particularly in the 1990s. The international financial system has continued to operate within aframework designed for a global environment of the 1970s and 1980s.In this era of the expansion of capital flows there has essentially been an absence of the developmentof the appropriate parallel prudential framework for the efficient functioning of the internationalfinancial markets. In the case of trade, the push towards free trade was matched by adequate rules toensure orderly development. International rules on market opening measures and procedures fordispute settlement were established. More importantly, there are safeguards to protect countries facingbalance-of-payments difficulties. In contrast, the push for a liberal environment for capital movementshas not been matched by a parallel development to establish rules for the efficient functioning of themarkets and for safeguards to individual economies from the adverse consequences of capitalmovements. The challenge is therefore not only for the international community to evolve a viableinternational system that can function efficiently in the current global environment, but also one that isrelevant to expected future changes.Quest for a reformed international financial architectureThe forces of change that we are confronted with are essentially international in character. A globalperspective is therefore required to evolve a system in which all countries can participate and benefitfrom the globalisation process. A permanent and sustainable outcome would be one that is developedby the global community, taking into account the diverse backgrounds of countries that make up theglobal community as well as its implications on the private sector. Efforts by individual countries tostrengthen their domestic systems and capabilities are important, but this is not a sufficient conditionfor ensuring economic and financial stability.
3BIS Review 89/1999Several international forums over the last two years have engaged in this exercise and have brought tothe forefront the issues and challenges at hand. While there is a general consensus among theinternational community that the international financial system needs to be reformed to ensure asystem that is relevant to the current changed environment, there is no general consensus of how thismight be achieved.The more recent initiatives by the G7 have provided the most encouraging progress that has beenmade with the establishment of the Financial Stability Forum. It provides the opportunity for theproposed changes to be translated into concrete implementation. While efforts are underway, it stillremains to be seen as to the degree to which changes will be made and the time frame for itsimplementation. The urgency for the development of an efficient functioning system that would avoidfuture crisis is vital, given that the strains and costs of such crisis occur not only for the affectedindividual countries but also have widespread consequences across countries.Rising to the challenge of changeWhile individual countries will continue to be vulnerable to changes in the external environment,initiatives can be taken to build the foundation to enhance capabilities and capacities to not onlyabsorb change but also to be in a position to take advantage of the opportunities that globalisationaccords.An important area towards achieving this is the process of liberalisation. There is now an internationalconsensus that the process of managing the liberalisation should ensure that countries have theinstitutional framework to deal with international capital flows before liberalising capital transactions.Financial liberalisation implemented in an orderly and well sequenced manner would allow thedomestic system to be adequately developed to cope with the challenges emerging from theglobalisation process. The necessary set of preconditions should therefore be in place prior to capitalaccount liberalisation. The East Asian crisis demonstrated that countries that have liberalised toorapidly in the absence of the preconditions became relatively more vulnerable. All too often, externalpressure has been applied to emerging economies to hasten the pace of liberalisation without takinginto account the risks that would emerge.However, it should also be noted that in spite of the best institutional framework, a country can still besubsumed by a liberalised capital account framework under the current international financial systemthat does not have any financial regulatory framework for capital flows. Management of domesticrisks must be matched by measures to ensure efficient markets. A parallel institution building andsurveillance system at the international level is necessary to secure greater stability.Another important area where safeguards are necessary are the strategies for financing growth. In thisregard, development strategies by individual economies need to make balanced choices between debtand equity, and the share between domestic and foreign financing. Excessive reliance on external debtfinancing increases vulnerability to changes in interest rates of creditor countries as well as exchangerates of both creditor and debtor countries. The different strategies pursued by the East Asian countriesin their financing strategies have resulted in different degrees of vulnerability to the externaldevelopments. Here, the development of a deep and liquid capital market is important to providealternative sources of financing and thereby reduce excessive reliance on the banking system for suchfinancing.For an individual country, the changed environment that has resulted in greater unpredictability anduncertainty, makes risk management vital. Decisions need to be made on the acceptable levels of risk,the degree of risk tolerance and for the development of strong risk culture. The methodology andtechnology need to be developed to measure and monitor the increased risks. Adequate controls andchecks and balances need to be in place to ensure there is no excessive risk taking that could result inadverse implications.The process of globalisation and change also implies the need for the domestic financial system toenhance its capacity to compete in world markets. In this regard, increased efficiency would providethe competitive edge. The move for consolidation would enhance this process in obtaining gains from
BIS Review 89/19994increased economies of scale and cost saving. Gains from increased efficiency in the utilisation ofphysical and human resources as well as higher technology become essential in this more competitiveenvironment. In the context of technological advantage, the application of IT will represent animportant enabling tool in this process. Efforts to upgrade skills will also be required. An enlarged sizewill enable significant increases in investment in cutting edge technology and human resources. Inessence, in an environment of scarce resources, the efficient utilisation of resources becomesimportant.The process of globalisation and change also implies a need for the domestic economy to enhance itscapacity to compete in the world markets. Small open economies such as Malaysia face the challengesto build a competitive edge in a product and service market that is also characterised by rapid change.Many of Malaysia’s exports face rapid technological and market changes. In this context, the strategyhas been for the diversification of the economic base, while at the same time enhancing efficiency andincreasing labour mobility. For this purpose there is also a need for more diversified and efficientsources of financing. In relation to this, a financial system that is efficient and competitive as well asan efficient functioning capital market is a key element in the process. Labour mobility also needs tobe enhanced through human resource development. On the corporate front, the current restructuringand consolidation taking place would make the industries more resilient and efficient. As corporationsbecome more focused on their core activities and as their activities are streamlined, this will increasethe prospects for enhanced efficiency and competitiveness. The ability to tap IT and engage ininnovation becomes increasingly important to meet the increasingly more sophisticated demand.Greater efforts will also be needed to promote more efficient flow and use of information. This willenable industries to respond faster to the changing environment and move towards a more knowledgebased economy.ConclusionIn this global environment of uncertainty and change, it is difficult to anticipate future risks. While thefuture is unpredictable, it is important to understand how the future might change, not only to gaugethe viability of existing initiatives but also to develop new capabilities to operate in the changedenvironment. Therefore, in moving forward, we need to look beyond the horizon to have an ability toface an environment that is fundamentally different from the present one. What is needed is anunderstanding of the range of possibilities that might occur and to be in a position to implementstrategies that will succeed under different circumstances. It is therefore important to identify theforces that could determine these different possible environments. The ability to recognise thepotential future developments and to be able to adapt and adjust to these developments would providesafeguards and increase our resilience and our prospects for survival and sustained growth.
1BIS Review 88/1999Statement by Mr Mboweni at his inauguration as new Governorof the Reserve Bank of South AfricaStatement by Mr Tito Mboweni on the occasion of the retirement of Governor Chris Stals as Governorof the South African Reserve Bank and his inauguration as new Governor, held in Midrand on7 August 1999.*      *      *…Esteemed guestsLadies and gentlemen,It is a privilege and an honour to have you all here as guests of the South African Reserve Bank as wesay goodbye to Dr Chris Stals, who was Governor of the Reserve Bank for ten years, and as we alsomark the start of my term as Governor. I am particularly pleased that all of you people with busyschedules have come from near and far to be with us on this occasion.A special note of thanks to the President of the Republic, Professor Stanley Fischer from theInternational Monetary Fund, Mr Bill McDonough, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of NewYork, Mr Urban Bäckström, Governor of the Central Bank of Sweden and also President of the Bankfor International Settlements, Mr Adriano Maleiane, Governor of the Bank of Mozambique and othercentral bank governors who are here tonight. Thank you to those of you who battled to rearrange yourdiaries to be with us tonight. Thank you once again.Tonight we say farewell to Dr Chris Stals, with whom I have worked closely over the past year butwhom I have known since 1988. I have come to know Dr Stals as a committed central banker ofinternational stature, a truly new Voortrekker who did not shy away from contributing his best to thenew South Africa. Thank you, Dr Stals, for your lasting contribution and for showing suchcommitment during this smooth transition.We are also bidding a fond farewell to Dr Chris de Swardt, an Afrikaner gentleman par excellencewho was Deputy Governor, and whose career at the Bank also spanned some 44 years. This man is anexample of how one should relate to and treat other human beings. Although our association was brief,I will treasure our association for a long time to come.We wish both of you well in your retirement.It is a most interesting and demanding time to be Governor of the South African Reserve Bank. It is atime when the costs and benefits of globalisation are under scrutiny, not just by policymakers, but alsoby ordinary citizens.Emerging markets globally have experienced financial turmoil which plunged many into deeprecession. South Africa, though resilient, has not emerged from this turmoil unscathed. At only 0.5%,the rate of growth in gross domestic product last year fell woefully short of the levels needed in acountry where poverty and joblessness remain widespread and where tackling these issues remainpriorities for all of us.Against this background, it is hardly surprising that people sometimes hope that the Reserve Bank willtake action to stimulate economic growth by printing money. Some people think that, as a formerCabinet Minister, my appointment heralds the start of a cheap money era in the Bank. I must say ithere, loud and clear, they are wrong.Our view has been, and will continue to be, that it is not our role to provide an artificial stimulus forthe economy. The role of the Bank is to create a climate of financial stability in which sustainableeconomic growth and wealth creation can be achieved; an environment in which an economic boomwill not be followed by an inevitable bust.
We are not Icarus; there is no need to fear that we will fly too close to the sun.Tonight is not the appropriate occasion to spell out our detailed approach to monetary policy or its rolein the South African economy. However, we are not going to try to rewrite the monetary policytextbooks or reinvent the wheel. The principles of sound and prudent central banking are the same theworld over and will not be fundamentally changed by any central bank governor, no matter howenergetic or enthusiastic, let alone how young.The details of our approach will be spelt out in the Governor’s Address at the Annual General Meetingof the Bank on the 24th of August. However, whatever we say then will be in accordance with theprinciples of sound and prudent monetary policy frameworks that have been tested in a global context.Central banks follow different approaches to their monetary policy frameworks. Some central bankshave adopted currency boards to fix their exchange rates, while others follow exchange rate targetingor inflation targeting. We will design our approach bearing in mind our particular experiences andhistory, as well as taking into account international best practice which has delivered financial stabilityand acceptable levels of inflation.South Africa has been exposed to the recent turmoil in financial markets but has emerged, whilst alittle bruised, both stronger and wiser. We, like other countries, have learnt important lessons and willput our experience to good use.We know that if we want to benefit from globalisation in the form of sustained foreign capital inflows,we should constantly think of ourselves as citizens of the global village. The strength of the UnitedStates economy and trends in financial markets in New York, London, Tokyo and elsewhere will besignificant factors in influencing whether or not South Africa realises its economic potential. But wemust not underestimate our own responsibility as South Africans to develop our own potential and torun our economy responsibly and efficiently.As citizens of the global village, we must continue to participate actively in the debate on improvingthe international financial architecture in the hope that a way can be found to minimise the intensity offinancial shocks to emerging and developed markets alike.After a long, stimulating and challenging year which I have spent navigating the transition fromCabinet Minister to central banker and getting to know my colleagues in South Africa and other partsof the world, I am looking forward to starting officially next week with enthusiasm and confidence,inspired in no small part by many of you present here tonight. We are fortunate that the South AfricanReserve Bank is staffed by well qualified, committed and loyal people.To the President, the members of the Board of Directors of the Bank, my colleagues the DeputyGovernors, management and staff, and esteemed guests: sweswi hi ngene eka nkari wamahlambandlopfu (we are now entering the time of the day when the elephants go washing; that is, thecrack of dawn).
1BIS Review 88/1999Mr Bäckström discusses international financial stabilitySpeech given by the Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, Mr Urban Bäckström1, at a seminar at theSouth African Reserve Bank in Pretoria on 9 August 1999.*      *      *IntroductionFinancial stability is a topical subject in the light of events in the past decade – years that saw financialproblems in a number of European countries as well as in Mexico and Asia, the devaluation of therouble and suspended payments in Russia, considerable turbulence in western financial markets andfinancial unrest in Brazil. The crisis in the international financial system developed, to cite PresidentClinton, from being “just a few small glitches in the road” into “the worst financial crisis in fiftyyears”.The problem is that crises will always be intrinsically difficult to forecast. Recall that the scale of theMexican crisis in 1994 was foreseen by very few. In South-East Asia the onset, duration and scope ofthe recession were all missed by the forecasting community. In the last spring, no one had anticipatedthe extent of the turmoil in financial markets that would be generated by the Russian devaluation andmoratorium. The ways in which rising credit spreads led to losses by highly leveraged investors,liquidity shortages and the virtual drying-up of some markets were generally not foreseen. The trackrecord shows that there are many things we do not understand and cannot predict. That conclusion isunderscored by a look at existing attempts to build early-warning systems for various types of crisis.Either these systems miss out on crises that actually occur or they sound the alarm for crises that donot occur.Nevertheless, given the costs and the difficulties of managing the successive crises over the pastdecade, we must continue to devote considerable efforts to avoiding future crises and try hard tounderstand the kinds of vulnerability that lie behind them. The crises during the 1990s have revealedserious flaws not only in macroeconomic management but also, just as important, in the structure andregulation of the financial system in both debtor and creditor countries. The work now being carriedout in various international fora is thorough and can be summarised under three headings:• Crisis prevention, including the development of good practice standards and transparencycodes, and incentives for both borrowers and lenders to act prudently.• Crisis containment, including the establishment of official contingent lines and possibleforms of private sector finance which may reduce the severity of any crisis.• Crisis resolution, where the emphasis is on possible ways of creating a more orderlyenvironment for restructuring external debt, on principles to guide the restructuring ofbanking systems in the wake of a crisis, and on handling corporate insolvency.Much of this work involves international institutions like, for instance, the International MonetaryFund, the World Bank, the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on BankingSupervision, and the OECD, as well as the newly created Financial Stability Forum.1Governor Bäckström is also Chairman of the Board and President of the Bank for International Settlements. Beforebecoming Governor of the Riksbank in 1994 he was State Secretary in the Ministry of Finance with responsibility forFiscal and Financial Affairs, which included the responsibility, under the minister, for the handling of the Swedishbanking crisis in the early 1990s.
However, the work, often hard, of implementing policies and codes lies with national authorities.These measures will contribute to improved financial stability only if countries actually adopt andimplement them. A crucial ingredient in achieving this is of course to involve countries, formally orinformally, in the development of the policies, codes and standards. But even if that is achieved, Iknow from my own experience how difficult the actual implementation sometimes can be, not least forpolitical reasons. I would also like to make the point that today’s favourable trends in the worldeconomy should not lead us to conclude that the danger is over. Instead, policymakers throughout theworld must continue to work on forestalling new problems both because some evident threats tointernational financial and economic stability still remain and because there may well bevulnerabilities that are not so evident.The run up to the financial turbulence of the 1990sDuring the past twenty years, the financial systems in many countries have been deregulated. For thefirst time since the outbreak of World War One, capital can again pass more or less freely acrossnational borders. Moreover, major changes in communication and information technology have pavedthe way for new instruments and methods for risk management. Taken as a whole, this has led to thefinancial system being more extensive and global today than ever before. This holds even thoughcapital flows relative to GDP were also large at the end of the last century.The rapid financial development and internationalisation are per se a logical consequence of theproduction of goods and services being globalised, with a massive increase in cross-border trade. Theyalso have to do with growing wealth in many parts of the world. This in turn has increased the need fornew financial solutions for businesses and households. The increasing globalisation of production andtrade in goods and services generates a demand for a more developed and internationalised financialsystem so that the opportunities for increased prosperity can be used to the full. Note that this, asalways, involves a trade-off between risk and return. It is of course possible to substantially increasestability, in the sense of lowering risk, by measures that result in very low returns. However thesolution is not to turn back to a less turbulent, but also less prosperous past regime of capital controls.The transition to a more global financial system has certainly not been free from problems. It shouldnot be forgotten that extensive capital regulations entail a mispricing of risks. Deregulation then leadsto desirable price adjustments. But it is often during these transitional corrections that financialproblems are liable to occur. Changes have often occurred too quickly for the system, including theinstitutional infrastructure, to be able to keep up. In most cases, neither the banks nor the publicauthorities had the necessary prerequisites for adapting to the new conditions that were created by afreer capital market. The expansion of lending had too free a rein in many countries and the authoritiesdid not properly monitor what was happening at either micro or macro level.Economic overheating often followed the deregulation and opening up of the domestic financialsystem due to a rapid expansion of credit rapidly. Asset prices rose sharply and imbalances developed.Furthermore, in countries with a fixed exchange rate system, extensive short-term borrowing abroadwas stimulated. A large proportion of these funds was often channelled through the domestic bankingsystem and rendered this rather vulnerable. When capital flows subsequently reversed, the adjustmentwas often violent. Production fell, unemployment rose and both the currency and the banking systemfaced an acute crisis.Apart from the actual process of financial market deregulation, there may have been other factors atwork. The openings for capital investment in so-called emerging markets created opportunities forinternational investors for achieving high returns. Between 1990 and 1997, the annual flow to Asiaalone was equivalent to around 25% of the affected countries’ aggregate GDP. This was a combinationof bank lending and portfolio investments; 60% of the lending from international banks was short-term.That capital moves from one part of the world to another if the yield is seen to be higher is, of course,positive in itself. The problem lay in the conditions for productive investments being less good than
3BIS Review 88/1999had been hoped. Later, when the Asian economies ran into problems, the capital flows reversed andserious financial turbulence broke out.A further way of achieving a high return was to take increased risks by debt financing and complexfinancial instruments. This created a starting point for so-called highly leveraged institutions. LongTerm Capital Management was one extreme example.International banks engaged in lending directly to countries where the returns were high. At the sametime, they lent capital to hedge funds that invested in the same countries. In some cases, moreover, thebanks owned shares directly in these funds. There are grounds for saying that risk-taking was high inmany cases. The good profits created a culture of deceptive security and stimulated further risk-taking.To this can be added the false sense of security that the new mathematical models imparted. Theywere seen to function well under normal circumstances but failed to do so when they were mostneeded, i.e. in turbulent times.Domestic policies, institutions and rules, important factors behind crises …Although several of these factors may have played some part in the run-up to recent financial crises, itis important to bear in mind that financial crises almost always originate in an unsuccessful domesticeconomic policy and in the structure and regulation of the domestic financial system. While moderninternational financial markets have possibly contributed to an earlier appearance of crises and to theirspreading, a deregulated financial system with free capital movements as such is not the basicproblem. It is striking that several countries most affected by financial turbulence in the 1990s wererelatively new participants in the international financial system without having first established asound domestic financial system and a sound economic policy. That conclusion also holds for my owncountry, Sweden, which experienced a severe crisis in the early 1990s.One obvious insight is, and I quote Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, “that participation in theinternational financial system with all its benefits carries with it an obligation to maintain a level ofstability and a set of strong and transparent institutions and rules if an economy is to participate safelyand effectively in markets that have become highly sensitive to misallocation of capital and otherpolicy errors”.Thus, emerging market economies must reform their domestic financial systems, just as we did inSweden after our crisis, if they want to enjoy the benefits of an open international financial system.Accordingly, further progress in establishing a sound legal infrastructure, covering both bankruptcyprocedures and effective corporate governance, would seem to be very high on the list of priorities.It is also important to understand the dangers inherent in adjustable peg exchange rate systems. It isstill far too early to draw the firm conclusion that the only viable exchange rate regimes, in allcircumstances, are a free float on the one hand and a currency board or a monetary union on the other.Nevertheless, one common characteristic of the main crises of the recent past – Mexico, Thailand,Indonesia, Korea, Russia, Brazil and, for that matter, my own country Sweden – has been that theauthorities had adopted a more or less rigid exchange rate regime that ultimately proved to beunsustainable. One clear lesson seems to be that, in many circumstances, once a weak peg comesunder fire, defending it is often a losing battle, especially if the exchange rate does not properly reflectthe development in the real economy. Another drawback to a fixed, but adjustable, peg is that it maystimulate excessive short-term capital inflow and thus in itself generate vulnerability because thecentral bank is seemingly absorbing the exchange rate risk. Against this background, a key question isthe appropriate exit strategy to another exchange rate regime or a timely adjustment of the peggedexchange rate should the need arise.An additional insight is that the simultaneous occurrence of foreign exchange rate crises and bankingcrises is probably the single most important reason why some countries have suffered much deeperrecessions when their currency pegs collapsed or came under a severe speculative attack. Thecontractionary shock to most European countries in 1992-93 was clearly much smaller than forSweden and Finland in the early 1990s and for Mexico in 1995 and Asian countries in 1997-98.
Thus, authorities in countries that receive capital inflows should prepare for the day when themovement might reverse. Countries that are vulnerable in this regard should carefully consider theadequacy of their foreign exchange reserves, particularly in relation to their short-term external debt.Since large numbers of countries cannot build up their reserves by increasing their trade surplusessimultaneously, this would seem to argue for greater use of contingent lending facilities provided bythe private sector. Given such arrangements, recourse to the new IMF Contingent Credit Lines wouldthen add public sector to private sector affirmation that the domestic policies being followed by theborrowing country are sensible and sustainable.… but the international dimension should also be recognisedTo say that the key to avoiding future crises in emerging markets must be found in domestic reforms isnot to deny that part of the solution may still lie in measures that change the way in whichinternational financial markets sometimes operate. While financial liberalisation and internationalfinancial integration bring unquestionable benefits, they can also be subject to episodes of excessiverisk-taking. In recent years, there does seem to have been imprudent lending, and not just to emergingmarket economies but also to borrowers within the industrial world.In part this has been spurred by competitive forces. That such forces will diminish as financialrestructuring accelerates seems unlikely. However, the potential of public safety nets to distortincentives and breed complacency can also be discerned and these structures should be re-evaluated. Itis important that all investors are held accountable for their decisions. The international communityshould also ensure that all investors and lenders play their part in the resolution of any future financialcrisis and, to this end, should implement, inter alia, changes to international bond covenants thatwould facilitate debt restructuring should this become necessary.The events of the past decade have made it clear that greater efforts are needed to strengthen thefunctioning of markets. Information asymmetries lie at the heart of market failure, and the market’sway of resolving them can give rise to unpredictable outcomes. Ensuring that markets have adequateinformation about national economies, the strength of financial systems, aggregate positions and thefinancial standing of counterparties is important. Equally, if not more, important is to ensure thatmarket participants’ approach to risk management reflects the full balance of costs and rewardsimplied in their decisions. Internal risk assessment procedures must recognise the interrelationshipsthat exist between categories of risk before, not when, markets are under strain.
Mr Hayami discusses the challenges for the Japanese economySpeech given by the Governor of the Bank of Japan, Mr Masaru Hayami, at the Kisaragi-kai meetingon 27 July 1999.*      *      *I.IntroductionIt is a great privilege to be invited to the Kisaragi-Kai meeting to make a speech in front of thisdistinguished audience.First, I will make use of this opportunity to discuss the current state of the Japanese economy. Then Iwill move on to the main theme – structural problems that have to be faced in revitalizing theeconomy. I hope that my view will give you some perspectives for the future.II.Recent Developments in the Economy and the OutlookLet me begin with the Bank of Japan’s view on the current state of the Japanese economy and theoutlook: Japan’s economy, at present, has stopped deteriorating, and corporate sentiment has improvedslightly, however, clear signs of a self-sustained recovery in private demand have not been observedyet. The following factors have combined to keep the Japanese economy from a further deterioration.First, active fiscal policy has been stimulating public investments as well as housing investments.Second, private firms have been reducing their inventories successfully helped to some extent by thedevelopment of final demand. Third, financial conditions are improving, as a result of the Bank ofJapan’s zero interest rate policy and the injection of public funds into major commercial banks. Thebuoyancy in the stock market since early spring and the improvements in corporate sector confidenceshown in the Tankan, are based on the increased anticipation of better business and financialconditions in the future, as well as the current improvements in final demand, output, and inventories.It is, however, uncertain at this stage whether the Japanese economy, is on the way to a self-sustainedrecovery as anticipated above. The reasons can be summarized as follows.To begin with, I will address two factors that will have a negative effect on the future of the economy.First, the stimulus effects of public investment will fade out eventually. Second, the corporaterestructuring efforts of individual firms will expose the macro economy to downside pressures. This isan example where what are rational strategies from the viewpoint of individual firms may haveundesirable effects on the economy as a whole. With corporate restructuring, workers faced with harshincome conditions, reduce consumption spending, while firms save the resulting cash or make debtrepayments, instead of reinvesting. This “paradox of thrift” may drive our economy into shrinkage.Of course, there are factors that will work positively on the economy. The point is, however, whetherthese factors are strong enough to outweigh the negative ones mentioned above.Let me discuss the positive factors in detail. First, corporate restructuring may bring about a recoveryin corporate profits – and may push up stock prices in anticipation of such a recovery. For the recentcorporate restructuring to have a positive effect, the profits recovery should boost firms’ spendingsufficiently to outweigh workers’ saving.The second positive factor is that the effects of the government’s various measures to ensure thestability of the financial system and the Bank of Japan’s monetary policy to ease financial conditionsare permeating throughout the economy, improving household and corporate sector confidencesomewhat. Furthermore, there is a possibility that this improved confidence will stimulate thespending attitude of consumers and firms. In fact, household consumption has held steady even amidthe harsh income conditions. However, corporate expenditure is still weak, as is obvious from the
Tankan survey on business fixed investment plans. While financial institutions are improving theirskill in risk management and striving for adequate lending margins, bank loans have not increasedwhile demand for fund raising remains weak.The third positive factor is a recovery in overseas economies, especially in Asia. Although China’seconomy is decelerating somewhat, Korea is now on a recovery trend. Thailand and the Philippines aswell as Malaysia and Singapore are bottoming out gradually. These developments will facilitateJapanese exports and production.The above arguments make obvious the following fact: if foreign economic factors are not considered,the recovery of the Japanese economy depends largely on when corporate behavior becomes active.The recent improvements in corporate sector confidence are good signs for the economy, but othereconomic indicators and fixed investment plans show no significant signs of economic recovery. Ourjudgment is that it is too early to say that the Japanese economy is on the way to a self-sustainedrecovery. Therefore, the downward pressure on prices will remain, although prices have been stablerecently.It is in view of such economic conditions as those described above that the Bank of Japan willmaintain the current monetary easing stance and continue to firmly support economic activities untildeflationary concerns subside.III.Contained Dynamism of the Japanese EconomyA caveat regarding fiscal and monetary policies is that they are effective in managing the economy inthe short run, but are not a panacea for all of the problems the Japanese economy faces.This last decade of the 20th century has seen the Japanese economy experience its lowest growth sincethe end of the Second World War. Despite several economic stimulus measures from both themonetary and fiscal side, the response of the economy has been generally slow and we have yet toconfirm any clear revival of economic dynamism led by private demand. Taking into account theweakness of private demand over the past ten years, it is perhaps natural to think that there might besomething “structural” which has contained economic dynamism. If this is the case, it is difficult toexpect a long-lasting recovery, if any, based solely on macroeconomic stimulus measures. Hence, torestore vitality to the Japanese economy in the medium term, painstaking efforts must be made toresolve each structural problem so as to enable the nation’s economic potential to fully blossom. Andsuch efforts are also necessary if both monetary and fiscal policy are to have their full effect.Since many structural problems stem from the supply side of the economy, resolving them requiresthat we send the appropriate signal and give the right incentives to the public. As evidenced byReaganomics in the U.S. and Thatcherism in the U.K., supply-side policies would most likely beaccompanied by various pains and require a long period until reforms take root among the public andbear real fruit. It is indeed for this reason that we need to reach an early consensus as to the nature ofthe structural problems in Japan and thus come up with the right prescriptions.Some say that structural problems encompass a variety of issues, not only economic ones but alsodemographic, educational, and environmental ones. But, today, I will focus on three economic issueswhich are interrelated and have a particularly strong impact on Japan’s macroeconomic performance:first, the delay in cleaning up the balance sheet of firms; second, changes in economic growthmechanisms under globalization; and third, the imbalance between savings and investment.IV.Delay in Cleaning Up the Balance Sheets of FirmsThe most immediate lingering structural problem is that we have not yet completed the disposal ofassets and liabilities that ballooned during the bubble period. In the wake of the bursting of the bubble,we first saw the collapse of firms which had expanded their liabilities based on aggressivemanagement plans, and then the accumulation of non-performing assets on the part of financialinstitutions. This, in turn, reduced the risk-taking ability of financial institutions by eroding their
capital position, resulting in impairing the smooth circulation of money in the economy. In addition, aloss of credibility in the financial system triggered by the collapse of some financial institutionsworried depositors and financial markets alike, and seems to have contributed to the economicdeterioration witnessed during 1997 and 1998 through a worsening of household and corporate sectorconfidence.The disposal of the non-performing assets of financial institutions has made considerable progress, atleast from the accounting viewpoint, thanks to efforts on the part of financial institutions as well ascapital injection into major banks using public funds. Needless to say, financial institutions must makefurther efforts, including the removal of non-performing assets from their balance sheets.It should be noted that balance sheet erosion is not limited to firms which have already gone bankruptand the financial institutions which extended loans to them. Although not on the verge of suspendingbusiness, not a few firms misjudged demand during the bubble period and made large fixedinvestments or launched new businesses which turned out to be totally unprofitable. These firms haveonly just been managing to repay the debt while suffering from worsening asset efficiency and a highdebt ratio. The often heard cases of “excess capacity” and “excess debt” have been partly attributed tothe business cycle, but fundamentally they should be interpreted in this context of the debt overhangfrom the bubble period.There is little doubt that the delay in cleaning up corporate balance sheets lies behind the slowrecovery of fixed investments despite extremely low interest rates. Indeed, there are cases wherefinancial institutions have been obliged to be cautious in extending additional loans to firms lagging inimproving their financial condition, even if they have new projects which are expected to beprofitable. It is pointed out that this is partly because financial technology is not well developed inseparating the risk related to a firm from that related to a project which the firm undertakes like inproject finance. It thus seems unlikely that the Japanese economy will regain dynamism without animprovement in the balance sheets of the corporate sector.V.The U.S. Experience – A Case of “Creative Destruction”Often asked questions include: “How can the corporate sector scrap unprofitable businesses andobsolete equipment?” “Once the corporate sector has downsized unprofitable sectors, how will it leadto revitalization of the whole economy?” To answer these questions, it is perhaps instructive to look atthe past 20 years’ experience of the U.S. The U.S. faced such problems as dwindling productivitygrowth during the 1970s and 1980s and balance sheet adjustment from the late 1980s to the early1990s. In solving these problems, the U.S. government, particularly since the Reagan administration,has played a supporting role by promoting deregulation which has led to intensified competition andindustrial revitalization. In the private sector, U.S. firms reviewed their production and managementprocesses, and made necessary strategic adjustments, which has been labeled “re-engineering”.Therefore, to look at developments in the U.S. is useful in considering not only the balance sheetproblem but also the kind of structural adjustment which is conducive to increasing productivity andrestoring economic dynamism to the Japanese economy.Economic recovery in the U.S. since March 1991 has often been labeled a “jobless recovery” becauseit was not initially accompanied by a significant increase in employment and private consumption.However, this gradually changed to a full-fledged recovery with an increase in both fixed investmentand employment, resulting in more than eight years of expansion until now. There are, admittedly,various views with respect to the future of the U.S. economy, but it deserves attention that theSchumpeterian process of “constructive destruction” has often been cited to have played an importantrole in its success to date.It should be noted that under such slogans as “re-engineering” and “strengthening core competence,”many U.S. firms have sold off or scrapped unprofitable sectors and concentrated managementresources on profitable ones while taking full advantage of information technology. Such efforts havebeen responsible for a rise in their stock prices and laid the ground for further expansion in businessareas where they had advantages via such methods as mergers and acquisitions. At the same time,
many new firms specializing in “high technology” have grown rapidly with the spread of the Internetagainst the backdrop of across-the-board large increases in investment in information technology toimprove management efficiency. In addition, it helped the economy that those who lost jobs due tocorporate downsizing were smoothly reallocated to such growth areas as software and other services,including medical and nursing care, in a highly mobile labor market.With all these factors combined, industrial structure in the U.S. has dramatically changed over the past10 years. The 50 years’ history of U.S. industry since the Second World War shows that thecompanies in major industries remained more or less the same during the 1950s and 1970s, includingthe “Big Three in the automobile industry,” and the big oil and steel companies. However, whencomparing the 1990s with the 1970s, a number of firms specializing in “high technology,” which werenot even established 20 years ago, are now listed among the major firms representing U.S. industry.This simple fact is deemed symbolic of the process of “creative destruction”.What about the situation in Japan? In the 1950s and the 1960s, the textile industry and heavyindustries such as steel and chemicals developed as leading industries. In the 1970s, the rise of theautomobile and electronics industries substantially changed the lineup of major firms. However, sincethe 1970s, there have been no substantial changes.I hasten to add that I am not saying that the Japanese economy cannot grow unless new firms arecreated. There is no doubt that many existing major firms are actively pursuing the development ofnew technology. Indeed, in this context, we can find examples of major firms in the U.S. which haveundergone a dramatic transformation from what they were 20 years ago. Having said this, recallingShumpeter’s belief that the function of an entrepreneur in the true sense is not so much to manage asto create a company, I cannot help but feel slightly disappointed that we have not yet seen the creationof many new companies which can lead the Japanese economy. A main driving force behind thebuoyant development of the U.S. economy has been revitalization through intensified competition,and, if I may add another factor, “a culture of risk taking”. In Japan, while existing firms shouldconcentrate their management resources on business areas where they have a comparative advantage,new industries or groups of new firms should emerge to create jobs, thereby achieving growthbalancing the old and new. What is important in the process is that capital stock such as equipmentand technology and management resources such as human resources be liquidated and reallocated tobe fully utilized in growing new business areas.VI. Changes in the Economic Growth Mechanism under GlobalizationThe second structural problem Japan has to face is that as globalization progresses and theshareholdings of foreign investors increase, Japanese corporate managers have come to pursue higherrates of return rather than expansion. At the same time, rates of return in those industries which hadbeen protected by regulations have been forced to decline. Together, these developments have putheavy adjustment pressure on the existing industrial structure.A.Management Pursuing Higher Rates of ReturnA recent survey by the Economic Planning Agency shows that Japanese corporate managers haveclearly changed to now emphasize higher rates of return. Since economic stagnation continues andhardly any increase in sales is expected, it is natural for corporate managers to pursue both higherreturn on assets (ROA) and higher return on equity (ROE). In addition, major Japanese firms used torely on unrealized gains on shares as a buffer for the unexpected, and were able to remain profitable onthe whole even if substantial losses were incurred in some areas. But, with the stagnant economy andsluggish stock prices, it became difficult to continue to depend on such unrealized gains, and this alsoseems to be partly responsible for the recent change in attitude of corporate managers who nowemphasize rates of return over the short term.
The data show that the ROA of Japanese firms was an average 7.8 percent during the 1980s, butdeclined to 5.1 percent in the 1990s.1 While this was partly due to the business cycle factor, it is truethat the profitability of Japanese firms has been on a declining trend.B.Changes in Economic Growth MechanismsOne factor behind the declining profitability of Japanese firms is that their balance sheets still carry ahuge amount of assets, either idle or underutilized, which is the negative legacy of the bubble period.A second factor is that since Japanese firms have long adopted a management style with an emphasison maintaining employment, labor’s relative share inevitably rose during the long recession, therebysqueezing capital’s relative share, which translates into declining profitability. And, a third factor isthat as the economy becomes more globalized, those Japanese industries, which had hitherto beenprotected by various measures such as regulations, are now forced to accept a declining rate of return,leading to the imminent need for large-scale adjustment of their industrial structure.Given the efforts made by firms, the first two factors may be mended over time. The third factor,however, seems to stem from the substantial and irreversible structural changes that the Japaneseeconomy is currently experiencing.Let me elucidate on this third factor. Looking at the Japanese economy from a long-term perspective,we observe the following pattern. There is no doubt that the automobile and electronics industries havebeen one of the engines supporting post-war economic development because of the rapid increase intheir productivity. By exposing themselves to international competition from an early stage, theseindustries have remained at the highest technological level globally and enjoyed high profitabilitythrough exports. Wages in these industries were raised in line with increased productivity. And, suchan increase in wages permeated to other domestic industries with lower productivity, therebyimproving the standard of living for the nation as a whole. If industries with low productivity try topay the same wage as those with high productivity, the prices of products and services in theseindustries inevitably have to be raised. The existence of various regulations and traditional businesspractices have contributed to making such price increases possible without much difficulty.As the economy became further globalized in the 1990s, the traditional pattern has undergone atremendous change. What triggered the change was that firms in leading industries have expandedproduction overseas and conducted operations on a global scale while paying close attention to thedifference in costs at home and abroad. As a result, Japanese workers who had enjoyed high wageswhen compared internationally have become exposed, directly or indirectly, to global competition. Inaddition, globalized firms which focus on cost performance have pressured their domesticsubcontractors and service providers to reduce their prices, thereby threatening the profitability ofdomestic industries which had not been operating in a competitive environment. Furthermore, with theincrease in travel overseas, Japanese consumers have become conscious of the difference betweendomestic prices and those abroad. These factors, combined with the progress of deregulation, havecreated a situation where domestic industries which used to be protected from competition find itincreasingly difficult to secure profits just by raising prices as they used to do. Thus, the traditionalgrowth mechanism whereby even low productivity industries could maintain a certain level ofprofitability has apparently become unsustainable.Since the trend toward globalization is irreversible, it seems that time alone will not resolve this thirdfactor responsible for declining profitability. Hence, it should be regarded as one of the most difficultstructural problems facing the Japanese economy. In the U.S., such factors as technological innovationin telecommunications and intensified competition stemming from deregulation are said to haveplayed an important role in improving productivity. Crucial for Japan’s economic future is how toraise the productivity of industries which have not operated in a competitive environment. The process1 Based on “Financial Statements Statistics of Corporations by Industry, Quarterly” compiled by the Ministryof Finance.
of “creative destruction” is deemed unavoidable to a certain extent. In this regard, we need to carefullymonitor what happens to employment in the process.VII.Savings and Investment Imbalance and Shortage of Risk CapitalAs may have become already clear, keys to restoring dynamism to the Japanese economy are thegrowth of new industries and firms as well as the simultaneous revitalization of investment. In thiscontext, one might well ask why a country with one of the highest per capita GDP figures in the worldand ample household savings totaling 1,300 trillion yen finds it difficult to revitalize domesticinvestment. This brings us to the third structural problem: the savings and investment imbalance.A.Decline in Capital ProductivityIt is rather ironic that as economic globalization progresses and cross-border capital movementsbecome free, Japan has become an increasingly uncomfortable place for capital to stay because of itshigh level of capital accumulation. With slow growth in the labor force, Japan has accumulated capitalthrough aggressive fixed investment since the high growth period, which substantially raised theamount of fixed assets per unit of labor. In fact, in the incessant pursuit of economic developmentsince the end of the Second World War, Japan has become a capital rich country, even more so thanthe U.S.We should be proud of the fact that, through such capital accumulation, Japan’s per capita GDP isamong the highest in the world. At the same time, we should be mindful of the fact that the amount offixed assets necessary to produce the same GDP has been increasing, that is, the productivity of capitalhas been declining. Declining productivity of capital means that the expected return has beendeclining, which is consistent with the downward trend of ROA. From an investor’s viewpoint, this isthe same as saying that capital is not efficiently employed in Japan, which might make investors bothat home and abroad hesitate to invest in Japanese companies. Hence, if Japan increases investmentsonly in existing areas to raise labor productivity, it will lead to a further deterioration in capitalefficiency. Therefore, Japanese firms are currently facing a difficult challenge to expeditiously disposeof the negative legacy from the bubble period while at the same time exploring new business areaswith high profitability and reallocating such resources as capital and labor to them.B.High Savings RatioThe imbalance between savings and investment is not a problem stemming exclusively from theinvestment side. The household savings ratio (on SNA basis) was more than 20 percent in themid-1970s, but declined to around 10 to 15 percent by the end of the 1980s. The future prediction atthat time was generally based on the following life-cycle hypothesis: When Japan becomes an agingsociety in the 1990s, older generations will reduce their savings and the household savings ratio willfurther decline, eventually resulting in the disappearance of Japan’s huge current account surplus.However, the reality is that the savings ratio stopped declining in the 1990s and the prediction at thattime has turned out to be wide of the mark.It does not seem plausible to argue that a high savings ratio, that is, lower consumption than otherwise,is entirely due to national traits of the Japanese who regard savings a virtue. For example, surveys bythe Prime Minister’s Office and the Bank of Japan suggest that many older people are concerned abouttheir future livelihood and that they have reduced expenditures because of rising uncertainty regardingthe pension and social welfare system. An increase in such uncertainty is also seen among youngergenerations. People, young and old alike, seem to have been cutting back on expenditures andincreasing savings in self-defense to prepare for future uncertainty.One could say that we are caught in a “double savings” situation: In an aging society with a decliningbirth rate, older generations are saving more from their pensions in preparation for future nursing careneeds, while younger generations are actively saving in fear of receiving less from their pensions inthe future. Thus, if the household sector considers it necessary to save more and domestic investments
are losing attractiveness, the economy will inevitably see an expansion of the fiscal deficit and currentaccount surplus.To avoid such a situation, it is important to give the public a clear image of the future framework ofthe pension system so as to reduce uncertainty as well as to establish a social framework for lookingafter the elderly. In view of the fact that caring for the aged can be a business opportunity in the U.S.and Europe, we should make good use of private sector vitality to create businesses in such areas associal welfare.C.Shortage of Risk CapitalIn addition to the high savings ratio, another marked characteristic of household savings behavior inJapan is the high proportion of savings held in low risk assets such as bank deposits and postalsavings. A comparison of the composition of household assets between Japan and the U.S. accordingto flow of funds accounts statistics shows that: cash and deposits comprise 55 percent of total assets inJapan, but only 11 percent in the U.S.; and, while the figure for stocks is 7 percent in Japan, it is43 percent in the U.S. These figures vividly highlight the difference in risk-taking attitude of thehousehold sector between Japan and the U.S. It seems that U.S. capital markets, which tend topromote venture businesses, are supported by such household behavior to no small extent. In Japan,despite the strong propensity for safe assets, it cannot be denied that how to make firms and financialproducts attractive for investment purposes will warrant study.I stated earlier that capital productivity in Japan is low and thus not attractive for either domestic orforeign investors. This refers only to the overall trend of the economy thus far. If we closely examineeach individual firm and project, there must potentially be many investment opportunities with anappropriate combination of risk and return. There should not be much difference between Japan andabroad in that even a small firm will be able to become a big success if it takes advantage oftechnological innovation in telecommunications and deregulation. In fact, we may detect some seedsof new business opportunities in the recent buoyancy of the stock market. To germinate such seeds, itis deemed necessary to encourage new entry to the market through deregulation which leads tointensified competition and the revitalization of industries, and to create a variety of financial productsthrough which the abundant savings of the household sector can be smoothly channeled as risk capitalto investments in new businesses.VIII.Concluding RemarksThe Japanese economy now stands at a crossroads as to whether it can move onto a self-sustainedrecovery path. Needless to say, a stable macroeconomic environment is important for the smoothprogress of structural adjustment. We are fully aware that monetary policy is expected to play animportant role under such circumstances. With these considerations in mind, we will maintain currentmonetary easing until deflationary worries subside.Having said this, the three structural problems discussed here are determined by supply-side factors,and cannot be dealt with only by demand stimulus measures from the monetary and fiscal side. Forexample, in addressing the corporate balance sheet problem, to what extent firms tackle the allocationof management resources will depend critically on the way corporate governance is beingimplemented. Regarding the changes in growth mechanisms under globalization, whether new firmsemerge to bring innovation to the productivity of existing domestic-oriented industries will depend onhow regulations and traditional transaction practices change and how the capital market functions. Asto the savings and investment imbalance and the provision of risk capital, much may depend on thefuture of pension, insurance, and taxation systems.Since these supply-side measures work on the incentives of firms and households, it thus often takestime for effects to materialize unlike measures working on the demand side.Even if it takes time, I am not pessimistic about the future of the Japanese economy. We should beproud of Japan’s high quality labor force, technology, and managerial ability which enabled the post-
war economic recovery. Such economic potential is still intact. I believe that dynamism will berestored to the Japanese economy if, with appropriate supply-side prescriptions, industries revitalizethemselves through the transformation of existing firms or the creation of new ones in a competitiveframework conducive to increasing risk-taking activity.In fact, the government has been examining various measures to tackle unemployment and industrialrevitalization. And, in the private sector, we can observe some signs of future changes such as theincrease in business affiliations and mergers and the review of business areas. By promoting structuralchange, the Japanese economy will undoubtedly exhibit the potential to transform itself into aneconomy with vitality and high productivity.In coming up with specific supply-side prescriptions, cooperation between the private sector and thegovernment is essential in discussing such problems as how to guide incentives for firms andhouseholds in a desirable direction and how to minimize moral hazard. I sincerely hope that myspeech today will contribute to discussion on the very important problem of structural reform.
1BIS Review 103/1999Mr Yam comments on Hong Kong: from crisis to recoverySpeech by the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Mr Joseph Yam, at the HKMALuncheon on the occasion of the opening of the HKMA Representative Office in London on28 September 1999.*   *   *It is a great pleasure to be speaking here in London again, and to do so at this large and expertgathering. Some of you may have been present at my last speaking engagement here, in June last yearat the 11th Dragon Boat Dinner, which now seems like a very, very long time ago. In that speech Idescribed Hong Kong, against the background of the financial turmoil in Asia, variedly as a pillar ofstability, the eye of the storm and the typhoon shelter of Asia. My message then was that Hong Kong,with prudent policies and robust financial structures, had been the last and the least to be affected bythe storm.Since that time, as you all know well, the tail of the storm has swept through Hong Kong and it has notbeen so gentle after all. The painful downward adjustment in the internal cost/price structure under afixed exchange rate system eventually and inevitably came. This was reflected in plummeting assetprices, declining GDP and rising unemployment. Although the fundamentals of the Hong Kongeconomy remained sound, these events provided an attractive environment for the launch ofspeculative attacks. And so during the summer of last year we received a severe buffeting from attacksagainst our currency and financial markets, threatening a financial meltdown. We fought off theseattacks in August 1998 with a dramatic and controversial operation in the stock and futures markets.We accumulated Hong Kong stocks to the value – at that time – of around US$ 15 billion. Since then,the value of that portfolio has increased to US$ 26 bn, a reflection of the greatly improved financialenvironment and, even for many of our critics, a vindication of our operation. I should stress thatmaking huge profits was not our primary purpose in this operation. But we are not complaining. The70% return so far represents a bonus to our reserves: too bad there are no bonuses for thoseresponsible for acquiring the portfolio. It has been a very productive investment for the people ofHong Kong. And we now have even more resources to safeguard the stability of our currency.But this large holding of Hong Kong stocks is arguably excessive, having regard to the traditional lackof involvement of Government in business, and to the potential conflict of interest in its dual role asregulator and shareholder. Towards the end of this presentation I shall briefly return to the question ofhow we intend to set about disposing of this portfolio. Before I do that, I should first like to update youon the state of our economy as the painful adjustment process draws to a close and as clear signs ofeconomic recovery emerge. I should also like to address some of the concerns – unnecessary ones, inmy view – that still seem to be clouding the view of Hong Kong from outside.The recoveryThose of you who heard me in June last year may well be a little sceptical about any advice from meon the outlook for the Hong Kong economy. Although I was under no illusion about the lessprosperous times that lay ahead, like many at the time I was perhaps a little too sanguine in myassessment about the impact that the Asian crisis would have on Hong Kong. However, the temptationnow for many is to go to the other extreme: to be very cautious in making predictions about the futureand to acknowledge signs of recovery only very reluctantly. This is understandable when we are stillonly just moving out of our sharpest recession on record. Yet even the pessimists would now, I think,acknowledge that the storm signals are down, the clouds are thinning out, and there are shafts ofsunlight in the distance. I speak only metaphorically, of course. As those of you who have been inHong Kong recently will know, this has been a very stormy summer from a meteorological point ofview: we have just had the worst typhoon in sixteen years and the wettest typhoon since records beganmore than a hundred years ago.

1BIS Review 102/1999Mr Duisenberg comments on the past and future of European integration:a central banker’s perspectiveThe 1999 Per Jacobsson Lecture by Mr Willem F Duisenberg, President of the European CentralBank, held in Washington DC on 26 September 1999.*      *      *1.IntroductionI feel honoured to have been invited to give this year’s prestigious Per Jacobsson lecture before such adistinguished audience. The euro was launched successfully almost nine months ago. This was ahistoric moment, with 11 countries voluntarily relinquishing sovereignty over monetary policy.Technically the changeover proceeded remarkably smoothly. Former national money markets wererapidly integrated, in no small measure due to the smooth functioning of TARGET, the new Europeanpayment system which, generally speaking, worked well from the outset. The euro is traded on allinternational financial markets. Moreover, the euro has been introduced in a climate of prevailing pricestability in the euro area. This is the result of a process of convergence in which there has been ageneral decrease in European inflation rates over recent years, from – in the case of some countries –significantly higher levels in previous years.The introduction of the euro is neither an isolated nor a purely economic event. It is another, yet veryimportant, step in the process of European integration. The process began more than half a centuryago. The creation of the euro is not the end of that process either. Today, I should like to briefly lookback, but mainly look ahead. My perspective is that of a central banker. The nature of this perspectivewill become clear in the course of my lecture.Dealing with European integration and with the new European single currency is particularlyappropriate in the context of this lecture series. Per Jacobsson has spent his professional careerpursuing sound money. This is the very same challenge that faces us: making the euro a sound – that isto say stable – currency.2.The history of European integrationLet me first deal briefly with the history of European integration. This process has been stronglydriven by political motives. The main underlying aim was to avoid a recurrence in the future of thewars which devastated 20th century Europe. To that end, central Europe’s largest country, Germany,should be firmly embedded in a European structure. As Thomas Mann has aptly put it: “a EuropeanGermany, rather than a German Europe”. Without a common European framework, tensions couldarise again between Germany and other countries, France in particular. European integration shouldserve the objective of creating a peaceful, stable and prosperous Europe. The unification of Germanyalmost a decade ago, and the removal of the iron curtain have placed Germany even further, as it were,in the heart of Europe. These fundamental changes make clear that the motives for Europeanintegration are no less valid today than 50 years ago.The main vehicle for European integration has been economic integration, via the coal and steelindustry, from establishing a customs union, the European Monetary System, to the Single Marketprogramme and the introduction of the euro. “Trade, do not fight” or perhaps better “Trade and youwill not fight” was the basic philosophy. Given this background, it is striking that economists all toooften assess the costs and benefits of European integration in purely economic terms and in a ratherstatic context. This is clearly too narrow an approach.Nonetheless, the economics of European integration are important. The political objectives can only bemet if economic integration is successful and placed on a sound economic footing. This is also wherethe role of the central banker comes in. He or she should not and does not decide on the steps to be
BIS Review 102/19992taken in the integration process. That is in the realm of politics and is also market-driven. The centralbanker advises and points out the conditions which have to be met for certain steps to be taken safely.The reverse is also true: the central banker and central banks are for their part influenced by theintegration process, and the greater the level of integration in the monetary field, the greater the impactupon them. The central bank and the central banker are operating in an environment, which is affectedby the ongoing integration process. This has to be taken into account. Moreover, the question arises asto whether a single monetary policy ultimately calls for further integration in other areas.In retrospect, it can be concluded that, thus far, the European integration process has, on balance, beensuccessful. In our part of Europe we have experienced peace since the process was initiated and wehave seen a continuous growth in earnings and wealth. The further process of gradual integration hasnow culminated in the emergence of a single currency.There is no room, however, for complacency. Looking back, let me also draw some more specificconclusions:1. The integration process has been marked by ups and downs, often in step with the course ofthe business cycle or in connection with major shocks, such as German unification. The roadhas been long and winding, sometimes bumpy.2. Long ago European integration reached the point of no return. There is no alternative but tocontinue down the path of integration. Economic integration has generated its owndynamics. It is no longer completely dependent on political initiatives to propel it forward.3. Overall, however, the political component of the European integration process is stillessential and should not be forgotten.4. Politicians should clarify the objectives of the European integration process, explaining themto European citizens and pointing out the steps envisaged in the years ahead. The role ofcentral bankers is to be critical, yet at the same time constructive. They should indicate theeconomic consequences and the risks of certain steps, stipulating under which conditionscertain steps can safely be taken. It is better to take a step later, but successfully, than to takeit prematurely and then fail and fall back further. Such a role will not always make thecentral banker popular. He or she will often be perceived as stepping firmly on the brakes.Nonetheless, I am convinced that it is the best service he or she can provide in furthering theprogress of the integration process. It may sound paradoxical, but by continuouslyemphasising the importance of fulfilling the convergence criteria, central bankers havecontributed to making possible the introduction of the euro. It has perhaps already beenforgotten by some, but this event was not considered very likely by many observers, evenclose to the date on which it actually happened.European integration is an ongoing process. It will continue. What does the future hold in store? Letme now turn to this issue.3.The future of European integration3.1IntroductionEuropean integration is a task of great magnitude, and will remain so in the next century. It offersmany opportunities. It faces many challenges. I would classify these challenges in three categories andlook at them from the perspective of the central banker:1. How to make the euro and Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) a success.2. How to cope with the accession of new countries to the EU and the euro area.3. How to develop the role of Europe, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Eurosystem(i.e. the ECB and the eleven national central banks of the EU Member States which haveadopted the euro) in the world.
3BIS Review 102/1999I shall now discuss these challenges in turn.3.2How to make the euro and EMU a successIn the first category, I would make a distinction between what central bankers can do or what is withintheir control, or what they can influence on the one hand, and what the outside world should do or islikely to do with an impact on the central bank world, on the other.3.2.1The role of central bankersThe most important task and challenge for the Eurosystem is to build up a track record of actual pricestability in the euro area. Action speaks louder than words. Showing in practice that we are capable ofproviding stable prices is what really counts. We have to ensure that European citizens are confidentthat the euro is a currency, which can sustain its value over time, and that the ECB is an institutionwhich they can trust. The ECB should be perceived as an institution that says what it does and doeswhat it says.The ECB and the Eurosystem should develop into truly European institutions. They should alwaystake their decisions and conduct their analyses from a euro area-wide perspective. Although somegood progress has been made in this regard, there is still room for further improvement. Additionalefforts will also be required in finalising the process of setting up and consolidating the ECB and theEurosystem. For instance, the ECB began life with a staff of around 400 persons, which in themeantime has grown to more than 700. It is likely to grow further in the years ahead, but it has to berecognised that there are limits to the pace at which the organisation can be expanded. It is fair to saythat at the moment the ECB is capable of fulfilling its tasks, but that the pressure of work in manyareas is still simply too high. As will become clear later in this lecture, some new tasks will have to betaken up in the years ahead, while others need to be enhanced. While expanding, it has to be ensuredthat the ECB remains an efficient organisation. What is more, the role of the ECB, as the central bankrepresenting the second largest economic area of the world with a population of 300 million people,has to be shaped and elaborated further. Setting up the ECB is a fascinating process. It is like theEuropean integration process itself, but on a micro scale and under very great pressure of time. Insome respects, the process of establishing and consolidating the ECB and the Eurosystem could serveas an example for the European integration process in a wider sense.The Eurosystem will have to explain time and again what monetary policy can and cannot do. Ourmandate of maintaining price stability in the euro area in the medium term has to be emphasisedcontinuously. Our medium-term orientation should be underlined. It is not in the power of a centralbank to deliver price stability on a short-term basis. We cannot and should not respond to every twistand turn in economic data. The Eurosystem’s stance is not an “activist” one.The more successful we are at maintaining price stability, the more important it may become tocommunicate the benefits of price stability. The memories of periods of high inflation with itsdamaging consequences may fade. It cannot be taken for granted that the reason for the independenceof the ECB is widely known. Having such knowledge widely distributed is crucial for the maintenanceof price stability in the longer term. No central bank, however independent on paper, can maintainprice stability in the longer term in practice if not supported in the execution of its mandate and in itsindependence by a large part of the population. This is certainly the case for a new and young centralbank which has the task of conducting monetary policy for an area consisting of eleven differentcountries, with populations from different cultural, economic and historical backgrounds.The euro is not and cannot be a cure for all European problems. The introduction of the euro will notin itself solve the unemployment problem. Monetary policy is neither the cause nor the solution of theunemployment problem. Structural reforms are needed to attack it. Fortunately, this insight is gainingbroader support. The challenge now is to translate it into sustained action. Carrying out structuralreforms is politically difficult, since they may be painful in the short term and only bear fruit over alonger time scale. However, it is encouraging to note that those countries which have implementedstructural reforms have indeed been more effective in coping with the unemployment problem.
BIS Review 102/19994I shall continue to focus on the unemployment problem. Unemployment is a waste of resources, leaveshuman potential unused, is a source of frustration and ultimately undermines the stability of oursocieties. In a narrower vein, the existence of a high level of unemployment may also hamper theconduct of monetary policy. It can all too easily lead to calls for an expansionary monetary policy as asolution to a problem which monetary policy cannot solve. The central bank could become thescapegoat for failure to take action in areas where action on the part of others is what is in factrequired. Making markets more adaptable is also necessary for making EMU work. Only flexiblemarkets will be able to cope with the asymmetric shocks which can sometimes affect any monetaryunion. The policies needed to make EMU work are, at the same time, essential to reducingunemployment. A single currency does not call for uniform wage developments or uniform economicor social policies in general. On the contrary – where national or regional economic developments aredifferent, this should be reflected in different policy responses and wage developments. Moreover,different reactions to similar problems make it possible to learn from each other.The existence of a single currency and 11 fiscal authorities is a unique phenomenon. This can onlywork if the Member States strictly apply the Stability and Growth Pact, which calls for the reductionof government deficits to close to balance or to create a surplus in the medium term. In this way, roomis created for letting the automatic stabilisers work in response to both asymmetric and symmetricshocks. Such a fiscal policy is required not only for EMU. It has its own merits. The ageing of thepopulation calls for such a policy line independently of EMU. The need for fiscal consolidation is notjust the result of creating the euro, but would be a key element in any sound fiscal policy in the euroarea. It remains to be seen whether the Stability and Growth Pact goes far enough in compensating forthe absence of one fiscal authority in the European Union. We should be ready to learn fromexperience and adapt our institutional framework if and when the need arises. This applies, of course,in a more general sense. EMU has been well prepared, but actually playing the game is alwaysdifferent from preparing the game plan, important as this may be. A good game plan is necessary, butnot sufficient to win the game. While it is as yet unknown whether the Stability and Growth Pact willbe the last word on fiscal policies in the euro area, it is certain that a failure to adhere strictly to thePact would be a recipe for all manner of problems.The Eurosystem has adopted a monetary policy strategy which is tailored to the unique conditions ofintroducing a new currency. Our two-pillar strategy, with its emphasis on monetary developments anda broadly based outlook for price stability, takes into account that economic behaviour may change asa result of the introduction of the euro itself. In other words, it takes into account that the start of EMUconstitutes a structural break. This already indicates that after some time our experience withconducting monetary policy within this framework will have to be carefully evaluated. Over time ourstrategy may evolve, perhaps in the direction of greater emphasis on one of the pillars. However, thishas to be a cautious process, since one of the main functions of a monetary policy strategy is toprovide a tool for clearly communicating monetary policy preparation and decisions. Thus, you cannotchange your monetary policy strategy as you would change suits. Continuity must be a feature of anymonetary policy strategy.Although the primary task of the ECB and the Eurosystem is to conduct monetary policy, there arealso other tasks. It is only natural that up to now we have very much focused on our primary task, andthere is thus ample scope for further reflection upon and implementation of these other tasks. In thiscontext I am referring to the task and role of the ECB in maintaining financial stability. All moderncentral banks are active in this area. They are involved in legislative processes relating to the financialsector and play a role in designing the market structure, in surveying the financial markets and inmonitoring key players in the financial sector. The ECB is already involved in the first two areas. Ithas an advisory role in respect of legislation concerning the financial sector. With regard to the marketstructure, an active role is being played in the context of payment and securities settlement systems.The other two roles could be developed further in the years to come.The European financial markets, especially those for longer-term instruments, are not yet fullyintegrated. There is not, as yet, a completely single market for financial services. Pan-European banksare not yet a dominant feature of the European financial landscape. However, the situation is clearlydynamic. The introduction of the euro did not trigger this process, but is certainly giving it a boost.
5BIS Review 102/1999Mergers and restructuring are taking place, albeit on an as yet predominantly national level. However,this may, and probably will, change. The European Commission is taking many initiatives to furtherenhance the single market for financial services. These initiatives are highly welcome. Financial sectorissues will tend, more and more, to become European issues. It is hard to predict the pace of thisprocess, but its direction is clear. This conclusion underlines the importance of the ECB’s furtherstrengthening its ability to deal with matters relating to financial stability. Banking supervision is anational responsibility, although intensive international cooperation does exist, inter alia – though notexclusively – at a European level. Given the current European financial landscape, the decentralisedstructure of banking supervision in Europe can be defended. However, in the years to come thequestion of whether the adequacy of this framework is undermined by developments in the financialsector will have to be closely monitored and analysed. It is reassuring that the Treaty on EuropeanUnion contains a provision which enables the Council of Ministers to further enhance the role of theECB in the field of banking supervision.In the relatively near future the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins will be on the agenda.This is another important step in the process of introducing the euro, albeit not so much for economicreasons. The decisive step was of course taken this year through the irrevocable fixing of exchangerates, but it is the step to be taken in early 2002 which will make the euro visible and the significancethereof should not be underestimated. The introduction of the banknotes and coins will offer a furtheropportunity for informing European citizens about the euro and EMU in general.Open communication with many parties – from the economics professor to the members of theEuropean Parliament and ordinary European citizens – is high on the agenda of the ECB and theEurosystem. Our wish is to be open, transparent and, as far as possible, predictable. This is basicallythe case for three reasons. First, a central bank which is understood will be more effective. Second, ina democratic society the other side of the coin of central bank independence is that the central bankshould be accountable for its actions in fulfilling its mandate. Third, a clear framework for externalcommunication will structure and discipline internal debates. Our aim is to be predictable but let memake one thing quite clear: ultimately, it is achieving our objective of price stability which is ofoverriding importance. In other words – although we will try to avoid such a situation – we shall notrefrain from surprising the markets by taking an unexpected measure if we firmly believe that this isnecessary. It has to be kept in mind that monetary policy is different from mechanics: it alwaysinvolves judgement. If that were not the case, a good personal computer would be a better centralbanker than an ordinary human being.An important starting-point for our communication policy is that the Governing Council of the ECB isa collegiate body where decisions are taken from a euro area-wide perspective. What we wish tocommunicate are the decisions of that body, not those of individuals. This does not rule out alsopresenting the arguments for and against a certain decision. That is what we do in substance. Everymonth the Vice-President and I hold a press conference immediately after the meeting of theGoverning Council. In an introductory statement I explain our decisions and on what basis we havetaken them. This is followed by a question and answer session with a large number of journalists. Boththe introductory statement and the questions and answers are published on our Website, almostwithout delay. I believe this arrangement is both a unique and – from our perspective – demandingone. In addition, we publish a Monthly Bulletin in all 11 official languages of the European Union. Wepublish an Annual Report and there are many speeches, interviews and publications. At quarterlyintervals I appear at a hearing before the European Parliament. Nobody should doubt our intention tobe open and transparent. Unfortunately, the debate on this issue has often focused on our practice ofnot publishing the minutes of Governing Council meetings. In substance my introductory statementsare not so different from what other central banks would call minutes. And they are publishedimmediately. As to the substance of what we publish, two issues remain. First, we do not reveal votingrecords for several reasons. As I said, the Governing Council is a collegiate body. What is relevant arethe final decisions of that body and the underlying arguments, not the individual positions. Publishingindividual positions can easily distract from what is really important. What is of paramountimportance in the European context is that members of the Governing Council do not represent aparticular country or their national central bank and that decisions should always be based on euro
BIS Review 102/19996area-wide considerations. This is a new principle and everything should be done to ensure that it isadhered to. Publishing voting records could easily lead to placing monetary policy debates in anational context and even to putting pressure on individual Council members.The second issue is that, for the time being, we do not publish our economic forecasts, including ourinflation forecast. Again we have several reasons for not yet doing so. It is crucial that our monetarypolicy strategy be well understood. Publishing inflation forecasts could easily be interpreted as theECB following a strategy of direct inflation targeting. This is not the case. Inflation forecasts have noexclusive role in our monetary policy discussions and decisions. They are among many otherindicators which we analyse in the context of the second pillar of our strategy. Publishing inflationforecasts could make them become self-fulfilling prophecies. This may hamper monetary policy whereforecast inflation is incompatible with maintaining price stability. Finally, due to the structural breakwhich the introduction of the euro constitutes, some time will be required to obtain estimates whichare sufficiently reliable for publication. At the same time, I would acknowledge that, if presentedclearly within the context of our strategy, forecasts may also enhance our transparency. Thus weshould indeed consider publishing forecasts at some point in the future.In our external communications we aim to speak with one voice. The collegiate character of theGoverning Council underpins this principle and facilitates the process of ensuring that monetarypolicy decisions are transparent. This is not always easy and here we are clearly in a learning phase.This is the case on a more general level too. Communication is more an art than a science. We willcertainly try to learn from experience. Verbal discipline and transparency are not contradictions: theyshould be two sides of the same coin. We aim to be predictable. This will be easier if we can predicthow the media will interpret and publish our communications. This is not yet always the case.Communication should not be a one-way street. The ECB must also take note of and be sensitive to itsenvironment in order to be effective in its own policies. Let me therefore now turn to the issue of ourwider environment.3.2.2The environmentMonetary policy cannot be conducted in isolation. The ECB cannot operate on an island. It needs astrong European foundation. This is an issue which touches upon much more than just the frameworkfor monetary policy or even for EMU. In the longer term having a single currency means thatultimately we are sitting in the same boat. It is inevitable that sometimes the single monetary policywill not be perfectly tailored to a certain region or even to a certain country. This is the case in allmonetary unions. Optimal currency areas do exist in textbooks, but not in practice. Thus, for amonetary union to be viable, the absence of perfectly tailored policies will have to be accepted. Thismay sometimes require a feeling of belonging together – social cohesion if you like. I believe this maybe even more fundamental than the discussion on the establishment of political union, which is often apoorly defined concept. Increasing political integration and creating or changing joint politicalinstitutions may help to foster social cohesion but, like the ECB, these institutions cannot operate in avacuum. They also require a certain amount of social cohesion. Moving solely on the political frontmay not be enough and it may not be the first or even most important thing to be accomplished.Fostering this process of enhancing social cohesion is not a simple task. It is not something which canor should be imposed from above, but it can, to a certain extent, be guided. It is a process which mustbe both evolutionary and spontaneous. Its pace cannot be forced. This would be counterproductive. Inthe end it is a matter of clarifying and further developing elements of a common European culture.This implies articulating and emphasising the many things which Europeans already have in common,but also building up more common experiences. Such experiences can serve to cement intra-Europeanrelations. Having a single currency will automatically contribute to this process, not only because ofthe common banknotes and coins, but also because it will mean dealing with identical issues in allEuropean countries. There are many other areas in addition to politics and economics where this canbe done, such as the sciences, the arts, the press, television and so on. We should try to develop debateon European issues at a European level. I attach great importance to explaining our monetary policiesat the hearings in the European Parliament. Monetary policy is conducted from a European perspectiveand should therefore primarily be explained at a European level. More attention should be paid to
7BIS Review 102/1999European issues. The objectives of European integration should be explained more often and moreclearly.The fear that Europe is something abstract, remote and threatening to local culture should be takenseriously. However, I do not believe that there necessarily has to be a contradiction betweenpreserving local culture and at the same time further developing a common European culture. On thecontrary, they can complement and enrich one another. It is necessary and inevitable that an increasingnumber of issues be decided at a European level. Quite apart from issues relating to the euro, otherissues such as those relating to the environment, crime, defence and migration can no longer beconsidered to be purely national issues. In deciding on what should and should not be discussed on aEuropean level, the principle of subsidiarity should continue to play a guiding role. What can bedecided at a lower level should be decided at a lower level.I do not close my eyes to the existence of substantial obstacles to further integration in this broadsense. Perhaps the fact that the European Union has 11 official languages is the most important one. Ina sense it also poses a dilemma in our communications policy. On the one hand, it is very important toreach all European citizens in their own language; on the other, should we not encourage a situation inwhich as many Europeans as possible also speak one common language? Could our education systemsnot make this happen? This cannot, of course, be accomplished overnight, but should we not at leasttry to make the issue less sensitive than it still is?History is in some respects another barrier. There is no alternative but to recognise this and work toovercome it. I believe this lies at the heart of the European integration process. European integrationhas been, is and will continue to be, a step-by-step process. It will certainly suffer setbacks at times,but on balance it is contributing to peace, stability and prosperity.What often strikes me is the negative, gloomy attitude of many Europeans towards Europeanintegration. This project deserves a different attitude. We should see Europe as an opportunity, apositive challenge, rather than as a threat or a cost. European integration is a unique and fascinatingprocess and I wish that this were more strongly reflected in the attitude of many towards it. We alsoneed the energy which is born of such an attitude to deal with the challenge posed by the accession ofnew countries to the European Union and the euro area. Let me now turn to that issue and deal with itfrom the perspective of the ECB.3.3Coping with the accession of new countries to the EU and the euro areaFour countries of the European Union have not yet adopted the euro. They may well join in themedium term. A greater challenge is the potential accession of still more countries to the EuropeanUnion and ultimately the euro area. Negotiations are currently being conducted with six countries.Negotiations with another six candidates may start soon. The so-called Copenhagen criteria must befulfilled for EU membership. They read as follows:• stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect forand protection of minorities (political criteria);• the existence of a functioning market economy as well as the capacity to cope withcompetitive pressure and market forces within the European Union (economic criteria); and• the ability to take on the obligations of membership including adherence to the aims ofpolitical, economic and monetary union (acquis communautaire criteria).Accession is a political decision, but it is clear that the entry of new members into the EU will haveconsequences for the ECB and the Eurosystem. The three steps of accession to the EU, becoming amember of the exchange rate system ERM II and adopting the euro should be seen as a continuum.This autumn, EMU issues will be on the agenda for negotiations. It is only natural that the Eurosystemwill become more involved in this process in the future both in its advisory role and because of theimplications for its own tasks and objectives. The Eurosystem should be involved in the accessionprocess and in other forms of cooperation with the applicant countries on all issues falling within itsexclusive or shared areas of competence: monetary policy, exchange rate policy, payment systems,
BIS Review 102/19998financial stability and the impact of enlargement on the Eurosystem itself. Currently we are in theprocess of defining our position. Let me briefly outline some preliminary observations.The Eurosystem needs to have an open and positive attitude towards the prospect of the accession ofnew EU Member States, as well as their subsequent participation in ERM II and adoption of the euro.The Eurosystem should be prepared to advise these countries in pursuing appropriate structuralreforms and stability-oriented policies in line with accession and convergence criteria. The Eurosystemshould stand ready to provide technical assistance to accession countries. The accession processimplies a significant body of preparatory work on the part of the central banks of the applicantcountries. This work may be facilitated by external technical assistance.Equal treatment should be a key feature of the accession process. Objective and uniform criteriashould apply both to accession, and to participation in ERM II and adoption of the euro. These criteria,related to each step of the process, should be implemented in a strict and effective manner, in order toprovide the countries concerned with the external constraints necessary to bring their economies inline with the respective standards and the final goal of EMU, while also avoiding any discrimination.Against the background of different starting-points and degrees of economic transition, and thedifficulty of ascertaining the lead time for further headway towards real and nominal convergence, aplurality of approaches should be feasible without compromising equality of treatment. This mayapply, in particular, to the timing of EU accession, ERM II membership, monetary policies (includingexchange rate strategies) before EU accession and the development of sound financial marketinfrastructures.In accordance with the Treaty establishing the European Community, the Eurosystem will alwaysfocus on the maintenance of price stability in the euro area. Hence, our involvement in the accessionprocess, including technical assistance, and any arrangement or other forms of cooperation withaccession countries must be without prejudice to the Eurosystem’s independence and its primaryobjective. The process for ultimately adopting the euro is clearly stipulated in the Treaty. Theconvergence criteria play an important role in this respect.Institutional adjustments of the Eurosystem required by enlargement should preserve the efficientfunctioning of the Eurosystem and its ability to maintain price stability in an enlarged euro area. In thecase of previous enlargements, the entry of new Member States often brought about so-called“arithmetical adjustments” to the composition of the EU institutions, which entered into force with theratification of the Accession Agreements. However, an enlargement by as many as 12 new countriesmay require more substantial adjustments. This is one of the reasons why a new IntergovernmentalConference will be convened on enlargement-related issues by the end of this year. In this regard, asprovided for in the Treaty on European Union, the Eurosystem would stand ready to take part in anyinitiative taken by the competent EU institutions on issues falling within its competence. Suchinstitutional adjustments should be without prejudice to the fundamental features of the Statute of theESCB, namely the Eurosystem’s mandate and its independence.Let me now turn to the role of Europe, the ECB and the Eurosystem in the world economy.3.4The role for Europe, the ECB and the Eurosystem in the world economyThe euro is the currency of an economic area with a population of nearly 300 million people andone-sixth of the world’s gross domestic product. Both numbers will increase as new countries enterMonetary Union. After the US dollar, but ahead of the Japanese yen, the euro is the second mostwidely used currency on a world-wide scale. Given these facts, it is stating the obvious to say that theeuro and the Eurosystem are bound to play an important role in the world economy.With regard to the international role of the euro, the Eurosystem has adopted a neutral stance. We shallneither hinder nor actively promote this role, but leave its development to market forces. To put itanother way, there is and shall be no policy of challenging the position of the dollar, nor that of anyother currency. Of course, to the extent that the Eurosystem is successful in maintaining price stabilityit will almost at the same time automatically foster the euro’s international role. The euro already hasan important international role. This role is likely to grow over time. The pace of this process cannot
9BIS Review 102/1999be precisely predicted. If history is any guide, it may well be a rather gradual process, although Iwould not rule out that this time it may well evolve faster than history would suggest.The monetary policy strategy of the Eurosystem clearly rules out any implicit or explicit targets ortarget zones against third currencies, such as the US dollar and the Japanese yen, without the consentof the Eurosystem itself. The pursuit of an exchange rate target could easily compromise theachievement of price stability and thereby also have a negative impact on real economicdevelopments. The fact that we do not have an exchange rate target does not imply that we areindifferent to exchange rate developments or that we will neglect them. On the contrary, the effectiveexchange rate of the euro is monitored as a potentially important indicator for monetary policy.The ECB and the Eurosystem stand ready to contribute to the international exchange of informationand views on economic policy issues. In fact we already play our role in many international fora andmeetings, such as the G7, the G10, the OECD, the BIS and the IMF. The ECB has obtained observerstatus at the IMF and is to become a shareholder of the BIS. The best contribution the Eurosystem canmake to international stability is to maintain price stability in the euro area. Attempts at internationalpolicy coordination beyond the scope that I have just indicated could easily becomecounterproductive, compromising both the Eurosystem’s mandate and international financial stabilityitself. The Eurosystem’s role on the international scene will tend to expand and develop over time, instep with its growing experience and the gradual evolution of the ECB’s organisation. In the context ofinternational cooperation, the Eurosystem and the ECB will also play an increasing role in providingtechnical assistance in their fields of competence.Since the number of parties in the international arena should fall as a result of the establishment ofEMU and the Eurosystem, cooperation at an international level should potentially become easier thanin the past. However, arriving at this situation may take some time. From a more general point ofview, Europe should aim at becoming a stronger partner in international cooperation and, as far aspossible, at speaking with one voice. Such an ideal cannot be realised overnight, but every effortpossible should be made to move in this direction.A stronger, more integrated and coherent Europe is in the interests of the world at large. To be able toplay this role on the international scene, Europe should keep an eye on the rest of the world and, inspite of the many challenges it will face internally in the years and even decades ahead, should avoidadopting an exclusively introspective stance.I come to a conclusion.4.ConclusionI have discussed three areas in which Europe will have to be active in the immediate and longer-termfuture. They concern the euro area, the wider Europe and Europe in the world. Each of these areasalready offers enough challenges in itself. The fact that progress has to be made in all three areassimultaneously makes Europe’s agenda for the next century even more exciting.Europe has the potential to meet these challenges, if it is clear about its objectives and, as in the past,is flexible in its way of achieving them. If Europe is successful, the lives of its citizens will beimproved, and it will be a stable and stabilising factor in the world. Success will not comeautomatically. It will require substantial efforts and the will of many people and institutions in manyareas. However, these efforts, if successful, will be amply rewarded.
1BIS Review 101/1999Mr Greenspan draws lessons from the global crises of 1997 and 1998Remarks by Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem, before the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund, Program of Seminars,Washington, D.C., on 27 September 1999.*      *      *With the benefit of hindsight, we have been endeavoring for nearly two years to distill the criticallessons from the global crises of 1997 and 1998. From what seemed at the time to be isolated andcontained disruptions in Thailand and Indonesia, economic turmoil deepened and spread, ultimatelyengulfing the emerging-market economies of East Asia and other parts of the globe and then thefinancial markets of industrial countries.The failure of normal adjustment processes to contain the financial turmoil made this crisis longer anddeeper than any of us had expected in its early days. One possible clue to this breach may reside not inthe events leading up to the East Asian crisis in the spring of 1997, but rather in the extraordinaryepisode of financial market seizure that afflicted some emerging-market and industrial-countrymarkets, particularly in the United States, a year ago.Following the Russian default of August 1998, public capital markets in the United States virtuallyseized up. For a time not even investment-grade bond issuers could find reasonable takers. WhileFederal Reserve easing shortly thereafter doubtless was a factor, it is not credible that this move wasthe whole explanation of the dramatic restoration of most, though not all, markets in a matter ofweeks. The seizure appeared too deep seated to be readily unwound solely by a cumulative 75 basispoint ease in overnight rates. Arguably, at least as relevant was the existence of backup financialinstitutions, especially commercial banks, that replaced the intermediation function of the publiccapital markets.As public debt issuance fell, commercial bank lending accelerated, effectively filling in some of thefunding gap. Even though bankers also moved significantly to risk aversion, previously committedlines of credit, in conjunction with Federal Reserve ease, were an adequate backstop to businessfinancing.With the process of credit creation able to continue, the impact on the real economy of the capitalmarket turmoil was blunted. Firms were able to sustain production, business and consumer confidencewere not threatened, and a vicious circle – an initial disruption in financial markets leading to lossesand bankruptcies among their borrowers and thus further erosion in the financial sector – never gotestablished.What we perceived in the United States in 1998 may be an important general principle: multiplealternatives to transform an economy’s savings into capital investment offer a set of backup facilitiesshould the primary form of intermediation fail. In 1998 in the United States, banking replaced thecapital markets. Far more often it has been the other way around, as it was most recently in the UnitedStates a decade ago.Highly leveraged institutions, such as banks, are, by their nature, periodically subject to seizing up asdifficulties in funding leverage inevitably arise. The classic problem of bank risk management is toachieve an always elusive degree of leverage that creates an adequate return on equity withoutthreatening default.The success rate has never approached 100%, except where banks are credibly guaranteed, usually bytheir governments, in the currency of their liabilities. But even that exception is by no means ironclad,especially when that currency is foreign.When American banks seized up in 1990, as a consequence of a collapse in the value of real estatecollateral, the capital markets, largely unaffected by the decline in values, were able to substitute for
BIS Review 101/19992the loss of bank financial intermediation. Interestingly, the then recently developed mortgage-backedsecurities market kept residential mortgage credit flowing, which in prior years would have contractedsharply. Arguably, without the capital market backing, the mild recession of 1991 could have been farmore severe.Similarly Sweden, like the United States, has a corporate sector with a variety of non-banking fundingsources. Bank loans in Sweden in the early 1990s were concentrated in the real estate sector, and whenreal estate prices also collapsed there, a massive government bailout of the banking sector wasinitiated. The Swedish corporate sector, however, rebounded relatively quickly. Its diversity in fundingsources may have played an important role in this speedy recovery, although the rapidity and vigorwith which Swedish authorities addressed the banking sector’s problems undoubtedly was acontributing factor.The speed with which the Swedish financial system overcame the crisis offers a stark contrast with thelong-lasting problems of Japan, whose financial system is the archetype of virtually bank-onlyfinancial intermediation. The keiretsu conglomerate system, as you know, centers on a “main bank,”leaving corporations especially dependent on banks for credit. Thus, one consequence of Japan’sbanking crisis has been a protracted credit crunch. Some Japanese corporations did go to the marketsto pick up the slack. Domestic corporate bonds outstanding have more than doubled over the decadewhile total bank loans have been almost flat. Nonetheless, banks are such a dominant source offunding in Japan that this non-bank lending increase has not been sufficient to avert a credit crunch.The Japanese government has intervened in the economy and is injecting funds in order to recapitalizethe banking system. While it has made some important efforts, it has yet to make significant progressin diversifying the financial system – which arguably could be a key element, although not the onlyone, in promoting long-term recovery. Japan’s banking crisis is also ultimately likely to be much moreexpensive to resolve than the American and Swedish crises, again providing prima facie evidence thatfinancial diversity helps limit the effect of economic shocks.This leads one to wonder how severe East Asia’s problems would have been during the past eighteenmonths had those economies not relied so heavily on banks as their means of financial intermediation.One can readily understand that the purchase of unhedged short-term dollar liabilities to be invested inThai baht domestic loans (counting on the dollar exchange rate to hold) would at some point trigger ahalt in lending by Thailand’s banks. But why did the economy need to collapse with it? Had afunctioning capital market existed, the outcome might well have been far more benign.Before the crisis broke, there was little reason to question the three decades of phenomenally solidEast Asian economic growth, largely financed through the banking system, so long as the rapidlyexpanding economies and bank credit kept the ratio of non-performing loans to total bank assets low.The failure to have backup forms of intermediation was of little consequence. The lack of a spare tyreis of no concern if you do not get a flat.East Asia had no spare tyres. The United States did in 1990 and again in 1998. Banks, being highlyleveraged institutions, have, throughout their history, periodically fallen into crisis. Where there wasno backup, they pulled their economies down with them. One can wonder whether in nineteenthcentury United States, when banks were also virtually the sole intermediary, the numerous bankingcrises would have periodically disabled our economy as they did, had alternate means ofintermediation been available.In dire circumstances, modern central banks have provided liquidity, but fear is not always assuagedby cash. Even with increased liquidity, banks do not lend in unstable periods. The Japanese bankingsystem today is an example: the Bank of Japan has created massive liquidity, yet bank lending hasresponded little.With very large non-performing loans of indeterminate value, the size of capital in Japanese banks isdifficult to judge. The periodic eruption of the so-called Japanese funding premium in recent yearsattests to the broad degree of uncertainty of the viability of individual banks. This understandablycreates considerable caution on the part of Japanese bank loan officers in committing scarce bank
3BIS Review 101/1999capital. But unlike the United States and Sweden a decade ago, alternate sources of finance are not yetreadily available.The Swedish case, in contrast to America’s savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and Japan’s currentbanking crisis, also illustrates another factor that often comes into play with banking sector problems:speedy resolution is good, whereas delay can significantly increase the fiscal and economic costs of acrisis. Resolving a banking-sector crisis often involves government outlays because of implicit orexplicit government safety net guarantees for banks. Accordingly, the political difficulty in raisingtaxpayer funds has often encouraged governments to procrastinate and delay resolution, as we sawduring our savings and loan crisis. Delay, of course, can add to the fiscal costs and prolong a creditcrunch.The annals of the United States and others over the past several decades tell us that alternatives withinan economy for the process of financial intermediation can protect that economy when one of thosefinancial sectors experiences a shock. But the mere existence of a diversified financial system maywell insulate all aspects of a financial system from breakdown. Australia serves as an interesting testcase in the most recent Asian financial turmoil. Despite its close trade and financial ties to Asia, theAustralian economy exhibited few signs of contagion from contiguous economies, arguably becauseAustralia already had well-developed capital markets as well as a sturdy banking system. But goingfurther, it is plausible that the dividends of financial diversity extend to more normal times as well.It is not surprising that banking systems emerge as the first financial intermediary in marketeconomies as economic integration intensifies. Banks can marshal scarce information about thecreditworthiness of the borrower to guide decisions about the allocation of capital. The addition ofdistinct capital markets outside of banking systems is possible only if scarce real resources are devotedto building a financial infrastructure. It is a laborious process whose payoff is often experienced onlydecades later. It is thus difficult to initiate, especially in emerging economies that are struggling toedge above the poverty level. They perceive the need to concentrate on high short-term rates of returnto capital rather than accept more moderate returns stretched over a longer horizon. We mustcontinuously remind ourselves that financial infrastructure comprises a broad set of institutions whosefunctioning, like all else in a society, must be consistent with the underlying value system and henceits time preference.On the surface, financial infrastructure appears to be a strictly technical concern. It includesaccounting standards that accurately portray the condition of the firm, legal systems that reliablyprovide for the protection of property and the enforcement of contracts, and bankruptcy provisions thatlend assurance in advance as to how claims will be resolved in the inevitable result that some businessdecisions prove to be mistakes. Such an infrastructure in turn promotes transparency within enterprisesand corporate governance procedures that will facilitate the trading of claims on businesses in openmarkets using standardized instruments rather than idiosyncratic bank loans. But the development ofsuch institutions is almost invariably molded by the culture of a society. The antipathy to the “loss offace” in Asia makes it difficult to institute, for example, the bankruptcy procedures of western nations.And even the latter differ from one another owing to deep-seated differences in views ofcreditor-debtor relationships. Arguably the notion of property rights in today’s Russia is subliminallybiased by a Soviet education that inculcated a highly negative view of individual property ownership.Corporate governance that defines the distribution of power, of course, invariably reflects the mostprofoundly held societal views of the appropriate interaction of parties in business transactions.It is thus not a simple matter to append financial infrastructure to an economy developed without it.Accordingly, full convergence across countries of domestic financial infrastructure or even of theinternational components of financial infrastructure is a very difficult task.Nonetheless, the competitive pressures toward convergence will be a formidable force in the future if,as I suspect, additional forms of financial intermediation will be increasingly seen as benefiting aneconomy that develops capital markets. Moreover, a broader financial infrastructure will also likely be
BIS Review 101/19994seen as strengthening the environment for the banking system and enhancing its performance. Theresult almost surely will be a more robust and more efficient process of capital allocation, as a recentstudy by Ross Levine and Sara Zervos suggests.1Its analysis reinforces the conclusion that financial market development improves economicperformance, over and above the benefits offered by banking sector development alone. The resultsare consistent with the idea that financial markets and banks provide useful, but different, bundles offinancial services.It is no coincidence that the lack of adequate accounting practices, bankruptcy provisions, andcorporate governance have been mentioned as elements in several of the recent crises that so disruptedsome emerging-market countries. Had these elements been present, along with the capital markets theywould have supported, the consequences of the initial shocks of early 1997 may well have been quitedifferent.It is noteworthy that the financial systems of most continental European countries escaped much of theturmoil of the past two years. And looking back over recent decades, we find fewer examples incontinental Europe of banking crises sparked by real estate booms and busts or episodes of creditcrunch of the sort I have mentioned in the United States and Japan.Until recently, the financial sectors of continental Europe were dominated by universal banks, andcapital markets are still less well developed there than in the United States or the United Kingdom.The experiences of these universal banking systems may suggest that it is possible for somebank-based systems, when adequately supervised and grounded in a strong legal and regulatoryframework, to function robustly.But these banking systems have also had substantial participation of publicly owned banks. Theseinstitutions rarely exhibit the dynamism and innovation that many private banks have employed fortheir, and their economies’, prosperity. Government participation often distorts the allocation ofcapital to its most productive uses and undermines the reliability of price signals. But at times whenmarket adjustment processes might have proved inadequate to prevent a banking crisis, such agovernment presence in the banking system can provide implicit guarantees of resources to keep creditflowing, even if its direction is suboptimal.In Germany, for example, publicly controlled banking groups account for nearly 40% of the assets ofall banks taken together. Elsewhere in Europe, the numbers are less but still sizable. In short, there issome evidence to suggest that insurance against destabilizing credit crises has been purchased with aless efficient utilization of capital. It is perhaps noteworthy that this realization has helped engender adownsizing of public ownership of commercial banks in Europe, coupled with rapid development ofheretofore modest capital markets, changes which appear to be moving continental Europe’s financialsystem closer to the structure evident in Britain and the United States.Diverse capital markets, aside from acting as backup to the credit process in times of stress, competewith a banking system to lower financing costs for all borrowers in more normal circumstances. Overthe decades, capital markets and banking systems have interacted to create, develop, and promote newinstruments that improved the efficiency of capital creation and risk bearing in our economies.Products for the most part have arisen within the banking system, where they evolved from beingspecialized instruments for one borrower to having more standardized characteristics.At the point that standardization became sufficient, the product migrated to open capital markets,where trading expanded to a wider class of borrowers, tapping the savings of larger groups. Moneymarket mutual funds, futures contracts, junk bonds, and asset-backed securities are all examples of thisprocess at work.1Ross Levine and Sara Zervos, “Stock Markets, Banks, and Economic Growth,” American Economic Review, vol. 88(June 1998), pp. 537-558.
5BIS Review 101/1999Once capital markets and traded instruments came into existence, they offered banks new options forhedging their idiosyncratic risks and shifted their business from holding to originating loans. Banktrading, in turn, helped these markets to grow. The technology-driven innovations of recent years havefacilitated the expansion of this process to a global scale. Positions taken by international investorswithin one country are now being hedged in the capital markets of another: so-called proxy hedging.But developments of the past two years have provided abundant evidence that where a domesticfinancial system is not sufficiently robust, the consequences for a real economy of participating in thisnew, complex global system can be most unwelcome.Improving deficiencies in domestic banking systems in emerging markets will help to limit the toll ofthe next financial disturbance on their real economies. But if, as I presume, diversity within thefinancial sector provides insurance against a financial problem turning into economy-wide distress,then steps to foster the development of capital markets in those economies should also have anespecial urgency. And the difficult ground work for building the necessary financial infrastructure –improved accounting standards, bankruptcy procedures, legal frameworks and disclosure – will paydividends of their own.The rapidly developing international financial system has clearly intensified competitive forces thathave enhanced standards of living throughout most of the world. It is important that we developdomestic financial structures that facilitate and protect our international financial and trading systemsthat, aside from their periodic setbacks, have brought so much good.
1BIS Review 100/1999Mr Thiessen gives an update on the Canadian economyand on the state of Year 2000 readiness in the Canadian financial sectorSpeech by Mr Gordon Thiessen, Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the Chamber of CommerceRegina, Saskatchewan on 23 September 1999.*      *      *It is always a pleasure to return and speak to people in my home province. This time, we are here for ameeting of the Bank of Canada’s Board of Directors. Once a year, our Board meets outside Ottawa, ina different part of the country. This year, we are delighted to be in Regina.Today, I would like to give you an update on the Canadian economy – its recent performance and itsprospects. I would also like to brief you on the state of Year 2000 readiness in the Canadian financialsector.The recent performance of the Canadian economyHere in Saskatchewan, you know only too well that the last couple of years have been difficult for theCanadian economy, especially for producers of primary commodities. But there is reason for optimismas we look ahead. To fully appreciate why, we need to understand the international shocks that havebuffeted our economy since mid-1997 and how we have dealt with them.The global financial crisis, which started in Southeast Asia in mid-1997 and spread to other countriesduring 1998, led to a sharp decline in the world prices of primary commodities. By this time last year,the average price (in US dollars) of key commodities produced in Canada had fallen by about 20%over the course of the previous 18 months.And when Russia declared a standstill on the servicing of its debt in August 1998, the effects were feltfar and wide. Conditions tightened in financial markets everywhere. Many highly rated corporateborrowers in the industrial countries were faced with a reduction in the availability of credit and withhigher borrowing costs – the same conditions that faced governments from emerging-marketeconomies.Nevertheless, the Canadian economy has fared surprisingly well over the past year. Of course, wehave not experienced booming conditions. Indeed, some of our primary sectors, such as farming,continue to struggle with low prices. Grain prices, in particular, have been plagued by ample globalsupplies and weak demand. But, on the whole, the economy has performed well. I expect that whenthe numbers for the third quarter of this year are out, they will show that output has grown by about4% since the third quarter of 1998. This compares with growth of only 2½% over the same period theyear before.To be sure, the economic impact of the Asian crisis on Canada has been moderated by the strength ofthe US economy and by the prompt response of major central banks, particularly the US FederalReserve, to the global financial difficulties. And the efforts made by emerging-market economies inAsia to deal with their problems have helped to gradually repair confidence and improve worldeconomic conditions.Although these positive developments are certainly important, it is also true that we have coped betterwith this crisis than in the past because our economy is now operating from a firmer base than it hasfor some time. This reflects a number of fundamental improvements in our economic structure. Iwould highlight three in particular:• first, our low-inflation record and the Bank of Canada’s commitment to keeping inflationlow;
BIS Review 100/19992• second, the virtual elimination of government deficits and the beginning of a downwardtrend in the high level of public debt to the size of our economy (as measured by the ratio ofpublic debt to GDP);• third, the major restructuring of Canadian businesses during the 1990s in response tostronger global competition and to technological change.It has not, of course, all been smooth sailing. You will recall that throughout the summer of 1998 ourcurrency kept losing ground in reaction to the sharp fall in commodity prices, which was made worseby the fallout from events in Russia. And with signs of a potential loss of confidence in Canadiandollar assets, the Bank of Canada moved to raise short-term interest rates significantly in August 1998.But once we got through that period of unusual global turmoil, we were able to reverse that increaserather quickly. Consequently, Canadian interest rates for all maturities fell back to levels below thosein the United States, consistent with Canada’s lower inflation rate.The downward movement in the Canadian dollar, besides softening the impact on our resource sector,encouraged a rather prompt increase in exports of manufactured goods. This helped to compensate forthe reduction in receipts from commodity exports. With this shift of economic activity out of theresource sector and into manufacturing, conditions in the labour market did not deteriorate as onemight have expected. In fact, the unemployment rate has continued to decline over the past 12 months– from 8.3% to its current level of 7.8%. And despite the loss of jobs in the resource sector, close to350,000 net new jobs have been created across the economy over this period.The three factors I mentioned earlier – low inflation, reduced budget deficits and debts, and businessrestructuring – have provided a sound base for the Canadian economy during this turbulent time. Theyhave also helped smooth the process of exchange rate and economic adjustment that I have beendescribing.Because of our good inflation record in recent years, achieved through the Bank’s commitment toinflation targets, inflation remained subdued, even as our currency was falling and causing prices ofimported goods to rise. Low inflation and a much improved fiscal position have helped to keep interestrates down. At the same time, because of restructuring, many more Canadian firms have been in astrong position to take advantage of the low Canadian dollar and increase their sales abroad. Lowinterest rates have also made it easier for businesses to finance investments so that they can expandproduction capacity and increase their foreign sales.The outlook for the Canadian economyThe fundamental improvements in our economic foundation and the way that Canada has coped withthese recent external financial difficulties give us good reason to be optimistic about the future.The export sector has been an important source of strength for the Canadian economy for some timenow. Recently, the stimulus from spending by Canadian households and businesses has also beengrowing. Indeed, with the waning of last autumn’s global strains, consumers have regained theconfidence to go out and buy a new car, a house, or furnishings. And businesses have revived theirplans for investment in machinery and equipment (including continued buoyant spending on computerupgrades, partly related to Year 2000 readiness). With improved confidence, relatively low interestrates, and gains in employment, these trends should continue.Clearly, conditions outside Canada remain crucial to our economic outlook. In Europe, prospects forstronger growth now look better than they did a few months back. Even for the troubled Japaneseeconomy, next year should be brighter. Forecasts for a number of emerging-market economies,particularly in Asia, have also been revised up. And with these improved global prospects, the pricesof a number of our key commodities – especially energy, base metals, and minerals – have risen.Of course, for Canada the external influence that matters the most is the US economy. That economyhas turned in an amazing performance in the past seven years – robust output growth, lowunemployment, and low inflation. But with US consumers and businesses continuing to spend
3BIS Review 100/1999strongly, and labour markets tightening further, some signs of cost pressures have emerged recently.This has rekindled concerns about a pickup of inflation down the road. And it has prompted the USFederal Reserve to reverse part of last autumn’s easing, by raising interest rates twice this summer, inan effort to return the economy to a more sustainable, non-inflationary pace.The Fed’s success in preventing the US economy from overheating and bringing it down to a “softlanding” is critical for the world economy and especially for Canada. The worst case for us wouldhave been for the Fed to have delayed action and risked another inflationary boom. Not only wouldthis require more drastic tightening by the Fed down the road, but it could well lead to a recession –another episode of boom and bust.The Bank of Canada did not follow the two interest rate increases made by the Fed this summer.While there is no reason that changes in US interest rates should automatically trigger similarmovements here, neither is it the case that such developments are irrelevant for us. Canada is closelyintegrated into the world economy and international financial markets. Developments in the UnitedStates, the world’s largest economy, will always have a major global impact. When it comes toCanada, the central bank must carefully assess the economic and financial circumstances in the UnitedStates that are behind any move by the Fed and their likely implications for our economy. Sometimesthis will mean that the Bank of Canada will respond to a Fed move and sometimes it won’t.The interest rate actions taken by the Fed this summer improve the odds of continued, non-inflationaryeconomic expansion in the United States. This is good news for all concerned. But it also means thatwe cannot count on the US economy to provide the same strong stimulus for Canadian exports in thefuture as it has in the recent past. Thus, the improved outlook for Europe and the firmer markets forprimary commodities are particularly welcome developments for Canada. These external factors,along with the relatively low domestic interest rates and improved employment conditions that Imentioned, bode well for sustained economic expansion in Canada. Altogether, our economy shouldcontinue to grow at a healthy pace and take up slack in production capacity.Core inflation is expected to stay low over the next year, in the bottom half of the Bank’s 1% to 3%target range. But as the economy begins to produce at full capacity, monetary policy will have to bemindful of the potential for price pressures.However, there is a lot of uncertainty and imprecision in our estimates of the economy’s capacity toproduce. For example, we do not know to what extent large investments in new technology and inmachinery and equipment during the 1990s may have raised production capacity. Consequently, theBank will be putting more emphasis on, and carefully watching, a range of indicators to assess thedegree of pressure on capacity and on inflation. The interpretation of developments on this front willbe an important challenge for monetary policy in the period ahead, one that will require a great deal ofcareful analysis.The Year 2000 changeover in the financial sectorWith the end of the millennium approaching, any review of near-term economic developments wouldbe incomplete without a word on the efforts by financial sector participants and public sector agencies,including the Bank of Canada, to deal with the implications of the Year 2000 date change.As part of its commitment to Canadians, the Bank seeks to promote the safety and soundness of ourfinancial system. With this in mind, we have for some time now been working closely with variousCanadian and international organizations to minimize any effects on our financial sector as we headinto the year 2000.Today, I can tell you that the Canadian financial sector has done its homework. It has been passing itsYear 2000 tests. And contingency plans have been made. So, at the dawn of the new year, the Bankexpects that it will be “business as usual,” but we will also be ready if anything unusual happens.Efforts to identify and fix potential Year 2000 problems in the Canadian financial sector started early.And they have been exhaustive, with expenditures in the billions of dollars.
BIS Review 100/19994Operators of systems shared by the financial sector have made the necessary changes and fully testedthem. For example, last June, the Canadian Payments Association and its members participated in aGlobal Payments Systems test to verify the ability of financial institutions around the world to sendand receive international payments. Domestic clearing and settlement systems have also been tested,as have all systems used by the markets for transactions involving Canadian debt and other securities.They are ready to operate in a Year 2000 environment.At the same time, virtually all individual financial institutions have completed and tested changes totheir critical systems, including those that support automated banking machines, credit and debit cards,and telephone banking. And major Canadian deposit-taking institutions have guaranteed the safety oftheir clients’ accounts and records from any Year 2000 computer-related disruptions. The Bank ofCanada has given the same guarantee for Canada Savings Bonds records.Of course, the Bank of Canada’s own critical computer systems have also been reviewed, upgraded asnecessary, and tested. And they are Year 2000 ready.An important issue for the financial sector is the state of preparedness of providers of infrastructureservices (e.g. electricity, telecommunications). These, too, are reporting that they are Year 2000 ready.With all the effort, time, and resources devoted to the task, it is not surprising that a number ofknowledgeable Year 2000 commentators have singled out the Canadian financial sector, especially thebanking sector, as one of the world leaders in Year 2000 preparedness. That is a strong vote ofconfidence, which should help reassure Canadians.Still, we cannot afford to be complacent and relax our efforts. Computer systems will continue to bemonitored and retested right up to the end of the year. There is also a need for ongoing clear,responsible communication to keep the public well-informed and confident in a smooth Year 2000transition. At the same time, increasing attention is rightly being paid to contingency plans.In this connection, the Bank of Canada has recently announced a number of arrangements to providean additional measure of confidence to financial institutions and the general public. We are putting inplace a special line of credit to assure these institutions and the users of financial services that if thereis any unusual demand for liquidity around the turn of the year, it will be met. And the Bank isprepared to accept a wider-than-normal range of collateral to support any liquidity loans it provides.We have also made arrangements to counter any unusual pressures on money market interest ratesduring this period.All this should be enough to reassure the vast majority of Canadians that the safest place to keep theirmoney is with their financial institutions. In fact, they should prepare for the century-changeoverweekend much as they would for any other long weekend.Nevertheless, there will be some who still feel that they need to take further precautions. Those whoprefer a little extra reassurance in the form of additional cash can rest easy – it will be readilyavailable. The Bank has increased considerably its inventory of bank notes. And it has been workingwith financial institutions to ensure that the system can meet an increase in demand for cash acrossCanada. But let me reiterate that there is no reason for Canadians to feel that cash is the only way theycan pay for goods and services over the New Year’s weekend.Overall, the Bank of Canada and other financial sector participants have every confidence thatCanadians can plan on it being “business as usual” in the financial sector heading into the year 2000.
1BIS Review 99/1999Mr Duisenberg focuses on maintaining price stability in the euro areaSpeech by Mr Willem Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, at the Swiss BankingCongress in Zurich on 10 September 1999.*      *      *Ladies and gentlemen,I was only too pleased to accept your invitation to this place of price stability between Lake Constanceand the Dufourspitze, to report to you on the first experiences with the euro. No other country inEurope can rival the success of Switzerland in combating inflation, and this is something of which youcan be very proud.With the introduction of the single currency in Europe, European integration has scaled new heights.Since the beginning of this year, the Governing Council of the ECB has been responsible for thestability of the euro. Monetary Union means that for the whole of the euro area there is only one singlemonetary policy. The aim of this policy is to achieve price stability in the euro area as a whole. Thismeans that there can no longer be a monetary policy designed to meet the needs of individual MemberStates. Therefore, it will be more important than ever for individual Member States to push ondeterminedly with fiscal consolidation and to carry out structural reforms with the aim of enhancingthe flexibility of the commodity and employment markets and improving the incentives for thecreation and taking-up of employment.The Governing Council of the ECB determines the single monetary policy centrally. The GoverningCouncil consists of the Executive Board of the ECB and the governors of the central banks in the euroarea. Monetary policy decisions are implemented by the Eurosystem, which comprises the ECB andthe national central banks of the 11 participating EU Member States. The national central banks are,above all, entrusted with the decentralised implementation of the single monetary policy and therelevant activities in their countries.First, I should like to say that the launch and the first few months of the common currency have, in ourview, gone well. The initial experiences with the euro and the single monetary policy have proved tobe both positive and encouraging. We have currently achieved price stability and the prospects lookgood for this to remain the case in the years to come.The Governing Council of the ECB has become a truly supranational body. The members of theGoverning Council clearly see themselves as committed to this joint cause. They take the whole euroarea into consideration when discussing and taking decisions on monetary policy.The efforts made prior to and at the time of the changeover weekend at the beginning of this year arealready part of history. Since the beginning of this year the euro has been quoted on the internationalfinancial markets and used for cashless payments. Although the euro will only become available in thetangible form of banknotes and coins in over two years’ time, there is already a feeling that the euro isaccepted by the majority of the population and that the benefits of the euro are appreciated. The euro,as you in Switzerland are particularly well placed to observe, is playing an increasingly important rolenot only within the euro area, but also beyond it.Monetary policy with a view to price stabilityEuropean Economic and Monetary Union is a great opportunity to achieve the objective of sustainedand widespread price stability in Europe. Monetary stability is the best contribution that monetarypolicy can make to lasting economic and employment growth. Stable prices promote the efficientallocation of scarce resources and also help to guide expectations.
BIS Review 99/19992For these sound reasons, the Treaty establishing the European Community specifies the maintenanceof price stability as the primary objective of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) andtherefore of the Eurosystem.The Governing Council of the ECB does its utmost to fulfil this function. In this respect, it endeavoursto communicate its monetary policy to the public in a comprehensible manner. In particular, theGoverning Council of the ECB has published a quantitative definition of its primary objective of pricestability. This helps provide economic agents with clear guidance on expectations of future pricedevelopments. The publication of this definition also provides the public and the European Parliamentwith clear criteria for assessing the success of the single monetary policy, thereby rendering theEurosystem and its policy both transparent and accountable.The Eurosystem defines price stability as a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index ofConsumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2% to be maintained over the medium term. Thewording “below 2%” clearly delineates the upper boundary for the measured rate of inflation that isconsistent with price stability. At the same time, in this context, the use of the word “increase” impliesthat deflation – i.e. a prolonged decline in the price level – is not consistent with price stability.The price stability objective must be achieved both in the medium term and the long term. On the onehand, this objective has been set in order to take into account the variable and somewhat unpredictabletime lags affecting monetary policy. On the other, it is a reflection of the possible emergence ofshort-term volatility in prices resulting from non-monetary shocks that cannot be controlled bymonetary policy.Stability-oriented monetary policy strategy of the EurosystemThe monetary policy strategy of the Eurosystem is geared towards price stability within the euro areaand can basically be described as a two-pillar strategy.The first pillar assigns a prominent role to money as defined by the broad monetary aggregate M3.There is wide consensus that medium-term inflation is actually a monetary phenomenon. Therefore,the money supply provides a natural “nominal anchor” for a monetary policy aiming at thesafeguarding of price stability. To emphasise the prominent role assigned to money, the GoverningCouncil of the ECB has announced a quantitative reference value for monetary growth in terms of thebroad definition of M3.The second pillar of the monetary policy strategy is founded on a broadly based assessment of theoutlook for price developments in the euro area as a whole. This assessment is made using a widerange of indicators. In particular, those variables which may provide information on future pricedevelopments are thoroughly analysed. These analyses should not only provide information on therisks for price developments but should also help to determine the cause of unexpected changes inimportant economic variables.In view of this policy stance and the published definition of price stability, the monetary policystrategy of the Eurosystem bears some resemblance to that of the Swiss National Bank. Allow me toquote the President of the Swiss National Bank who outlined the strategy of the Swiss National Bankas follows: “We try to meet the price stability objective by following developments in the monetaryaggregates, but also, at the same time, taking into account other indicators.” [See the paper by HansMeyer entitled “Zur Geldpolitik im neuen Jahr”, from the seminar held on 21 January 1999 at theUniversity of St. Gallen.]However, the motives for developing these respective strategies were different. Whilst in Switzerlanddisturbances affecting, in particular, the demand for central bank money “for reasons still unknown”have increased in recent years, the ECB faces additional uncertainties at the beginning of MonetaryUnion in terms of the effects of the shift of regime to a single monetary policy in Europe. It is difficultto assess whether conventional and reliable macroeconomic relationships are changing as a result ofthe introduction of the euro. In view of these uncertainties, but also in general, it is unwise to rely on afew indicators or only one when making monetary policy decisions. Indeed, to date our studies have
3BIS Review 99/1999revealed that the M3 monetary aggregate shows clear signs of stability and healthy indicatorproperties. This provides a sound basis for the prominent role given to the M3 monetary aggregate.Monetary policy instruments and the operational framework of the EurosystemThe operational framework of the Eurosystem has proved to be an effective instrument for steeringmoney market interest rates and for limiting fluctuations. The Eurosystem controls money marketinterest rates by means of either the provision or withdrawal of liquidity in the banking system. Openmarket operations play an important role in the context of monetary policy strategy. The weekly mainrefinancing operations give an indication of the Eurosystem’s monetary policy and provide the largestshare of liquidity. Longer-term refinancing operations provide the banking system with longer-termliquidity (three months). The system of (interest-bearing) minimum reserves has contributed towardssmoothing out daily liquidity fluctuations in the money market, whilst the “standing facilities”effectively limit fluctuations in the money market interest rate.The efficiency of this set of instruments can be demonstrated by the fact that the Eurosystem has beenable to manage to date without having recourse to any fine-tuning operations in the money market. Infact, developments in short-term money market interest rates have thus far been exceptionally stableand money market rates have been relatively close to the interest rates at which the ECB has providedliquidity through its weekly main refinancing operations. This is a notable success, as is the extremelyrapid integration of the money markets in the euro area, in which, since January, temporary interestrate differentials have been rapidly eliminated during the day through arbitrage by active marketparticipants.Initial monetary policy decisionsConditions at the start of the introduction of the euro were favourable, given a rate of inflation ofbelow 2% (measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices) and moderate monetary growthrates in the two years leading up to the beginning of Monetary Union. However, the outlook in theeuro area became increasingly gloomy in the second half of 1998 as a result of the crises in Asia andin Russia, thereby causing inflationary pressure to weaken further. The central banks of theparticipating countries reacted by reducing short-term interest rates. This caused the average interestrate level in those countries of the future euro area to be lowered considerably before the beginning ofMonetary Union.The close cooperation which had always existed between the European central banks was increasinglystepped up in the final months of 1998 between those countries participating in Stage Three ofMonetary Union. The coordinated reduction of central bank rates in December 1998 to 3% made itperfectly clear that, de facto, Monetary Union had already begun before the start of Stage Three.Looking at economic developments, in the first few months of this year there have been an increasingnumber of indications that the negative effects of the crises in Asia and Russia on growth andemployment in the euro area could be more serious than was first expected. With the apparentslowdown in economic growth in the euro area, the risks that the 2% threshold for the tolerable rate ofinflation would be exceeded in the foreseeable future evaporated. This forecast was also reflected inthe revisions to the inflation forecasts of international organisations.At the beginning of April 1999, the Governing Council of the ECB therefore decided to reduce theinterest rates on the main refinancing operations by 50 basis points to 2.5%, as well as the rates on thestanding facilities to 1.5% and 3.5% respectively. The M3 monetary aggregate did expand such that itwas slightly above the reference value at the beginning of 1999. However, it was not clear, at thatpoint in time, whether this sharp increase at the beginning of the year was a one-off effect inconnection with the launch of the single currency and thus quickly fall again. In view of theseuncertainties, the Governing Council of the ECB saw nothing in the development of M3 in the springof this year to prevent it from reducing the interest rates.
BIS Review 99/19994Current assessment of the monetary, financial and economic situationPlease allow me to explain briefly how the Governing Council of the ECB currently views themonetary, financial and economic situation in the euro area.Since the beginning of the year, the annual inflation rate for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Priceshas stood at around 1% in the euro area as a whole, i.e. within our definition of price stability. Whilstthe rate of price increases in food products has been falling since the beginning of the year, energyprices have increased strongly as result of the sharp increase in oil prices over the last few months.Overall the upward pressure turned out to be moderate, and perhaps more moderate than expected,which is a reflection of the increased competition in the service sector and the success of deregulationin some markets. However, since production costs could also increase in time as a result of theincrease in energy prices, the increase in oil prices contributes to certain risks to price stability.However, this should not lead to sustained higher inflation rates, as long as the unions do not use thehigher energy prices as grounds to demand additional wage increases.The monetary aggregate M3 rose in July by 5.6% compared with 5.3% in June. The money supplyfigures have recently been revised upwards and we still need to examine the factors responsible forthese revisions carefully. Measured by the moving average over the last three months, i.e. May, June,and July, M3 growth has moved further away from the reference value of 4.5% announced by theGoverning Council of the ECB at the beginning of this year to 5.4%. This increase is largelyattributable to the low opportunity costs of holding money. However, the gradual improvement in theeconomic outlook has probably also played a role. Similarly, the development in lending to the privatesector is not restrictive at present. Annualised growth rates of just over 10% do not, in any case,indicate that the conditions for lending are currently unfavourable.As previously explained, the money supply development of M3 plays a prominent role in our strategy.However, short-term fluctuations in the money supply should be viewed cautiously, not least becauseof the uncertainties associated with the brief existence of Monetary Union and the recent statisticalrevisions to the money supply figures. However, the most recent figures suggest increased growth.At the same time, the prospects for an economic recovery in Europe starting this year and continuinginto next year have clearly improved in the meantime. In addition to encouraging trends in the globaleconomy, the stabilisation of output growth in the euro area has contributed significantly to this.However, the most recent industry and consumer surveys also give positive indications with regard toeconomic activity in the euro area. Therefore, it is likely that economic activity will accelerate in thesecond half of 1999 and the year 2000.When assessing the risks for price stability, the ECB does also monitor the external value of the euro.The weakening of the effective exchange rate of the euro, which remained at around 8% between thestart of the year and early September, lent itself to an increase in import prices denominated in euro.Taking into account all available information, the outlook for the preservation of price stabilityremains favourable. However, recently inflationary risks have increased slightly. In the comingmonths it will therefore be necessary to monitor developments in the monetary aggregates and creditaggregates. In addition, the short-term effects of the increase in oil prices and exchange ratedevelopments on consumer prices need to be taken into account. The latter factors should not affectthe outlook for price stability as long as wage increases remain moderate. The wage round for the year2000 will, however, play an important role in future price developments.On the basis of this current assessment of the monetary, financial and economic situation, theGoverning Council of the ECB left the central bank interest rates unchanged at yesterday’s meeting.Economic policy arena: fiscal policy and the employment marketsThe success of Monetary Union and the future of Europe will also depend on fiscal and structuralpolicies in the Member States significantly improving the structural conditions for further economicdevelopment and, in particular, employment developments. As is evident from the waning
5BIS Review 99/1999consolidation efforts following the beginning of Monetary Union and the continuing high level ofunemployment, in general, the initial experiences in this area were rather disappointing.Most Member States are currently still very far from meeting the medium-term requirement for abalanced budget laid down in the Stability and Growth Pact. The measures currently planned are, forthe most part, insufficient to achieve a sustained reduction in the long-term structural deficits. Thisproblem is becoming particularly obvious given the current low interest rates in the euro area, whichhave, in themselves, tended to increase the scope for fiscal consolidation. In view of the relativelypositive economic outlook for the euro area, fiscal policy should be taking advantage of thisopportunity to make cuts in expenditure in order to achieve a more sound fiscal policy in the mediumterm.The high level of unemployment in Europe is primarily of a structural nature, which is evident when acomparison is made with the United States. Whilst in the United States, over the last twenty years,unemployment has declined significantly during the economic cycles as a result of a successfuldeflationary and stability policy introduced by the Federal Reserve, unemployment in Europe hasincreased further in the same period. Since the beginning of the year, the rate of unemployment hasstabilised at around 10% in the euro area. Those Member States with more flexible employmentmarkets and more restrained wage bargaining generally have much higher levels of employment thanthe average in the EU.It is still hoped that the current upturn will not be slowed down by excessive demands for higherwages and will be used to make decisive structural policy reforms. Flexibility in the employment andcommodity markets would therefore appear to be urgently needed.As you know, at the summit in Cologne the European Council called for an Employment Pact to becreated with the aim of achieving a sustained reduction in unemployment. The Pact underlines theneed for the implementation of structural reforms in Europe. It is hoped that the Pact will achieve thisobjective. Together with the national fiscal policymakers, the unions and the European Commission,the Eurosystem will also take part in the macroeconomic dialogue. We shall use this dialogue to makeit absolutely clear to the other parties that structural unemployment cannot be reduced without decisivereforms. Short-term activism intended to stimulate employment cannot solve the structural elements ofthe problem and the Eurosystem will insist that all measures envisaged by other parties are consistentwith the need to preserve price stability.The international role of the euroFinally, I should like to talk in more detail about the international role of the euro. The euro is thecurrency of an economic area consisting of almost 300 million inhabitants which represents aroundone-sixth of the world’s gross domestic product. Behind the US dollar and ahead of the Japanese yen,the euro is the second most used currency at the international level. This is a reflection of the formersignificance of the national currencies which the euro replaced, as well as the important role that theeuro area plays in the global economy.The ability of the Eurosystem to preserve price stability has not been hampered by the start of theinternationalisation of the euro. Initial experiences have shown that the development of the euro as aninternational currency will be determined, above all, by the international financial markets. In thiscontext, the use of the euro in the private economic sector as an investment and issuing currency andas a means of payment is of great importance.The international interest in the euro is evident, for example, from international new issues. Accordingto information from the Bank for International Settlements, the volume of new issues in euro(calculated as a gross figure) almost doubled in the first half of 1999 compared with same period lastyear. By contrast, the increase in new issues in US dollars was around 10% weaker. New issues in theJapanese yen and the Swiss franc either stagnated or even declined somewhat.With regard to the role of the exchange rates between the euro and other important currencies outsideof the EU, in particular the US dollar, the Eurosystem made an unambiguous choice when shaping its
BIS Review 99/19996monetary policy strategy. This strategy clearly excludes any explicit or implicit targets or target zonesfor the euro exchange rate. The pursuit of an exchange rate target could easily jeopardise thepreservation of the price stability objective and therefore hamper real economic developments.It should also be noted that exchange rate fluctuations are often caused by structural or fiscal policy aswell as divergent economic developments. Monetary policy would be significantly challenged and itscredibility put at risk, if such exchange rate fluctuations had to be contained by monetary policy. Theabsence of an exchange rate target does not mean that the ECB views the exchange rate of the euro asirrelevant or does not take it into account. On the contrary, the exchange rate is monitored andanalysed as a potentially important monetary policy indicator.The success of the euro in its relatively early stage of life has led, in many places outside the EU, tosuggestions that domestic monetary policy should be more closely linked to that of the Eurosystem.Suggestions range from pegging the exchange rate to the euro to the introduction of the euro as aparallel currency or even as a replacement currency. In principle, the ECB maintains a totally neutralposition with regard to such developments. We will neither endeavour to strengthen the internationalrole of the euro nor to prevent such developments from taking place.In this respect, I should like to emphasise that when formulating monetary policy the GoverningCouncil of the ECB is bound by the mandate to ensure price stability in the euro area set out in theMaastricht Treaty. This means that developments in neighbouring European countries are taken intoaccount to the extent that the outlook for these countries influences price developments in the euroarea. However, the ECB cannot and may not assume any obligations with regard to monetary orgeneral economic policies in other countries, irrespective of the role the euro plays in those countriesor of the size of the economies concerned.I should like to point out that the Maastricht Treaty envisages a clear and transparent procedure whichlays down the conditions for countries wishing to join the euro area. There are three stages. The basicprerequisite is that the country is a member of the EU which is linked to specific criteria. In addition,the country concerned is expected to join the Exchange Rate Mechanism II, for which it must similarlyfulfil certain economic criteria. Finally, the convergence criteria must be complied with, which shouldensure that a candidate country wishing to join provides evidence of sufficient economic convergencewith the euro area. In addition to sound public finances and a high degree of price stability, they mustalso provide evidence of relatively low long-term interest rates and stable exchange rates. TheEuropean Council decides whether a country is eligible to join in Monetary Union and calls upon theECB and the European Commission to give an Opinion.ConclusionI shall now come to a close. The ECB has been responsible for monetary policy in the euro area fornine months now. So far, we believe that the ECB’s monetary policy, the new monetary policystrategy and the new range of instruments have passed their first test very well indeed. Manyinternational observers share this view.The real art of monetary policy will continue to be maintaining price stability in the euro area in theforeseeable future. Faith in a currency cannot be achieved by way of national or internationallegislation. Rather, the ECB must try to inspire new faith in the euro on an almost daily basis in orderto build up credibility over time. It would be wise to develop this credibility so that the ECB’smonetary policy is also sufficiently prepared for difficult phases in the future.
1BIS Review 98/1999Mr Garganas gives a speech on integratingGreece into the euro area and the challenges aheadSpeech given by Mr Nicholas C Garganas, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Greece, at the “AthensSummit 1999” on 18 September 1999.*      *      *The adoption of the euro as a common currency by a first group of eleven European Union MemberStates on 1 January 1999 was rightly described as an historic event since the move to the final stage ofEconomic and Monetary Union indeed marks a decisive step towards full economic and politicalintegration between the countries participating in this endeavour. The vigorous and credibleimplementation by Greece of policies aimed at achieving a high degree of sustainable economicconvergence and meeting the terms of the Maastricht Treaty for EMU participation have yieldedconcrete results, thus placing Greece directly on the road to joining the euro area by the target date of1 January 2001.Over the past few years, convergence towards price stability has been impressive. The annual rate ofinflation in August was 2%. Great progress has also been achieved regarding the general governmentbudgetary position. In 1998, the deficit stood at 2.5% of GDP, and is expected to fall further (to justover 1.5%) this year, continuing the downward path of the debt–to–GDP ratio, which currently standsat 105%. The gradual reduction in budget deficits, together with the entry of the drachma into theExchange Rate Mechanism, has led to an appreciation of the drachma (first against the ECU and thisyear against the euro), and lower long-term interest rates. In the first half of this month, the ten-yeargovernment bond spread versus Germany was around 163 basis points, compared with 196 basispoints in March 1999 and 425 basis points in September 1998.The remarkable nominal convergence achieved by Greece indicates that its objective of meeting theMaastricht criteria by early 2000 is now becoming a reality.Although it is widely anticipated that Greece will be admitted into the euro area by June next year sothat it can adopt the single currency on 1 January 2001, we should not allow this achievement to dimour view of what remains to be done. As I see it, Greece faces two broad sets of challenges. First, inthe remainder of 1999 and in 2000, macroeconomic policy has to remain firmly focused on keepingthe EMU process on track and on securing the conditions that will make for a smooth transition andpositive performance upon entry. From this point of view, the main challenge is that of sustainingprice stability. Second, Greece is faced with the additional challenges of completing the necessarybudgetary consolidation and stepping up the structural reforms required to prepare the economy for thedemanding competitive environment of monetary union. Let me discuss each of them in turn.Maintaining price stabilityFirst, there is the issue of establishing conditions that will secure price stability between now and theend of 2000. On current projections, in the remainder of 1999 and early 2000, inflation (as measuredby the Harmonised Consumer Price Index) is expected to average close to – or slightly below – 2% – arate that is consistent with the Bank of Greece’s definition of price stability. The benign outlook forinflation reflects a number of important policy choices, most notably the tight monetary policy stanceadopted to date, centred on high interest rates and a strong drachma. The reduction in inflation is alsosupported by a moderation of wage settlements. However, the current favourable inflation prospectsreflect, in part, the impact of recent indirect tax cuts and other administrative measures.Given the need to maintain price stability throughout the year 2000 and beyond, the present tightmonetary conditions will have to be maintained as long as is feasible to ensure against unforeseeninflationary pressures. Should there be renewed inflationary pressures, there are evident limits to what
BIS Review 98/19992monetary policy could do to maintain price stability in the run-up to EMU. I do not have the time todiscuss these constraints in detail. I can only mention the fact that the ability of interest rate policy tocurb credit growth is being eroded by the public’s widespread perception that interest rates willnecessarily decline by end-2000 and by firms’ recourse to foreign borrowing.Looking further to 2001, the alignment of Greek interest rates with those in the euro area and the slideof the drachma to its central ERM parity when Greece enters the euro area will, of course, entail asubstantial easing of monetary conditions. This prospect for a substantial easing of monetaryconditions in early 2001 could result in a reversal of the downward trend in inflation in the course of2000 and beyond. Against this background, the macroeconomic policy mix will need to undergo afundamental rebalancing, with other policy instruments – notably fiscal, wage and structural policies –being called upon to offset the effect of monetary easing on inflation and thereby help to maintainprice stability.Let me now turn to the matter of the challenges facing Greece with respect to the completion of theadjustments required to prepare the economy for the exigencies of monetary union. Three interrelatedissues are important in this respect. First, the need to sustain efforts to achieve and maintain a soundbudgetary position consistent with the Stability and Growth Pact, and a speedy reduction in the stillhigh debt-to-GDP ratio. Second, the need to strengthen Greece’s ability to respond to “asymmetric”shocks, i.e. negative shocks affecting the entire national economy and only that economy. Third, thechallenge of stepping up the structural reforms required to secure Greece’s smooth participation in theeuro area and to reap fully the opportunities offered by EMU.Sound public financesAs I indicated at the outset, Greece has made enormous progress in reducing the large imbalances inits public finances over recent years. However, additional progress is required in order to ensurecompliance with the Stability and Growth Pact’s medium-term objective of a budgetary position closeto balance or in surplus. That will allow Greece to deal with cyclical fluctuations while keeping thegovernment deficit within the reference value of 3% of GDP. It will also allow a speedy reduction inthe still high public debt ratio and help prepare for the fiscal impact of population ageing.A sound budgetary position will impart a layer of flexibility into the economy. Since, following entryinto the euro area, adjustment to adverse cyclical developments and country-specific disturbances will,to an important extent, rest with budgetary policy, it will be of paramount importance to ensure thatthe automatic stabilisers will be able to play their role.Greece needs to step up its budgetary adjustment to put its debt ratio firmly on a declining path and tobring it down swiftly below the reference value of 60% of GDP in the near future. A further steadydecline in public debt and an appropriate debt management strategy would reduce the vulnerability ofGreece’s public finances. Moreover, a speedy reduction in public debt is essential because Greece, likeother EU Member States, will face increased pension liabilities in the second decade of the nextcentury as a large number of people will retire because of a marked ageing of the population. As aresult, public pension spending is likely to increase sharply in relation to GDP, particularly if there isno reform of the social security system.Reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio to 60% will not be easy. While Greece can count on comparativelylarge privatisation proceeds, it is burdened by a currently high government debt ratio, significantcontingent liabilities and a large debt accumulated by its chronically loss-making public enterprises.
3BIS Review 98/1999An exercise on the dynamics of the debt ratio carried out under certain assumptions and starting from2000 onwards suggests that it would take 10-12 years for the debt-to-GDP ratio to be brought down to60%. 1Maintaining Greece’s primary budget surplus at its present level (6.7%) for 10-12 years – which iswhat is assumed in this exercise – would virtually remove the scope for easing the high tax burden onGreek citizens over the next 10-12 years and would imply little room for public spending increases.It would be more realistic for the government to speed up and expand its privatisation plans, using theproceeds to reduce the debt stock. The government could also press ahead as fast as possible with thereform of the social security system (for example, along the lines implied by the Spraos CommitteeReport). The government could also intensify its efforts to reduce tax evasion, rationalise publicexpenditure and reform the wider public sector.Asymmetric shocksLet me now turn to the issue of country-specific disturbances. With the date of Greece’s entry intoEMU approaching, attention should now shift from issues of transition to monetary union to thechallenges posed by EMU for Greece.By definition, EMU implies the loss of national monetary autonomy. One of the criticisms often leviedagainst the EMU project is that member countries will not be able to respond to adverse economicdisturbances via changes in national monetary policy or the nominal exchange rate. It is then arguedthat country-specific disturbances will result in a recession and a surge in unemployment.In reality, the exchange rate is potentially appropriate for coping with adverse economic developmentsand country-specific shocks only in a narrow set of circumstances. Mutatis mutandis, the same can besaid of monetary policy.Shocks that are truly national are already relatively infrequent. And they will become even more soonce Greece joins the euro area: the stability-oriented macroeconomic framework will reduce thelikelihood of policy-induced shocks (such as disturbances originating from reckless fiscal behaviour),which in the past have been an important source of country-specific shocks. Moreover, the increasingopenness and trade integration of EMU members will further blur the economic importance of nationalboundaries, thereby reducing the national specificity of economic disturbances.In the case of Greece, there will be the added benefit to be derived from the process of catching up. Asingle currency will greatly enhance prospects for bringing in new industries, as the elimination ofexchange rate risk will encourage firms to produce closer to their markets. Large infrastructureprojects already underway – and financed through the Community Support Programmes – willimprove competitiveness and provide a further inducement for firms to move to Greece. It is thereforelikely that the conditions after EMU entry will be favourable to growth and employment creation inthe Greek economy.To argue that the incidence of country specific disturbances will diminish is not, however, to say thatsuch shocks will disappear altogether.In those circumstances, in which a change in the exchange rate or national monetary policy wouldhave been helpful, alternative adjustment mechanisms will have to be provided for responding tomacroeconomic disturbances once national authorities have lost monetary and exchange rateindependence.1To achieve this it is assumed that Greece would need growth of 3.5% a year, a cost of public borrowing of 5%, and aprimary budget surplus of 6.7% of GDP. It is also assumed that the general government takes on contingent liabilities anddebt of public enterprises (outside the general government).
BIS Review 98/19994At the macroeconomic level, it was argued earlier that, in the case of Greece, public finances will haveto regain the necessary room for manoeuvre to cope with adverse economic developments andcountry-specific disturbances. Where structural adjustment, rather than mere macroeconomicstabilisation, is called for, an improvement in price competitiveness will be needed. This brings me tothe crucial role of structural reform.Structural reformOn the structural front, there has been much progress in several areas over recent years and it isbeginning to yield substantial benefits to the economy. But, given the breadth and the magnitude of thestructural problems, much still remains to be done.I focus here only on a few selected issues where I feel that significant breakthroughs would make amajor contribution to preparing the economy for the exigencies of monetary union. In particular, morestress needs to be placed on enhancing competition in product markets and improving labour marketflexibility. Greater market flexibility will not only allow Greece to cope with country-specificdisturbances more easily, but it will also, by reinforcing Greece’s competitiveness, ensure atension-free macroeconomic growth process and increase the employment-content of growth.Although legislation was passed in 1998 aimed at addressing some key rigidities in the labour market(the inflexibility of working time, wages, the ineffectiveness of job matching mechanisms), theperformance of the Greek labour market has not yet materially improved. This year’s National ActionPlan for Employment is a well-articulated approach intended to provide an overview of thegovernment’s initiatives and plans in this area. But more stress needs to be placed on improving thequality and job-relevance of vocational training.The government’s privatisation and flotation programme has been steadily implemented. This hascontributed significantly to debt reduction and enhanced competition in the banking system. Butprivatisation needs to expand into other areas, including key economic sectors that remain dominatedby public enterprises.Tax reform is also needed to alleviate the tax burden, particularly, although not exclusively, on wageearners and to bring the tax structure into line with that in the euro area, thereby preventing themovement of capital and labour to lower-taxed areas.In concluding, I would note that the achievements to date are impressive and have paved the way forGreece’s forthcoming participation in the euro area. By meeting the challenges of completing thenecessary budgetary consolidation and stepping up action across the broad spectrum of structuralreforms, Greece will not only be able to join the euro area in a strong competitive position, but willalso reap the full benefits from participation in EMU.
1BIS Review 97/1999Mr Gramlich assesses the state of the electronicmoney transformation in the United States and abroadRemarks by Mr Edward M Gramlich, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem, before the Electronic Payment Symposium, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor on17 September 1999.*      *      *Although the United States economy seems to be leading the world in the adoption of new computerand internet-based technology, the picture is not uniform. The United States is not at the forefront inthe adoption of electronic money systems, one area that would seem most eligible for the informationrevolution. Adherence to traditional payment systems, check and cash, is very strong. The UnitedStates is the only developed country in the world where check use is still increasing, with the numberof checks written growing at a rate nearly as fast as the overall economy.Use of cash is extensive as well. Americans still use cash for about three-quarters of all transactions.The total US supply of coin and currency now comes to $550 billion, about one-third of which isactually circulating in this country (the remainder is held abroad). But even after subtracting estimatedforeign balances, the supply of outstanding coin and currency comes to $670 per capita which strikesmost people as incredibly large.For many years, observers have looked forward to the advent of electronic money, a system that useseither a computer chip or another electronic device to record payments and debits automatically. Thereare obvious efficiency advantages in terms of ease of handling and record-keeping for consumers,merchants, the banking system and the Federal Reserve. Use of electronic money systems appears tobe growing in at least a few foreign countries. But in this country, growth of electronic money systemsis sluggish – well behind earlier predictions, well behind the growth of credit and debit card use andway behind the growth of other types of electronic commerce. Even fervent advocates of electronicmoney will admit disappointment at its rate of adoption.In this talk I will try to assess the state of the electronic money transformation, here and abroad. Imention some promises, some stumbling blocks and some technological and regulatory issues that willhave to be dealt with as electronic money use proceeds.Historical antecedentsThe idea of using technology to improve the efficiency of the payment system is very old. Worldcommerce has seen an evolution from barter to valuable metals, to paper money and to checks. In theUnited States, as early as 1853, more than a half-century before the Federal Reserve System came intoexistence, private banks in the New York area formed an exchange and settlement system thateconomized on the movement of paper and settlement balances. In 1970, some of these arrangementswere automated and became the basis for a wire transfer system called the Clearing House InterbankPayments System (CHIPS). CHIPS is still the leading clearing and settlement system for large dollarinterbank payments (average size of $6 million) originating in international trade and finance.When the Federal Reserve System came on the scene in 1913, one of its early tasks was to eliminategold transfers and exchange rate differentials between the dollar and gold across the Federal ReserveDistricts. The Fed created a “goldwire” system that involved inter-District settlements through theGold Settlement Fund. This system quickly gave way to a telegraphic system for adjusting reservebalances. This system in turn evolved into a highly automated and centralized Fedwire system tohandle large volumes of high-value payments settled in reserve balances on a real-time basis. TheFedwire system is the key interbank settlement system for the federal funds market. Average paymentsare around $3 million, but the system is also used for much smaller time-critical payments.
BIS Review 97/19992There is also a system for handling smaller retail payments, now averaging about $3.000. In the early1970s, a group of California commercial banks, in cooperation with the Federal Reserve Bank ofSan Francisco, organized an automated clearing system operating within the San Francisco District. Asimilar development occurred in the Atlanta District, with groups in other Districts studying similarsystems. These efforts led to the creation of an Automated Clearing House (ACH) throughout theentire Federal Reserve System. The federal government along with some other large private employersbegan making some payroll deposits through this system in 1975. I vaguely remember the Universityof Michigan switching to automatic payroll deposit at about that time, apparently one of the early largeemployers to switch. Use of the ACH has grown and is still growing rapidly, with the number ofpayments made through ACH rising at double-digit annual rates right up to the present time (incontrast to the sluggish growth of electronic money use). But there is still vast potential for furtherACH growth because only about 45% of payroll payments are now made through the ACH and onlyabout 8% of consumer bill payments. Since the marginal cost to consumers of making payments byACH is about half that of the cost of making payments by check, in the end the most interestingquestion may be why the ACH has not displaced the costlier check system even more rapidly.Electronic moneyWith that background, we now turn to our main topic, electronic money. This term is normally takento refer to a stored-value product, where a prepaid balance of funds is recorded on a card or personalcomputer controlled by the consumer and updated automatically as payments are made in or out. Thestored-value balance would be recorded as a liability of the institution, financial or otherwise, thatissues the card.Early stored-value cards recorded the account balance on magnetic strip, but magnetic strip cards canbe difficult to reload and are easy to tamper with. Future smart cards are likely to record stored-valuethrough an embedded microprocessor chip which permits sophisticated encryption to protect againstcounterfeiting. These cards can also be used as credit cards, debit cards or repositories of otheridentifying information for the consumer.While much rarer, electronic money systems can also be computer-based. Under these systems,variously called e-cash, cyber coins and cyberbucks, computer software generates electronic (virtual)tokens that serve as cash. The seller has to verify the tokens and the issuer may have to settle them –operations that at this point have proven costly and difficult.Stored-value products can be used in open or closed systems. Closed systems involve a narrowlydefined group of consumers such as riders of a metropolitan transportation system or students at theUniversity of Michigan. The infrastructure necessary to redeem the value is in place either attransportation system terminals or owned by merchants within a relatively small geographic area.Open systems involve many consumers and merchants over an extended geographic area, with thestored-value cards really functioning as electronic money.One way to assess the potential of electronic money is to analyze the benefits and costs of electronicmoney as compared with alternative ways of making payments. I will discuss this separately forconsumers, merchants, financial institutions and the Federal Reserve System. While the potential gainsto all groups together may not be huge, they do seem to be positive, adding to the puzzle about theslowness of adoption of stored-value technology.From the consumer’s standpoint, there could be many potential advantages of electronic money, butthere are also risks. Stored-value cards are easier to handle than either cash or checks. Although mostelectronic money systems now do not have pin number protection, that protection is technologicallypossible, and protection against loss through theft could be developed in the future. There is some riskof insolvency by the issuer, but at least for financial institutions that risk is very low statistically. Agreater problem is that until the stored-value system becomes universal, there is a risk that the sellerswill not accept the card. Payment systems involve a network – money is not truly money unless itbecomes nearly universally acceptable – and network problems have been a big impediment to the
3BIS Review 97/1999development of any currency system. This is one reason that electronic money systems may be morelikely to develop in natural closed systems or in small countries.One apparent cost of electronic money for consumers, at least in comparison with credit cards, is thatof float. In benefit-cost parlance, float is an internal redistribution – a cost of electronic money felt byconsumers offset by gains to other sectors. Float then should not affect the overall social interest inelectronic money. Moreover, in the long run we might expect the competitive market to offerelectronic money products that compensate consumers for their loss of float.Electronic money systems might raise a potential trade-off between protection and privacy. Consumerprotection could be enhanced by stored-value systems because there could be a record of alltransactions, and this record could be used to resolve disputes or to deal with losses due to theft, inmuch the same way that consumers’ credit cards are now protected. At the same time, this recordcould also be misused to defraud consumers or infringe on their financial privacy, by irresponsibleaction on the part of the issuing institution or in some other way. Consumers could sacrifice theirprotection but retain their privacy by purchasing cards without this extensive record-keeping or bysigning “opt out” forms to prevent the disclosure of confidential information. Consumers could alsolimit invasions of privacy by keeping low balances on their card or restricting its use, but this limitsthe utility of electronic money in the first place.From the standpoint of merchants, electronic money systems raise orthodox benefit-cost questions. Itis costly for merchants to invest in the infrastructure to process the stored-value cards, much more sothan for credit cards because of the encryption technology or the difficulty of verifying electronictokens. But once merchants have made the investment, costs of handling at least some types ofpayments should go down. Compared with credit and debit cards, there may be little cost reduction.Compared with checks, there is less risk of default because the sale will not be completed unless thestored value is adequate to make the purchase and the amount of the stored value can be determinedimmediately. Compared with cash, there is less risk of theft, at least out of the traditional cash register.While merchants have not eagerly invested in the infrastructure because of the network problemsmentioned above, in the long run there should be some gains to them from electronic moneytechnology.For financial institutions, stored-value products may offer new opportunities for delivering bankingservices and improving security through computer chips. Consumers may switch from using cash tousing deposits that are linked to stored-value products, say with automatic loading from an ATMmachine or with links to a personal computer. This could be a profitable new market for financialinstitutions with relatively little risk. While financial institutions have not been early to climb aboardthe electronic money bandwagon either, they may become strong supporters at some point.If financial institutions issue the stored-value cards, there is some protection against abuses becausefinancial institutions are already regulated, particularly with respect to their solvency. Regulationscould also encompass the institutions’ disclosure policy, its privacy policy and its following of otherproper procedures. Many institutions are now announcing very strict disclosure and privacy policiesand extending these policies to stored-value products should be straightforward.In one early indication of coming complications, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)has ruled that electronic money accounts issued by insured institutions are not always legally definedas deposits under the deposit insurance act. This means that stored-value balances do not always carrydeposit insurance. By contrast, in virtually all European countries, some of which seem to have morerapid growth of electronic money products, stored-value balances are typically accorded the sameprotection as deposits issued by a bank. At this point it is unclear whether the negative FDIC decisioncould be a major reason for the sluggish growth of stored-value products in this country. In a statisticalsense, risk of loss of value through financial insolvency is minor and is probably much less of a factorto consumers than risk of loss of the card or risk that merchants will not accept the card.Finally, governmental institutions could have a stake in stored-value technology. The Debt CollectionImprovement Act of 1996 encourages the federal government to make most of its paymentselectronically. When consumers do not have bank accounts, as about 10% now do not, governmentshave at this point made most payments through debit cards. But at some point, stored-value products
BIS Review 97/19994might become an easy way for governments to pay social security benefits, unemployment insurancebenefits and even welfare and food stamps. Innovations are often criticized because they leave low andmoderate income groups behind, but this is an innovation that might actually benefit low and moderateincome groups disproportionately.Returning to the protection-privacy trade-off, government crime control agencies may findstored-valued transactions easier to trace than cash transactions. But as said above, to the extent thatthe government may gain records of transactions, consumers will lose a corresponding degree ofprivacy. When this issue has come up in the past, the desire for customer privacy has clearly won out,and there is no obvious reason that the balance of political weight will shift in the future. While thepotential is there for increased crime control, this potential seems unlikely to be realized.Federal regulators have also had to face the issue of whether to regulate stored-value products. On theone hand, when networks are important, there is something to be said for having the governmentdefine a technology early to provide a standard for future development. As mentioned earlier, the roleof the Federal Reserve was critical in the past development of some of our major payment systems.On the other hand, the existence of an already well-functioning payment system is an argument for amore passive governmental regulatory posture. Presumably now that the main institutions are in place,payment systems can develop in ways that effectively meet consumer desires. One can imaginenetwork externalities, but it is not obvious that the natural development of payment systems in anenvironment with minimal regulation will lead to serious inefficiencies. For what it is worth, federalregulators have taken the passive posture and there is at this time little federal regulation ofstored-value products.Summing all of this up, it seems that all groups – consumers, merchants, financial institutions andgovernments – can realize potential gains from electronic money. The gains will be greater, the easierit is to establish natural networks or closed systems. Net gains will be correspondingly less, the moreconvenient alternative payment systems are.Foreign experience with electronic moneyMoving from the general to the specific, I now review the actual experience with electronic money inother developed countries. As I said earlier, adoption of electronic money products is proceedingsomewhat more rapidly in some foreign countries than at home, and it makes sense to examine thereasons.Electronic money pilot programs are at least in the development stage throughout much of the world.A recent survey found that fifty countries had at least some electronic money pilot projects. The vastmajority of the projects involved stored-value card systems, with a handful of countries having at leastsmall-scale experimental network systems.Seven countries appear to be making the most use of electronic money products. Switzerland, theNetherlands and Hong Kong have numbers of outstanding cards exceeding 75% of their population,though in Hong Kong a great many of the cards are for transportation purposes. Germany, Singapore,Belgium and Austria have numbers of outstanding cards exceeding 40%, though many of these arelinked to debit cards. By contrast, the US number is a fraction of 1%. But even in countries where carduse is widespread, the cards are used for very small transactions and account for a small share ofoverall payments.Many countries have adapted their commercial codes to electronic money products. They haveprotocols for dealing with fraud, loss, theft, other disputes and privacy disclosure requirements. Manyof these countries have anti-money-laundering provisions and unlike the United States, most haveruled that deposit insurance does cover electronic money products.While it is difficult to generalize, the countries where stored-value products seem to have made thebiggest inroads are small, implying that electronic money systems work better in a natural closedsystem or in isolated areas. They also work better in more developed countries where wages andpersonnel costs to handle less automated payment systems are higher.
5BIS Review 97/1999The small average size of stored-value transactions suggests that stored-value cards will substitute forcurrency, if they substitute for anything. In that light, the average ratio of currency holding to GDP inthe seven countries where stored-value cards are common is 6.8%, higher than the average ratio of 6%for all developed countries. It is also much higher than the ratio for the United States. Nominally, theUS ratio is 5.2%, but when we consider that two-thirds of US currency is held abroad, the effective USratio is less than 2%. This comparison implies that stored-value products have their best chance ofsuccess in countries where use of currency is widespread. Even though the United States seems tohave a lot of domestic currency outstanding, currency usage is even higher in these other countries.Domestic experienceIn this country there are a number of closed electronic money systems, but still relatively few opensystems. In Atlanta, more than 1.7 million electronic money cards were produced for the 1996Olympic Games, and these cards paid for about 200,000 transactions totalling $1.1 million. TheOlympics are over and this system has now been discontinued. Two separate pilot programs, involving100,000 customers and 1,200 merchants, began in New York City, but were discontinued as ofDecember 1998, largely because of sluggish acceptance by consumers and merchants.Nationally, the firm Digicash tried a network-based system, but acceptance was again sluggish and thesystem was discontinued. Cyber Cash and Wells Wallet are now trying other network-based systems.There is a growing amount of commerce on the Internet, but at this point only a minuscule amounttakes place through stored-value products. Most takes place through credit cards, not electronic moneysystems. It may be easier and cheaper for consumers to make Internet transactions directly throughstored-value routines or it may not. Given the slight cost differences between Internet credit cardtransactions and Internet stored-value transactions, it may be realistic to look towards a continuation ofthe slow development of stored-value Internet transactions. Stored-value transactions would seem tooffer the biggest cost savings relative to cash, not existing Internet transactions.ConclusionsThis brief survey of electronic money suggests some tentative conclusions. Stored-value productscould have a promising future – they could become easier or cheaper for every potential stakeholder –consumers, merchants, financial institutions and governments. At the same time, there have beencontinuing innovations in the payment system in this country, and part of the reason for the slowadoption of electronic money products here is surely that innovations in credit cards, debit cards andthe ACH have made it much easier and safer to conduct transactions through these systems. Stored-value products have done better in small countries and in countries where there is greater use of coinand currency.Looking ahead, the United States may be one of the countries least likely to adopt open stored-valuesystems. It is a big country with many alternative ways of making payments. Americans are stronglyattached to checks and use of credit cards, debit cards and the ACH is growing rapidly. Even cash isstill widely used for small transactions, though less so than in other countries.A major hurdle for the electronic money products is the network problem. If most merchants do notaccept stored-value products, most consumers will not bother with stored-value cards. This is theclassic chicken-egg problem, a problem that often gets solved by slow growth on both sides of themarket. In principle, the government could intervene and force or induce merchants, consumers andfinancial institutions to adopt the new technology, but in practice, alternatives to stored-value productsare cheap and safe enough that such intervention is both economically unwise and politically unlikely.It is also possible that this network consideration leads to the development of many closed electronicmoney systems – for transportation, for university students, for one-employer towns and the like. Thisis perhaps not the visionary’s dream, but even the development of closed systems cuts the demand forcash and checks and makes the payment system more efficient.
1BIS Review 97/1999Ms Hessius discusses the role of the central bank and market liquiditySpeech given by Ms Kerstin Hessius, Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at a seminar ofSveriges Finansanalytiker Förening on 14 September 1999.*      *      *The financial sector plays a central role in our society’s economy. It is this sector that enables us tomake payments, to transform savings into investments or future consumption and to spread andminimise potential financial risks. It is therefore essential that the financial sector functions smoothlywhen we pass from one millennium into the next.Many actors share the responsibility of a smooth transition. Naturally, the Swedish Riksbank is oneparty involved, but everyone – from private savers and investors to public authorities and the media –must bear their part of the responsibility.Agents in the financial sector addressed early the potential problems that may arise in connection withthe transition to a new millennium. Substantial resources have been devoted to measures designed tominimise the risk of any technical problems arising and to ensure that all systems can cope with thetransition. The Financial Supervisory Authority has closely monitored work on systems adaptationsince 1997.The role of the Riksbank in this connection is bound up with our regular tasks as Central Bank in theeconomy – to implement monetary policy, to promote a secure and efficient system of payments andto ensure that sufficient notes and coins are available in the economy. My intention today is toconcentrate on the central role played by the Riksbank in the management of liquidity in the financialsystem.The risks that are generally given prominence as being the greatest where the millennium period isconcerned are the risks of technical malfunctions arising, primarily as a result of problems in adaptingall computer systems to the year 2000. Such malfunctions have the potential to disrupt the financialinfrastructure. Irrespective of how high a degree of probability is assigned to these risks, they have tobe treated with the utmost seriousness. The very uncertainty about the possibility of problems arisingis in itself enough to lead to disturbances; for this reason, preparations have to do not only withtechnical adaptations but also to a great extent with instilling confidence that the systems will functionin practice.One way to build confidence is to use various types of agreements to attempt to limit the burden onsystems around the millennium period, hence reducing the risks. One example of a measure of thiskind is that the European Central Bank, the ECB, has decided that the European payment system,Target, is to be closed on 31 December. The reason for this decision is to enable all measures that needto be taken by the end of the day and the year to be carried out in good time before midnight. Theclosing of Target makes it possible to close down all financial trade within the EU on New Year’sEve.A further means of enhancing confidence and reducing vulnerability is to establish contingency plans,i.e. measures that will be resorted to should problems still arise in spite of all preparations. Such plansare not something that should be unique to the change of millennium; they should always exist inorganisations in the financial sector.Many of the measures that have been taken in preparation for the transition to the year 2000 havefocused on questions related to confidence. A high degree of confidence in financial markets isimportant if the markets are to function efficiently. For this reason, anxiety that the functioning of themarket may be impaired or a lack of confidence in the payment systems, are enough in themselves toconstitute a problem.
BIS Review 97/19992Lately, comments have frequently centred around possible liquidity problems. However, the exactsignificance invested in the word liquidity is often unclear, as is what, fundamentally, could lead toproblems. The word liquidity means “the capacity to quickly obtain funds for the settlement of debts”.1In practice, the word liquidity is used to express a variety of phenomena. In my opinion, therefore, itmay be appropriate to take a closer look at the concept of liquidity and to clarify the role played by theRiksbank in managing liquidity.The comment that liquidity in the market is poor often describes a situation in which major pricechanges occur even when turnover is low. To use market jargon, the market is said to be thin. Oneexplanation for this can be a low level of customer activity. Such situations frequently tend to arise atthe end of the year, when companies and financial institutions have adjusted their balances inpreparation for closing their books and therefore have little interest in modifying their portfolios.Judging by comments on the market, there are expectations that the period of low activity in themarket at the end of this year could turn out longer than usual. In other words, uncertainty about theeffects the change of millennium might have on interest rates and financing possibilities could leadagents on the market to make adjustments to their portfolios earlier than usual. On this view, onepossible explanation for why the interest rates on loans and investments that run over into next yearhave risen could therefore be a higher liquidity premium, i.e. a rise in the price that reflects how easilya security can be sold on the market.However, it is important to point out that this type of liquidity problem – a thin market – has no directconnection with the practical liquidity management exercised by the Riksbank. The Riksbank’s role inliquidity management is rather to function as the banks’ bank. This leads us to a second definition ofthe concept of liquidity: the opportunities available to financial agents to obtain refinancing withoutneeding to sell assets.Uncertainty regarding the future liquidity situation in both senses risks reinforcing the problems. Ishall therefore explain and inform you, as far as possible, how the Riksbank will manage the supply ofliquidity. I shall also give my opinion of the risk of liquidity problems actually arising in practice.In Sweden, all major payments between accounts are managed within the RIX payment system whichlinks together the Riksbank and all major credit institutions. A bank that has a payments deficit alwayshas the option of financing this deficit by borrowing from the Riksbank against collateral at theRiksbank’s lending rate. Similarly, a bank that has a surplus always has the right to invest it at theRiksbank at the Riksbank’s deposit rate. These rates at present stand at 4.25% and 2.75% respectively.However, a bank that has surplus liquidity always gains by lending it to a bank that has a deficit viathe market for lending between banks, the interbank market. The bank that lends its surplus funds thenreceives a higher rate of interest than the Riksbank’s deposit rate, while at the same time the bank thatborrows money pays a lower rate of interest than the Riksbank’s lending rate. Loans on the interbankmarket occur within the framework of set credit lines so that here no collateral is required.If the financial system as a whole has a liquidity deficit with respect to the Riksbank – as a result ofthe banks ordering banknotes from us – the deficits and surpluses cannot be settled on the interbankmarket. The banks then have to borrow from the Riksbank at an interest rate normally close to the reporate; this occurs by means of “fine tuning” transactions on the part of the Riksbank.As long as the Swedish banks feel sufficient confidence in one another and the banks have adequatecollateral to borrow from the Riksbank, the banks will encounter no difficulties in obtainingrefinancing. Refinancing can then normally occur at the repo rate or at a rate close to the repo rate.So do the banks have sufficient confidence in one another, or is there any possible cause to reconsiderthe size of credit lines because of uncertainty about the year 2000? I can see no reason for any suchrevisions. For one thing, solvency in the Swedish banks is high. The Riksbank publishes stabilityreports twice a year in which we analyse the Swedish banking system. In our judgement, the financial1Nationalencyklopedin (The Swedish National Encyclopaedia).
3BIS Review 97/1999strength of the banking system and its capacity to resist disruptions is good. Furthermore, the reportsof the Financial Supervisory Authority make a “second opinion” available on the progress ofpreparations for the year 2000. The Financial Supervisory Authority will publish its next report on1 October.One further question is whether the banks possess adequate collateral to finance increased borrowingrequirements from the Riksbank. In addition to Government securities, we also accept securities issuedby housing credit institutions and some foreign countries as collateral for loans from the Riksbank. Asof 30 June, the stock of Government and housing securities in Sweden came to approximatelySEK1,700 billion.2 At the same time, only about SEK50 billion worth of securities were being used ascollateral for loans from the Riksbank. The banks held securities that are approved as collateral in theRIX system amounting to almost SEK200 billion at the time. It is therefore reasonable to concludethat collateral ought not to constitute a restriction for increased borrowing from the Riksbank.In order to judge whether this safety margin is adequate, it is also necessary to estimate how muchcollateral might be needed. Essentially, an augmented demand for banknotes is the only factor thatmight be capable of increasing the total refinancing the banks need to obtain from the Riksbank.However, a substantial rise in demand for cash on the part of the general public appears to be unlikely.The surveys that the National Board of Psychological Defence has carried out indicate that the generalpublic has great confidence that the banking sector will function in the millennium period. However,the possibility that the situation may change as a result of psychological factors and the demand forcash may increase cannot be discounted. Nevertheless, there is not the remotest possibility of the sumsinvolved being so large that the collateral held by the banks might impose limits on their borrowingfrom the Riksbank. In an earlier financial stability report, we outlined a highly hypothetical argumentin which we followed the assumption that all households wanted to hold an extra SEK10,000 in cash.This would be equivalent to increased withdrawals totalling approximately SEK38 billion. A morereasonable assessment of the risk is that each household might withdraw an additional couple ofthousand kronor; this would be equivalent to about SEK10 billion. I am therefore on firm groundwhen I say that the Swedish bank system is well equipped to cope with any rise in the demand forcash.Nevertheless, some central banks have announced special lending facilities for the banking system inpreparation for the turn of the millennium. These central banks include the Federal Reserve and theBank of Canada. However, both the structure of the banking market and the central banks’ systems formanaging the supply of liquidity vary from country to country. In Sweden we have financially strongbanks and the banking market is easily surveyed, since the number of banks is so small. Moreover, asa result of the rules that the Riksbank follows for collateral requirements and because of the structureof the Swedish securities market, a considerable stock of pledgeable securities exists.In supervising financial stability, the Riksbank also has other means at its disposal. Although in myjudgement the risk of liquidity problems in the run-up to the coming year-end is small, it is of coursenever possible to rule out the possibility that technical hitches might lead to temporary problems. Onehypothetical issue that has been discussed is what would happen if a single bank, in spite ofeverything, encountered technical problems in sending out its payments. The banks that were toreceive these payments would then run the risk of a temporary deficit that would have to be financedby the Riksbank. If it should prove impossible in that situation to present an adequate amount ofcollateral, the Riksbank would be able to make use of the existing legal option of offering loans onspecial terms, always assuming that those affected were solvent. The situations in which this option isto be used and exactly how this is to occur is considered on a case to case basis. The Riksbank alwaysmaintains a high level of preparedness for taking quick decisions about loans of this kind.The financial sector was early in paying attention to the millennium problems. Representatives of thefinancial sector meet in varying constellations for discussions and to make sure that adequate measures2Sveriges Riksbank: Finansmarknadsstatistik No. 6 (Sveriges Riksbank: Financial Market Statistics No. 6).
BIS Review 97/19994have been taken to avoid problems. Already in April 1998, “The Joint Year 2000 Council” wasestablished;3 its principal task is to ensure coordination between the various actors in the market and toprovide a platform for an exchange of information and experience. Everybody is working for acommon goal – to ensure that the turn of the year passes by in a smooth fashion.Up to now, the preparations for the millennium shift has, in all essentials, been working according toplans. However, it is of great importance that this issue continues to have top priority. My opinion isthat the financial sector and all interested parties can look ahead to the new millennium withconfidence.In conclusion, it is worth recalling that the introduction of the euro at the beginning of this year wasable to take place without any serious hitches, even though many systems were being taken into usefor the first time.3Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems, the InternationalOrganization of Securities Commissions and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors.
1BIS Review 96/1999Mr Heikensten discusses monetary policyaspects of Sweden’s position “inside EU, outside EMU”Speech given by Mr Lars Heikensten, First Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at a seminararranged by Handelsbanken Markets, Stockholm, on 10 September 1999.*      *      *First a word of thanks to those who arranged this seminar for inviting me to take part. The agendacovers many important issues that all deserve a thorough discussion. Sweden’s relationship with theEuropean monetary union is one of them.Today I shall be considering four matters: the feasible timetable in the event of full participation inEMU; Sweden’s performance as regards the criteria for joining the euro area; considerationsconcerning the rate for the krona’s conversion to euro; and, finally, something about how economicpolicy should be formulated in the meanwhile in the event that we do join the monetary union.When could we join?The timetable in the event of our participation in the monetary union is set both by decisions inSweden and by negotiations with the existing euro countries.As regards the domestic process, in December 1997 the Riksdag (Sweden’s parliament) decided thatSweden would wait and see, but that the door to future participation is not to be closed. Players in thefinancial markets, along with other observers, are now trying to work out whether this door will beopened wide and, if so, when that is likely to happen.Our Prime Minister has stated that the question will be discussed at the Social Democrats’ partycongress next March. If the congress were to agree that Sweden ought to join, the next step, to quotethe government bill, is for the matter to be “submitted to the people of Sweden for assessment”. Thiscan be done in a referendum or an election. An affirmative response would be followed by agovernment bill, leading to a parliamentary decision on an application.In the speculation about the timing of a participation, what is known as the fast track has been seen byobservers as a feasible scenario. It assumes that all the competent bodies are in favour of participationand that the matter is referred to a referendum, in which case the domestic side of the decision-makingprocess could be completed some time around the turn of 2001.However, such a short run-up to euro participation cannot be taken for granted. The Social Democratcongress may refrain from considering the matter or arrive at a more tentative conclusion, for instancealong the lines of the British government’s declaration in favour of participation, but not for the timebeing. That would alter and prolong the process. A number of forecasters and political observers havein fact revised their assessments recently in favour of a later date for Sweden’s probable participation.If and when Sweden does opt for participation, the matter will be negotiated with the other EUcountries. This will be done on the basis of examinations of the Swedish economy by the EUCommission and the European Central Bank (ECB). Those assessments will be discussed by thefinance ministers of the member states, who will then hear the opinions of the EU Parliament and theheads of state or of government before arriving at their decision.When that decision has been made, the member states must also agree on the time that Sweden shouldhave for completing the necessary preparations. The countries that participated from the start havebeen given a transitional period of over three years from the euro’s introduction in January 1999 untilit completely replaces the national currencies not later than June 2002. That a similar arrangementwould apply for Sweden is, however, not certain. If we consider that our preparations can becompleted more quickly, perhaps we could ask for a shorter interval.
BIS Review 96/19992Do we meet the entry criteria?The Commission and the ECB will be examining the Swedish economy with reference to the criteriathat were included in the Maastricht Treaty. Those criteria are for inflation, long-term interest rates,the exchange rate, the government budget balance and government debt. There are also specificrequirements as regards central bank legislation. The principle of equal treatment will apply; that is,the basis for the assessments is to be the same as for the initial group of euro participants. That meansthat some conclusions can probably be drawn from the examinations in May 1998.Compared with the countries that passed the entrance examination at that time, Sweden’s economy isdoing well. We have managed to achieve stable government finances and combine this withpersistently low inflation, with the result that long-term interest rates have fallen towards the Europeanlevel.In the present situation, Sweden would have little difficulty with the criteria for inflation, thelong-term interest rate and government finances. The budget surplus of around 2% of GDP is clearlybetter than the criterion of a deficit of not more than 3%. Government debt is still above theconvergence criterion of 60% but should not constitute an obstacle; the debt is being rapidly reduced –according to the Spring Bill by almost 10 percentage points from 1988 to 1999 – and countries with aweaker position in this respect were admitted in the initial round. Moreover, economic forecasts forSweden point to the continuation of strong government finances, making more debt repaymentfeasible and thereby a further improvement in this position.The criteria for low inflation and interest rates are formulated in relative terms. Comparisons with thelevel of inflation and interest rates in the three euro countries where inflation is lowest show thatSweden would fulfil these criteria today and current forecasts suggest that the same holds for thecoming years.The criterion for exchange rate stability is more complicated. The Treaty states that for two yearsbefore the examination the national currency is to have been inside the normal fluctuation marginsprovided for by the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM). The process by which the initial group ofparticipants was selected suggests that the criterion could be interpreted somewhat more freely.Finland and Italy were both approved in May 1998 even though their currencies had then beenparticipating in the ERM for only around eighteen months.The other countries may also have reasons for not insisting too strongly on a strict interpretation offormal participation by outsider countries. Considering the apparent strength of British opposition to afixed exchange rate arrangement, such an attitude might obstruct a British membership of the euroarea. It seems to me that in this respect the United Kingdom is in a more difficult position thanSweden. Our Government and the Riksdag have stated that participation in ERM II can be seen as adirect preparation for joining the monetary union; the Riksbank has noted that we do not see anyproblems with that. In a future situation where a referendum or a general election has resulted in apositive attitude to the monetary union, it is difficult to envisage Sweden’s participation in ERM II asposing any major political problems.Regardless of the formal requirements that may apply at the time of the examination, the assessmentsin May 1998 indicate that a central factor in the evaluation will be how the exchange rate has actuallydeveloped. Exchange rate stability will probably be analysed with respect to the period before as wellas during participation in ERM II. The relationship between the krona and the euro1 has been relativelystable since the beginning of 1996. Disregarding the exceptionally turbulent period last autumn, duringthis period the fluctuations around a krona/euro rate of 8.70 have been largely inside a margin of±2.25%.1The synthetic euro up to the turn of 1998.
3BIS Review 96/1999How is a reasonable exchange rate decided?When, or if, the time approaches for a Swedish decision to join the monetary union, it will thus benecessary to consider the question of participating in ERM II. Since the beginning of this year, thematter of whether and when the krona is to be included in the Exchange Rate Mechanism is somethingthat the government decides, albeit in consultation with the Riksbank. At the same time, the krona’scentral rate with the euro in ERM II and the margin for fluctuations are matters for which theRiksbank is accountable. So in practice, the new allocation of responsibilities means that thegovernment and the Riksbank have to reach a consensus on the terms for the krona’s participation inERM II.But these terms are not decided by Sweden alone. The central rate and the band width will benegotiated between Sweden, the countries in the monetary union and the non-euro countries that aremembers of ERM II. The negotiators include finance ministries as well as central banks.It is clearly important that Sweden and the other countries try to agree on an exchange rate that is asreasonable as possible. This is because the central rate that is set for participation in ERM II will veryprobably be the rate for the krona’s subsequent conversion to euro on joining the monetary union.Consequently it ought to be an exchange rate that is commensurable with real economic equilibrium;in other words, the rate the krona would have when Sweden’s economic resources are being fullyutilised without this generating inflationary pressure and external debt is sustainable in the long run.At the same time, the problem of arriving at a reasonable rate should not be exaggerated. Any nominalexchange rate whatever could, in principle, be said to be commensurate with real economic balance.Via adjustments in wage and price levels relative to the rest of the world, the economy will sooner orlatter attain its real equilibrium exchange rate. But the question, of course, is how extensive and costlythe economic adjustments would be. Evidently, the goal must be to keep such costs to a minimum.All the negotiating parties have a strong practical interest in setting the rate correctly. An unduly weakkrona would admittedly favour Swedish exports, but it would be disadvantageous for the competitiveposition of the other countries and could also lead in time to higher inflationary pressure in Sweden.An unduly strong krona, on the other hand, would benefit the other countries’ competitive position,but also dampen economic activity in Sweden to the detriment of demand for the other countries’exports.Assessments of the appropriate exchange rate cannot be based solely on a particular model. Besidescomparing various prices and costs, allowance must also be made for other indicators of the state ofthe economy and their future paths. In earlier negotiations, the rate-setting decisions have rested on themacroeconomic situation in the country in question and the rest of the world, various indexes ofcompetitiveness and, not least, the exchange rate’s average level and its fluctuations in recent years.The agreed rate has often been the prevailing market rate or a rate close to this.How should economic policy be formulated?The room for discretion in monetary policy will be affected if Sweden participates in ERM II. Oneextreme in that situation would be for policy to focus on a strict exchange rate target, so that theinterest rate is set exclusively in relation to the exchange rate tendency. In practice, the Riksbankwould then fully follow the ECB’s footsteps. The other extreme, you might say, would be formonetary policy to continue to target inflation, still with the exchange rate as one of the set ofindicators of inflationary pressure in the Swedish economy. The construction of ERM II, with a broadband for exchange rate fluctuations, would then make it possible for the interest rate to deviatesomewhat from the level in the euro area.The problems that may arise in such a situation depend on how economic policy in general works.Provided Sweden is more or less in phase with the cyclical pattern in the euro area, there need not beany serious conflicts. The monetary policy objectives are broadly the same.There are therefore grounds for supposing that monetary policy can be much the same as at present.The starting point here is a credible central rate that market players expect will be the rate at which the
BIS Review 96/19994krona is ultimately converted into euro – two assumptions that are both very reasonable. A case inpoint is what happened in Finland. Monetary policy there continued to target inflation even after themarkka had been included in ERM II; following its entry, the markka stabilised and was close to itscentral rate.This brings me to the recent discussion in Swedish media. Briefly, it has been argued that Sweden is inthe process of moving out of phase with activity in the euro area, mainly because fiscal policy isunduly expansionary. At present we can handle such a situation because Sweden is in a position toimplement an independent monetary policy focused on price stability; the Riksbank can quite simplyraise interest rates and thereby counter any tendencies to overheating. Participation in the monetaryunion, however, would deprive us of that possibility and we would then run the risk of landing oncemore in a situation like that in the late 1980s.This account of the problem has a kernel, to which I shall be returning shortly, that deserves to betaken seriously. But the arguments also suffer from distinct weaknesses.For one thing, they assume that policy will be unsuccessful. The starting point is that the fiscal stancewill be unduly expansionary and that Sweden will deviate seriously from the cyclical path in the restof Europe. So far, however, the empirical foundation for this case is weak. What we know to dateabout fiscal policy indicates that its direction is now becoming more neutral after a series of years inwhich its impact on the economy has been restrictive. Thus, as things stand at present, Swedish fiscalpolicy will come to be more in line with the stance in the euro countries. It should also be noted thatmany countries in the monetary union are doing relatively well there despite a level of activity that forsome time has been or is stronger than in Sweden. It is mainly two countries, Italy and Germany,albeit important for the euro area, that have fallen behind appreciably and even there it now looks asthough activity has turned upwards.For another thing, the argument presupposes that any problems with overheating can be tackledsuccessfully by the Riksbank. That is certainly true in the sense that we are able to raise the interestrate and ensure that inflation comes into line with our target. But the picture as presented is too rosy. Ifwage formation were to fail or budget policy became excessively expansionary, the restoration of abalanced economy would be costly: growth would be depressed and employment would presumablyfall when interest rates are raised, accompanied perhaps by an appreciation of the krona. In this sense,access to a national monetary policy is not a patent remedy.At the same time, it is clear that we – as a member of the monetary union – would lose the option ofguaranteeing low inflation even by having recourse to this costly cure. For example, if the labourmarket organisations were to make unduly high wage settlements or if fiscal policy were to get out ofhand, the Riksbank would no longer be in a position to secure low inflation.To me, however, it is by no means clear that the natural conclusion today is to begin arguing thatSweden ought not to aim for euro area participation as soon as there is political support. Comparedwith a couple of years ago, the economic situation is now more stable in almost every respect. It is notonly that the economy has adjusted in various ways to lower inflation; government finances have alsoimproved and during the past year employment has risen rapidly. To this should be added the supportfrom institutional changes in budget work and the legal status of the Riksbank.The natural conclusion is completely different. In the years ahead it will be a matter of cultivating ourachievements. This means not losing the grip on fiscal policy, even though in simple book-keepingterms there may be some room for expansion. The target of a 2% surplus over the business cycle willnot be credible; neither will it provide any room to manoeuvre when activity slackens, if the surpluswhen activity is strong is not considerably larger. Everything must be done, moreover, to make thelabour market function properly. Now that activity is rising and new jobs are being created, it isparticularly important to make every effort to ensure that the vacancies are filled without delay. It isalso crucially important that wage formation functions satisfactorily and that wage costs stay well inline with the growth of productivity.It is only by conducting policy along these lines that Sweden’s options on the EMU issue will remainopen as the Riksdag has ordained. Fortunately enough, if we remain outside the monetary union it is
5BIS Review 96/1999also such a policy that we should implement in order to create good conditions for increased prosperityand attain the high goals the Government and the Riksbank have set up for employment.
1BIS Review 95/1999Mr King gives a speech on reforming theinternational financial system: the middle waySpeech delivered by Mr Mervyn King, Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, to a session of theMoney Marketeers at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on 9 September 1999.*      *      *1.IntroductionOne of the roles which international financial officials are sometimes required to play is to describedisasters as triumphs and to make the dramatic seem bland. So, on 16 September 1992, followingmassive speculation against sterling and its withdrawal from the Exchange Rate Mechanism, the thenChancellor of the Exchequer, Norman Lamont, opened his statement with the words: “Today has beenan extremely difficult and turbulent day”. In the seven years since, several finance ministers have hadcause to echo those words. Officials have spoken of the risks associated with capital flows. Well theymight. Sharp reversals of capital flows to emerging markets have caused crises with a frequency andon a scale that threaten support for an open, market-led international economy.These crises have created millions of victims, whose circumstances and aspirations were totallyunrelated to financial markets. In Korea unemployment tripled, in Indonesia several years of economicgrowth were wiped out leading to political instability and similar results have been visible in otherparts of Asia as well as Latin America. Over the past century, governments in the industrialised worldhave, in the wake of domestic financial crises, taken steps to regulate and strengthen the financialsystem. Is there a similar need to change the rules of the game for the international financial system?Capital markets do not operate on their own. They need an adequate legal and supportinginfrastructure for participants to engage with each other. There is no magic wand that can be waved tocreate such an infrastructure internationally. Short of a world authority, what is required is a patientprocess of building such an infrastructure. Some have described this as a need for new architecture,others as a need for plumbing. I prefer to speak of bricklaying. But after innumerable meetings ofministers and governors, deputies, deputies’ deputies and so on, we still do not have an adequatebuilding. Recent crises have shown that the need is not for a lavish palace, but simply a roof over ourheads. We need to get to the point where less time is spent on the role of the IMF in handling crisesand more on the role of the World Bank in promoting development. So where should we start?In order to answer that question it is necessary to understand the causes of recent financial crises.Without pretending to be comprehensive, I shall focus attention on the importance of balance sheets– national balance sheets – as the trigger for financial crises. I shall discuss four issues. First, I shall tryto identify the problems underlying recent financial crises. Second, I shall discuss two fundamental orpurist solutions which, although infeasible in the short run, do provide us with some ideas about howwe might deal with these problems in our imperfect world. Third, I shall describe some practical steps– a “middle way” to improve the international financial system. These are the bricks which are slowlybeing laid in place. Fourth, in the context of the middle way, I shall argue that transparency is ofcrucial importance. Notwithstanding the weaknesses in domestic policies pursued by a number ofemerging market economies, there is a structural fault in the nature of international capital flows.Short-term debt flows, especially bank finance, are highly volatile. Unless that problem is tackled thepotential for future crises will remain.
BIS Review 95/199922.What is the source of the problems?“Small open economies are like rowing boats on an open sea. One cannot predict when they mightcapsize.”1 So wrote Joseph Stiglitz, Chief Economist at the World Bank. He also likened theinternational financial system to a road which, after too many accidents, raises more doubts about thedesign of the road than the drivers involved. The analogy with travel has been taken up byLarry Summers, who compared global financial markets with jet aeroplanes. Travel is faster and, onthe whole, safer. But crashes, when they do occur, are more spectacular. Whichever form of travel youprefer, one thing is clear. In recent years, the passengers have suffered from severe travel sickness. Somuch so, that their journey towards an open capital market has seemed, at times, a nightmare.The core of the problems faced by a number of emerging markets has been the sharp reversal ofcapital flows. Between 1996 and 1998, the reversal of capital flows to the five Asian countriesprimarily affected (Korea, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines) was of the order of$125 billion, equivalent to 12% of the pre-crisis level of GDP. These reversals imply equal andopposite swings in the current account. To turn a large current account deficit into a substantial surpluswithin two years almost certainly requires a recession. In 1998 real GDP fell by 6% in Korea, by 9%in Thailand, by 14% in Indonesia, by 7% in Malaysia and by 1% in the Philippines.Moreover, the reversal of capital flows to emerging markets means that the industrialised countriesmust in aggregate run a larger trade deficit. The distribution of that increase in the collective deficithas already led to a debate about domestic policy, making it harder to resist the ever presentprotectionist pressures, especially in election years. So rapid reversals of capital flows bringsubstantial economic costs.Capital flows also bring real economic benefits. They enable savings in one country to finance moreprofitable investment in another. That was a key feature of the world economy in the nineteenthcentury. Such flows also facilitate the transfer of knowledge and expertise. And by investing overseas,domestic residents are able to pool risks of various kinds with residents of other countries. To date,international diversification of portfolios has been remarkably limited. In particular, equity portfoliosof investors in the industrialised world are heavily biased towards domestic equities. In part, thisreflects the difficulty of obtaining adequate information about the legal, accounting and other aspectsof the infrastructure of economies overseas. But the failure to exploit the full benefits of an opencapital market reflects also the instabilities resulting from the volatility of short-term capital flows.The volatility of capital flows has affected not only Asia but also Latin America, and almost allemerging markets have suffered directly or indirectly as spreads on their debt have risen to levels thatin some cases have come close to cutting them off from the international capital market altogether.Indeed, Eisuke Sakakibara, formerly of MOF in Japan, has insisted that the past five years have been a“crisis of global capitalism”.2 Over that period, financial crises have been too frequent to beacceptable. The so-called “Washington consensus” that sound macroeconomic and financial policiesshould embrace the free movement of capital has come under fire. Both Mexico and Korea, regardedas models of development to such an extent that they were admitted to the OECD, experienceddamaging crises shortly after their elevation to the premier league of advanced economies. Contrasttheir fate with that of India. Capital controls insulated India to a large extent from the recent crisis. Ifwe cannot find a way to reconcile free movement of capital with prevention of financial crises, thenmany countries may draw the lesson that they are better off with capital controls – either explicit orimplicit – than without. Over the past decade, the two-year swing in the current account among G7countries has been of the order of 1-2% of GDP. The largest swing was less than 4% (3.7% for Italyover the period 1992-94). These are small compared with the swing of 17% for Korea, in 1996-98.1Stiglitz, J E, Financial Times, 25 March 1998.2Sakakibara, E (1999), “Reform of the International Financial System”, speech to the Manila FrameworkMeeting in Melbourne on 26 March 1999.
3BIS Review 95/1999Two dimensions of the reversal of capital flows have been evident in recent experience. First, theirintensity and scale. Second, the rapid contagion from one emerging market to other previouslyunaffected countries. Both phenomena are a product of the nature of the capital flows concerned. Theproblems arise from short-term flows of debt finance, not long-term equity flows or direct investment.Equity investment has a self-stabilising mechanism. When an investor wishes to withdraw from theequity market he or she has to find a buyer before they can head for the exit. The market price adjustsin order to attract a buyer to replace the seller. The physical investments financed by equity flowsremain in place, even if their value on the market has fallen. The need to find a buyer to replace aseller can be expressed in the equivalent statement that the maturity of the liability is extremely long,in this case indefinite. The real problems stem from liabilities with very short maturities. These occurwith debt finance, whether in terms of bank deposits payable on demand or longer-term debt financewhich has almost run to maturity. In these cases, depositors who wish to withdraw their funds do nothave to find replacement depositors. They simply take their funds out. The result is that, if this rush tothe exit is on a sufficiently large scale, banks find themselves on the receiving end of a liquidity run.Such runs can occur even if the fundamentals are sound, although they are more likely when thefundamentals are weak. And the banking systems of some emerging markets compounded the problemby borrowing in foreign currency at short maturities and investing the proceeds in domestic currencyassets at longer maturities. This was indeed a recipe for instability.The importance of short-term debt finance in the reversal of capital flows in recent years is clear.Virtually the whole of the $125 billion reversal of flows to the five Asian crisis countries wasaccounted for by swings in short-term debt finance. And 80% of this swing resulted from changes inthe net flow of finance from commercial banks. Figures from the Institute of International Financesuggest that the same picture is true for a larger group of emerging markets, with 81% of the decline inprivate net capital flows to the 29 most important emerging market economies accounted for by banklending.Liquidity runs, although not the sole cause of problems, did play a major part in recent financial crises.Such runs reflect mismatches in the national balance sheet. Such mismatches can occur in either thepublic or private sectors. Examples of the former are Mexico and Argentina in 1994, where short-termofficial dollar denominated debt exceeded foreign exchange reserves. Examples of the latter areThailand, Korea and Indonesia in 1997, where the private sector had borrowed short in order to lendlong. Either maturity or currency mismatches create the potential for sudden reversals of capital flowson a huge scale. In the technical jargon, such markets are subject to multiple equilibria where a smallevent can cause a shift from one benign equilibrium state to another which is accompanied by rapidcapital outflows. The possibility of a rapid shift from one equilibrium to another explains, in the wordsof Maurice Obstfeld, “why capital markets can appear to impose too little discipline before the crisesarise, and too harsh a discipline afterwards”.3If this diagnosis is correct, two observations follow. First, capital flows in the form of foreign directinvestment and portfolio equity investment should be encouraged. Emerging markets can do a greatdeal to increase these by adopting modern accounting standards, a transparent legal framework, and astable market-friendly environment to which foreign investors will be prepared to commit long-terminvestments. Second, ways must be found to reduce the volatility of short-term flows of bank finance.The key is to avoid maturity and currency mismatches on the national balance sheet. That is easier saidthan done, and similar mismatches on the balance sheets of domestic financial institutions have causedfinancial collapses on a regular basis in the industrialised world.Before turning to the question of how such mismatches might be limited if not prevented, let memention two other contributory factors to recent crises. The first was overvalued real exchange rates,reflecting attempts to maintain fixed nominal exchange rates beyond their economic shelf life. Not3Obstfeld, M (1998), “The Global Capital Market: Benefactor or Menace?”, NBER Working Paper 6559,mimeo.
BIS Review 95/19994only did such attempts contribute to a crisis when the nominal peg could no longer be sustained, butthey also contributed to the illusion that it might be profitable to borrow at lower interest rates inforeign currency and invest at higher rates domestically, thus exacerbating the balance sheetmismatches. The second is that capital outflows do not result solely from the actions of overseasresidents. Capital flight by domestic residents has been a factor in increasing the scale of outflowsfrom a number of emerging markets. It is important to focus on the nature of capital flows not thenationality of investors concerned. Hence the resolution of crises involves more than simplyrestructuring liabilities to foreign banks or overseas investors. The problems created by the volatilityof short-term debt flows require a structural solution.3.Purist solutionsHow can we design an appropriate infrastructure for the international capital market to prevent, or at leastlimit the frequency of, crises? To return to our transport analogy, there is clearly a case for eliminatingblind spots on the road or lengthening the runway. But this is not enough. We also need to think abouthow the emergency services should respond to a crash.The purist is led naturally to consider solutions of two opposite kinds. One, which maintains open and freecapital movements, is to create an international lender of last resort (ILOLR). The second, at the oppositeend of the spectrum, is to reinstate permanent capital controls.Consider first the merits of an ILOLR. The obvious institution to play that role would be the IMF, and itsFirst Deputy Managing Director, Stanley Fischer, provided a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of anILOLR earlier this year.4 Although not new, the concept of an ILOLR has, in polite official circles,become the facility that dare not speak its name.The principle of a lender of last resort was described by Thornton and Bagehot in the nineteenth centuryas a willingness to lend freely against good collateral at a penal rate. All three aspects of this principle– “lending freely”, “good collateral” and a “penal rate”, are problematic at the international level. Aneffective LOLR must be willing to lend whatever it takes to prevent a liquidity run. The more credible isthe LOLR, the less the resources that are required to be lent in practice. Domestic LOLRs have credibility.But for a prospective ILOLR the decision for a group of countries, either jointly or via the IMF, to lendlarge sums to another country will always be difficult. In a world of nation states, it is unreasonable tosuppose that political considerations will not enter the choice of recipient of such largesse. And the greaterthe political uncertainty about the willingness to act as an ILOLR, the larger the amount of funding thatwill be required. In turn, the operation will appear less credible, and the authorities are caught in a viciouscircle. The current resources of the IMF – between $125 billion and $150 billion depending on how theyare measured – are wholly inadequate for an ILOLR. Nor are resources on the appropriate scale likely tobe forthcoming.Moreover, serious moral hazard arises when the private sector ignores the risks of lending to a countrybecause it believes that the country would be bailed out by the international community in the event of aliquidity crisis. And investors are encouraged to lend to emerging markets in forms – short-term debt –which are more likely to be bailed out. In the domestic context, the LOLR ensures that neither themanagers nor the equity holders of the institution receiving support are allowed to benefit. Internationally,it is not easy for the IMF to penalise those responsible for management of the economy, nor to distinguishbetween those citizens that have been responsible for excessive risk-taking and those who will be theinnocent victims of the consequences of a financial crisis. It is the ordinary taxpayers in emerging marketcountries who will have to bear the burden of servicing loans from the IMF.54 Fischer, S (1999), “On the Need for an International Lender of Last Resort”, IMF.5 A point stressed by Calomiris (“The IMF’s Imprudent Role as Lender of Last Resort”, Cato Journal, Vol. 17No. 3 1998) although he underestimates, in my view, the possibility of liquidity runs as seen, for example, inKorea in 1997.
5BIS Review 95/1999Absent a world government, it is difficult to see a credible ILOLR on the horizon. The reason is thesimple maxim: “it’s the politics, stupid”.The second purist solution, at the opposite end of the spectrum, is the imposition of permanent capitalcontrols. In other words, a return to the world in which the Bretton Woods institutions were createdhalf a century ago. The advantage of capital controls is that they prevent the liquidity runs that resultfrom currency and maturity mismatch of the financial sector. India did not experience a financialcrisis, Korea did. They also enable countries to maintain a fixed exchange rate while retaining someflexibility in domestic interest rates. And they might limit the movement of capital to lower taxedjurisdictions, thus slowing the inexorable decline of capital income taxation resulting from thedevelopment of a world capital market. But it is difficult to distinguish between controls on capitalflows and flows related to trade. The growth of trade in services has highlighted the difficulty ofseparating currency trade-related flows from those representing investment. Thus, to be effective,capital controls are likely to impede trade flows. This would be a heavy price to pay and few countrieshave chosen to pay it.Permanent capital controls have other disadvantages. They forsake all the economic benefits of a freecapital market. And controls are never implemented by wise, or even merely clever, economists. Theyattract rent-seeking and corrupt behaviour in both official and private sectors. And they undermine thecause of market liberalisation. There is no shortage of protectionist tendencies that seek to limit tradeand investment. We should not add to them.So neither purist solution is likely to appeal – the one because there is insufficient political and financialsupport for an ILOLR, and the other because permanent controls go against the grain of promoting marketreforms and good governance.But the present system is not sustainable. The danger is that we have the worst of both worlds. The IMFmay lend large amounts, create moral hazard in doing so, and still not be able to ward off the threat offinancial crises. And faced with a run on their currency or banking system, countries may be forced totake unilateral action to suspend payments. So what to do?4.The middle wayGiven that neither purist approach is on the agenda, the international community has been trying to takesome practical steps forward. The aim is to reduce the frequency and severity of financial crises. Somemight describe this as muddling through. I prefer to call it the “middle way”. The difference is that themiddle way is based on the principle that if the emergency services will be slow to arrive then whicheverform of transport you care to think of, borrowing countries should drive slowly.How to encourage and enforce careful driving has been the subject of innumerable international meetings.Initially, the discussion took place in the G10, which, as you know, comprises eleven countries. Then lastyear the discussion was taken up by the G22. By the spring of this year that group had become the G33.Can you complete the sequence by guessing which international forum will take the lead next year?Suffice it to say that at the original Bretton Woods conference there were forty-four countries and it tookplace fifty-five years ago.In terms of practical steps forward, it is useful to distinguish between the prevention and resolution ofcrises. On the former, recent experience suggests five lessons for emerging markets:(1)Create a do-it-yourself (DIY) LOLR, with the aim of providing self-insurance against a liquiditycrisis. There are several ways of providing such insurance. One is to build up large foreigncurrency reserves. This has already been taken to heart by emerging markets. China hassubstantial foreign exchange reserves ($147 billion at the end of June). And Korea, perhaps thebest example of a country suffering a liquidity run on its banking system in terms of foreigncurrency, has raised its reserves from a low point of $7.3 billion in November 1997 to a currenthigh of $64.8 billion in August. It is unfortunate that the absence of more efficient solutions tothe risk of crises means that scarce capital might be deployed in this inefficient way. Buildingup net reserves – via current account surpluses – will reduce world demand at a time when the
BIS Review 95/19996US economy is unlikely to provide as large a stimulus as over the past five years. An alternativeis to create gross reserves by borrowing from abroad and investing the proceeds in liquidinternational securities. Both methods involve costs. A second approach to DIY LOLR is foremerging markets to create contingent credit facilities with international banks, as Argentina hasdone with its contingent repo facility, or try to set up collateralised loan facilities along the linessuggested by Martin Feldstein.6 A final approach to the DIY LOLR, in the absence of aneffective multilateral ILOLR, is the creation of regional self-insurance funds. All of theseapproaches are likely to be pursued, to a greater or lesser extent, in the wake of recent financialcrises.(2)Manage the national balance sheet and, as far as possible, avoid maturity and currencymismatches. For a country without a track record of international borrowing, it is important tomanage its external liquidity position, especially in foreign currency. The lack of foreignexchange controls means that it will be difficult to observe, let alone manage, the balance sheetof the entire private sector. But the key elements are those relating to the public and bankingsectors. Governments already have information on these sectors. As important as anything is theneed for self-awareness by the countries concerned of the state of their national balance sheetand the approach of impending liquidity difficulties. When governments and markets alike areinformed of the potential for future financing difficulties, both sides have time to takepreventive action. Of course, the use of derivative instruments and hedging techniques makesthe assessment of risk exposure more difficult. But the effort must be made. Alan Greenspan hassuggested that consideration be given to simple rules of thumb such as that countries without atrack record of international borrowing should maintain unencumbered foreign exchangereserves sufficient to meet all foreign currency liabilities over the following year, and that theaverage maturity of external liabilities should exceed three years. Rudiger Dornbusch hasproposed the use of value at risk assessments of country balance sheets. Ideas such as these,precisely because they focus on the national balance sheet, are sure to be centre stage.(3)Encourage inflows of equity rather than debt finance. This is an extension of the need to managethe national balance sheet. The imperative is the old adage: borrow long not short. A crediblelegal and institutional infrastructure for private investors would go a long way to encourageequity inflows. Reserve requirements on short-term debt inflows, as adopted in Chile, mighthelp to modify the pace of vulnerable capital inflows, but will in themselves do little to help intimes of rapid capital outflow. It is also time to reconsider the incentive to the provision ofshort-term finance provided by the Basel Accord risk weights.(4)Promote the better design of debt contracts which provide a framework for negotiation betweencreditors and debtors when financing difficulties arise. The particular proposal – advancedinitially by a G10 Deputies’ report in 1996 and subsequently endorsed by the G7 – for the use ofcollective action clauses in sovereign debt contracts has stalled. How far such clauses wouldhelp is unclear. Bonds issued under UK, but not US, law – currently these account for just under50% of the stock of emerging market eurobonds – generally include such clauses already. Buttheir widespread adoption looks unlikely, not least because of the reluctance of the G7 toincorporate such clauses into their own debt contracts. More productive in the short run is likelyto be the promotion of regular contacts between debtor countries and their creditors in goodtimes, well before any crisis occurs. State-contingent debt where returns are related to the priceof major exports is another possibility.(5)Avoid, at all costs, the defence of fixed but adjustable exchange rate pegs when they are nolonger consistent with internal and external equilibrium. Thailand shows the cost of a prolongedand ultimately unsuccessful attempt to defend its exchange rate. Brazil shows that there is lifeafter a fixed exchange rate. It is much too early to conclude that emerging markets have littleoption but to adopt the dollar as their currency.6 Feldstein, M (1999), “A self-help guide for emerging markets”, Foreign Affairs, March/April, 93-109.
7BIS Review 95/1999To these five imperatives, I have refrained from adding the mantra of better bankingsupervision. Of course, banking supervision should always strive to be better. But is it not timeto ask the question of whether the implicit government guarantee afforded to the bankingsystems of the major industrialised countries is itself not part of the problem. One of the factorscontributing to the scale of short-term debt flows to emerging markets is the moral hazardimplied by the financing of banks in the developed world. It is certainly crucial that internationalrescue packages do not lead to moral hazard in the provision of finance to emerging markets.But an important lesson for the G7 is that moral hazard starts at home.In the resolution of crises less progress has been made. The IMF can, and has, providedfinancial assistance without which the cost of recent crises to the affected countries would havebeen even greater. But the stumbling block has been how “to involve the private sector”.Although the statement by G7 finance ministers to the Cologne Summit in June set out both“principles” and “tools” for involving the private sector in crisis resolution, much remainsobscure. Unilateral debt moratoria can be damaging in terms of future access to capital flows.But there will be circumstances in which a debtor country and its creditors could benefit from ajoint resolution of temporary payments difficulties, and procedures are needed to prevent somecreditors from free-riding on others. The following four elements in crisis resolution merit someconsideration. They have no particular status, but are issues that need to be faced. The four are:(i)the provision of official finance should be linked to the involvement of othercreditors, including the private sector, in the resolution of crises. This can beachieved by the IMF setting a floor for the minimum level of foreign exchangereserves a country is required to maintain;(ii)the aim of resolution is to find a cooperative solution negotiated between a debtorand its creditors. No particular class of creditor should be in a privileged position,unless the instrument in question explicitly gives it preferred creditor status;(iii)the use of temporary standstills – possibly sanctioned by the internationalcommunity – would allow time for a country to negotiate with its creditors. In theabsence of a formal mechanism to achieve this, the IMF can indicate itsendorsement of a standstill by being prepared to provide new money to a countrywhich has temporarily suspended payments to its creditors (often referred to asIMF lending into arrears). By making standstills part of the furniture – or one of thebricks – they would be seen not as an ad hoc response, which might lead tocontagion in other emerging markets, but part of an approved process;(iv)measures, including perhaps strictly temporary capital controls, to prevent capitalflight by domestic residents in exceptional circumstances. It would be odd tosanction a standstill of payments to foreign creditors while allowing domesticresidents to move assets overseas without restriction.The essence of the middle way is to find practical steps forward to enable emerging markets to bettermanage the liquidity positions of their external liabilities, and to reduce their dependence on debt finance.Crises will still occur. But the aim is to reduce their frequency and severity. To that end there is onefurther policy which is fundamental to the success of the middle way – transparency.5.TransparencyTransparency is one of the most popular words in economic policy today. And for good reason. Much hasbeen said about transparency, and, interestingly, much has been done. Why is transparency so important?In itself, transparency will neither prevent nor resolve financial crises. But transparency can help reducethe frequency of crises – by alerting not only markets but also policymakers to problems on the horizon –and their severity – by minimising the surprises about the scale of any liquidity problems. In Korea, theforeign currency exposure of its banking system was not known until after the crisis had hit. And inThailand, the true state of the foreign exchange reserves was unknown even to its own finance ministry,
BIS Review 95/19998let alone financial markets. So transparency can be seen as a “second best” policy when purist solutions tofinancial crises are unavailable. It is in the context of the middle way that transparency comes into its own.The aims of transparency are to allow better informed decisions in both public and private sectors, toreduce the risk of contagion by allowing markets to differentiate among borrowers and to encouragemacroeconomic policy to become more predictable. Transparency is not simply a question of makingavailable certain data. It is an approach to economic policy, almost a way of life. The G22 Report of theWorking Group on Transparency and Accountability (which I was privileged to co-chair withAndrew Sheng of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority) was published in October 1998. Itsrecommendations were endorsed in full by the G7. It stressed the importance of transparency in threedifferent sectors: national governments, the private sector and the international financial institutions. Goodprogress has been made in implementing many of its recommendations.Rather than give an exhaustive account of progress in transparency, let me give a few examples. In Marchof this year, the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard was strengthened by the inclusion of atemplate covering the disclosure of net foreign exchange reserves and short-term foreign currencyliabilities of central government. These data are required to be published monthly with a lag of no morethan one month, and the transitional period for observing the standard runs to the end of March 2000.Agreement is very close on a Code of Monetary Policy Transparency to match the earlier Code on FiscalPolicy Transparency.BIS data on international banking statistics will be produced quarterly from next spring and the lag inpublication shortened. One of the three Financial Stability Forum Working Groups is considering thequality and timeliness of disclosure of exposures to and of highly leveraged institutions. This categoryincludes hedge funds. Proposals for direct regulation of internationally mobile funds are unlikely to beworkable. But many commentators remain suspicious, regarding such funds as like children playing justout of sight who are told – “I don’t know what you’re doing, but, whatever it is, stop it”.The IMF itself has become more open about the release of information. During an eighteen-monthexperiment countries will be able to publish their Article IV reports. And more background information,including policy papers and programme reviews, is now available. All this should improve thetransparency and accountability of national governments, the private sector and the IMF.But there is one further step on which progress is urgently required. In a world of sovereign states,countries cannot, and should not, be compelled to disclose information if they do not wish to do so. Butcountries should not be able to claim to be transparent when in fact they are not. A crucial substitute forthe inability to make transparency mandatory is that we need transparency about transparency. That iswhy the G22 Report recommended that the IMF – in the context of its Article IV consultations – prepare aTransparency Report for each country summarising the degree to which that economy complied withdisclosure standards and codes of conduct. The case for “transparency about transparency” is the case forhonesty in economic policy.Some progress has been made. Pilot transparency reports on the UK and Argentina have been producedby IMF staff. Other pilot reports are to come. Australia has published a self-assessment transparencyreport. The need now is to make the production of Transparency Reports an integral part of the Article IVprocess. There is no reason for further delay. Transparency Reports should always be published. I verymuch hope that the IMF will make rapid progress towards the regular production and publication ofTransparency Reports on each country. This practical measure could do a great deal to enhance theperformance of all economic actors involved in the international capital market.6.ConclusionsUnrestricted capital mobility and the absence of an ILOLR are not a recipe for a stable internationalfinancial system. Short-term interbank flows are the Achilles heel of present arrangements, leading to bothcurrency and maturity mismatches. Throw in a predilection of emerging markets for pegged exchangerates and you have a dangerous cocktail. Purist solutions – whether of an ILOLR or a return to permanentcapital controls – are, for good reasons, unlikely to be pursued. What is needed now are some practicalsteps forward. Central to any such programme is the need to monitor and manage the national balance
9BIS Review 95/1999sheet. The objective cannot be to eliminate the risk of financial crises. The middle way will not do that.But it can reduce the frequency and severity of crises. In this context transparency is important. There willstill be crises in the future, but transparency will reduce their costs and help to keep governments closer tothe straight and narrow. All central bankers will surely welcome that.Of course, the immediate crisis has receded, and some of the Asian countries, in particular, haverecovered sharply over the past year. But we should not be misled by the calm after the storm. There willbe future storms, and now is the time to prepare for them. There is no need for another internationalconference of the kind which led to the creation of the Bretton Woods institutions. But there remains aneed for thinking as original and imaginative as that which inspired the Bretton Woods conference. Themiddle way is a start, but no more.David Ignatius has written about the “founding generation”, people such as Dean Acheson and GeorgeC. Marshall, who created the great post-war institutions. All of those institutions have now passed theirfiftieth birthday. It is time to appraise carefully the architecture, foundations, plumbing and evenbricklaying of that inheritance. Ignatius described the qualities of the founding generation as “resolve andclarity”. Those qualities are still required. Dean Acheson entitled his memoirs, “Present at the Creation”.Let us hope that, similarly, a new generation of officials will be able, at some future date, to look back atthe creation of an open world economy in which financial crises were successfully contained. That wouldbe an achievement of which all economic bricklayers could be proud.
1BIS Review 94/1999Mr Greenspan discusses developments crucial tounderstanding the impressive economic record of the United StatesRemarks by Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem, at the Millennium Lecture Series, sponsored by the Gerald R. Ford Foundation and GrandValley State University at Grand Rapids, Michigan on 8 September 1999*      *      *Thank you for your kind welcome to Grand Valley State University and the Ford Museum MillenniumLecture Series.Over the past quarter-century I have appeared on many platforms with President Ford. He never seemsto change, but I keep losing my hair.Those of us who had the privilege to work closely in the White House with the 38th President of theUnited States gained a respect for his wisdom and integrity, not all of which came from his obviousgood judgment in marrying Betty. Hence it has been a special pleasure for me, and my FordAdministration colleagues, to see our view of Gerald Ford increasingly being shared by the Americanpeople and the rest of the world.When I was invited to participate in this series of lectures complementing the remarkable exhibitentitled “The American Century,” I was told to talk about anything I’d like. You will be pleased toknow that I resisted the temptation to prepare a discourse on the statistical discrepancy between grossdomestic product and gross domestic income. Instead, given that we are at the tipping point of a newcentury, I decided to speak about several developments that strike me as crucial to understanding thiscountry’s rather impressive economic record.It is safe to say that we are witnessing this decade, in the United States, history’s most compellingdemonstration of the productive capacity of free peoples operating in free markets. I said earlier thisyear that members of the graduating class of 1999 are being bequeathed the tools for achieving amaterial existence that neither my generation nor any that preceded it could have even remotelyimagined as we began our life’s work.The quintessential manifestations of America’s industrial might earlier this century – large steel mills,auto assembly plants, petrochemical complexes, and skyscrapers – have been replaced by a grossdomestic product that has been downsized as ideas have replaced physical bulk and effort as creatorsof value. Today, economic value is best symbolized by exceedingly complex, miniaturized integratedcircuits and the ideas – the software – that utilize them. Most of what we currently perceive as valueand wealth is intellectual and impalpable.The American economy, clearly more than most, is in the grip of what the eminent Harvard professorJoseph Schumpeter many years ago called “creative destruction,” the continuous process by whichemerging technologies push out the old. Standards of living rise when incomes created by theproductive facilities employing older, increasingly obsolescent, technologies are marshaled to financethe newly produced capital assets that embody cutting-edge technologies.This is the process by which wealth is created, incremental step by incremental step. It presupposes acontinuous churning of an economy as the new displaces the old. Although this process of productiveobsolescence has ancient roots, it appears to have taken on a quickened pace in recent years andchanged its character. The remarkable, and partly fortuitous, coming together of the technologies thatmake up what we label IT – information technologies – has begun to alter, fundamentally, the mannerin which we do business and create economic value, often in ways that were not readily foreseeableeven a decade ago.Before the advent of what has become a veritable avalanche of information technology innovation,most twentieth-century business decisionmaking had been hampered by dated and incomplete
BIS Review 94/19992information about customer preferences in markets and flows of materials through a company’sproduction systems. Relevant information was hours, days, or even weeks old. Accordingly, businessmanagers had to double up on materials and people to protect against the inevitable misjudgments thatwere part and parcel of production planning. Ample inventory levels were needed to ensure outputschedules, and backup teams of people and machines were required to maintain quality control andrespond to unanticipated developments.Of course, large remnants of imprecision still persist, but the remarkable surge in the availability ofreal-time information in recent years has sharply reduced the degree of uncertainty confrontingbusiness management. This has enabled businesses to remove large swaths of now unnecessaryinventory, and dispense with much programmed worker and capital redundancies. As a consequence,growth in output per work hour has accelerated, elevating the standards of living of the averageAmerican worker.Intermediate production and distribution processes, so essential when information and quality controlwere poor, are being bypassed and eventually eliminated. The proliferation of Internet web sites ispromising to alter significantly the way large parts of our distribution system are managed. Moreover,technological innovations have spread far beyond the factory floor and retail and wholesaledistribution channels. Biotech, for example, is revolutionizing medicine and agriculture, with farreaching consequences for the quality of life not only in the United States but around the world.The explosion in the variety of products of many different designs and qualities has opened up thepotential for the satisfaction of consumer needs not evident even a decade or two ago. Theaccompanying expansion of incomes and wealth has been truly impressive, though regrettably thegains have not been as widely spread across households as I would like.How is this remarkable economic machine to be maintained, and how can we better ensure that itsbenefits reach the greatest number of people?Certainly, we must foster an environment in which continued advances in technology are encouragedand welcomed. If, as I indicated in a commencement address this spring, the graduates of 1999 aregoing to be able to build on the accomplishments of their forebears, many of them must push forwardto expand our knowledge in science and engineering, and our universities must ready themselves tomeet the technical needs of our students yet to come.But scientific proficiency will not be enough. Skill alone may not be sufficient to move the frontier oftechnology far enough to meet the many challenges that our nation will confront in the decades ahead.And technological advances alone will not buttress the democratic institutions, supported by a rule oflaw, which are so essential to our dynamic and vigorous American economy. Each is merely a tool,which, without the enrichment of human wisdom, is of modest value.A crucial challenge of education is to transform skills and intelligence into wisdom – into a process ofthinking capable of forming truly new insights. But learning and knowledge – and even wisdom – arenot enough.National well-being, including material prosperity, rests to a substantial extent on the personalqualities of the people who inhabit a nation. Civilization, our civilization, rests on the presumption of aproductive interaction of people engaged in the division of labor, driven by a process economists labelcomparative advantage. This implies mutual exchange to mutual advantage among free people.To repeat what I said five years ago here in Grand Rapids before the Gerald R. Ford Foundation:institutions are needed that give free play to the inventive capacities of people and effectively promotethe translation of conceptual innovations into increased output of goods and services that are thelifeblood of material progress. What these particular institutions should be has not always been asclear as it is today. Much of this past century, in effect, has been a test of whether capitalist institutionsor more centrally planned socialist institutions would work better, over the long run, in serving theneeds of human society.Specifically, on 9 November 1989 the Berlin Wall came down, symbolizing the end of an experimentin social policy that began more than four decades earlier with the division of the states of Western
3BIS Review 94/1999and Central Europe into market economies and those governed by state central planning. At the end ofWorld War II, as Winston Churchill put it, “From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic an ironcurtain … descended across the Continent.” The economies on the Soviet side of the “curtain” hadbeen, in the prewar period, similar to the market-based economies on the western side. Over fourdecades both types of economies developed with limited interaction across the dividing line. It was asclose to a controlled experiment in economic systems as could ever be implemented.With the books now closed on this experiment, we of course have learned much about how communisteconomics works, or, more exactly, does not. How highly inefficient prior to 1989 the economies ofEastern Europe and the former Soviet Union were is best illustrated by the fact that energy consumedper unit of output was as much as five to seven times higher than in the West. Moreover, theexceptionally large amount of resources devoted to capital investment, without contributing to theproductive capacity of these economies, suggested that these resources were largely wasted.In addition, such gaps in efficiency actually understated the gap in performance because they failed totake into account the impact of industrial activity on the environment. The market economies of theWest have expanded resources to minimize the adverse impact of industrial activity on theenvironment. No such resource allocation was made in the Soviet bloc, and the cumulative effect ofthis neglect is appalling.At least for the foreseeable future, the experiment seems to have been concluded overwhelmingly infavor of the free-market capitalist institutions. The bottom line is that coercive societies rarely enhancethe state of what we call civilization. But neither do coercive relationships among people.It is decidedly not true that “nice guys finish last,” as that highly original American baseballphilosopher, Leo Durocher, was once alleged to have said. I do not deny that many in our societyappear to have succeeded in a material way by cutting corners and manipulating associates, both intheir professional and in their personal lives. But material success is possible in this world withoutexploiting others, and clearly, having a reputation for fair dealing is a profoundly practical virtue. Wecall it “good will” in business and add it to our balance sheets.Trust is at the root of any economic system based on mutually beneficial exchange. In virtually alltransactions, we rely on the word of those with whom we do business. Were this not the case,exchange of goods and services could not take place on any reasonable scale. Our commercial codesand contract law presume that only a tiny fraction of contracts, at most, need be adjudicated. If asignificant number of business people violated the trust upon which our interactions are based, ourcourt system and our economy would be swamped into immobility.It is not by chance that in nineteenth-century America, many bankers could effectively issueuncollateralized currency because they were able to develop a reputation that their word was theirbond. For these institutions to succeed and prosper, people had to trust their promise of redemption inspecie. Now, as then, a contractor with a reputation for shoddy work will not prosper long.In today’s world, where ideas are increasingly displacing the physical in the production of economicvalue, competition for reputation becomes a significant driving force, propelling our economyforward. Manufactured goods often can be evaluated before the completion of a transaction. Serviceproviders, on the other hand, usually can offer only their reputations.The extraordinarily complex machine that we call the economy of the United States is, in the end,made up of human beings struggling to improve their lives. The individual values of those Americansand their reputations will continue to influence the structure of the institutions that support markettransactions, as they have throughout our history. Without mutual trust, and market participantsabiding by a rule of law, no economy can prosper. Our system works fundamentally on individual fairdealing. We need only look around today’s world to realize how rare and valuable this is.While we have achieved much in this regard, more remains to be done. Considerable progress, forexample, has been evident in recent decades in the reduction of racial and other forms ofdiscrimination. But this job is still far from completion.
BIS Review 94/19994A free-market capitalist system cannot operate fully effectively unless all participants in the economyare given opportunities to achieve their best. If we succeed in opening up opportunities to everyone,our national affluence will almost surely become more widespread. Of even greater import is that allAmericans believe that they are part of a system they perceive as fair and worthy of support.Our forefathers bestowed upon us a system of government, and a culture of enterprise, that haspropelled the United States to the greatest prosperity the world has ever experienced. Thecontributions of our national leaders, people like President Ford, have sustained and promoted thatculture in the most difficult of circumstances and have given us the tools to improve upon thisinheritance in ways that we have yet to imagine.
1BIS Review 93/1999Mr Mboweni explains the position taken by theReserve Bank of South Africa on inflation targetingAddress by Mr Tito Mboweni, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, at the biennial Congressof the Economic Society of South Africa, Pretoria, on 6 September 1999.*      *      *IntroductionIn my Governor’s Address at the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders of the Reserve Bank on24 August 1999, I stated that it is advisable to move away from the “eclectic” or informal inflationtargeting monetary policy framework to formal inflation targeting. This change is necessary becausethe eclectic framework has at times created uncertainties about Reserve Bank decisions and actionswhich were perceived as being in conflict with the stated guidelines for the growth in money supplyand bank credit extension.The question may be asked whether the adoption of inflation targeting will lead to a more effectivemonetary policy? I believe that this will be the case and that inflation targeting should minimise thesocial and economic cost of achieving price stability. In my address this evening I want to explain thisposition that has been taken by the Reserve Bank by elaborating on the following aspects of inflationtargeting, namely:• What are the main characteristics of inflation targeting?• What are the advantages of inflation targeting?• Are there any disadvantages in shifting to an inflation targeting framework?• What are the preconditions that have to be met before implementing inflation targeting?• What factors should be taken into consideration with the implementation of inflationtargeting?Characteristics of inflation targetingA number of industrial countries, such as New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom, Sweden,Finland, Australia and Spain have adopted an inflation targeting framework during the 1990s. Morerecently some of the developing countries have also opted for this monetary policy framework. TheCzech Republic has operated a fully fledged inflation targeting regime since December 1997. Israel,Chile and Mexico are countries that have one-year inflation targets, while Poland, Hungary andrecently Brazil have multi-year inflation targets.The motives for the adoption of inflation targeting have varied considerably from country to country.In some countries, such as the United Kingdom and Sweden, the collapse of their exchange rates led toinflation targeting in order to assure the public that monetary policy would remain disciplined. Othercountries, such as Canada, introduced inflation targeting because of problems experienced with thetargeting of monetary aggregates.Whatever the motives of the countries were, the adoption of an inflation targeting strategy in all casesreduced the role of formal intermediate targets or guidelines, such as the exchange rate or the growthrate in money supply. Commitment to an intermediate target would be inconsistent with inflationtargeting except if it is the only determining factor of inflation. Obviously this is unlikely. Althoughgrowth in money supply is a precondition for a general rise in prices, it is not the only factor thatcauses inflation.
BIS Review 93/19992In an inflation targeting framework the central bank has to adopt a strategy of determining directlywhat the likely path of inflation will be. In inflation targeting close attention is typically given tochanges in indicators which in the past have affected inflation. This has led to sophisticated models forthe prediction of inflation and detailed assessments of factors that could affect it. The prediction ofinflation is of the utmost importance in the implementation of monetary policy because changes inpolicy measures are based on likely future price developments.The fact that inflation targeting has to rely on forecasting has led to the criticism that this is aweakness of the technique because forecasts are inherently unreliable. Although it is true that aninflation targeting framework is based on forecasts, it is also true that any other monetary policyframework has to take account of the fact that policy changes will only affect inflation some time inthe future. If the objective of the central bank is the attainment of financial stability, it will alwayshave to take a view on how its current policy stance will effect future price developments, whatevermonetary policy framework it decides to pursue. The difference between inflation targeting and othermonetary policy frameworks is that inflation targeting makes forecasting explicit and transparent.The adoption of inflation targeting by a central bank does not mean that the central bank must applydefinite rules and is not left with any discretion. Exclusive emphasis on inflation goals over theshort-term could lead to a highly unstable real economy in the case of serious supply shocks. If asevere supply shock hits the economy, keeping inflation close to the long-run target could be verycostly in terms of lost output. In such cases, some discretion must be applied. Many of the centralbanks opt for escape clauses in these circumstances. Others have defined the inflation target in such away that changes in food prices, the price of oil or the effects of value added tax are excluded from theindex that they target.The degree to which the central bank is held formally accountable for inflation outcomes variesconsiderably. In New Zealand the tenure of the Governor of the central bank is linked directly to theachievement of the inflation targets. In most other countries there are no explicit sanctions on centralbanks if they miss the target. However, missing the target by a very wide margin and consistentlywould, of course, lead to lost reputation or prestige and eventually perhaps to a request for theresignation of the officials involved in targeting. In most countries applying this framework it is stilltoo early to determine what prospective penalties will be applied.The achievement of the target is, however, also important because it affects the credibility of thecentral bank. An inflation targeting framework can only be successful if the public is convinced thatthe central bank is serious about containing inflation. This means that the government and the centralbank cannot simply change to inflation targeting without reference to anyone else. It must ensure thatthe ordinary people in the street are in favour of price stability. Any misconception that the centralbank is not concerned about economic growth and employment creation must be removed. It isimportant that the public does not get the impression that the central bank is dogmatic about thecontainment of inflation and does not care about other critical issues of importance to the economy.It is also important that the public is ensured that there are no hidden agendas, in other words that theobjectives stated will be the ones actually pursued. Bill Allen, an official of the Bank of England, atthe beginning of this year in a speech at the Reserve Bank indicated that this was a major issue in theUnited Kingdom when they adopted inflation targeting in 1992. This was partly due to their mixedhistorical record at that time in achieving monetary policy objectives and partly because monetarypolicy had traditionally been conducted in an environment of considerable mystery and secrecy.Fortunately, we have progressed somewhat on both these fronts in South Africa and there should notbe any difficulties in switching to inflation targeting.Advantages of inflation targetingWhat are the advantages of inflation targeting for South Africa? Firstly, inflation targeting canimprove the coordination between monetary policy and other macroeconomic policies depending onthe way the target is set and whether the target is consistent with other policy objectives. The setting ofinflation targets should preferably (but not compulsorily) be a joint effort between the government and
3BIS Review 93/1999the central bank. Inflation targeting will be most effective when economic policies are wellcoordinated. This coordination must be clearly spelled out and all stakeholders should be consulted,including business and the trade union movement.A formalised coordinated approach will probably lead to the best results. The Reserve Bank istherefore of the opinion that with the adoption of inflation targets a policy target agreement should bedrawn up that would be signed by the Minister of Finance on behalf of Cabinet and the Governor ofthe Reserve Bank to define precisely the coordinated effort needed to contain inflation in pursuit of thebroader economic objectives of sustainable high economic growth and employment creation. Whilethis agreement should define the practical implication of the Reserve Bank’s goal of price stability, itshould also guarantee the instrumental independence of the Reserve Bank.Secondly, the announcement of inflation targets clarifies the central bank’s intentions and reducesuncertainty about the future course of monetary policy. Inflation targets make policy transparent. Theymake the central bank’s intentions explicit in a way that should improve the planning of the privatesector.Thirdly, inflation targeting helps to discipline monetary policy and strengthens the central bank’saccountability. If targets are not met, the central bank has to explain what went wrong. This leads to abetter understanding on the part of the public on what basis monetary policy decisions were made.Disadvantages of inflation targetingAlthough inflation targeting has certain definite advantages when compared with other monetarypolicy frameworks, it could also have certain disadvantages. One of the limitations of inflationtargeting is that it is a complicated approach to implement. Although all monetary policy frameworksshould be forward looking, inflation targeting relies heavily on forecasts. Where inaccurate forecastsare made public it can obscure the central bank’s objectives and reduce its credibility.Compared with other monetary policy frameworks there is also the risk that inflation targeting couldlead to inefficient output stabilisation. This can occur particularly in the event of significant supplyshocks, such as sharp changes in the price of oil.Preconditions for inflation targetingIn view of these potential disadvantages of inflation targeting, it is important that certain preconditionsare met before a decision is taken to implement this framework. In this regard it is important that acentral bank is free to pursue financial stability. The inflation target may be jointly set by thegovernment and the central bank. However, once the target has been determined the central bankshould be free to use any instrument to achieve the ultimate objective.In the application of inflation targeting it is further important that there is a commitment by allauthorities to the objective of price stability. Preferably there should be close cooperation betweenmonetary policy and other policies, and in this coordinated effort the inflation objective should be aninherent part of overall policy.To implement inflation targeting it is important that well-developed financial markets exist in acountry. The policy instruments generally used by monetary authorities require effective money,capital and foreign exchange markets. If financial markets do not react quickly to the instrumentsapplied, it obviously reduces the effectiveness of monetary policy and leads to a delay in impacting oninflation.For the implementation of inflation targeting the central bank must have the necessary resources, i.e.human, technological, etc. Inflation targeting requires sophisticated forecasting models which needadvanced computer hardware and software. In developing economies in particular, this could be animportant constraint on the implementation of inflation targeting.
BIS Review 93/19994Fortunately, the Reserve Bank’s staff should be able to refine and strengthen the Bank’s forecastingframework, especially with the help of international experts in this field. The Bank has enoughexperience in information technology for the implementation of inflation targeting and the otherpreconditions are generally met in the case of South Africa.The implementation of inflation targetingBefore inflation targeting is implemented, it is important that:• a decision is taken on the inflation target that will be set;• a satisfactory forecasting framework is developed; and• a high degree of transparency is ensured.In all inflation targeting countries the practice has been to specify the target in terms of the consumerprice index, or some variant thereof. There is, however, no consensus on how inflation should bemeasured. Preferably the index should include a range of products whose prices fully describe changesin the cost of living and are generally accepted by the public. Including prices over which policy hasno control may lead to misleading signals when these prices move out of line. Policymakers in manyinstances have accordingly opted for a target that excludes certain measurable components that areeither unpredictable, volatile or unresponsive to policy.In addition, a choice has to be made between setting a single point or a target range. This choicereflects a trade-off – a narrower band may be interpreted as indicating a stronger commitment to theinflation target, but frequent breaches could undermine credibility. A fixed point target is much moredifficult to hit than a band. A single point provides the best focus for inflation expectations and avoidsthe disadvantage of a band which tends to concentrate expectations towards its upper boundary. Aband, however, leaves some discretion to the central bank and can provide more flexibility in the caseof unforeseen price shocks.It is also important to decide at what level the target should be set. Preferably it should rather be on thelow rather than on the high side. High targets may give the impression that the central bank is notserious about combatting inflation. It is accordingly better to lengthen the period over which the targetwill be reached than starting at too high a level.The implementation of inflation targeting requires that the authorities must be able to develop asatisfactory forecasting framework. Although South Africa has experienced major structural changesin recent years, it seems that we are in a position to forecast inflation. The Reserve Bank alreadymakes regular inflation forecasts using a large macroeconomic model which is based on a wide rangeof financial and economic equations. In the application of inflation targeting it will be prudent tosupplement this large model with a number of smaller and single equation models.Mervyn King, Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, recently stated that forecasting, more thanany other aspect of economics, brings the discipline into disrepute. Forecasts should not be presentedas a single number but rather as a probability distribution. The Bank of England has accordinglyadopted a so-called fan-chart forecasting technique which shows the relatively likelihood of possibleinflation outcomes. Careful consideration will have to be given to these techniques of other centralbanks before inflation targeting is introduced in South Africa.It is important that the Reserve Bank enhances transparency for the effective operation of an inflationtargeting framework. Transparency introduces predictability and helps to ensure that expectations areconsistent with the objective of price stability, thus lowering the cost of achieving the inflation target.As pointed out by prominent economists many years ago, monetary policy should avoid exacerbatingfluctuations of output and employment by introducing unnecessary uncertainty.A transparent monetary policy will mean that changes in short-term interest rates should not surprisethe market. Markets should be able to anticipate decisions taken by the Reserve Bank. Transparencyshould promote the predictability of policy. In this regard Mervyn King has stated that a successful
5BIS Review 93/1999central bank should be boring, it is like a referee whose success is judged by how little his or herdecisions intrude on the game.Although the Reserve Bank has progressed considerably in recent years in providing more detailedinformation to the market and in explaining its policy stance, the Bank has decided that with theintroduction of inflation targeting it will improve the transparency of monetary policy further byperiodic testimony to Parliament, the regular publication of a monetary policy review report andfocussed statements after the meetings of the Monetary Policy Committee. In both cases the Bank willprovide an assessment of how it perceives the underlying economic and financial conditions andexplain the monetary policy stance.ConclusionAlthough inflation targeting is a difficult monetary policy framework to apply in practice, most of thepreconditions for its implementation can be met in South Africa. Inflation targeting should lead tocloser economic coordination and greater transparency and accountability. It is, however, at the sametime important that our house is in order before we implement this framework. In other words we mustget our ducks in a row first.Thank you very much.
1BIS Review 92/1999Mr Mboweni speaks on the role of theSouth African Reserve Bank in developing the economySpeech given by Mr Tito Mboweni, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank at the Western CapeExporter of the year awards dinner on 1 September 1999.*      *      *Many central bank governors fight a constant battle against public misconceptions about the centralbank’s role in the economy. After only a short period in the job, I have realised that I, too, will havemy work cut out for me in explaining the South African Reserve Bank’s responsibilities.As I discovered last week when I took part in a phone-in programme on SABC radio, there are peoplewho mistakenly believe the Bank can provide them with personal loans, or loans for their businesses. Ihad to explain that I am not a personal banker with a limitless cheque book.I was also worried to find that some of the callers did not have a good understanding of therelationship between interest rates and inflation. Once again, I realised the need for education and forcontinued emphasis on the Bank’s main task – the achievement and maintenance of financial stability.There might be people who are getting bored with my message. But I think it is well worth repeating,as even people with a good understanding of the economy sometimes expect us to be miracle-workerswho will bring new life to the economy.When I was invited to speak here tonight, my hosts asked me to talk about the role of the central bankin developing the economy, with a particular focus on exports. As was highlighted in the Governor’sAddress last week, the central bank’s main contribution to economic development and export growthis to achieve price stability.That must come as a disappointment to those exporters here tonight who hoped I would say somethingabout the rand’s exchange rate against the currencies of SA’s major trading partners.The best that I can do on the topic of the exchange rate is to recount a story about the euro, which hasrecovered somewhat from its weakness against the dollar. Please bear in mind that I tell the story withmy tongue firmly in my cheek.Research published last week by 4Cast, a London-based economic consultancy, suggests that aninverse relationship has developed between the performance of the euro and the frequency ofstatements by European Central Bank officials about the currency. The periods during which centralbank officials kept quiet about the euro coincided with relative stability or appreciation of the euroagainst the dollar. The researchers were worried that when the ECB officials return from their summerholidays and start talking again, the currency could resume its slide to parity with the dollar.I know there are people who might try to read some deeper meaning into that story. I tell this storysimply to illustrate that I believe “less is more” when it comes to comments on the rand.The only comment I will make is to reaffirm that we will not set targets, formal or informal, for theexchange rate. As you know, we have started making preparations for implementing inflation targetingas our monetary policy framework. We believe the inflation targeting route is incompatible with tryingto force the currency into a straightjacket. And, in any case, fixed exchange rates are globallybecoming a thing of the past as more and more countries move towards flexible exchange ratesystems.In the Governor’s Address last week, we outlined our approach to inflation targeting and we reportedon the organisational changes being made to the monetary policy decision-making process.We also noted that the South African economy had recovered remarkably well from the effects offinancial turbulence in Asia and Russia. Many tentative signs of a return to financial stability hadappeared in the economy.
BIS Review 92/19992This was again confirmed by July’s money supply and bank credit figures which became availableyesterday. These figures show that for the first time since 1993, total bank credit extension increasedat a rate of below 10%. This is good news indeed.The markets have by now digested last week’s Address. We have noted that analysts andcommentators welcomed the decision to formalise monetary policy decisions by establishing aMonetary Policy Committee, or MPC, which will comprise the governor, the deputy governors andsenior bank officials.However, market participants are apparently disappointed by our decision not to publish the minutesof the MPC meetings.There are costs and benefits for the Reserve Bank to publish the minutes of internal meetings. In theinterests of greater policy transparency, we will issue brief statements to the public at regular intervalsto provide information on overall economic conditions and the monetary policy stance. Thesestatements will usually follow MPC meetings, which will take place every six weeks.Frequent and predictable communication with the financial markets is not the only way in which wehope to achieve better public understanding of monetary policy. Regular reporting to Parliament’sfinance portfolio committee meetings, which are open to the media and the public, is anotherimportant component of getting our message across. That is why I was pleased to accept the portfoliocommittee’s invitation to brief its members in Parliament and take questions on the Governor’sAddress later this month.The release last week of the Governor’s Address and the Annual Economic Report was a goodopportunity to take stock of the economy after a particularly difficult time.As exporters, you will know that global demand for South Africa’s exports suffered a severe setbackin the second half of last year as a result of the turmoil in international financial markets.As a result of the crisis in Asia, the share of South African exports destined for Asian countries,including Japan, declined from more than 21% of total exports in the third quarter of 1997 to about15% in the fourth quarter of last year. African economies were also experiencing hard times, and thecontribution of exports to Africa fell slightly to below 14% of total exports over the same period.South African exporters did, to some extent, offset the effects of the recession in these economies byredirecting trade flows to markets less affected by the crisis. Exports to the United States, for example,increased by about 30% in rand terms between 1997 and 1998.But the effects of the global crisis and continued buoyancy in imports were such that the annualisedcurrent account deficit swelled to 2.6% of gross domestic product in the second half of last year.Although the deficit was not large by international standards, it nevertheless raised concerns that thelevel of spending, especially on public sector capital formation, could not be sustained.Last year’s tightening in monetary policy, and the improvement in international economic conditionsas the turmoil in financial markets subsided, caused a marked recovery in the current account this year.The improvement in the current account reflected a revival in international demand for South Africanexports and a significant contraction in local demand for imports.Export volumes rebounded satisfactorily in the first quarter of this year, but lost some momentum inthe second quarter, when the current account slipped into deficit again.It seems that the current account may remain in deficit for the remainder of the year, although exportsshould still benefit from the lagged effects of the rand’s depreciation, the resurgence of foreigndemand and an increase in international commodity prices.As the lagged effects of interest rate cuts continue feeding through to economic activity and therecovery gains momentum, the demand for imports can be expected to strengthen. The turnaround inthe inventory cycle, which appears to have begun in the second quarter of this year, will heighten localdemand for imports.
3BIS Review 92/1999The deficit on the current account should be financed comfortably by net capital inflows. Barring anyunforeseen shocks on the international front, the South African economy has entered a period of morerapid growth coupled with a fairly comfortable balance of payments situation.But the expected increase in the economic growth rate from last year’s paltry half-a-percent will fallfar short of the levels needed to make inroads into South Africa’s high unemployment rate. Many ofour people remain poverty-stricken, living below the breadline in makeshift shacks that do little tokeep out the winter cold. To them, the concept of financial stability might be remote, but the only wayin which their lot can be improved on a sustainable basis is if the Reserve Bank does not deviate fromits course.Globalisation of financial markets means that countries that are out of step with the rest of the worldwill be punished swiftly and severely. For our part, we must continue policies and programmes tocontain inflation. We must also maintain sound and efficient financial institutions and markets.In other words, the main thrust of monetary policy has to be the maintenance of financial stability –that is, stability of prices, financial institutions and financial markets. Ladies and gentlemen, everytime you invite me to occasions such as these, expect to hear the same thing.Thank you.
1BIS Review 92/1999Mr Bäckström elucidates the economic situation in Swedenand describes the consequences it may have for future monetary policySpeech given by Mr Urban Bäckström, Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank at Föreningssparbanken,Ulricehamn on 1 September 1999.*      *      *First a word of thanks for the invitation to visit Ulricehamn and talk about something that is close tothe heart of a Riksbank governor, namely Sweden’s economic situation. I shall be describing thesituation as I see it and saying something about the consequences it may have for future monetarypolicy.Unexpectedly strong trendThe new statistics in recent months show that economic activity is stronger than most forecasters hadforeseen as recently as in the spring. The growth of both domestic and external demand has beenhigher than expected. Relative to the first half of 1998, the GDP growth rate for the first six months ofthis year is an estimated 3.7%.Most observers are in the process of revising their forecasts upwards, if they have not already done so.In the Inflation Report last June the Riksbank judged that growth this year would reach 2.5%, followedby 3% next year as well as in 2001. When the Executive Board discussed monetary policy on12 August, however, our assessment was that this year’s growth rate would be 3.5%. We also sawgrounds for an upward revision of growth in the next two years, though the prospects for that periodare more uncertain.It is not just total output that has exceeded expectations. The same applies to employment. In the firsthalf of 1999 there were approximately 100,000 new jobs compared with the same period last year.Much of the increase occurred in the private sector. This has been accompanied by decreasedunemployment, if one disregards the temporary seasonal upturn during the summer. However, thereduction of unemployment is less marked than the increase in employment because many people arereturning to the labour market now that jobs are becoming available.Meanwhile, price increases have been moderate. The underlying rate of inflation (UNDIX, whichmeasures inflation excluding interest expenditure, indirect taxes and subsidies) fluctuated during thespring between 12-month figures of 1.0 and 1.5%. Other indexes also point to low inflation, despite anincrease in some commodity prices, oil in particular.Altogether, then, the Swedish economy is developing very well. We are now entering the seventh yearof favourable economic growth – an average annual rate of about 3% – since the upturn in the summerof 1993. Today, moreover, there is no immediate threat to price stability.Market interest rates risingThe better economic situation and expectations that inflationary pressure will be somewhat higher thanbefore have caused a worldwide increase in market rates of interest. Sweden is no exception. Duringthe summer the five-year T-bond rate, for example, has moved up just over 1.0 percentage point.Along with this increase, the spread between T-bond and other interest rates has widened. In otherwords, the rates for long borrowing by housing institutes and firms have risen relatively more than therate the Treasury has to pay for government borrowing with the same maturity. Since June, the rate fora five-year housing bond has moved up around 1.3 percentage points.
BIS Review 92/19992Similar shifts have been noted in the international financial markets. Spreads of this kind often tend towiden when the future path of interest rates becomes more uncertain. Besides the uncertainty aboutinterest rate tendencies in the cyclical upswing, a contribution to the wider spreads is said to havecome from the turn of the millennium: concern about limited liquidity at the turn of the year isconsidered to induce some investors and borrowers to try to carry out transactions earlier.In this context I should like to take the opportunity to underscore that the Riksbank, with itsresponsibility for monetary policy and financial stability, has the instruments that are needed tomanage any liquidity problems that may arise. Together with the extensive preparatory work that hasbeen done in the financial sector, this means that the turn of the millennium should not be seen as aserious problem.The revised expectations of future inflationary pressure have entailed an adjustment of expectationsabout monetary policy. Price setting in the financial markets includes built-in expectations that in thecoming years many central banks, including the Riksbank, will be raising their instrumental rates.A point worth noting is that, if they continue, today’s higher market interest rates will have a directimpact on inflation from household interest expenditure, just as the recent years’ steeply fallinginterest rates had a sharp downward effect on inflation. In that case, the higher interest expenditurewould pull CPI inflation upwards fairly rapidly towards the targeted rate and above inflation’sunderlying rate (UNDIX). Monetary policy would then face the same situation, albeit in reverse, as onso many occasions in the recent past. An attempt to counter the tendency by tightening the monetarystance would accentuate the direct impact and add to the increase in CPI inflation. That is why it isinflation excluding transitory factors that is the focal point for monetary policy.Central issues for monetary policy in an upward phaseAbout a fortnight ago the Executive Board of the Riksbank confirmed that the stronger growth canlead to increased price pressure. Monetary policy may accordingly need to be conducted in a lessexpansionary direction in the future.But the Board also emphasised that the Swedish economy is not yet in such a situation. The trade-offbetween inflation and growth is uncertain and earlier relationships therefore have to be tested in thelight of new information.I consider that this conclusion still holds.When the Riksbank begins to talk of a less expansionary monetary stance, I can imagine it raises anumber of questions. I should like to take this opportunity of discussing some of them.One such question could be: Why must the Riksbank spoil the party? The Swedish economy hasfinally begun a period of good growth, rising employment and decreased unemployment, whileinflation is low. So why do central bank representatives have to talk about the need to raise the interestrate in such a situation? May it not lead to a renewed increase in unemployment?Another question is how strongly the Swedish economy can expand without risks for inflation. Can itbe the case that even the Swedish economy is displaying new tendencies, as certain observers arguehas happened in the United States, that is, that growth can be higher without inflation taking off? If so,why is the Riksbank talking of a need to raise interest rates?Let me begin with the first question.Why spoil the party?History teaches that when the growth of demand outpaces the economy’s long-term output trend, thisleads in time to risks of capacity shortages and bottlenecks that result in turn in rising prices andwages. At the same time, as it takes one to two years for an adjustment of the instrumental rate toaffect the economy, the central bank’s monetary policy decisions have to be based on assessments ofthe future. Faced with the risk of a situation of this type occurring, it is therefore better to try to slow
3BIS Review 92/1999things down with a small interest rate increase at an early stage. Demand growth can then be broughtinto line with the growth of production capacity and result in a more stable path. By acting in goodtime in a manner that is predictable, it is hopefully possible to avoid interest rate adjustments that aremore drastic. Meanwhile, economic agents can continue to count on stable, low inflation.An example of the good results that can be achieved with a forward-looking monetary policy is the USeconomy. With a judicious and timely tightening of the monetary stance, the Federal Reserve hascontributed to a long period of sustainable growth. Since the gradual increase from 3% between 1993and 1994, the fed funds rate has fluctuated between around 4.5 and 6%. This has accompanied anotably good economic development, with the longest postwar period of unbroken growth. The latentinflationary pressure has been held in check without arresting growth. Similar reasoning lay behindlast week’s interest rate increase. The positive trend has been aided by the consolidation of federalfinances.On the other hand, if inflation has already risen to a high level that is expected to last, the central bankmay have to resort instead to larger interest rate increases to signal its determination to fulfil theinflation target. That weakens economic activity and risks a renewed increase in unemployment.Thus far the argument – and the question of which alternative is most advantageous – seems fairlysimple. But that is where the difficulties begin. How is the central bank to arrive at an interest rateincrease that is appropriate in its timing as well as its size? A large, abrupt increase might lead todemand being curbed too early and too much, along with the risk of inflation falling below the pricestability target of 2%1. That is naturally not desirable. Which brings me to the second question: Whatrate of GDP growth can the Swedish economy sustain without inflation taking off?How strongly can the Swedish economy grow?In situations involving rapid changes, there is a tendency to affix labels such as the new economy. Thelogical implication is the existence of an old economy that works less well. I find this misleading.There have been periods in Sweden’s economic history when the economy performed exceedinglywell; one example is the 1950s and 1960s. There have also been periods that were less successful, forinstance the 1970s and 1980s.The concept of a new economy might be apposite if the comparison is confined to the present and thepreceding decade. There are signs that the Swedish economy is functioning better in the 1990s than itdid in the 1980s. But what does this concept actually stand for?One of the many interpretations of the new economy is that long-term growth’s trajectory has shiftedupwards on account of a better productivity trend. For a given input of the production factors labourand capital, the economy is able to sustain higher overall growth. It follows that if the supply side ofthe economy works better, then its demand side can expand more rapidly without leading tobottlenecks and inflation.One of the driving forces behind the new and better functioning of the US economy is sometimes saidto be the rapid advances in data and telecommunications. By improving production and distributionprocesses, the innovations are seen as a basis for stronger productivity growth.Some consider that, for the United States, the potential growth rate has been raised from 2 to 3%. Italso looks as though the potential growth rate for Sweden has become somewhat higher – stillcompared with the 1980s – but it does not seem to have reached an annual rate of as much as 3%.1I refer here, not to the consumer price index but to an index of underlying or core inflation, e.g. UNDIX, which StatisticsSweden publishes regularly on behalf of the Riksbank. That index excludes house mortgage interest expenditure andindirect taxes. If the Riksbank were to raise the interest rate prematurely, the resultant increase in house mortgageexpenditure could cause the CPI to overshoot the target, while UNDIX is on the low side. This is the reverse of thesituation in recent years when the interest rate was lowered.
BIS Review 92/19994A common, but not entirely certain estimate is that today the Swedish economy can sustain an annualgrowth rate of between 2 and 2.5%. Growth above this level leads to decreased unemployment andvice versa. But it is not just the strength of demand growth that determines the level of unemployment.Other factors, such as economic structures, are also involved and at some level of unemployment theonly result of additional growth stimuli is bottlenecks and shortages. Wage costs will then rise in away that conflicts with low and stable inflation.The GDP growth rate of 3.7% for the first half of this year accordingly exceeds any reasonableassessment of the Swedish economy’s long-term potential. For a time, however, such a high growthrate can be feasible if firms are able to recruit the necessary labour, for instance because the economyis recovering from a situation with high unemployment. That has been the case in Sweden’s labourmarket and pressure from wages and prices has thereby been able to remain low. Neither are anydramatic changes foreseen in respect of wages in the near future. But how long can this situation lastin the present economic upswing? How far can unemployment be reduced without firms encounteringrecruitment problems more generally?Even with the high unemployment at present, it is, for example, already difficult to recruit computerconsultants and some other occupational categories. The situation in certain segments of theStockholm labour market is also tighter than in other parts of Sweden. But so far, the bottleneckproblems seem to be fairly restricted. As yet there are no indications of more widespread shortages. Itis a positive sign that the matching of job seekers and job vacancies is still running comparativelysmoothly, as it is that although the shortages of skilled workers in manufacturing have grown, the levelremains relatively low. To date this year, moreover, the wage drift statistics show increases that arelower than expected.Good credibility promotes price stabilityExperience from the 1990s and earlier periods demonstrates that the relationships which arediscernible in economic models have to be constantly questioned and reviewed. Above all, they cannever be adopted uncritically when forecasting the future. So much happens in different economies,not least as regards economic policies, that earlier truths have to be reassessed continuously.Inflation has been subdued in recent years for a number of reasons. Imported inflation has been lowbecause of subdued commodity prices in connection with the Asian crisis. Productivity growth inSweden has been better than before. Another major factor is the increased confidence in monetarypolicy and economic policy in general. All the survey data, as well as the underlying trend in marketprices, show that no one expects inflation in the somewhat longer run to be anything but 2%.The inflation target accordingly seems to constitute a clear anchor for price formation. In the 1970sand 1980s, inflation prospects did not depend on the level of domestic economic activity alone.Relatively abrupt shifts in more long-term inflation expectations also played a part. Today, there areno abrupt shifts of that kind. Economic players simply count, with good reason, on the Riksbankacting if signs of rising inflation were to appear. In such a world, overall price formation centres aboveall on the level of economic activity. The improved credibility is thus a further factor that may havecontributed to a level of inflation that is lower despite relatively strong growth.At the same time, the Riksbank has the major responsibility of keeping a close eye on the morelong-term inflation expectations in order to maintain the credibility that has been built up in recentyears.Demand assessments difficultA question that naturally has to be included in the assessments is whether the stronger growth ofdemand we have experienced, not least this year, will last. An important matter to bear in mind in thiscontext is that as long as the monetary stance is expansionary, demand growth will normally be aboveits sustainable level. But some restrictive effect has, of course, already started to come from the higherbond rates in recent months.
5BIS Review 92/1999However, both the Swedish and the international economy can be exposed to unforeseen shocks. Weneed to remember that no one foresaw either the extent or the course of the crisis in Asia. Neither wasattention drawn at an early stage to the risks behind last autumn’s international financial unrest. Ourknowledge about phenomena of this type is still limited. It may be asked whether we shall ever becapable of making definite predictions in this field. The models being tested at present are simply toorough and ready. They tend to sound the alarm about events that never occur and miss those thatactually happen.Although the picture looks bright, we know there are countries in the global economy that arevulnerable, with a situation that may deteriorate. Share prices, moreover, have climbed very high, notleast in the United States. There are also imbalances in the US economy that may affect the futurecourse of events.There is also the possibility, however, of demand growth in Sweden becoming even stronger. We donot know how other components of economic policy will be constructed in detail. I am thinking inparticular of the current discussion about the direction of tax policy. The Riksbank is in no wayopposed to tax cuts. On the contrary, strategic tax reductions could make the Swedish economyfunction better and thereby lead to higher growth. But we have a duty to issue a warning about a taxpolicy that would give additional force to a growth of consumption that is already rapid and therebylead to economic overheating in Sweden. At the same time, I believe that decision-makers are awareof these risks.Taken together, all these factors make it difficult to assess the future development of demand. So thereis reason to monitor developments closely.ConclusionAt present I do not for my part see any direct, immediate threat to price stability in the Swedisheconomy. But I do believe that a continuation of strong demand growth, with all else equal, requiresthe members of the Riksbank’s Executive Board to consider how we can best ensure that economicgrowth in Sweden remains stable. How soon and with what safety margin shall demand be broughtback to the rate that is sustainable in the long run? Do we need to take out the insurance provided byan early, small adjustment of the interest rate? Or can we wait? That is something about whichopinions can differ slightly.In my opinion, there is no reason as yet to reduce the expansionary effect on the Swedish economythat monetary policy is currently exerting. A monetary policy adjustment will indeed be called for atsome time in the economic upswing but I still see its timing as an open question. My colleagues and Ion the Executive Board, as well as all those who analyse us, must follow the incoming statisticsclosely. New knowledge and new insights must be continuously woven into the analysis.Maintaining price stability, as the law prescribes, accordingly means that the Riksbank delivers itscontribution to making growth in the Swedish economy sustainable.
1BIS Review 90/1999Ms Hessius speaks about the monetary policy and growth conditionsfor Sweden’s economySpeech given by Ms Kerstin Hessius, Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank at the Chairmens’Conference of the Västmanland’s Local Authorities Association on 27 August 1999.*   *   *The whole speechThe bright picture of the Swedish economy that has been coming to the fore in recent years now seemsto be becoming increasingly distinct. Growth is stable and employment is rising, accompanied by priceincreases that are moderate. It is important now that this bright picture can become permanent and thatthe work of creating good conditions for long-term economic development continues. Today I shall beconsidering the economic situation in Sweden and the rest of the world, with some discussion of theconditions for consolidating the favourable trend.Functions of the RiksbankEver since Sweden abandoned the fixed exchange rate regime in November 1992, monetary policy hasbeen conducted with its sights on inflation. Sweden was one of the first countries to adopt an inflationtargeting strategy. In many respects, the period with the inflation target has been characterised by goodresults in the Swedish economy. Interest rates and inflation have fallen to levels that are historicallylow and, after the crisis in the early 1990s, growth has been comparatively high and stable. Thegeneral public’s expectations of inflation two years ahead are below 2%, which suggests that theinflation targeting policy has achieved credibility – a matter that is crucial for monetary policy’sability to produce good results.The foundation for monetary policy credibility has been strengthened in that the new legislation inforce from the beginning of this year has created a more independent central bank. Maintaining pricestability is now the Riksbank’s statutory function.The Riksbank has defined its target as being to keep annual inflation, expressed as the change in theconsumer price index (CPI), at 2%. The ambition to keep inflation low stems from the insights aboutinflation’s harmful effects on the economy – that higher growth and employment cannot be generatedin the longer run by means of higher inflation. It is other matters, such as how the economy functions,achievements in technology and the educational system, that determine those factors. The best way formonetary policy to contribute to high growth and employment is therefore to improve the long-termgrowth potential via low inflation.To achieve its objective, the Riksbank uses its instrumental rate, the repo rate. If the Riksbank’smonetary stance is unduly expansionary, that is, if the repo rate is too low to ensure macroeconomicbalance, in time the economy will be liable to overheat. Demand then grows more rapidly thanproduction capacity and this generates inflationary pressures. If, instead, the Riksbank’s monetarystance is unduly restrictive, that is, if the repo rate is set too high, the result may be declining demand,a weaker price trend and unsatisfactory growth.The full effect of an interest rate adjustment takes between twelve and twenty-four months tomaterialise. This means that the interest rate has to be set on the basis of the Riksbank’s assessment ofthe macroeconomic trend and inflation prospects in that period. However, the inflation assessments aresubject to uncertainty and this risk spectrum has to be considered too. Since December 1997 theRiksbank’s inflation forecast includes what is known as an uncertainty interval. This intervalrepresents the Riksbank’s assessment of the uncertainties in the forecast.
BIS Review 90/19992Targeting CPI inflation, however, has certain drawbacks. At the beginning of this year the ExecutiveBoard of the Riksbank therefore clarified the inflation target in some respects, stating that, undercertain specific circumstances, the Riksbank may have grounds for interpreting the CPI target moreflexibly. Price formation in the past three years, for example, has been affected by some clearlyidentifiable price movements that monetary policy neither can nor shall aim to counter in full. Thisapplies mainly to decreased indirect taxes and the direct effects that the Riksbank’s own interest rateadjustments exert on interest expenditure and thereby on CPI inflation.The economic situation in SwedenLabour marketAs I mentioned earlier, monetary policy’s primary contribution to the development of employment liesin creating conditions for a stable economic trend. A predictable monetary policy, focused on a clearlydefined inflation target, provides good guidance for wage negotiations. One of the main reasons whywage formation did not function satisfactorily during most of the 1980s was probably that stabilisationpolicy did not work. Inflation exceeded the official target on several occasions in that period and thelabour market organisations had difficulty in discerning the rules of the game. One example of this isthe government ambition of bringing inflation down in the mid-1980s: a crisis package was presentedin 1983, aimed at inflation rates of 4% in 1994 and 3% in 1995; when inflation exceeded these targets,the employee organisations considered that a 5% ceiling on wage increases was no longer acceptable.Today’s confidence in the Riksbank’s current inflation target facilitates wage negotiations. The 1997wage round, for instance, took the 2% inflation target as a starting point.The development of wages is always a central factor in inflation assessments, but the difficultiesinvolved in forecasting wages are considerable. The indicators used by the Riksbank include data onwages and unit labour costs, shortage figures (bottlenecks) at industry level, wage drift andunemployment relative to unfilled job vacancies. Another factor of importance for monetary policy isthe equilibrium level of unemployment, that is, the level of unemployment that is compatible withstable inflation. Attempts to push unemployment down below the equilibrium level with the aid ofmonetary stimuli are liable to just boost inflation. Maintaining an expansionary monetary stancecannot therefore generate permanently higher employment.During the past year the situation in the Swedish labour market has improved appreciably. Since thebeginning of 1999 the number in employment has risen by almost 100,000. A continued improvementcan be expected, but more employers are reporting difficulties in recruiting qualified labour eventhough unemployment in Sweden is still historically high. There is still a need for measures of astructural nature to improve the workings of the labour market and thereby the long-term conditionsfor economic growth.ConsumptionThe demand side of the Swedish economy, above all private sector demand, has picked up properly inrecent years. In 1997 private consumption rose 1.6% from the previous year, followed by 2.4% in1998 and a preliminary rate of 3.4% between the first halves of 1998 and 1999. Major factors behindthe growth of private consumption are the better labour market situation, rising disposable income andincrements to household wealth.The consumption trend is particularly dependent on future household income. Expectations of animprovement will lead to increased spending on consumption at the expense of current saving.At present, households’ optimism about their own economy seems to have stabilised at a level that ishistorically high. The Riksbank envisages that household expenditure on consumption will bestimulated in the future by, for example, rising real wages, low interest costs and tax relief. Moreover,international economic prospects have stabilised and employment in Sweden has risen. Thesedevelopments suggest that the consumption trend will remain favourable.
3BIS Review 90/1999Public sectorThe financial position of the public sector has been strengthened appreciably in recent years, partly asa result of decreased unemployment, but also because interest expenditure on government debt hasbeen reduced as a consequence of lower interest rates and debt repayment. This has been accompaniedby comparatively high tax payments from households as well as the corporate sector. For 1998 thefinancial surplus – measured as public sector revenue less expenditure – was almost SEK 40 billion,which is equivalent to over 2% of GDP.In recent years the central government budget process has been changed with a view to tightening thecontrol of government spending. The new budget process includes a spending ceiling that sets themaximum level for central government expenditures. In addition to the new budget process, the goalhas been established of achieving a general government financial surplus equivalent to 2% of GDPover the business cycle. Thus, the goal is formulated in terms of the average over the business cycle,not as an annual target.These rules do not owe their existence to happenstance. Both the expenditure ceiling and the goal of agovernment financial surplus over the business cycle serve to promote greater confidence in economicpolicy. The direction of budget policy, like the monetary stance, is highly important for economicdevelopments. The observance of these rules is important. Stable fundamental rules encourageeconomic agents to make long-term decisions.The international situationFavourable conditions in the rest of the world are of course of major importance for economic growthin Sweden.In the euro area there are now also increasing signs that activity is picking up. Incoming statistics onconfidence indicators, for instance from Italy, France and Germany, show that households as well asfirms foresee a brighter future than before.Moreover, the Japanese economy seems to be recovering from its poor performance in recent years.Still, the latest statistics suggest that the trend for manufacturing output remains weak, making itadvisable to wait for further statistics before taking a Japanese upswing as given.The US economy remains strong. GDP growth in the first quarter this year was over 4% and over 2%in the second quarter. Household expenditure on consumption has gone on rising more rapidly thancurrent income, so saving has fallen and is now at a record low. This has been accompanied by a weakprice trend for a majority of goods. Nevertheless, the US Federal Reserve now considers thatinflationary pressure is building up. At the two most recent meetings the Federal Reserve has raisedinterest rates in order to forestall an unduly rapid increase in consumer prices.New economic relationships?The prolonged strength displayed by the US economy has been unexpected. In the past five years USeconomic growth has averaged an annual rate of over 3%. At the same time, the average rate of CPIinflation has been little more than 2%.Some observers consider that this performance represents a new economic era in which high economicgrowth and falling unemployment can be achieved without generating increased inflationary pressure.According to this view, potential output has risen in recent years, accompanied by a fall in equilibriumunemployment. Explanations for this could be, for example, improved productivity as a result of newtechnology and increased international competition. An alternative explanation is that transitoryfactors, such as the loss of global demand in connection with the crisis in Southeast Asia, have causedprices to fall or remain unchanged.In Sweden, too, economic growth since the mid-1990s has been comparatively good withoutinflationary pressure giving cause for concern. The monetary stance has been adjusted accordingly and
BIS Review 90/19994the repo rate is currently 2.9%. It is too early, however, to say whether or not this is a sign of some far-reaching change in the Swedish economy. The Riksbank will have to take a close look at the incomingstatistics and endeavour to arrive at a conclusion.ConclusionThere are many signs that the Swedish economy is growing more rapidly. It is only now that we arebeginning to see growth rates above 3%. For the Riksbank – as well as for the economy in general – itis important that this trend does not again land us in a situation where inflation is high and variable.Provided the cards are played correctly, growth can be sustained and lead to a permanent increase inemployment.This calls for an adjustment of demand to the economy’s productive capacity. It is important thatstructural measures which primarily improve the workings of the economy are implemented in goodtime. The good consumption trend can then be met by rising output and high growth can bemaintained without this necessarily leading to unduly high inflation.As I have already made clear on several occasions, I consider that tax cuts, in tune with the establishedguidelines for budget policy, are motivated. The tax-to-GDP ratio has risen in recent years as aconsequence of the growth of private consumption and rising wage bills; today the ratio is above 50%.The Swedish economy would probably function better with lower taxes.The reforms that are needed in the tax system – as well as those I consider should occur in the labourmarket – can be arranged, however, in such a way that they promote the aims of stabilisation policy.Tax cuts in Sweden are probably needed that confer long-term benefits on both the supply and thedemand side of the economy; a long-term tax reform with those ambitions would be desirable. In thepresent situation, however, with growth seemingly reaching around 3.5% this year and 3% in 2000,tax cuts and labour market reforms that primarily favour the supply side would increase theopportunities for good growth without contributing to increased inflationary pressure. That wouldlessen the risk of overheating and facilitate the interaction of fiscal and monetary policies.There is the problem, however, that evidence of good results – be they in the national economy or inone’s own enterprise – tend to weaken demands for changes which are needed for more sustainableachievements. I would also say that the less one does in the good years, the tougher the going is likelyto be when times are worse. Not infrequently, necessary measures are not taken until a crisis isactually looming. Today we are reaping the harvest from many important structural changes that wereimplemented during the crisis in the first half of the 1990s. It is up to every decision-maker to considerwhich measures we can now take in order to create robust long-term conditions for the economy.
1BIS Review 89/1999Bank of Japan’s August report of recent economic and financial developments1Bank of Japan, Communication, 17 August 1999.*      *      *The Bank’s view2Japan’s economy, at present, has stopped deteriorating, and corporate sentiment has seen a slightimprovement recently. However, clear signs of a self-sustained recovery in private demand have notbeen observed yet.With regard to final demand, business fixed investment has been on a downward trend. Recovery inprivate consumption continues to be weak on the whole. Net exports (exports minus imports) aresluggish at present due to an increase in imports. Meanwhile, housing investment has continued torecover, and public works have been rising.Reflecting such developments in final demand and continued progress in inventory adjustment,industrial production has stopped decreasing. In addition, corporate and consumer sentiment has seenan improvement due to the effects of measures taken to restore the stability of Japan’s financial systemand the continued monetary easing by the Bank. The improvement in corporate sentiment, however,has not necessarily stimulated business activities, because firms strongly feel that they have excesscapacity and employees and their profits remain weak. Meanwhile, the improvement in consumersentiment is underpinning household expenditure even under the worsening employment and incomeconditions, but is not strong enough to push up overall private consumption.As for the outlook, with the progress in inventory adjustment gradually paving the way for a recoveryin production, improvements in the overall financial environment partly due to the monetary easing bythe Bank, along with a series of economic measures taken by the government, are expected to continueunderpinning the economy. Moreover, the recovery of overseas economies, especially of Asianeconomies, is likely to have a positive impact on domestic production. Nevertheless, under cautioussales plans, firms are implementing further restructuring to improve their profitability. Although suchcorporate restructuring is expected to improve productivity, it is likely, in the short run, to reduce fixedinvestment and discourage household expenditure through the resulting deterioration in employmentand income conditions. Under such circumstances, it is still difficult to expect an immediate self-sustained recovery in private demand. Overall economic developments require careful monitoring inconsideration of the above points. It is also important to promote structural reform in order to assurethe economy’s sustained growth in the medium term.With regard to prices, import prices continue to rise due to the increase in international commodityprices such as crude oil prices. Domestic wholesale prices are leveling off due to the progress ininventory adjustment as well as an increase in prices of some products closely related to internationalcommodities, such as those of petroleum products. Consumer prices are also leveling out. On the otherhand, corporate service prices continue to decline. For a while, movements of overall prices are likelyto be flat, as import prices are rising and the decline in domestic commodity prices has come to a haltreflecting the progress in inventory adjustment. However, distinct narrowing in the output gap is1 This report was written based on data and information available when the Bank of Japan Monetary Policy Meeting washeld on August 13, 1999.2 The Bank’s view on recent economic and financial developments, determined by the Policy Board at the Monetary PolicyMeeting held on August 13 as the basis of monetary policy decisions.
BIS Review 89/19992unlikely for the time being even though the economy has stopped deteriorating, and wages continue todecline. Thus, downward pressure on prices is expected to remain.In the financial market, the overnight call rate has stayed at nearly zero, and financial institutions havebeen confident about the availability of overnight funds. Interest rates on term instruments slightlyincreased from the middle of June but then fell back, and have recently been steady. However, thoseon instruments maturing beyond the year-end are relatively high partly due to market participants’concern over the Year 2000 problem.The Japan premium has continued to be nearly zero.Yields on long-term government bonds fell to the level of 1.6 percent in the middle of July, but haveslightly increased to 1.8-1.9 percent. The yield spread between government bonds and private bonds,especially corporate bonds with relatively low credit ratings, has narrowed further.Stock prices fell in late July against the background of the appreciation of the yen and the recent weaktone in U.S. stock prices. The current level is around 17,000-17,500 yen.The amount outstanding of funds in the call money market has remained generally stable since themiddle of June. To date, this has not led to any difficulty in funds settlement, but close attentionshould be paid to future market developments.With regard to corporate finance, private banks have basically retained their cautious lending attitude.However, constraint that had been caused by severe fund-raising conditions and insufficient capitalbase has eased considerably. Under these circumstances, major banks have gradually become moreactive than before in extending loans, while carefully evaluating the credit risks involved.However, credit demand for economic activities such as business fixed investment remains weak. Inaddition, firms’ moves to increase their on-hand liquidity have settled down. As a result, creditdemand in the private sector has continued to be weak, and thus private banks’ lending has remainedsluggish. Furthermore, the pace of issuance of corporate bonds and CP has generally been slowing.Money stock (M2+CDs) has recently shown a year-to-year increase of over 4 percent partly due to anincrease in fiscal expenditure.In this financial environment, credit conditions have eased somewhat.The following continue to warrant careful monitoring: how actively investors will take risks; how farprivate banks will ease their lending stance; and how these changes will affect economic activities.
1BIS Review 89/1999Mr Brash comments on the economic reformsof the last 15 years in New ZealandComments on accepting the NZIER/Qantas Economics Award by Dr Donald T Brash, Governor of theReserve Bank of New Zealand, held in Auckland on 18 August 1999.*      *      *Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen,I was greatly flattered to be nominated for this NZIER/Qantas economics award, and feel deeplyhonoured to have been selected to receive it. I regard the earlier recipients of the award as among thegiants of the economics profession, and I have been privileged to work with all of them in one way oranother. I am also very much aware that, while my name is on the award, I owe that fact in largemeasure to the efforts of a great many other people, including my colleagues on the Monetary andEconomic Council, on the Committee of Inquiry into Inflation Accounting, on the New ZealandPlanning Council, on the Economic Monitoring Group, and on the various taxation advisorycommittees I was privileged to chair in the eighties; to the efforts of my colleagues and staff in theReserve Bank; and of course to my teachers and family over a great many years. Thank you.I was told I might speak briefly on accepting the award. What to talk about? It hardly seems theappropriate moment to speak about the Official Cash Rate, so I thought I might be allowed a littlelicence to add my contribution to the debate currently raging on all sides about the success orotherwise of the economic reforms of the last 15 years.But before I do that I want to say that I sometimes wonder whether we New Zealanders are notcongenitally prone to wild swings in mood: we are either riding high in self esteem, confident that wecan take on the world and win, as we were in the mid-eighties and mid-nineties, or we are utterlygloomy, convinced that a cyclical downturn in net immigration represents the end of civilisation as weknow it, with our only hope being to plead with Australia to take us on as a distant Tasmania. As DougMyers mentioned in a speech a week ago, “we have developed a cottage industry of pessimism”.1I do not propose to assess why we have this tendency to wild swings in mood, nor even to offer acomprehensive assessment of the economic reforms of the last 15 years. That can not be done in15 minutes. But let me make just a few observations.First, I believe that there are several aspects of those reforms where the results are measurable andclearly positive. For example, I believe we can now safely conclude that the monetary policyframework put in place as part of that overall reform process has been hugely successful. And I saythat as someone who had only a small involvement in the original design of that framework. Am Isaying that the framework guarantees against mistakes in the formulation and implementation ofmonetary policy? Of course not. No framework can do that. We have made mistakes in the past and,since we do not have (or claim to have) perfect foresight, we will certainly make mistakes in thefuture. But the monetary policy framework conceived when Roger Douglas was Minister of Financeas a way of depoliticising the operation of monetary policy, brought to Parliament by David Caygill,passed into law without a single dissentient vote, and now supported by most political parties is anoutstandingly good one, and has already been emulated by a number of other countries. It has helpedus to reduce inflation from well above the levels in other developed countries to a level closelyconsistent with those in Australia, the United States, and Europe. It has helped us to reduce long-terminterest rates from 1000 basis points above US long-term interest rates in the mid-eighties to less than100 basis points above US long-term rates in the recent past. That improvement in inflation1“Wake up New Zealand”, speech to the Tauranga Chamber of Commerce, 11 August 1999.
BIS Review 89/19992performance has been of benefit to the New Zealand economy and of benefit to New Zealand societymore generally.Second, I believe that there are several aspects of the reforms where the results are not so easilymeasurable, at least in terms of conventional macroeconomic statistics, but where the results are againunambiguously positive. With banks now falling over themselves to lend money, who wants to goback to having to get down on bended knee to get a home mortgage loan? With new phoneconnections now available in most parts of the country within days of making a request and the cost ofdomestic toll calls down some 80 per cent in real terms in the last decade, who wants to go back towaiting 12 to 18 months for a residential phone connection? And who wants to go back to the old levelof in-flight service on domestic airlines? Or to five-day-per-week shopping? Or to paying 60 cents formailing a surface letter (the cost in 1986 in 1999 dollars), instead of today’s 40 cents? None of thesebenefits show up very clearly in GDP statistics, but all of them have made a big, and a beneficial,impact on our lives. Few of us would want to lose them.But what about economic growth? Surely growth in GDP has been disappointingly slow since 1984,and this proves beyond reasonable doubt that the reforms have failed? Certainly, taking the whole 15year period growth has been disappointing. I am not at all sure, however, that it is legitimate toconclude that therefore the reforms have made no difference to our potential growth rate. In the firstseveral years of the period, the New Zealand economy was going through huge changes madeinevitable by the decision to abolish quantitative import controls, to reduce tariffs, to abolish exportsubsidies, to corporatise and then privatise many state-owned enterprises, to deregulate the bankingsector, and to reduce inflation from levels well above the developed country average. A lot of thecapital built up in the period before 1984 was destroyed when the subsidies and protection on whichthat capital was totally dependent were eliminated. While there is some debate about the speed withwhich subsidies were eliminated, there is little or no debate that abolishing those subsidies was in theinterests of the long-term health of the New Zealand economy. But inevitably the short-term result ofthese moves was to leave the overall level of GDP looking pretty flat. It was, on a small scale, similarto the kind of trauma which the former Soviet bloc countries have gone through in recent years, withwhole industries wiped out and, in their case, overall GDP shrinking substantially. New Zealand’sGDP did not shrink to any significant extent, but for six or seven years it barely grew at all.  From theearly nineties, however, the picture is much more encouraging. In the six years from 1992 to 1997,growth in GDP averaged 3 per cent per annum – not the 4 or 5 per cent per annum which we achievedwhen we were first emerging from the recession but better over those six years than the growth inJapan, in continental Europe, and in the United Kingdom, and almost identical to the growth inAustralia, on average over those six years. We would of course like to be growing faster, and unlesswe do we will not regain any of the ground lost relative to Australia during the sixties, seventies andeighties, when we were growing quite a bit more slowly than Australia and other developed countries.But we still did very much better in the six years to 1997 than we did in the previous three decades.But what about 1998? I suspect the fact that Australia grew at more than 4 per cent in 1998 while wegrew not at all in that year is at the root of a lot of our current gloom. How could we bomb out sobadly, when both countries had a very similar exposure to the Asian crisis? This isn’t the place toprovide a comprehensive answer to this question, and indeed I don’t think anybody yet has acomprehensive answer to this question. Some blame poor monetary policy decisions by the ReserveBank for the difference. I don’t share that view and see the impact of New Zealand’s severe drought asbeing a much more relevant factor, but then I am clearly not an objective observer. But even if, for thesake of the argument, monetary policy caused all of the difference between Australian growth andNew Zealand growth in 1998, that was at most a temporary impact, and monetary policy in NewZealand was eased very substantially over the course of 1997 and 1998. Official forecasts suggest thatgrowth in New Zealand over the next two years will be closely similar to that in Australia, as it wasfor the six years prior to 1998. So it is hard to see strong grounds for pessimism there.But what about productivity? Now we are getting to the heart of the matter, and there has been somepessimism, even among professional economists, that New Zealand’s productivity performance hasnot improved discernibly as a result of 15 years of reform. To shed some light on this issue, theReserve Bank, the Treasury, and the Department of Labour commissioned some work on productivity
3BIS Review 89/1999by Denis Lawrence, director of the Tasman Asia Pacific economic consultancy, and Erwin Diewert,professor of economics at the University of British Columbia, and their conclusion, as summarised bythem in the New Zealand Herald exactly one week ago, was that “to the extent we can make like-with-like comparisons between New Zealand and Australia (another country that has had a sizeable butmore gradual reform programme over a similar period) New Zealand’s performance (in multi-factorproductivity) appears to be at least comparable”.22  Indeed, they suggested that if sectors whereproductivity is very hard to measure (such as banking and community services) are excluded from thenumbers on both sides of the Tasman, New Zealand productivity seems to have been as good as, oreven a little higher than, in Australia in recent years.So we have plenty of reasons for being optimistic. We have more natural resources per capita than agreat many other countries, but not so many that we are tempted into ignoring the real source of ourfuture prosperity, which is the skills and education of our people. We have a framework for bothmonetary and fiscal policy which is the envy of a great many other countries, and that framework hasalready delivered us consistently low inflation for nearly a decade and a huge reduction in net publicsector debt. Despite important differences of opinion on a whole range of issues, we have a substantialmeasure of consensus about some of the really important policy questions. Remarkably for a countrywhich, until the mid-eighties, had a long history of controls on almost everything, we have a publicservice which is almost totally free of corruption. Similarly, we have a judiciary which has never beensuspected of corruption. New technologies which were not even dreamt of when Britain entered theEuropean Union substantially reduce the tyranny of distance by reducing the cost of finding andservicing distant markets. New technologies create new business opportunities by making us lessdependent on the economies of large scale production, thereby reducing the relevance of our smalllocal market.The Reserve Bank estimates that our sustainable rate of growth is currently around 3 per cent perannum. I am convinced that, with the right policies and the right attitudes, we can do even better.Where do professional economists fit into all this? Having devoted the first half of my speech toarguing that the current mood of pessimism about the fruits of the last 15 years of reform isconsiderably overdone, I want to use the second half of my address to talk about where I thinkprofessional economists have let the side down. I am not talking about all of my colleagues of course.Some have done a superb job of explaining how the world works. But too often you, I, we haveremained silent in the face of very considerable public and political confusion and uncertainty.Take, for example, the rather limited public comprehension of what has been happening to the NewZealand economy over the last 30 or 40 years. It seems, to me at least, that for several decades prior tothe early seventies New Zealand enjoyed a standard of living which was high by internationalstandards because we had unfettered access to the British market for everything which our veryefficient farming sector could produce. We taxed our farming sector by providing protection to ourinefficient manufacturing sector, and used the revenue to build a generous system of state-fundedhealth, education, and welfare. This may not have been sustainable indefinitely in any event, becausethe real price of our commodity exports was steadily declining (although improving productivity in thefarming sector was doing a pretty good job of offsetting this decline in price). But the viability of thewhole approach was jeopardised when Britain entered what was then referred to as the CommonMarket in the early seventies. All of a sudden, our farming sector was under severe pressure. For morethan a decade, we tried to pretend we could box on regardless. We made no serious attempt to help thefarming sector by reducing the protection given to inefficient sectors. We made no serious attempt totailor our social welfare system to the cloth available. Indeed, in 1975 we introduced a DomesticPurposes Benefit which would, over 20 years, grow to involve a fiscal cost almost as big as theUnemployment Benefit. In the same year, we killed off an embryonic contributory superannuationscheme and replaced it with a very generous taxpayer-funded scheme.2New Zealand Herald, 11 August 1999.
BIS Review 89/19994What successive Governments have been grappling with over the last 15 years is finding ways to makemore of the economy internationally competitive, to take up some of the load which the farming sectorcan no longer carry, while trying to explain to a sceptical public why the erstwhile generosity of thestate may not be able to continue. Alas, they have got precious little help from professional economistsin explaining this story to the public, and in some respects we economists have actually encouragedthe public’s reluctance to change.Or take another example. Tariffs. To the best of my recollection, I have only ever met two economistsin my life who believed that tariff protection was a desirable long-term feature of economic policy (afew more have accepted the infant industry argument in favour of temporary protection). Economistsare probably more united against tariffs and import controls than they are on any other single issue.And yet we allow to go unchallenged statement after statement, on talk-back radio and in the printmedia, suggesting that New Zealand has been daft to reduce its tariffs ahead of our trading partners,and that the only reason we are doing so is because politicians, or Treasury officials, are driven bysome mad theory. Or perhaps just by a desire to look holier-than-thou in international tradenegotiations. The idea that we should reduce tariffs in New Zealand no matter how stupid othercountries are about raising theirs is incomprehensible to most of the public, and yet is an idea whichwould be accepted by almost all economists. Of course we would be better off if other countries didnot raise tariffs against our lamb, or our kiwifruit, or our butter, or our cheese, or our beef, or our fish.But even when they do raise such tariffs, it is not in our own interests to reciprocate in kind.Economists know that, but have not done a terribly good job of helping the public to understand that.Or take a third example. Health care. I am certainly not going to step into the political maelstromwhich is the health care debate, at least in part because I simply do not know what to suggest orrecommend. But every economist knows from the days of Economics 101 that if you offer to supplysomething for free, the demand for it will be enormous, and that if you don’t use price to limit thatdemand, you will soon be unable to meet the demand – whether you devote 6 per cent, 8 per cent, or10 per cent of GDP to health care – and will be faced with long queues. In recent years, and contrary, Isuspect, to public perception, government spending on health care has risen somewhat faster thanGDP. (In the year to March 1984, government spending on health care took 5.6 per cent of GDP,while in the June 1999 year government spending on health care is estimated to have absorbed 6.4 percent of GDP.) I simply do not know what proportion of GDP New Zealand should be spending onhealth care. But I do know that, no matter how much is spent on health, there will always be queuesunless price or some arbitrary political decision is part of the rationing process. Of course queues maybe an optimal way of dealing with the situation. As I said, I don’t want to enter the substance of thisdebate. All I am saying is that economists would do a service to rational discussion of health care ifthey made the nature of the issues clear.At the end of the day, what I am seeking from my professional colleagues is a greater commitment toassist in the formulation of economically sound policy. At the moment, politicians of all of the majorpolitical parties are hugely constrained by the fact that, while more economically literate than peoplein many other countries, the general public do not have a good understanding of some of these crucialissues. How, for example, do political leaders grapple with the gradually growing fiscal cost ofNational Superannuation, or encourage rational public discussion of the issue, when a news item inone of our largest daily newspapers could say, about the present Government’s decision to maintainthe real value of National Superannuation by indexing it to the CPI rather than to wages, “up to halfthe superannuitants in New Zealand could be pushed below the poverty line when their pensions arereduced tomorrow”.33 I suspect it is true that the great majority of superannuitants today believe thattheir National Superannuation payments have been reduced or are about to be reduced, and yet ofcourse economists know that that is not true, either in nominal terms or in real terms. It is true inrelative terms of course, but a reduction in relative terms is assuredly not what most people think of3 “Elderly pushed into poverty”, The Dominion, 31 March 1999.
5BIS Review 89/1999when they talk about a reduction in a benefit. To the best of my knowledge, no economist challengedthat newspaper claim, or similar statements made on the electronic media.Let me make it clear that I am not, here, arguing for any particular “solution” to the growing fiscal costof National Superannuation. There are obviously a range of possible solutions, including an increase inincome tax. All I am saying, and saying as strongly as I know how, is that we will not improve oureconomic performance, nor get the sound policy decisions on which that improved economicperformance depends, without a better public understanding of the nature of the issues. Economistscan not of course achieve that on their own. It requires leadership from political leaders, from businessorganisations, and from community leaders also. But as those with a professional understanding oftariffs, budgets, monetary policy, taxes, and all the rest, economists surely have a major responsibilityto help in building public understanding of the choices and the dilemmas.As an aside, the Reserve Bank decided to sponsor the production of a textbook on economic policy forthe Journalists Training Organisation a year or so back. This textbook will be launched next week. Itdoes not attempt to promote a single view of economic policy, and contains chapters written by a widerange of New Zealand economists and financial journalists. It is the Bank’s attempt to ensure thatjournalists, at least, have access to information on some of these important issues.Perhaps it is appropriate to end with a quotation from a speech given just last week by Mr KerryMcDonald, managing director of Comalco New Zealand and of course for a number of years Directorof the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research. In that speech4 he observed:“It seems that there simply isn’t a decisive constituency in New Zealand for increased growth andliving standards. No one is demonstrating for it, and few are fussed by the lack of it. Many want thefruits; they want the cargo to arrive, but not the hard effort of creating the economic wealth in the firstplace.”As a fifth generation New Zealander, I badly want Kerry McDonald to be wrong. I suspect he wants tobe wrong himself. I know that, when I threw my hat into the political arena in 1980, what motivatedme was a fear that, unless we could arrest our relative economic decline, my kids would leave NewZealand as soon as they were old enough to choose, and the country which I love would gradually sinkinto the sand.I think that we have as a country made some real progress in recent years at arresting that decline. Thelast 15 years have certainly not been in vain. But in part because of the failure of the economicsprofession, the public seem to imagine that half a century of relative decline can be arrested by just afew years of reform. It can’t be. There is still much to be done. Economists can assist sensible publicdiscussion of the issues, and if we fail to do that, we may yet, like the good people of Hamlyn, see ourchildren disappearing over the horizon.44 “Is a high performance business environment possible in New Zealand?”, speech to the NZ Institute of Management,Canterbury Division, 9 August 1999.
1BIS Review 88/1999Mr Stals gives a summary of his views on central bankingRemarks by Dr Chris Stals, retiring Governor at a Gala Dinner of the South African Reserve Bank, on7 August 1999.*      *      *1.IntroductionI have listened to many speeches about central banking over the past forty years. Some of myinternational colleagues present here this evening will recognise titles such as“The Agony of Central Banking”“The Triumph of Central Banking” or“The Art of Central Banking”I can obviously make long speeches about each one of these subjects, or many others on centralbanking. Out of respect for this occasion and taking account of the late hour of night, I am going to bebrief and give you, at the end of my long career in this wonderful profession, in summary form myviews on what I would regard as:2.The Twelve Commandments of Central Banking2.1A true central banker will always be against inflation.2.2The need for independence of the central bank must be recognised and appreciated by thepublic and by governments but, after all is said and done, a central bank can only be as independent asthe government of the day wants it to be. From my experience I have learned that, without regularcontact and close co-operation with the Minister of Finance the life of a central banker can becomevery lonely.2.3In many countries of the world the powers of the central bank should be reduced in order toincrease the effectiveness of monetary policy. Joined with the potent power to create money, thepower also to make loans and spend money has the potential to create a malignant superpower whoseactions can easily lead to financial destruction.2.4Wealth cannot be created by the creation of more money; poverty cannot be relieved byincreasing the money supply. If this would have been possible there would have been no poverty in theworld any more.2.5By successfully restricting growth in the total domestic assets of the central bank, monetarypolicy will bring about positive growth in the total foreign assets of the country.2.6A central banker is often very unpopular in his own country. As a matter of fact, if thegovernor does become popular in his own country, it may be time for him to retire. Monetary policy isabout financial discipline, about restricting expenditure, about forcing the country to live within itsmeans. Measures to achieve these objectives can never be popular. You cannot ask the turkeys of theworld to vote for Christmas. You also cannot ask the borrowers of money what the level of interestrates should be.2.7Where anybody stands on monetary policy is determined by where he sits. When I wascriticised for the policies of the Bank, I always asked who the critic was and where he worked. Theanswer invariably made me apathetic to the criticism.2.8A country may be able to keep politicians out of interest rates, but you can never takeinterest rates out of politics. When politicians therefore make statements about interest rates, tolerablecentral bankers should accept that politicians talk to their voters, and not to central bankers.
2.9There is no such thing as central banking by rules. Discretion remains indispensable in thedaily implementation of monetary policy. Economics, after all, is not an exact science. In the world ofmacroeconomic policy two plus two may sometimes add up to five. The central banker must, however,never try to stretch it to six.2.10A central banker must learn to ignore any praise bestowed on him, particularly through or bythe public media. This will justify his right also to brush aside the unfair criticism that will belaunched at him next time from the same source.2.11In our present world of a rapidly changing global financial environment, a central bankermust be a student for ever. Always remember the old Chinese saying that a man must study as if hewill live forever, but live as if he will die tomorrow.2.12I have left the most important commandment for the last – a good central banker is alwaysagainst inflation.These twelve commandments represent for me a final conclusion of my experience as a central bankerover many years.3.The people in central bankingI cannot let this occasion go by without saying a few words about the people I worked with over manyyears as a central banker.Firstly, there are the people in government. I wish to thank the Presidents of our country whoappointed me in 1975 as Deputy Governor, in 1980 as Senior Deputy Governor and then on twooccasions in 1989 and again in 1994 as Governor of the South African Reserve Bank. It was a greatprivilege for me to serve our country and all of its people for more than twenty years in these seniorpositions in the Bank.I thank the five Ministers of Finance with whom I worked very closely over this extended period oftime. And I add to their names the Directors General and the staff of the Government Departmentssuch as Finance, State Expenditure, the S.A. Revenue Services and Trade and Industries for theirco-operation. It is still true as Walter Bagehot observed in the previous century that monetary policybegins at the Treasury. Without co-operation between the central bank and the ministry of finance bothmonetary and fiscal policies will be weaker.I enjoyed the loyal support of all the people who served with me on the Board of Directors of theReserve Bank. In particular, I would like to thank those Board members who supported me withdedication and devotion over the past ten years when I was also Chairman of the Board.No words can express my appreciation to the staff of the Bank, all my colleagues past and present whoworked with me with great commitment to achieve our objective of protecting the value of the rand inthe interest of all the people of South Africa. Many times I said to you, and to the many people inSouth Africa and abroad who praised me for the achievements of the Bank, that we must alwaysremind ourselves that the world is run by people second in charge. You made the South AfricanReserve Bank the outstanding institution of excellence that it is known to be today. You shall alsoprotect this laudable reputation of our proud institution in the future.I am grateful for this opportunity to direct a few words of appreciation also to the many foreignvisitors we have with us this evening, firstly, to the Governors and representatives of central banks, theInternational Monetary Fund and the Bank for International Settlements. What a wonderful experienceit was for me to have been a member of the exclusive club of central bankers in an expanding globalfinancial environment. I have learned more from you in conferences, in meetings and in numerousdiscussions than from all the textbooks I struggled with to obtain my university degrees.It is a great privilege for us to have the governors of more than ten central banks from Africa here thisevening, and also senior staff members to represent others. I wish I could spend another ten yearsworking with you in meeting the great challenges we face together to develop the financial structures
3BIS Review 88/1999of our continent, and to establish in Southern Africa an intimate forum for effective central bankco-operation.We have a number of private foreign bankers present here, representing institutions that battled withme in the days of South Africa’s isolation and debt rescheduling arrangements, but also lend greatsupport to me and the Reserve Bank, particularly over the past five years when we had to reintegrateour country in a rapidly changing global financial market environment.I pay tribute to the South African bankers who do not always agree with the Reserve Bank’s hard lineapproach on financial disciplines, but who always remain loyal to their central bank. It did not gounnoticed in the world financial markets over this past year, with major global financial marketdisruption, that the South African banking sector remained stable and sound. I give the credit for thisto you, the managers of sound and well-disciplined private sector institutions.Finally, talking about the people of central banking, I must thank my wife, my four children togetherwith their spouses for their support over many years. I like to refer to the husband and wives of mychildren as my children who became my children because of the decisions of my children. My wifeseldom had a normal husband, my children must on many an occasion have missed a normal father inthe house because they had to contend with a husband and a father addicted to central banking. Mypeers as central bank governors will know what these words mean.4.The future of central bankingLooking ahead, I can only express my regrets that I were not as of today ten years younger. Excitingtimes lie ahead for the central bankers of the world as the process of the integration of financialmarkets around the globe will continue. However, I leave the South African Reserve Bank in greatpeace of mind because I am confident that Mr Tito Mboweni and the team with him in the Bank havethe ability, the determination and the will to steer South Africa successfully into this brave new world.Tito, I admire the way in which you approached the past year of induction with us in the ReserveBank. You succeeded in getting the staff of the Bank on your side. You grasped very quickly whatmany outsiders will always regard as the mystique of central banking. You have truly become one ofthe members of the exclusive club of central bankers of the world. I leave the Bank with greatconfidence that you will be the Governor that will finally destroy the African jackal of inflation in ourcountry. I wish you well.5.ConclusionOne day, shortly after lunch, as I was sitting in the Governor’s office on the 32nd floor of the ReserveBank Head Quarters building in Pretoria, the sliding door to the balcony in front of the office wasstanding open. I heard a noise and there came a bird almost falling out of the air as if it was shot. Iwalked out and found a beautiful homing pigeon lying on the floor of the balcony as if it was dead. Icarried on with my duties behind my desk.After about half-an-hour, I noticed the pigeon was recovering. On weak legs and with watery red eyesit started observing the environment. And then, to my surprise, with unexpected dignity andconfidence, it walked straight into the Governor’s office. The pigeon settled itself down on the carpetagainst the couch. I realised this bird must have come from somewhere far and it must be thirsty andhungry. In an ashtray, I gave it some water. My secretary produced a few breadcrumbs fromsomewhere. The pigeon drank and ate with a grateful look in its beautiful yellow-ringed red eyes, andthen nestled down for a good sleep-in.I asked my Secretary not to let anybody into the office and to walk on tip-toe as long as the specialguest stayed with me. After about two hours with the sun already setting in the west, my visitor wokeup, looked around and then, with even greater dignity and self-composure, walked out of the office.On the balcony, it stretched its legs, shook its wings and looked around to determine direction. And
then it took off and flew away. The bird obviously came a long way and was now destined for thecomforts of its home, and for a good rest after a long journey.I could not help but to think of this homing pigeon when I left the office of the Governor on the32nd floor of the Reserve Bank building for the last time this morning.
Mr Ferguson reviews the progress on Year 2000 readinessand focuses on public disclosure and public confidence in the United StatesRemarks by Mr Roger W Ferguson, Jr, a member of the Board of Governors of the US FederalReserve System and Chairman of the Joint Year 2000 Council, before the George WashingtonUniversity Y2K Group in Washington, D.C. on 29 July 1999.*      *      *As the countdown to the Year 2000 continues, and with only five months to go until the new year, it iscertainly prudent for us to focus now on the Year 2000 readiness of our nation and, indeed, the entireglobal community. So I applaud the Research Program in Social and Organizational Learning here atGeorge Washington University for sponsoring this wide-ranging conference. Over the course ofseveral days, this assembly has discussed important issues in many sectors of our economy. TheseYear 2000 discussions, and others like them around the nation, will help to create public awarenessand understanding, which are very important building blocks in the structure of public confidence. Iwill come back to the confidence issue in a few minutes, but I will commence with a review ofprogress to date.Preparedness of the Domestic Banking IndustryFirst I want to provide today some perspectives on the Year 2000 readiness of the US banking sector.At the Federal Reserve we are closely involved with preparations for the century date change in thefinancial sector here and around the world. We expect there will be glitches. Nothing this complex canbe completely without fault. However, I want to confirm at the outset that the Federal Reserve is readyfor the Year 2000, and every current indication is that the domestic banking system is, for all practicalpurposes, also ready for a smooth transition.Much of my emerging confidence results from the fact that the Federal Reserve System is fullyprepared for the Year 2000; 100% of the Federal Reserve’s mission-critical systems are ready. At theFederal Reserve Board and the 12 District Banks, we are using today the automated systems that wewill use in the Year 2000. In fact, we have been testing these systems for more than a year with banksand thrifts that are linked to us around the country for payments and related functions. These tests havegone extremely well. This is significant because the Federal Reserve Banks operate the hub of thenation’s payments system, providing depository institutions with essential services in cash, checks,and electronic payments. Thus, because of the Federal Reserve’s readiness, Americans can haveconfidence that the nation’s basic payments infrastructure is sound and ready to process payments asusual before and after the century date change.Another fact that gives me confidence in the domestic financial sector’s preparations for the centurydate change is that almost all of the nation’s banks, thrift institutions, and credit unions are ready forYear 2000. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) reported last month that 98.3% ofinsured institutions were ready. These good evaluations reflect years of diligent work by thousands oflarge and small institutions alike to meet rather aggressive deadlines for mission-critical systems set bythe regulators. As you may know, banks were required to meet certain milestones for identifying,renovating, implementing and testing their mission-critical automated systems to ensure that theircustomers would receive the quality and timeliness of service they expect after the century datechange. The small handful of institutions that have not yet met the regulatory milestones are, I assureyou, receiving the full attention of the regulators.Combined with the readiness of the Federal Reserve to support the nation’s payments infrastructure,the readiness of commercial banks means that we can expect that the processing systems that supportall methods of payment – ATM cards, debit cards, credit cards, direct deposit and other electronicpayments, checks, and even cash – will work smoothly around the date change.
The readiness of the Federal Reserve and the extensive preparations in the banking system do not,however, guarantee perfection. No one can say that there will be no problems in the banking systemwhen the century date rolls over. As we are all aware, processing and other failures do occur incomplex modern automated systems, often in ways that are rarely visible to the public. We fix theseannoying minor faults every day and go on, and this is what we will do at the time of the century datechange. Moreover, if isolated glitches do emerge, the Federal Reserve and depository institutions willdraw on their contingency plans to get systems operating again as promptly as possible.At the Federal Reserve, we have extensive contingency plans, many of them already well tested duringhurricanes, blizzards, and other events. It is important to emphasize that we believe such contingencyplanning to be an important element of planning and preparedness for a wide variety of possibleevents. It does not mean that we think particular problems are likely. In general, we encourage allbanking institutions to undertake appropriate contingency planning, so they will be ready just in casethere is an unexpected or unusual set of events. For the special circumstances of the century datechange, we have developed additional wide-ranging plans to deal with contingencies of all kinds, eventhough we expect the banking system to operate normally. Let me give you some examples.One recent example of our contingency planning is the establishment of special liquidity arrangementsfor borrowing by depository institutions. As lender of last resort, the Federal Reserve always is readyto provide short-term loans to banks and thrifts that experience temporary liquidity needs. Foradditional liquidity, the Federal Reserve announced a plan to help healthy institutions meet creditdemands late this year and in the first quarter of 2000 should they face short-term liquidity problems.This borrowing arrangement, by its very existence, even if it is not widely used, should provideassurance to the public and banks that the lender of last resort will be there to provide liquidity shouldbanks need it during the rollover to 2000.To be prepared in case our fellow citizens choose to have a little extra cash on hand for the centuryrollover – it will be a long holiday weekend for many, after all – the Federal Reserve is building aninventory of currency in our vaults. This inventory will be more than enough to meet any conceivabledemand for cash. Given the high expectation that all normal payments methods will work, we do notexpect that there will be any unusual demand for cash, but if there is, we will be ready to meet it.Just as the Federal Reserve has planned for even very remote contingencies, individual banks andthrifts also have been required to extend existing contingency plans to address new risks posed byYear 2000 and test these plans. These plans are meant to ensure that customers can be confident theywill have access to their funds during the century date rollover period. For example, each institutionwas required to develop a liquidity plan describing how it would meet demands for cash from itscustomers and how it would meet the credit needs of its community. For some institutions, gettingextra cash from the Federal Reserve or borrowing in the financial markets or from the Federal Reservemay be part of their plans.Having detailed the readiness and contingency planning of the Federal Reserve and the entireUS banking sector, I hope you can understand why I am increasingly confident that generally normaloperations will prevail in this country’s financial institutions during the century date change.International Financial Sector DevelopmentsTurning now to the international arena, I am encouraged at the progress being made this year by mostforeign financial regulators and the largest financial institutions to meet the Year 2000 challenge, but Iam somewhat less certain of the international preparations than I am of our domestic readiness.Let me emphasize that I am somewhat less certain, not fearful. Given the wide variety of institutionsand systems around the world, and obvious difficulties in systematically collecting definitive andcurrent information regarding Year 2000 readiness, no one can know for certain all of the internationaloutcomes of the century date change.However, in my role as Chairman of the Joint Year 2000 Council, which is an international group offinancial regulators representing banking, insurance, and securities regulators, as well as central
bankers and payment system overseers, I have information that helps bring some of the issues intoclearer focus.The preparation of our domestic payments links is bolstered by the fact that foreign financial servicesfirms are generally believed to be among the best prepared in their respective countries. We do knowthat the largest, most internationally active firms are making good progress toward preparedness. Theyare forced to do so in order to remain viable in their home markets and globally.I also know that awareness among financial regulators is high. The Joint Year 2000 Council has heldmeetings in all regions of the globe. These regional meetings have been attended by regulators fromover 100 countries. Similarly, the United Nations hosted a meeting for Year 2000 Coordinators inJune, which was attended by representatives of more than 170 countries. These public sector effortsare mirrored by regional meetings held by leading members of the private sector. Surveys ofinternational financial regulators, as well as my own conversations with many of them, also havedemonstrated that a recognition of the problem has been increasingly translated into concrete plansand actions, many of which have gathered momentum in the last six months.Another positive perspective flows from the large and very successful test of domestic and cross-border payments systems last month. In this test using a simulated Year 2000 environment, more than500 financial market participants from 19 countries were able to complete transactions in 34 nationaland international payment systems. The test included sending and receiving payment instructions, andpayment settlements. There were virtually no errors, and the few problems discovered were remediedquickly.That cross-border test is one example of a broader development. We are getting increasingly positiveinformation regarding the preparedness of core financial systems overseas, importantly includingpayment and settlement systems, that could, if not prepared, trigger difficulties in the world’s financialoperations. These systems have generally implemented extensive internal testing and most are testingwith participants as well. The large test last month does seem to confirm that Year 2000 readiness hasimproved in many of the more important financial sectors around the world.Avoiding ComplacencyWe should not let these recent successes lead to complacency, either domestically or internationally.Domestically, institutions should continue to make preparations for the rollover period through eventmanagement and contingency planning, and in a very few cases by further remediation work. Mostimportantly, this should include maintaining an active effort to keep customers appropriatelyinformed. Because of the important role of public confidence in sustaining financial stability during anevent such as the Year 2000 rollover, in which there are inevitable uncertainties, persistent andeffective public communication is essential.Full and fact-based information will certainly help individuals maintain perspective and encouragethem to avoid taking needless risks. On the other hand, incomplete information or misunderstandingmay cause some to take risks such as shifting deposits from banks, or withdrawing large sums of cash,or even making unreasoned decisions about other assets they hold. Without solid perspective aboutYear 2000 preparations, others may fall victim to Year 2000-related frauds or be asked to buyYear 2000 products and services of questionable value.Similarly, there is still work to be done internationally. First, while the financial sector worldwide isconsidered to be ahead of most other sectors, it is generally thought that the United States still leadsmost other countries in the degree of preparedness, although some are as advanced as we are. Forexample, testing programs and, in some cases, further remediation efforts still need to be made insome countries, although these activities are obviously quite advanced in our major trading partnersand the other major industrialized economies. Second, all countries should hold themselves to thehighest standard of self-disclosure, so that financial markets can make fully informed decisions. Thisneed for disclosure includes industrial countries, as well as developing countries. Similarly, financialmarket participants need to seek full information on international preparedness, and make reasonable,calm and considered – not hasty – trade-offs between risk and reward.
Now that it seems as though the developed world is generally well positioned in dealing with theYear 2000 problem, the focus has shifted to the “emerging market countries”. This group is describedby some to be at the greatest risk of failure due to technical difficulties. My concern is that “emergingmarket countries” is too broad a group of nations, numbering well over 100. It is important thatemerging and newly industrialized economies making good progress toward preparedness, and thereare many, disclose that as clearly as possible. Market participants should look for and make thosedisclosures part of their decisionmaking.Those “emerging market economies” that are not making satisfactory progress should disclose theirstatus and seek assistance as they work to remediate mission-critical systems and engage incontingency planning. In particular, financial institution preparedness can be hampered by a lack ofpreparedness in critical infrastructure – telecommunications, power, and water. This cannot be takenfor granted. I would, however, note that many of the countries that may be the farthest behind are alsothose that are least dependent upon technology. Similarly, many of these countries have the fewestlinks to the international financial markets, and their performance during the century date change isleast likely to have a significant cross-border impact. Finally, good contingency planning, includingmanual work-arounds may avoid serious problems. Ultimately, however, systems will have to be fixedor replaced, whether before the century date change or after, and the sooner the process is started, thebetter.ConclusionTo sum up, I believe that the US banking system is largely ready for the Year 2000 and that majorforeign financial institutions generally are working diligently to be ready as well by 1 January. Thus, Ibelieve that the Year 2000 in the financial sector of the United States and many other countries isreally less of a technical issue now than it was last year at this time. Moreover, the relevant regulatorshere and around the world know what needs to be done over the next five months, and arecommunicating with the business leaders managing the world’s financial institutions. The progress wesee in the global financial sector and the evidence from successful cross-border and domestic tests arealso positive signs. Thus, with the technical and business elements generally making good progress,the real issue remaining for the United States and other leading countries is that of public awareness,understanding and, ultimately, public confidence.We should all recognize that the Year 2000 event is unique in that we all know that it will occur, butexactly what will occur is uncertain. In this environment, we should listen to the most reasonable andresponsible sources.Part of maintaining public confidence is fact-based disclosure both to the public at large and to marketcounterparties. Disclosure still remains an issue for some, particularly as “emerging marketeconomies” seek to distinguish those making good progress from those that need to increase efforts.Many emerging market and newly industrialized countries are making good progress. For somecountries, technical challenges may remain, particularly for those that recognized this problemrelatively recently.Finally, we know that there are likely to be some glitches, which I would expect to be small and ofshort duration. Similarly, I would expect any international disturbances to be limited in terms of thenumber of institutions and countries affected. In order to achieve that outcome, however, somecountries and institutions should focus on mission-critical systems, and all should engage incontingency planning as the key activity now.By remaining dedicated for the next five months we can all ensure that the work of the last severalyears is fully completed, and any remaining risks are minimized. I believe that those who have beenworking on this effort will rise to the challenge.
1BIS Review   86/1999Mr Macfarlane elucidates the stability of the financial system and comments on what theReserve Bank of Australia needs to do to fulfil its financial stability responsibilitiesText of the eighteenth R.C. Mills Memorial Lecture delivered by Mr I J Macfarlane, Governor of theReserve Bank of Australia, in Sydney on 29 July 1999.It is an honour to be here today at the University of Sydney delivering the eighteenth R.C. MillsMemorial Lecture. It is customary to start a Memorial Lecture by paying homage to the person inwhose memory the lecture is held, but I would like to break with tradition and do that a little laterwhere it fits in more naturally.On nearly every occasion when I speak before an audience such as this, I talk about some aspect ofmonetary policy. That is what is expected of me because people – very naturally – associate centralbanks with monetary policy. Monetary policy’s major task is to contribute to sustainable economicgrowth through maintaining low inflation, as we have been doing with some success during the 1990s.I have talked about this at length elsewhere, and I am sure that informed people are well acquaintedwith the current monetary policy regime in Australia, which is based on an inflation target, anindependent central bank and a floating exchange rate. As a result, I do not wish to take up any moretime going over old ground.The subject of financial stability does, however, call for some public explanation. For a start, a lot ofpeople are unsure of exactly what it means. Additionally, there are those who are unsure of what itsrelation is to central banking, which, as I have just said, they usually associate with monetary policy.In the remainder of my lecture I would like to cover both these topics, plus two other issues: whatdoes the Reserve Bank need to do to fulfil its financial stability responsibilities; and whether thechanges we have seen in the structure of financial systems over recent decades have made the systemmore or less stable.(i)What is financial stability?Financial stability is the avoidance of a financial crisis. A financial crisis is a more modern term fordescribing what used to be called “banking panics”, “bank runs” and “banking collapses”. We use thebroader term financial because, with today’s more sophisticated financial systems, the source of thecrisis could be the capital markets or a non-bank financial institution rather than a bank, althoughalmost certainly banks would become involved.A well functioning financial sector is critical to an economy’s well being because it is so intimatelyconnected to every other sector of the economy through its role of providing credit. When large-scalefailures occur among financial institutions, the supply of credit dries up and this quickly leads tocutbacks in other industries. Additionally, the finance sector is the part of the economy that is mostsusceptible to crises of public confidence. A problem that hits one part of the finance sector canquickly spread to the rest of the sector, and then to the economy more widely. Once it becomeswidespread, it is termed a systemic financial crisis to distinguish it from one that is confined to asingle institution or a very narrow part of the financial system.Another way of approaching financial stability is to look at it from the perspective of developments inthe overall economy. There is widespread recognition in the community that the normal growth pathof an economy is not smooth. We have all lived through a number of business cycles, and although wewish that the cycle could be abolished, most of us are resigned to the fact that expansions cannot goon forever, and they will be followed by a recession. Provided that these recessions are not veryfrequent and not very deep, public confidence in the legitimacy of the economic system remainsintact. The problem with a serious bout of financial instability or a systemic crisis – inevitablyinvolving a boom in asset prices, followed by a bust – is that it makes the recession much deeper andlonger, and can even turn it into a depression.
BIS Review   86/19992The best known example of this is the Depression in the United States in the 1930s, the severity ofwhich is now widely attributed by modern scholars to the collapse of the US banking system.1Australia had a similar experience in the Depression of the 1890s, and some more recent examples,which I will cover later, contained some of the same elements, although fortunately on a smaller scale.Over the past three years, we have witnessed the Asian economic crisis, the depth of which is largelydue to the collapse of financial systems in these countries. Although it is not well known in Australia,the Nordic countries (Sweden, Norway and Finland) went through a similar experience a decade ago.2In short, it is possible to have a normal business cycle where financial stability remains intact. Theseare usually quite mild cycles. It is also possible to have cycles where financial instability plays a largerole. These are usually very severe. Thus, there are very good reasons for a country to do what it canto avoid financial instability. History shows that it does not happen very often, but when it does, itseffects can be devastating.Table 1: Cost of RecapitalisationCountryPeriodCost as per cent of GDPSpain1977-198516.8United States (Savings & Loans)1984-19913.2ScandinaviaFinland1991-19938.0Norway1987-19894.0Sweden19916.4Latin AmericaChile1981-198341.2Mexico199513.5AsiaIndonesia1997-199834.5Korea1997-199824.5Malaysia1997-199819.5Philippines1981-19873.0Thailand1997-199834.5Sources:Caprio and Klingebiel, World Bank, July 1996.World Bank, Asian Growth and Recovery Initiative, 1999.Another direct and measurable cost of financial crises is the cost to taxpayers of fixing them. Whenthere is widespread failure of banks and other deposit-taking institutions, the Government invariablypays out depositors in full or in part, whether or not there is a formal system of deposit insurance.Financial institutions also have to be recapitalised in order to allow them to start lending again. Thecost to the Budget of both these types of assistance can be enormous, as shown in Table 1. Note thatthe figures given for Asian countries are only estimates as the final bill has not yet come in. Theoutcome could be lower or higher, depending largely on how quickly Asian countries resume theirgrowth path.                                                     1 See, for example, Bernanke (1983) and Romer (1993).2 See Llewellyn (1992).
3BIS Review   86/1999(ii)Central banks and financial stabilityThe idea that a central bank should have responsibility for financial stability has roots deep in thehistory of central banking. Indeed, in many countries, financial stability considerations were theoriginal reason for the formation of the central bank. Perhaps the best example is the United States.The establishment of the Federal Reserve System in 1913 was a direct response to the bank runs andfinancial panic of 1907. It was only later that an explicit monetary policy role was grafted onto theFederal Reserve’s financial stability responsibility.Elsewhere too, financial stability issues played a significant role in central banking. By the end of the19th century, the Bank of England was well practised in acting as the lender of last resort. In the1850s and 1860s, following the bursting of speculative bubbles in the US and UK railroad sectors, itlent freely to institutions to prevent financial panic, as it did during the Barings crisis of the 1890s. InFrance, the unravelling of speculative positions in the stock market in 1882 led the Banque de Franceto provide secured loans to the Paris Bourse. In Italy, the collapse of a building boom in Rome andNaples in 1893, and the resulting failure of one of Italy’s largest banks, prompted the creation of thecentral bank, the Banca d’Italia.3Financial stability considerations also played a role in the development of central banking inAustralia, although less explicitly than in the United States. In the early decades of this century therewere strong advocates for a central bank along the lines of the Bank of England. Progress, however,was hampered by ideological debates about the role of private banking, and by concern that a centralbank would out-compete private banks. While the Commonwealth Bank did take on some centralbanking functions in the 1920s, including note issue and the provision of settlement accounts, thewatershed was the 1936 Royal Commission.It is here that we return to Professor R.C. Mills. In between establishing the economics department ofthe University of Sydney and chairing the University’s Professorial Board, Professor Mills played aprominent role as a member of the Royal Commission. As S.J. Butlin notes in his biography of Mills,the structure of the Commission’s Report and its drafting owes much to Mills’ hard work and hisability to argue and persuade. Mills was an advocate of a strong central bank with responsibility forensuring the overall stability of the financial system and the economy. He, and his colleagues on theRoyal Commission, argued that the private banks had intensified economic fluctuations by lendingaggressively during the boom of the late 1920s and then contracting lending harshly during theDepression. This was seen to be a repeat, although on a smaller scale, of the situation in the 1880s and1890s. The Commission argued that a strong central bank might have been able to limit the unhealthyexpansion that eventually brought about the crisis.The idea that a central bank should seek to restrict those developments in the financial system thatthreaten the health of the economy strikes a strong resonance today. The difference between today’sinterpretation and that advocated by Mills and his colleagues is a subtle, but important, one. In the1930s, banks dominated the financial system, and a framework of regulation on banks was seen as thebest way to ensure financial stability (and to operate monetary policy). Today we realise that heavyregulation stifles competition and innovation, and is an ineffective mechanism for monetary policy –even though it can achieve a high degree of financial stability.We also recognise today that, while banks remain at the core of the financial system, financialmarkets – and by this I mean the money, debt, equity, derivative and foreign exchange markets – playa much bigger role than they did in the 1930s. Control of banks is no longer the same thing asensuring financial stability – the issue is now much more complicated. Indeed, following therecommendations of the Wallis Report in 1997, the Government specifically separated the prudential                                                     3 Goodhart (1985) gives a comprehensive review of this history.
BIS Review   86/19994supervision of banks from the Reserve Bank and vested it in a completely new institution, theAustralian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA).This sounds on the surface to be very different from the sort of world envisaged by Mills, but it isonly so in a managerial sense, not in a fundamental economic sense. The Reserve Bank still has dualresponsibilities for monetary policy and financial system stability, something of which Mills wouldhave approved. And, of course, these two responsibilities were spelled out again in the Wallis Report,and in the speech by the Treasurer when introducing the Wallis reforms.What is different now is that the day-to-day face-to-face process of bank supervision, with its settingof standards, monitoring, interpretation and data collection, is carried out in a separate agency –APRA – which also has responsibility for the equivalent supervision of other deposit-takinginstitutions, insurance companies and the superannuation industry. APRA’s role is an extremelyimportant one. Recent events in Asia have reminded us that good supervision of financial institutionsis the single biggest contribution that governments can make to ensure financial stability, whether it isthe central bank or another agency that carries out the actual work.While the present system is managerially a different arrangement to the one it replaces, it is notfundamentally different in kind. There are still very close relations between bank supervision andfinancial system stability through the close connections between the Reserve Bank and APRA (withthe former having two Board positions on the latter). In addition, there is the Council of FinancialRegulators, which brings together the heads of the Reserve Bank, APRA and the Australian Securitiesand Investments Commission (ASIC). The fact that I chair this group reinforces the point that theReserve Bank has not vacated its responsibility for overall system stability, even if it no longer doesthe “hands on” supervision of banks.(iii)The Reserve Bank and financial stabilityI would now like to turn to the third issue: how the Reserve Bank meets its financial stabilityresponsibility. Here it is useful to think about two broad sets of policies: those that help preventfinancial disturbances and those that counteract the effects of disturbances if they occur. I will startwith the first set.Policies that help to prevent crises(a)Maintaining low inflationWhen listing policies that help to prevent financial crises, the first one we come to is the maintenanceof low inflation. It stands to reason that a background of low inflation is less likely to underpin rapidlyrising asset values, and the speculative excesses that go with them, than a background of highinflation. But we should not take too much comfort from this, as events in Japan remind us. A betterformulation would be to say that low inflation is probably a necessary, but not a sufficient, conditionfor financial stability. The transition phase from high to low inflation and from high to low interestrates can actually raise some asset prices for very good reasons.4 Similarly, if the move to lowinflation has coincided with the deregulation of financial markets, the first observed effect may beincreased instability.5 As so often in economics, it takes a long time to observe changed behaviour in anew steady state, such as low inflation; most of our recent observations come from transition phasesbetween one regime to another.                                                     4 A transition from a period of high inflation to a period of low inflation usually leads to a reduction inreal, as well as nominal, interest rates which, other things equal, would cause a rise in equity prices.Also, at lower nominal interest rates, people’s borrowing capacity rises, which can also lead to rises inasset prices. See Stevens (1997).5 See Macfarlane (1995). For an earlier Latin American example, see Diaz-Alejandro (1985).
5BIS Review   86/1999(b)Ensuring that the payments system is safeThe Bank also has important responsibilities in the payments system. As part of last year’s regulatorychanges, a new Payments System Board was established within the Reserve Bank. This Board hasexplicit legislative responsibility for ensuring the stability and efficiency of the payments system. Inthe stability area much of the hard work has already been done. The introduction, last June, of ourReal-Time Gross Settlement system for high-value payments greatly strengthened the paymentssystem infrastructure, as did the passage of a number of technical pieces of legislation involvingbankruptcy proceedings and the netting of obligations. Australia’s payments system is now as robustas any in the world.(c)Maintaining an influence on regulatory arrangements in AustraliaBefore explaining this, I must emphasise again that the Bank has no intention of duplicating the workof APRA. We recognise that APRA is the policy-making body responsible for setting prudentialstandards in Australia. We also recognise that the responsibility for supervising individual institutionslies with APRA, and, as part of this division, the Bank has taken the decision not to receiveconfidential prudential data on individual institutions on an ongoing basis. It relies on APRA tomonitor the health of these institutions, but it does receive aggregate data, and on occasions attendsAPRA’s on-site visits as an observer to keep up to date with the changing nature of financialinstitutions.Where the Bank can make a real contribution to regulatory arrangements is through its knowledge of,and day-to-day dealing in, financial markets and through its broad macro-economic responsibilities.Two examples should help to illustrate this. First, it was through our own dealings in the foreignexchange market that we became aware of the high level of activity of hedge funds in Australia inJune last year. This was well ahead of the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM),which is the event that alerted the world’s bank supervisors to the risks associated with large hedgefunds. The second example comes from the macro-economic studies we have undertaken of the Asiancrisis. These reveal that the main contributor to the rapid inflow and outflow of capital to thesecountries was short-term bank-to-bank lending. One of the reasons that banks in Europe, Japan andthe United States were so keen to lend short-term to banks in emerging markets was that the Baslecapital weights favoured short-term lending over medium or long-term lending. This is logical fromthe point of view of an individual bank – there is less risk associated with a short-term loan. But it isnot helpful to international stability if banks as a whole show a disproportionate tendency to lendshort-term. It is these flows which, with good reason, are often termed “hot money”. The Bank andAPRA are grappling with this conflict, and I for one hope that the Basel weights are adjusted toremove the incentive towards short-term international lending.(d)Being able to participate in international fora on financial stability issuesAs a result of recent instability in international financial markets, there has been renewed interest inofficial circles in examining the causes, and seeing what can be done to improve the situation.Australia has taken quite a prominent role in these discussions, with a number of arms of theGovernment involved. The Reserve Bank has contributed to Australia’s efforts, particularly byfocussing on two areas where we believe the incentive structure is leading to excessive risk-taking andheightened instability. The two areas are the activities of hedge funds, and the arrangements forhandling a crisis once it has occurred – in particular, ensuring that at least some of the losses areborne by the lenders. An indication of the success of the Australian effort to date is that Australia isone of the four countries that has been added to the original Group of Seven to form the new FinancialStability Forum. I will be representing Australia at the next meeting in September in Paris.
BIS Review   86/19996(e)Keeping abreast of developments in financial marketsIn carrying out its ordinary business, the Reserve Bank trades in the money, bond, foreign exchangeand futures markets. This gives us a familiarity with financial instruments and market practices whichcan add value to the views of other regulators. I do not wish to suggest that this puts the Reserve Bankin a better position, only a different position. Regulators such as ASIC have a much better legalperspective than the Reserve Bank, while APRA is more knowledgeable on prudential standards andinstitutional practices. Taken together, therefore, there is a very broad range of skills among themembers of the Council of Financial Regulators.(f)Handling “once-off” threats to stabilityThese will arise from time to time and may be difficult to predict in advance. The clearest example ofthis to date is the challenge of the Year 2000. While the financial system is well prepared for the newyear, the best-laid plans could be threatened if the public were to over-react to Year 2000 concerns.For this reason, given our mandate to maintain the stability of the financial system, we are directing alot of resources to ensure a smooth transition. A lot of the work has been very technical – making surethat computer systems work, that the financial system has sufficient liquidity and that ample currencynotes are printed. But in the final analysis, we have to ensure continued public confidence in thefinancial system, so it is a matter of public reassurance and communication.In each of these policy areas, the Bank needs to be mindful not only of the stability of the financialsystem, but also its efficiency. While in many cases, policies designed to improve the stability of thefinancial system also improve its efficiency, this is not always the case. A highly regulated systemmight well be very stable, but it is unlikely to be very competitive or innovative. The Bank’s broadpolicy responsibilities require it to balance these various considerations.Handling of a financial crisisThe other situation in which the Reserve Bank will be required to play an important role is if afinancial disturbance actually occurs. It is unrealistic to expect that financial regulators will be able toprevent all financial disturbances. The Bank, therefore, needs to be able to respond to disturbanceswhen they happen.The main way in which it would do this is through the use of its balance sheet to provide liquidity tothe financial system. The Bank’s preference would be to do this through its usual daily operations inthe cash market, providing liquidity to the market as a whole, rather than to individual institutions.Nevertheless, in the highly unusual case in which a fundamentally sound institution was experiencingliquidity difficulties, and the potential failure of the institution to make its payments posed a threat tooverall stability of the financial system, the Bank would be able to provide a lender-of-last-resort loandirectly to that institution. In principle, a lender-of-last-resort loan could be made to any institutionsupervised by APRA.It is important, however, to make clear that the Reserve Bank’s balance sheet is not available to propup insolvent institutions. Put more plainly, the Reserve Bank does not guarantee the repayment ofdeposits in financial institutions. Indeed, the recent legislative changes have removed from the Bankthe responsibility for protecting depositors. This is now APRA’s responsibility, and APRA has thepower to issue directives to institutions, to revoke licences and to arrange for the orderly exit oftroubled institutions. Obviously, if it were necessary to undertake any of these actions, APRA and theBank would consult closely in order to limit the flow-on effects to the rest of the financial system.
7BIS Review   86/1999(iv)Has the financial system become more or less stable?From a purely Australian perspective, our biggest financial crisis was in the 1890s. Although the1930s was comparable as an economic contraction, it was a lot smaller as a financial crisis.6 And forthe first four post-war decades financial instability was rarely in the foreground. One could beexcused for thinking that the problem of financial instability was fading away.The events from the mid-eighties to the early nineties dispelled this illusion. A widely based assetprice boom came to an end, and the ensuing asset price falls brought down many highly gearedbusinesses and, more importantly for present purposes, a number of financial institutions. Two largeState Government-owned banks failed, as did one of the largest building societies, as well as severalmerchant banks and fringe financial institutions. The effect on the real economy was profound,particularly in Victoria where a disproportionate share of the financial failures occurred.7 It was asalutary experience, but fortunately many lessons were learned both by the private-sector participantsand by the regulators.From an international perspective, it would be easy to gain the impression that financial instability ison the rise. The past decade has included the banking collapses in the Nordic countries, the Mexicancrisis of 1994, the Asian crisis of 1997, Russia in 1998 and Japan’s problems stretching over much ofthe decade. During the same period, we have heard disturbing news of many individual companiesand markets, the most celebrated ones being the demise of Barings and the near demise of LTCM.Looking over the experience at home and abroad, I do not think it is possible to say that the risk ofserious financial instability has either increased or decreased in the course of the past century. Theonly reasonable working assumption is that the risks of serious financial disturbance are about thesame as they always have been. An important reason for this is the unchanging human propensity togo through periods of extreme optimism which pushes asset prices to great heights, followed by areaction which causes prices to fall precipitously. What has changed over the course of the century,particularly in the past couple of decades, is the nature of the risks we face.The traditional financial crisis was triggered by the failure of one or more banks, often during a periodof declining asset prices. The cause was usually a failure to correctly assess credit risk, for exampleby lending against temporarily inflated asset values. Fire sales of assets and contagion led to runs onother banks and the emergence of a full-scale financial crisis. Such a scenario is still possible today,particularly in an economy heading into recession, but it no longer represents the stereotype. For astart, bank supervision and banks’ own control of credit risk have improved enormously over the pastdecade. Also, financial disturbances are now more likely to originate in, and be transmitted through,financial markets than has been the case in the past.Financial markets are now much larger and many transactions are much more complex, making therisks associated with them harder to understand. Derivatives – the biggest growth area – are a goodillustration. While they enable many businesses to hedge risks which they formerly had to accept, theyalso allow others to take risks that they formerly could not. Notably, derivatives can make it easier forsome participants to engage in leverage – an old-fashioned activity which can greatly increase risk.The recent LTCM episode brought this out clearly and its near-collapse illustrated how market riskscan be large enough to be systemic.Recent events also reminded us that in a globalised market place, financial instability will often comefrom abroad. Last year, after the Russian and LTCM incidents, risk premia on loans to all but the bestcredits increased sharply. Even in the United States, lesser corporates found sharply higher borrowing                                                     6 See Fisher and Kent (1999).7 In the early 1990s recession, final demand in Victoria fell by 6.5 per cent compared with 1.5 per cent forthe rest of Australia. There was a similar disparity in employment. See Macfarlane (1992).
BIS Review   86/19998costs, while in emerging markets even large stable companies could not roll over maturing debt atinterest rates which would keep them solvent. Fortunately, this situation did not prevail for long, butaction by the US Federal Reserve was required to end it. As an aside, I should add that Australia wasonly marginally affected in this episode, and our new-found reputation for financial stability was notquestioned.Of course, the spread of financial problems across national boundaries is not new. A hundred yearsago the default by the Argentinian Government on securities underwritten by Baring Brotherstriggered financial turmoil in London, which led to Britain reducing its overseas investments. This, inturn, contributed to major contractions in economic activity in Australia, South Africa and the UnitedStates. In Australia, the turnaround in capital flows was as dramatic as that recently experienced insome Asian countries, and the effects on the economy were just as severe. What is new today,however, is the speed with which events are transmitted around the world, and the role that markets,as opposed to institutions, play in the process.(v)ConclusionIt is important that we maintain financial stability because of the contribution that it makes toensuring a more prosperous and more fully employed economy. It is also important that we receiverecognition as a country that has a world class financial infrastructure which is capable of maintainingthis stability into the future. Our recent exemplary performance has helped in this regard.But the task of ensuring we have an acceptable degree of financial stability in the years and decadesahead is a never-ending one. No-one can or should guarantee that no financial institutions will fail,any more than no manufacturers or retailers will fail. In fact, in an ideal world there would be ascattering of small disturbances every year or two to keep everyone on their toes. Unfortunately, thereal world is not like this: there are long periods of calm when virtually no financial disturbances takeplace and rising prosperity is taken for granted, creating a false sense of security and eventuallyleading to short periods which contain several failures and the threat of many more. The requirementfor all those involved in ensuring financial stability is to be alert and pro-active during the longperiods of calm, just as an army must be during peacetime. There is a constant challenge to be foundin identifying new risks, avoiding harmful incentives and adjusting the regulatory arrangements tokeep pace with changes in financial technology. It is not an easy task, but I am confident that themajor regulators – APRA, ASIC and the Reserve Bank – are up to it.BIBLIOGRAPHYBernanke, B.

BIS Review   88/1998Bank of Japan’s monthly report of recent economic and financial developments1BANK OF JAPAN, COMMUNICATION, October 1998.The Bank’s View2Japan’s economic conditions still continue to deteriorate.With respect to final demand, public investment has bottomed out. Net exports(exports minus imports) are basically increasing mainly due to a decline in imports. Business fixedinvestment, however, has been decreasing significantly partly because of financial constraints, andhousing investment has declined further. Private consumption has not yet shown a recovery despitethe special income tax reduction. Against this background of weak final demand, production hasbeen reduced substantially. As a result, some industries have shown improvements in inventoryadjustments, but the level of inventories is still high as a whole. With the decline in expenditure andproduction, corporate profits are worsening rapidly. Furthermore, the employment and incomeconditions have deteriorated further as the unemployment rate marked a historical high and thedecline in employee income has accelerated. In these circumstances, corporate perceptions ofbusiness conditions have worsened substantially and consumer sentiment has become cautious.As the above indicates, there remain continued negative interactions of production,income, and expenditure. With the effects of the comprehensive economic stimulus package and therecent monetary easing, the deterioration of the economy is expected to moderate gradually towardthe second half of fiscal 1998. Nevertheless, the economy is hardly expected to recover immediately,judged from the strong negative interactions mentioned above and the financial constraints such asfinancial institutions’ cautious lending stance due to the nonperforming-loan problem. In thesecircumstances, there is an immediate need to rebuild the stability of the financial system. In thisregard, bills related to financial revitalization have been legislated, and a bill related to bankrecapitalization, including policy measures to strengthen banks’ capital base through injecting publicfunds, has passed the House of Representatives of the Diet. It is desirable that functions of andconfidence in Japan’s financial system be restored based on these schemes. Furthermore, thegovernment is devising plans for economic recovery, including reduction in personal income taxesand corporate taxes as well as additional public investment. It is important to materialize thesemeasures promptly, in such a way that they not only have sizable direct effects on the economy butalso contribute to restore corporate and household confidence.With regard to prices, wholesale prices are on a downtrend reflecting the expandingoutput gap, and consumer prices have fallen below the previous year’s level. With respect to theoutlook, given the persistently strong negative interactions of production, income, and expenditure,the expansion in the output gap seems unlikely to cease despite the expected effects of thecomprehensive economic stimulus package. Furthermore, the continued decline in wages and therecent appreciation of the yen may exert downward pressure on prices. Hence, prices are likely to beon a downtrend for some time.In the financial markets, responding to the further monetary easing by the Bank ofJapan on September 9, short-term interest rates declined as a whole after mid-September. However,since the end of September, the Japan premium has expanded and interest rates on Euro-yen deposits                                                     1 This report was written based on data and information available when the Bank of Japan Monetary Policy Meeting washeld on October 13, 1998.2 The Bank’s view on recent economic and financial developments, determined by the Policy Board at the Monetary PolicyMeeting held on October 13, as the basis of monetary policy decisions.
- 2 -BIS Review   88/1998have rebounded slightly reflecting intensified market concern toward Japanese financial institutions’funding in foreign currencies over the year-end. In the meantime, due to heightened uncertainty overthe economic outlook, long-term interest rates declined considerably.Stock prices continued a downtrend reflecting the concern over the worldwide stockmarket plunge, the further deterioration in economic indicators, and the persistent uncertainty overthe resolution of the problems with Japan’s financial system. In October, stock prices recordedhistorically low levels since the bursting of the economic “bubble”. Meanwhile, in early October, theyen surged against the dollar with the emerged uncertainty over the outlook of the US economy.With regard to corporate finance, while funding needs for real economic activitiesseem to be decreasing, some firms, especially large ones, are seeking to secure ample on-handliquidity to prepare for unexpected situations. Reflecting such increase in credit demand, the growthrate in M2+CD has slightly recovered since the summer of 1998.However, Japanese financial institutions have become more cautious in extendingloans, facing up severe fund-raising environments and deteriorating business conditions of borrowercompanies. While especially large firms are steadily increasing the issuance of commercial paperand corporate bonds, small and medium-sized firms and relatively low-rated ones continue to facedifficult conditions for fund-raising in capital markets. The influence of these severe financialconditions on business activities and on the economy continues to warrant careful monitoring.
1BIS Review 137/1999Mr Bäckström offers some thoughts onasset prices and their relevance to central banksSpeech given by Mr Urban Bäckström, Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank and Chairman of the Boardof Directors and President of the Bank for International Settlements, to the Swedish ShareholdersAssociation and the FöreningsSparbanken on 16 December 1999.*      *      *First a word of thanks for the invitation to this meeting. The question I want to consider this evening iswhy stock market values are so high at present in relation to levels in the past. Are share prices beingbased on perceptions of the future that are unrealistic? In other words, are they developing a bubble?The mood that may lead to assets being valued in terms of expectations that are not realistic has beendescribed by the Chairman of the US Federal Reserve as “irrational exuberance”.Could it be the case, on the other hand, that the high prices stem from a perception of somefundamental changes? After all, the future will not necessarily follow the same pattern as the past.Steep share price riseShare prices on the Stockholm Stock Exchange have risen strongly in recent years. In the course of1999 the average level has moved up more than 50%. This autumn, moreover, the rise has accelerated.So everything points to 1999 being a very prosperous year for those who save in shares.As a matter of fact, since 1982 the total real return on shares (the inflation-adjusted price levelincluding reinvested dividends) has risen in Sweden at an average annual rate of around 16%. That isaround two and a half times more than the trend rate since 1918. After 1982 the total real return in theUnited States has also been appreciably above the trend rate since 1871 (Fig. 1).11Note that the chosen initial year has consequences for the trend rate of return; the path shown in the figure shouldtherefore be seen as an approximation.Total annual real return on sharesUSA 1871-1999, index: S&P 500 1870 = 100Sweden 1918-1999, index: normalised to 1928 level of S&P 500100100010000100000100000018701880189019001910192019301940195019601970198019902000USASwedenTrend 6%Sources: Global Financial Data, Frennberg & Hansson, Affärsvärlden and Statistics Sweden       1982-1999Sweden     16%USA     15%
BIS Review 137/19992The price-earnings ratio for the Stockholm Exchange is currently around 30 according toAffärsvärlden. This means that the price of an average share portfolio is equivalent to around thirtytimes the annual earnings. The ratio in the United States is even higher, around 35 (Fig. 2).Although long series for the Stockholm Exchange’s P/E ratio are hard to find, it is hardly controversialto say that the present level is well above the historical average. The deviation of share prices from thefundamental conditions that have applied historically is even clearer after a look at the path ofPrice-earnings ratio for Sweden andUSAAffärsvärlden general index and S&P 500051015202530354019501955196019651970197519801985199019952000S&P 500 average for1871-1999Note: Exceptionally high P/E ratios for Sweden in 1992 and 1993 are not shown hereSources: Global Financial Data and Statistics SwedenReal trends in US sharesS&P 500, average annual percentage change612151120510151940-19811982-1999Total real returnReal share priceReal earnings/shareNote.

3BIS Review 137/1999earnings. In the United States the real earnings trend since 1940 has been virtually constant between2% and 3%, while - as I just mentioned - the real return on shares shows a trend break after 1982(Fig. 3).2Are present share prices fundamentally justifiable?I shall now use a simple model to examine whether the present level of share prices can be justified infundamental terms.3 Simplifying somewhat, this model equates the value of a share with the presentvalue of the future income the share is expected to generate. A valuation in P/E terms accordingly restson the assumptions that are made about these future incomes - the future growth of the company’searnings - and the factor by which these incomes are discounted - the stock market’s expected return.We can insert alternative values for these assumptions to find the combinations that might justifydifferent P/E ratios (Fig. 4). It will be seen that a P/E ratio of 14 can be warranted if the expected realreturn is 6% and the real growth of earnings averages 2.5%. These figures are all approximately in linewith the historical trends.In order to justify an upward shift in the P/E ratio from just under 15 to between 30 and 35, theexpected real return has to be lower and/or expected earnings growth needs to be higher. A P/E ratio atthe current level can be explained if, for example:2The picture in Sweden is somewhat different, with signs of a strengthening of the earnings trend in the period 1982-99,though this is not visible in the figure. The krona’s depreciation after 1992 seems to have been the main factor here.Earnings per share showed little, if any, improvement from 1982 to 1990. However, cyclical fluctuations and changesconnected with the krona’s marked depreciation should not be central issues for our discussion here. As the stock markettrend in both the shorter and the longer term has been largely the same in the United States and Sweden and the P/E ratioin both cases is between 30 and 35, there are grounds for assuming that the earnings trend has also been at leastapproximately the same.3See Gordon, M J (1962), The Investment, Financing and Valuation of the Corporation, Homewood (Irwin). The simplemodel is written P/E = d/(k-g), where P is the share price, E earnings per share, d the percentage dividend, k the expectedreturn and g the expected dividend growth.P/E ratios with different combinations ofearnings growth & expected return4.04.05.05.06.06.04.54.5---100333.53.510033202.52.5332014Earnings growth %Earnings growth %Expected return %Expected return %TrendTrend
BIS Review 137/19994–the expected real return has fallen from 6% to 4%, or–the expected real earnings trend has risen from 2.5% to 4.5% a year, or–a fall in the expected real return from 6% to 5% has been accompanied by an acceleration ofexpected earnings growth from 2.5% to 3.5%.Has the expected stock market return fallen?Let us begin with the possibility of a lower expected return. Does it seem likely? For a long period theexpected return, in the United States as well as in Sweden, has been stable at around 6%. So whyshould things have suddenly changed in recent years in a way that dramatically alters conditions forthe long-term valuation of share prices?Moreover, a lower expected return would mean that the real return on shares is much the same as ontreasury bonds, for example. Why would share investment be perceived as having roughly the samerisk as investment in bonds issued by a sovereign?But there are, in fact, some reasons why the expected return may have become somewhat lower.One is that when central banks around the world focus monetary policy on price stability, this isexpected to result in greater stability in the real economy. From this it follows that corporate earningsand consequently share prices should also be more stable. Another factor that may point to lessmarked cyclical fluctuations in the future is the transition from manufacturing to the production ofservices, together with the era of information technology. Thus, if the yield from share investment ismore stable in the future than it has been in the past, this might warrant some downward adjustment ofthe expected return and thereby lead to a higher valuation.Another argument is that with more and more people saving in shares for retirement, the investmenthorizon has been lengthened. This category of share investor is less concerned about short-runfluctuations in share prices and that might justify a somewhat lower expected return.A third argument is that financial market developments have resulted in decreased transaction costsand less liquidity risk.There may be some truth in arguments of this type but it is still difficult to believe that the expectedreturn has fallen as much as would be needed to justify today’s stock market valuations.Or is higher earnings growth foreseen?Let us now look at the importance of earnings growth for share valuations. We noted earlier that tojustify a P/E ratio between 30 and 35, given an unchanged expected return, real earnings growth mustmove up from 2.5% to 4.5%. Is it reasonable to suppose that the future earnings trend will be as highas that?One way of answering this question is to look at the macro picture and determine the trend rate ofGDP growth that would be commensurate with such a strong increase in corporate earnings. This isalso pertinent in the context of the current discussion about a “new economy” that is perceived asbeing capable of higher productivity growth and thereby an upward shift in potential GDP growth.A simple growth model shows that in order to justify a P/E ratio between 30 and 35, the growth trendfor total factor productivity would have to move up almost 3 percentage points.4 That in turn implies4The feasibility of a higher future increase in corporate earnings can be analysed with a simple model where GDP growthis determined by the inputs of capital and labour together with the efficiency with which these resources are utilised inproduction. Using a simple Cobb-Douglas function, the rate of increase in the return to capital can be derived asgR=gA+(1-a)(gL-gK), where gA, gL and gK are the growth rates for total factor productivity, labour and capital,respectively. The relevant factor in the present context is the return to capital (the flow of income to owners of the capitalstock in relation to the value of the stock) because this should be linked to the growth of corporate earnings. The return to
5BIS Review 137/1999that the trend rate of GDP growth has to move up from around 2% to an annual rate of 5% over aconsiderable period. Thus, we are talking of a marked upward shift in the growth trend that has not yetoccurred in Sweden. Neither has such high growth been mentioned in the United States, exceptperhaps for a single year. The discussion there does, however, concern the possibility that the trend orpotential rate of growth has risen. That would then point to some increase in the growth of corporateearnings in the United States.Why are asset prices relevant for central banks?If asset prices and the growth of credit in an economy are based on unrealistic expectations of futureprospects, the result is liable to be a financial bubble. Under normal circumstances, rising asset pricesadd to the value of collateral and thereby strengthen the borrowing propensity of investors and thelending propensity of banks. An upward trend in asset prices is therefore often accompanied by anexpansion of credit. In Sweden, for example, in the five-year period up to the early 1990s, real assetprices had risen more than 70% and private sector debt relative to GDP had grown from 100% to150% (Fig. 5). Bubbles burst sooner or later, with consequences for the financial system and theeconomy in general that may be grave. That is one reason for central banks to take an interest in stockmarket trends.Today, however, the situation in Sweden does not resemble what happened in the second half of the1980s. Asset prices have certainly risen strongly in recent years but credit has not grown to the sameextent. It seems that, at least to date in the present upswing, Swedish banks and their customers havetaken a different line on the provision of credit and borrowing. Everyone is hopefully moreaccustomed to a deregulated credit market than was the case in the late 1980s. Still, it is important tobe alert to the future path of asset prices and credit aggregates, as well as to the underlying forces atwork in the Swedish economy.capital in an economy is dependent on the level of output and how this income is shared between labour and the ownersof capital. To keep things simple, we can assume that the labour and capital shares are constant in the longer run andconcentrate on how the return to capital is affected by changes in total factor productivity (the overall efficiency withwhich labour and capital are utilised in production). A higher return to capital should imply a higher rate of increase incorporate earnings. Conversely, an accelerating growth of corporate earnings should show up as a rising return to capitalat the macro level.Real assets prices and total lending901201501802102402701970197519801985199019950,81,01,21,41,6Asset price index: 1980=100 (left scale)Lending in per cent of GDP (right scale)Source: Riksbanken
BIS Review 137/19996ConclusionsFrom what I have said this evening it is possible to draw two conclusions that at first sight may seemto be somewhat contradictory. On the one hand we have noted that stock market values are historicallyhigh and that in the past this has normally been followed by some form of correction. On the otherhand, there may be some grounds for arguing that changes have occurred in expected stock marketreturns and/or the economy’s potential growth rate which could justify a stock market valuation abovethe historical level. In the United States there are at least signs that point in this direction. For Sweden,however, figures at macro level have not yet been discerned that would confirm such a change.But these two conclusions are not necessarily contradictory. Present stock market prices could mirror acombination of “irrational exuberance” and a change in the fundamental picture of the globaleconomy. The impact of the new information technology may be leading to higher productivitygrowth. It is also conceivable that stock market investment is now considered to be somewhat lessrisky than before, in which case the expected return may have become somewhat lower. But the stockmarket reaction to these new signs may have been rather hasty. Experience has shown that financialmarkets are sometimes liable to overshoot when adjusting upwards or downwards.My intention today, however, is not to opt for a particular view. I am more interested in initiating adiscussion and would like to take this opportunity of asking the share investors who are present here:Which conclusion do you find most valid?An increase of 3 percentage points in the growth of total factor productivity above the long-term trend leads to an upwardshift in the real return to capital from 6.0% initially to 6.2% (1.031x6) after one year, 7.0% (1.035x6) after five years and8.1% (1.0310x6) after ten years, that is, an increase of about 2 percentage points after ten years.
1BIS Review 135/1999Mr Latter gives a tour d’horizon of the current situationon the world financial marketsText of the opening address by Tony Latter, a Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong MonetaryAuthority, to the Asia Pacific Issuers and Investors Forum, in Hong Kong on 7 December 1999.*      *      *As we leave the twentieth century behind, the major regions of the world economy appear to be inquite good shape. North America is buoyant; Europe is positioned for more solid growth than of late,albeit only by its own rather modest standards; Japan may be moving forward, even if we have seentoo many false dawns to be entirely confident; and the rest of Asia has recovered from the 1997setback more strongly and quickly than most people expected.Meanwhile, major stock markets look set to end the millennium at or near all-time highs, with thenotable exception of Japan, where the Nikkei is still at only about half its peak of more than ten yearsago.It is also a confident end to the decade, century and millennium for “markets” in a broader sense. The20th century has witnessed a considerable ebb and flow of fashions in economics, between allegiancesto systems which afford primacy to market forces and those which yield varying degrees of control tothe state. As it turns out, the former have held sway. We see this not just from the collapse of theSoviet Union and the extreme forms of socialism which it and its satellites practised, but also, in asubtler sense, from the fact that, among economies which have throughout been part of the free world,those which have been least burdened with high marginal taxation, state intervention in industry andcommerce, massive social security programmes and so forth, appear to have come out on top in termsof growth and full employment. The USA, the UK, Hong Kong and some others in the Asia-Pacificregion now exemplify this point. By contrast, Japan and much of continental Europe remain saddledwith a greater number of structural and bureaucratic problems, which, arguably, have been a brake ongrowth.But commitment to the market is far from sufficient to ensure a prosperous economy. Thecommitment must be accompanied by transparency, accountability and freedom from corruption, andby an infrastructure of laws which match the needs of the market economy, are respected and, whenrequired, are enforceable. Absent those conditions, you end up with economic anarchy, which isperhaps what best describes the current situation in a number of countries which switched with muchacclaim to the market paradigm during the past decade or so.Another example of the ascendancy of market-based economics can, I would argue, be found in therealms of corporate governance. At times during the 1970s and 1980s, when the so-called anglo-saxonmodel of relatively unbridled financial markets was not delivering particularly good results in terms ofeconomic growth, there was some envy of what one might depict as the institutional model ofcorporate ownership, as evident in Germany and Japan for example. In this model much of the equityof major businesses is closely held by friendly groups of long-term investors including one’s bankersand associate companies.It has been argued that this arrangement provides the best environment for long-term growth andstability, in contrast to the situation where businesses are exposed fully to the cut and thrust of thestock markets, which are characterised as being populated by people seeking only short-term profitand ever alert to opportunities for takeovers, asset stripping and the like. But experience of the 1990sdoes not support that view. Germany and Japan have been the laggards of the decade. The true cost toJapan of the longstanding cosy relationships between banks, industrial corporations and governmentministries has become apparent. And we watch in some amazement the reaction among some sections
BIS Review 135/19992of the political and business communities in Germany to the Vodafone/Mannesmann takeover battle -an almost unprecedented (for Germany) hostile bid, no more palatable for being from abroad - alongwith the government’s efforts to save the Holzmann construction group, not to mention the authorities’stout defence of the largely state-owned domestic regional banking network there.Thus, the more open and aggressive equity market environment of the anglo-saxon model seems tohave delivered ultimately the fitter economy. But we should remember that the stock market doesn’tserve everyone who is looking for equity finance. There is a large population of smaller and medium-sized businesses which cannot aspire to access the market. Nevertheless they are importantcontributors to the economy and need equity funding. Few, if any, economies have been able to matchthe USA when it comes to enterprise culture and the relatively abundant sources of funding availableto SMEs. Even in Hong Kong, where we pride ourselves as being highly market-oriented andenterprising, we cannot claim that life is a bed of roses for SMEs. But I am encouraged by the launchof the Growth Enterprise Market - the stock exchange’s second board – which fills a particular gap,albeit only one, in the needs of smaller or younger companies.The final years of this century have also seen inflation largely conquered across much of the worldeconomy. Low inflation should provide a propitious climate for the issuance of medium and long-termdebt instruments. In Hong Kong the debt market has been growing, although more at the short endthan the long, and the secondary market is not greatly active, except for Exchange Fund bills. There isof course nothing wrong in investors wanting to hold instruments to maturity; indeed, in one sense itmay be interpreted as a sign of confidence. But the investor base for any particular issue will be thatmuch larger if secondary market liquidity is assured.The significance of developing domestic debt markets has been widely recognised elsewhere in thisregion too. It is perhaps something that is of special importance for countries where there is a clearadvantage in expanding domestic financial intermediation in order to reduce dependence on externaldebt. Hong Kong has contributed to the APEC Compendium of Sound Practices for the developmentof debt markets, which covers such topics as regulation, transparency, risk control and so on. This willhelp guide the establishment of best-practice infrastructure for these markets, but that in itself is noguarantee that markets will actually mature. In general, however, the prospects for the furtherdevelopment of bond markets in the region in the new millennium look promising.From the point of view of international investors, exchange rates may also, of course, be a crucialelement of the investment equation. They are certainly so for the trader or short-term investor. Forlong-term investors, however, the swings and roundabouts may even out; it could be argued that muchof the movement of exchange rates reflects nominal impulses, which should not unduly affect long-runreal returns.If one tries to predict exchange rates in pursuit of a winning investment strategy, one is likely to be asoften disappointed as elated. In a rather arbitrary exercise I have looked at the return from investing in7-10 year government bonds in different countries from mid-1986 (selected only because it was thestarting point of the particular data set) to the present. The assumption is that the non-dollar currencieswere purchased out of US dollars at the outset and changed back at the end, so that the comparison ison a US dollar basis. It emerges that the average annual return for the period was nearly 12% forAustralia, 11% UK, 10.5% Japan, 10% Canada, 8% Germany and 6.5% Switzerland - with the USitself at 8%. How many of you would have got this right ex ante? I hesitate to try to draw anyprofound conclusions from this, other than that, with US inflation averaging about 3%, there wasclearly a reasonable real return to be had everywhere. You did not have to be greedy to survive.The argument of the monetarist school that - to put it in a slightly condensed form - monetary factorsdo not have a lasting effect on real developments, was especially fashionable during the 1970s whengovernments were criticised for conceding to inflation in the mistaken belief that they could therebysustain or stimulate activity. Subsequent experience has proved, if anything, that the optimal monetarystance is, quite simply, a continuing steady one, and that variance on either side - whether too tight ortoo loose and after allowing for any real shocks - may incur lasting economic losses. Thus, today, thereceived wisdom is that central banks should follow clearly articulated policies aimed at a stablemonetary environment. This in turn begs the question of how to define a stable monetary environment.
3BIS Review 135/1999In Hong Kong, a highly open economy with no capital controls, we focus on stability of the exchangerate, but this regime itself requires a flexible economic structure and a sound banking sector. I believethat Hong Kong possesses those attributes, as demonstrated not least by the adjustment of the past twoyears, and that the peg remains the appropriate regime for us, but I would be the first to admit that it ismay not suit others.From the point of view of investors, it is the stability and credibility of macroeconomic policy as awhole which probably determines, or ought to determine, investment strategy. As experience tells us,it can be a costly mistake to pay attention only to particular parts of the policy regime, such as theexchange rate, without scrutinising the wider context in order to be satisfied that the overall design iscredible.And so it is my pleasure to help to launch this conference today, and to welcome those of you fromoutside Hong Kong. We pride ourselves in being a place which offers not only a wide choice ofexcellent conference facilities but also, more importantly, the critical mass of financial and ancillaryservices which issuers and investors require - and which many of you here today contribute to. Muchhas been written of late as to whether costs in Hong Kong are too high. Let me ask you to reflect onthe following. Cities such as London and New York have a reputation for being expensive. So also doof a number of capital cities in former communist countries. In a very general sense one can say thatLondon and New York are expensive as a consequence of success as business centres and because,presumably, people still feel that there is value for money there. I leave you to judge whether theothers would fit that description; to my understanding, some of them have become expensive for ratherdifferent and less palatable reasons.I strongly believe that Hong Kong fits the London-New York paradigm. Actually, our competitiveness(as measured by the real effective exchange rate) is now back where it was in mid-1997 before theonset of the Asian crisis, thanks to the sharp adjustment of property prices and reductions in labourcosts, and with help from a strengthening of other currencies, notably the yen. Nevertheless, althoughcosts may now be back closer to their norm, Hong Kong will never be a cheap place. But when youtake account of what is on offer here and the high productivity of the labour force, I hope you willagree that you get value for money. Of course it is crucial for us all to pay continuing attention toraising efficiency and containing costs, but let’s not lose sight of the fact that emergence as a relativelyhigh-salary, high-rent business centre is a symptom of success, not a reason for failure.I wish you all an enjoyable and fruitful conference.
1BIS Review 135/1999Mr Thiessen clarifies some points regarding the economy,productivity and standard of living in CanadaRemarks by Gordon Thiessen, Governor of the Bank of Canada, to The Fraser Institute in Vancouver,British Columbia, on 6 December 1999*      *      *Over the past couple of years, there has been considerable debate about productivity and our standardof living in Canada. For the most part, the discussion of these issues has been useful, but at times it hasbeen somewhat confusing.There are so many different facets to productivity and the standard of living that they cannot all becovered in one speech. My objective today is relatively modest - to try and clarify some of the basicideas and measures and to explain where monetary policy fits in this debate.I will start by focusing on the relationship between the standard of living and productivity. Next, I willtalk about some of the different measures of productivity. I will finish with a few words on howmonetary policy can contribute to rising productivity and rising standards of living.The connection between the standard of living and productivityA country’s standard of living and its productivity are not the same thing, although over the long runthey are closely linked. This distinction has not always been made clear in some of the commentary Ihave seen.When we speak of a society’s standard of living, we are typically referring to the individual well-beingof its citizens. In principle, our standard of living should reflect both economic welfare and social(“quality of life”) elements, such as a clean environment, a low crime rate, freedom of expression, etc.But because the social elements are difficult to assess and to weigh properly, the focus is usually onmeasures of our economic well-being.There are a number of different indicators of our economic welfare. The most common one measureshow much output is produced in our economy, on average, for every man, woman and child in Canada(real gross domestic product per capita). There are also various measures of real income per person,before and after taxes (such as gross national income per capita and personal disposable income percapita).If we look closely at any one of these measures, it is clear that productivity is a critical factor in thedetermination of our standard of living. But it is not the only factor. And when there are changes inany of the other elements that influence our economic welfare, our standard of living can, for periodsof time, change in ways that appear to be disconnected from trends in the growth of productivity.As an example, let us look at the simplest yardstick of living standards - output per capita. Clearly, thisis closely related to the output produced per worker - which is the most common measure ofproductivity. But it also depends on the number of people employed relative to the total population.Through the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, output per capita in Canada increased more rapidly thanproductivity. But over the past 10 years, it has fallen behind the growth in productivity.Canada’s lacklustre standard-of-living performance in the 1990s, which we have heard so much about,has less to do with slower productivity growth than with the fact that the proportion of the populationthat is actually employed has not been increasing. This is in contrast to the rising trend of the previousthree decades, when an increasing number of women and baby boomers were entering the labourmarket.
BIS Review 135/19992During the 1990s, trends in employment rates in Canada also diverged significantly from those in theUnited States, contributing to an increased gap in living standards between the two countries. Thisweak employment growth in Canada partly reflects the extensive and difficult restructuring that ourprivate and public sectors had to undergo in a relatively short time compared with the United States,where the process started earlier and was spread over a longer time period.If we measure our standard of living in terms of how much of the national income goes to each andevery Canadian, then we are not just talking about the volume of goods and services we produce. Weare also talking about the world prices we receive for what we sell abroad relative to the prices we payfor imports - that is, our terms of trade.During the 1970s, world prices for the primary commodities that Canada exports soared relative toprices in general. And they remained high through to the early 1980s. Since then, however,commodity prices have typically been on a downward trend. And, of course, they fell sharply in thewake of the Asian crisis in 1997-98, before partly recovering in 1999. We have to take this intoaccount when we examine what happened to our standard of living in the 1990s compared with earlierdecades.We also need to look at what has happened to personal income after taxes. From the mid-1970s to theearly 1990s, tax revenues did not cover government spending and we were getting deeper and deeperinto debt. In other words, we were living beyond our means. During the 1990s, taxes rose andgovernment transfers and other expenditures were cut back relative to the size of our economy toreduce the burden of those large public debts that had accumulated during the previous two decades.Measures of after-tax income in the 1990s reflect that sobering reality.So these are some of the factors that have weakened the link between productivity and living standardsin recent years. In the long run, however, productivity is, without a doubt, the key elementcontributing to our prosperity. Productivity growth is the foundation for real income growth - it allowsbusinesses to pay higher real wages and still keep costs down and remain profitable.There is one important difference between productivity and the other factors that influence our livingstandards. The difference is that there are no constraints on productivity and its ability to contribute toimprovements in our welfare on a sustained basis. The other factors are constrained by physical,institutional, and legal limitations. For example, there is a limit to the proportion of the population thatcan, and will, engage in economic activity. Similarly, there are limits on the length of the work week.On the other hand, there does not seem to be an upper bound on capital accumulation over time or onthe growth of human knowledge or on the degree to which both can result in higher productivity.Productivity: the Canadian recordBut I have been talking about productivity without defining it properly or describing how we measureit.Measures of productivity tell us how much output we can produce from the effective use of variousinputs - skilled workers, capital equipment, technological innovation, and managerial andentrepreneurial know-how. Increases in productivity trace improvements over time in our ability toboost output by finding new and more efficient ways to use these inputs.The most commonly used, and best-understood, measure of productivity is labour productivity. It tellsus how much output is produced per worker or per hour worked. Of course, labour productivity isaffected by experience and education as well as by the amount of capital equipment (notablymachinery and equipment) that is available to workers. So, ideally, we would prefer to use themeasure that combines labour with all these other inputs - what we economists call total factorproductivity.In practice, however, it is very difficult to measure the amount of physical capital in the economy.Also, it is not clear how best to take account of improvements over time in the quality of the variousinputs. And, of course, measurement problems are worse in the services sector, where output is alsonotoriously difficult to estimate. Because of these difficulties, analysts usually focus on the more
3BIS Review 135/1999straightforward measures of labour productivity. This has the added advantage of being closer tomeasures of standards of living and more directly comparable across countries.With that as background, let me now turn to the “facts” on productivity in Canada, as best we canmeasure them, and see how they compare with those for the United States. We should, of course, keepin mind that the relevant statistics for the two countries, while similar, are not always comparable. Forexample, there are differences in the way some prices are measured, particularly for high-techequipment, as well as differences in adjusting for changes in the quality of inputs. Moreover, lastmonth, the Americans revised their productivity figures upwards, following revisions to their nationalaccounts going back to 1959. To a significant extent, these revisions reflect a definitional change thatnow treats computer software as an investment (instead of a business expense as before), and thereforeas part of the country’s gross domestic product.These definitional changes probably make the U.S. productivity figures less comparable with oursthan before. So one should be careful not to draw strong conclusions from comparisons that focus toonarrowly on these data. Nevertheless, we can still comment on the broad trends.Through the 1950s and 1960s and into the early 1970s, labour productivity in the overall businesssector in Canada grew rapidly. It averaged close to 4 per cent per year - somewhat higher than in theUnited States. From the early 1970s to the mid-1990s, productivity growth slowed sharply in bothcountries - to less than half that rate. It has picked up in the latter half of the 1990s, especially in theUnited States, where an investment boom has given U.S. workers substantially greater amounts ofcapital equipment to work with.Some commentators have paid particular attention to productivity growth in the manufacturing sector,even though manufacturing accounts for less than 20 per cent of total economic activity in bothcountries. They believe that the measures for this particular sector are more reliable and more relevantfor international competitiveness.Since the 1980s, labour productivity in the Canadian manufacturing sector has risen at a significantlyslower pace than in the United States. To a large extent, this stronger showing by the U.S.manufacturing sector reflects the remarkable performance of two industries - electrical and electronicproducts and commercial and industrial machinery. These industries have benefited the most fromdramatic advances in computer technology, and they have a much larger weight in the U.S. economythan here in Canada.As a last comment on the facts about our productivity performance, I would like to stress the need todistinguish clearly between the rate of growth and the level of productivity. While this may seem self-evident, there has been a certain confusion on this score in some of the recent public commentary.The rate of growth in our productivity has certainly slowed since the early 1970s, as it has in mostindustrial countries, for reasons that are still not fully understood. But the level of our productivity hasbeen rising, not falling. And it cannot be blamed for the decline in some measures of our livingstandards during the 1990s.However, there is a significant gap in levels of productivity between Canada and the United States -ours is below theirs. Since access to ideas and technology is international, we would have expectedthat gap to narrow, as it did during the 1950s and 1960s. But it hasn’t. For this to happen, productivityin Canada has to grow at a faster pace than in the United States. This is the challenge we Canadiansface if we are to bring our standard of living closer to that of our southern neighbours.How can monetary policy support productivity growth?Economists have not been particularly successful in explaining differences in rates of productivitygrowth over time or across countries. As a result, there is no widespread agreement on what can bedone to bring about faster productivity growth on a sustained basis.
BIS Review 135/19994Nonetheless, I would like to make some comments on what would be helpful in this regard. And Iwould certainly emphasize that we should always scrutinize our economic policies for any potentialimpact on productivity.When it comes to monetary policy, there is an increasing international consensus that the contributioncentral banks can make to encourage growing productivity and higher standards of living is to providea low-inflation environment.Low and stable inflation reduces uncertainty about future price movements, lowers the incidence ofboom-and-bust cycles in the economy, and helps to keep interest rates down. All of this encouragesinvestments in equipment and new technology that should lead to productivity gains. When I look atthe impressive productivity record of the United States over the past couple of years, I am struck bythe exceptionally large investments in machinery, equipment, and technology that have taken placethere.I know that the depreciation of the Canadian dollar through late 1997 and 1998 has kindled someconcerns that a weak currency blunts the incentives for export industries to improve productivity. Andthat has led to some suggestions that Canadian monetary policy, rather than targeting low inflation,should set targets for the Canadian dollar. Or that perhaps our currency should be pegged to the U.S.dollar.It is true that in a period of high, and potentially rising, inflation, a depreciating currency adds to theconfusion about what is happening to relative prices and contributes to an attitude that any costincreases can be passed on. Thus, businesses may not be as concerned about improving productivity asa cost-cutting measure. But that is not the case in Canada today - inflation is low and stable, and theBank is committed to keeping it that way. Businesses know that they will generally not be able to passon cost increases, and so they focus on cost control.The argument that a depreciated currency tends to discourage productivity improvements also ignorestoday’s powerful global competitive forces and the strong drive of businesses to increase their marketshare and their profits as well as raise the prices of their stock.In my judgment, our floating exchange rate works well. It absorbs the impact of, and facilitates theadjustment to, extraordinary shocks that hit our economy from time to time, such as the sharp drop inprimary commodity prices in 1997-98. As part of that adjustment, the low Canadian dollar hasencouraged businesses outside the primary industries to expand their presence in foreign markets. Butthey can maintain those gains only if they continue to work hard to increase productivity and to ensurethat they stay competitive as our currency regains strength.Concluding thoughtsTo conclude, it is almost impossible to overemphasize the importance of rising productivity as thefundamental long-term factor contributing to healthy economic performance and prosperity. Overtime, gains in productivity are the basis for growing incomes and rising standards of living.Compared with the strong performance of the 1950s and 1960s, Canada’s productivity record since theearly 1970s has been rather disappointing. Even though the level of our productivity has been rising,we have not made any headway in bringing it closer to that of the United States.Recent developments in Canada, however, offer some promise of improvement. Productivity growthhas picked up in the past couple of years in response to the cyclical recovery and the structuralchanges in our economy. And investment in machinery, equipment, and technology has increasedsharply in the past three years, much the same way as it did in the United States some years earlier.But there is no room for complacency. Increases in productivity do not just happen. These days, goodproductivity performance seems to be related to changing technology - an openness to adopting it anda flexibility in adapting to it. That is what we must strive for in Canada.We will also need to maintain a stable macroeconomic environment that combines low inflation and aprudent fiscal policy. This will help foster a climate conducive to initiatives in innovation, risk-taking,
5BIS Review 135/1999and investment that can contribute to sustained productivity gains. I can assure you that the Bank ofCanada will continue to do its part, by keeping inflation low and stable.
1BIS Review 134/1999Mr George looks at past, present and future challenges for the City of LondonSpeech given by Mr Eddie George, Governor of the Bank of England, at a City University Conferenceat the International Maritime Organisation in London 7 December 1999.*      *      *Mr Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen,As we approach the end of every year we naturally tend to look back at the past, to take stock, and tolook forward to the challenges ahead. The temptation to do that this year on the brink of the newMillennium, is almost irresistible.But take courage - I will at least try not to dwell upon the historical origins of the City this morning.Instead, I will start from where we are now - which is a good place to start because by and large theCity is in pretty good shape.It is, of course, the hub of the financial and business services industry of this country, which, broadlydefined to include shipping and real estate as well as other forms of intermediation, and theaccountancy and legal professions, contributes directly something like a quarter of total nationaloutput - with some 7-8% coming from the financial services sector alone.And, whatever the periodic outcry whenever something goes wrong - as it will from time to time - thedemand for these services does not of course exist in a vacuum; it exists because of the very positivecontribution that the business services sectors, including financial services, make to growth andemployment and rising living standards in the wider economy. That is true nationally, but it is equallytrue in a global context. Indeed the unique characteristic of the City is its role as the predominantinternational financial centre. It accounts for a fifth of all international cross-border lending, forexample; for a third of global turnover in foreign exchange and OTC derivatives, and as much astwo-thirds of issuance and secondary trading in eurobonds, or of global turnover in internationalequities, with more foreign firms listed on the LSE than on any other exchange. And London has anear-monopoly in exchange-traded short-term euro interest rate derivatives.I will not labour the point further, Mr Chairman. Despite - or perhaps driven by - a continuous streamof shocks and competitive challenges, the City has in fact gone from strength to strength, mostrecently coming through the global financial turbulence of the last couple of years as well as theadvent of the euro at least as strong as before.It is perhaps worth asking why the City is as strong as it is.Certainly it does have to do partly with history. The emergence of the City owed a good deal toBritain’s earlier position as the world’s leading industrial and trading nation and international power.But that does not explain its continuing strength. To explain that there are lots of factors one mightpoint to - the English language, the European time zone, the sheer momentum of the City’s criticalmass, supported by the availability of a professionally-qualified and technically-skilled work forcewhich gives the City remarkable resilience and flexibility, aspects of our commercial and physicalinfrastructure, and so on. All of these factors are certainly relevant factors.But if I had to identify one factor above all that helped to explain the continuing phenomenon of theCity, it would be what I can only rather vaguely describe as the surrounding ethos of a free,competitive, market place.I do not at all mean by that that the City is a lawless jungle where anything goes! In fact quite thereverse. You cannot have an effective competitive market without reasonably clear rules of the game,both to protect society as a whole from disruption and to retain the confidence of both the providersand users of the market by ensuring that they know what is expected of them and what they can
BIS Review 134/19992reasonably expect of others. The evolving legal and regulatory framework in this country, togetherwith the self-regulatory disciplines applied by the relevant market organisations and professionalbodies have been - and remain - a vitally important asset for the City in this context.It is not just the structure of these arrangements but their substance and the manner of application ofthe rules of the game that matters.It is all too easy to err on either side. The rules may be so loosely drawn that market participants andmarket users lose confidence and go elsewhere; or they may be so tightly drawn that they discouragecompetition and inhibit innovation. Equally, the actual, as distinct from the intended, balance betweensocial protection and fairness on the one hand, and competition on the other, may be affected by theapproach adopted by the various arbitrators. Theirs is a difficult job at the best of times. We’ve allseen matches ruined by either unduly lax or unduly officious refereeing. But ultimately the characterof the game depends upon the self-discipline, as well as the skills, of the players.In general I believe that we in this country have been well served in these respects. There has beenrelatively little systemic disturbance in recent years, and what there has been has required relativelymodest commitment of public funds. There have, it is true, been periodic concerns about businessbehaviour. Where these have been general concerns - often reflecting the rapid evolution of the marketplace or rising public expectations - they have mostly been addressed by reinforcing the rules of thegame. Or where they have reflected the behaviour of individual firms or their employees they havebeen pursued - not least to encourage others. Of course we need to remain constantly vigilant in allthese areas to retain confidence in our market place. But all the evidence suggests that such confidenceremains strong by any international standards.There are three characteristics of the City’s market ethos that I would point to in particular.Quite early on in my career at the Bank - more years ago than I care to remember - I was profoundlyinfluenced by the man then responsible for administering Exchange Control - Brian Bennett. He had,framed on his desk, a wartime poster which read “Freedom is in peril - defend it with all your might.”And he explained to me that this was to remind him that his job was not simply to apply the 4Exchange Control regulations - though that certainly was his job; it was also to help people to do whatthey were seeking to do consistently with both the spirit and the letter of the law. I like to think thatthat philosophy has informed - and continues to inform - the approach to applying the rules of thegame more generally in the City.A related characteristic is that apart from defining, and applying, constructively, the rules of the game,the various authorities do then leave the market to get on with it - they do not by and large seek to tellthe various markets, or firms operating within them, what they should or should not do. In the Bank,for example, we always stand ready to help when market participants collectively seek our help - say,in relation to market infrastructure projects where, working with market participants, we took on thedevelopment and introduction of new settlements systems for the Gilt-Edged, Money and Equitymarkets and new wholesale payments systems - but we try to avoid either dirigisme or unnecessaryconservative resistance to market initiatives, whether collective initiatives, such as the creation ofLIFFE, or initiatives at the level of the individual firm. We may act as a catalyst, encouraging differentsectors of the market to address emerging problems, either on their own or by coming together, butessentially we take the view that the markets and firms themselves are best placed to find the wayahead.The third characteristic of what I’ve called the free market ethos - and one which is absolutely crucialto the City’s success - is impartiality and even-handedness, both in the application of the rules of thegame and in terms of business opportunities - applying the same standards to all market participants orwould-be participants, regardless in particular of nationality.Some people still find this difficult to understand. A few years ago Japanese bankers used to tease meby asking what I thought of the “Wimbledonisation” of the City - meaning that this country organisedthe best competition in the world but the visitors carried off the prizes. I used to explain to them that itwas activity - rather than nationality of ownership or even control - that mattered in terms of the City’scontribution to the wider economy, and in terms of its direct contribution to growth or employment, or
3BIS Review 134/1999of income or tax base in this country; I even suggested that Tokyo would benefit as a financial centreif it became more open to overseas players. I don’t think that they were convinced at the time. Butnow that has begun to happen, and some of my Japanese banker friends tell me they finally see thepoint. It is in fact of course more generally a lot harder to see the benefits of increasing globalcompetition if you are an existing producer, whether an individual business or the nationalrepresentatives of businesses directly in the firing line than if you are looking at it in terms of thehealth of the macro-economy. But there is no doubt that it is this characteristic of openness tocompetition perhaps above all that explains the uniquely international nature of the City (with moreforeign banks represented here than in any other centre) and accounts for much of the City’scontinuing success.So much then, Mr Chairman, for the past, let me turn now to the challenges and prospects for thefuture.The most immediate challenge is to get through to the next millennium without significant mishap - todemonstrate that we have indeed succeeded in overcoming the Y2K bug. In fact I have no misgivingson that score as far as the City is concerned. The preparation has been immensely thorough. The Bank,with our colleagues in the FSA, and with our counterparts abroad, has worked with the financialmarkets, both on that technical preparation and to ensure that the necessary liquidity will be in place.That in turn has provided a degree of reassurance - to financial intermediaries and to the public morebroadly - that should help to avoid undue precautionary behaviour which might otherwise provedisruptive.A second challenge is the advent of the euro - and on this score, too, I have very few misgivings. Evenbefore the introduction of the new currency the City played a very positive role in its technicalpreparation - and one which has been widely acknowledged. And since that introduction the City hascontinued to play a very active part in the development of the broader, more liquid, financial marketswhich the euro has made possible, and which are vital to its success as a widely-used internationaltrading and investment currency. This activity is in fact the greatest contribution that the UK can maketo that success from the outside. Of course the City is in competition with other financial centreselsewhere in Europe. But as I have often pointed out before, at the macro-economic level suchcompetition is a positive-, not a zero-sum game from which we collectively, borrowers and lendersand market intermediaries, all stand to gain. I have every confidence in the ability of the City to thrivein this competitive environment - but it will thrive not at the expense of the rest of Europe butalongside other European financial centres. And in that context suggestions that we should besomehow artificially disadvantaged are irrational.The third challenge confronting the City - and a much more fundamental one - is the acceleratingadvance of information and communications technology which is currently sweeping across the wholeof the global economy. In the financial services sector in particular it is the major driver of change andinnovation. It makes possible the introduction of a whole raft of essentially new financial services andproducts, and it is radically changing the way in which they and existing services and products aredelivered, whether in wholesale or retail financial markets, at a fraction of the existing cost. Inwholesale markets it will affect the whole spectrum of activity - from trading through payments andsettlements, across the whole range of financial instruments, across national boundaries - not simplywithin Europe although that is an immediate focus of attention - and it has the potential to alterfundamentally the relationships between end-users of the markets, intermediaries and exchanges. And,at the retail level, too, we will all eventually need to learn to live with totally new, and more efficient,ways of doing things - though that will no doubt come harder to people of my generation!I don’t think anyone at this stage can see at all clearly the end-point of all this or even necessarily theappropriate next steps. And that is why we are seeing a continuous, and often bewildering, stream ofnew individual and collective initiatives, many of them involving the same participants, both in thiscountry and abroad. Some of these initiatives will inevitably fall by the wayside - that’s part of theprocess by which the market as a whole discovers the way ahead. But those that do succeed willsucceed because they add value by meeting more effectively the needs of the consumers of theproducts and services they provide. As an intensely interested - but non-commercial - observer of it
BIS Review 134/19994all, I find the whole process hugely stimulating and encouraging. I recognise that I might feeldifferently if I were a commercial rather than a central banker, but I’m impressed by the fact that mostof the commercial bankers I talk to see it in terms of opportunities rather than threats.The other challenge to the City that I would draw attention to is the quite different challengeassociated with growing social concerns and rising public expectations, which are probably heightenedby the rapid pace of financial change associated with advancing technology.In part these concerns relate to perceptions of increased risk of financial instability. There has been,and I suspect will continue to be, increasing public emphasis - both domestically and internationally -within the IMF, the new Financial Stability Forum and the BIS, for example, notably in the wake ofthe recent global financial turmoil - on reducing systemic financial risk and on how to handle systemicdisturbances when they occur.But the social concerns go well beyond this sort of systemic issue. They include growing concernsabout organised criminal abuse of the financial system, for example; they include an increasingemphasis on consumer protection - particularly protection of the less financially-sophisticated in anincreasingly complex environment; and they include questions relating to the financial exclusion ofdisadvantaged sectors of the community. In all these respects, too, the concerns are not just domesticconcerns but have close parallels internationally.It seems to me that in many instances the new technologies, appropriately deployed, actually improvethe capacity of the financial system to address these concerns. But if they are not adequately addressed- whether within the system as a whole or at the level of the individual market or individual firm - theycould - like purely financial failures - weaken public confidence or attract public responses, whichwould have a damaging effect on overall activity.Mr Chairman, I can’t imagine that anyone working in the City will become bored as we move into thenew millennium in the face of these challenges.How successful we are in confronting them will depend, as in the past, upon the interaction of thetechnical and professional skills and self-discipline of the market and the structure, substance andapplication of the rules of the game as they are reflected in public policy.We have unique experience within the City on which to build.The market has repeatedly demonstrated its capacity to respond successfully to new challenges andcurrently attracts representatives of the strongest participants from all parts of the world. It issupported by very highly qualified professionals and professional bodies which play an important rolein setting and maintaining standards. It is supported, too, by an extraordinary range of specialistprofessional and technical organisations, which help to ensure that the rules of the game are sensiblyformulated and clearly understood. And it is supported by a very strong tradition of technical trainingand education through the various financial institutes, a tradition which I hope may soon be bolsteredby the development of a coherent set of professional qualifications across the different financialmarket sectors.But how far we remain successful will depend importantly, too, on how far we are able to maintainwhat I have described as the ethos of the competitive market place in a rapidly changing environmentand that will represent a considerable challenge to public policy. Given market self-discipline, I haveevery confidence, Mr Chairman, that the various competent authorities will remain constructive andimpartial in their approach to defining and applying the rules of the game, and open to innovation andwide participation, so that the City retains its position as an attractive location for the provision offinancial and business services.So, Mr Chairman, I look to the future of the City with very considerable confidence. On recent form ithas little to fear and great opportunities to look forward to. But I don’t say that it will be easy.
BIS Review   88/1998Mr. Brash gives an address on ‘Reserve Bank forecasting: should we feelguilty?’   Address by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, Mr. Donald T. Brash, toThe New Zealand Society of Actuaries inWaitangi on 21/10/98.IntroductionThank you for the invitation to address you today. I last addressed the Society inApril 1995 on why I was strongly in favour of the Government’s issuing inflation-indexed bonds.Notwithstanding some concerns about the tax treatment of those bonds, and their inaccessibility tosmall investors, I believe that the issue of the bonds has been successful, and I am very glad that theGovernment proceeded to issue them.Today, I want to talk on quite a different matter. You, as actuaries, spend a lot ofyour time assessing the viability of pension schemes, and in doing that you need to makeassumptions about the rate of inflation, the rate of return on investments, and a host of other things.And of course sometimes your assumptions turn out to be wrong, because the one thing you can allbe absolutely certain of is that the future will never turn out to be quite the same as you assume itwill be.Well, I have a great deal of sympathy for you. Like you, I as a central banker spend agreat deal of my time trying to make an assessment of the future. And like you, I rarely get itabsolutely right.Recently, the Reserve Bank has been severely criticized by a number of people forhaving misread the economy in recent months, and in particular for failing to head off the twoquarters of negative growth which New Zealand experienced in the first half of this year. One majornewspaper has gone so far as to suggest that our forecasting record is ‘abysmal’. In recent days, withthe New Zealand dollar up sharply against the US dollar, we have also been criticized for allowingthis to happen. I believe the critics are wrong.The accuracy of Reserve Bank projectionsThe Reserve Bank devotes very considerable effort to its projections. We study a verywide range of data from New Zealand sources on production, prices, wages, money supply, bankcredit, business and household confidence, and much more. We have developed a series of so-calledindicator models, which help us to assess what is happening in the economy at the present time,before we have the official GDP figures available to us. We have developed a sophisticated model ofthe whole economy to help us with medium-term forecasting, after looking carefully at the workdone in other similar countries, particularly in Canada and Scandinavia. Before each quarterlyprojection, a group of Reserve Bank staff fans out across the country and talks to upwards of 40businesses and business organisations to get an up-to-the-minute impression of what a small numberof - hopefully - representative firms are experiencing. We have, for example, talked with 54companies and business organisations throughout the country in the last few weeks, in preparationfor our November Monetary Policy Statement. We get information from the non-executive Directorsof the Bank itself, and from a large number of informal sources, such as letters, phone calls, and themeetings which I myself have throughout the country. We talk to Statistics New Zealand to try to getan understanding of what lies behind some of the statistics. We talk to the producer boards to get anunderstanding of what is happening in the agricultural sector. As a result, we go into each quarterlyprojection ‘round’ armed with a very great deal of information on the New Zealand economy.
- 2 -BIS Review   88/1998We do not ourselves make forecasts of the international economy, but instead use themonthly Consensus Forecasts, produced by Consensus Economics Inc. in London. These reflect theassessment of a group of forecasters in each of the major countries to which New Zealand exports,and historically the average of these forecasts has tended to outperform the forecasting performanceof any single forecaster. We certainly have no reason to believe that we could produce betterforecasts for our overseas markets than can the forecasters ‘on the ground’ in the countriesconcerned.But despite all this effort, we often end up wishing, with the benefit of hindsight, thatwe had run monetary policy slightly differently. Unfortunately, it is inherent in the way in whichmonetary policy works that at times we will wish we had done things a little differently. Why?Because monetary policy has its effect on the real economy with a considerable lag, and its effect oninflation with an even longer lag. To make matters worse, the lags are not even stable. This meansthat to avoid making errors we would have to have perfect foresight, and of course I am notembarrassed to admit that we have nothing of the kind.Indeed, the situation is even worse than that. Not only can we not see into the futurewith perfect foresight, we do not even know precisely where the economy is at present. To be sure,we receive lots of anecdotes, and some of the data we analyse may only be a few weeks out of date.But the most comprehensive measure of output in the economy, the estimate for Gross DomesticProduct, is not available for almost three months after the end of the quarter to which it refers - andthen for the next year or so that figure is subject to revision, often to very substantial revision. Thusfor example, the first estimate made by Statistics New Zealand for GDP in the March quarter of 1996indicated that the economy was growing at an annualised rate of some 1.5 per cent. A year later,Statistics New Zealand estimated that the annualised growth rate for the March quarter of 1996 wasactually some 4.2 per cent. The policy implications of those two numbers are radically different.Cynics have suggested that God made economic forecasters to make weather forecasters look good.But at least weather forecasters can look out the window, and with reasonable accuracy know whatthe weather is at the present time. Economic forecasters do not have that advantage.If monetary policy works well, it can help the economy adjust to the unforeseenshocks which will inevitably hit us from time to time, whether these be sudden changes in exportprices, sudden changes in import prices, or whatever. This should have a tendency to smoothfluctuations in output to some extent. But it is quite unrealistic to expect that monetary policy caneliminate the business cycle completely, and we have never claimed that we can do so. No matterhow prescient the Reserve Bank had been, the sudden collapse of the Korean economy was alwaysgoing to have a hugely negative impact on the New Zealand forestry industry, and on parts of theNew Zealand tourist industry. We should not, and do not, feel embarrassed about being unable tofully offset events such as that.In years past, some economists, recognising the very great practical problemsinvolved in forecasting over the period relevant to monetary policy, suggested that as a substitute foreconomic forecasting central banks should simply concentrate on keeping some measure of moneysupply growing at a rate consistent with the inflation target. Alas, central banks around the worldfound that keeping money supply growing at a stable rate was not only very difficult to do in practicebut it also provided rather poor control over inflation. As a result, virtually all central banks admit tohaving abandoned such a monetarist approach to monetary policy, and even those central bankswhich continue to base policy on money supply numbers to some degree often find it necessary todepart from a strict adherence to those targets.
- 3 -BIS Review   88/1998Other monetary policy ‘rules’ have been devised, the most famous of these perhapsbeing that named after Professor John Taylor of Stanford University. The Taylor rule involvessetting interest rates in response to deviations in the rate of inflation and the level of output fromtheir targeted levels.But all of these rules involve a simple rule of thumb as a guide to policy in a situationwhere the central bank must of necessity set policy for an economic situation which is 18 to 24months into the future, and therefore can not be foreseen with any certainty whatsoever. The onlyway the Reserve Bank could avoid the embarrassment of being wrong about the future at least asoften as being right would be to stop publishing our projections. Indeed, most central banks do notpublish detailed projections for either the economy or for inflation. The Bank of England does, asdoes the Swedish central bank. But the Reserve Bank of Australia does not, the Bank of Canada doesnot, the Federal Reserve Board in the United States does not, and the Bundesbank does not. We stillbelieve that publishing our projections is helpful to an understanding of what the Reserve Bank isdoing, but life would certainly be rather more comfortable for us if we did not.What of the present situation? How seriously have we misread the situation? The firstpoint to note I think is that the Bank’s primary responsibility is to keep the inflation rate within thetarget which has been agreed with Government. That is the measure against which the Bank shouldbe held accountable. The inflation target was originally 0 to 2 per cent, but has been 0 to 3 per centsince December 1996. We first entered that inflation target in 1991 and, with the exception of theyear to June 1995 (when we exceeded the target by 0.2 per cent, in part as a result of a very sharpincrease in vegetable prices two months before the end of the year), and 1996 (when we wereslightly above the target throughout the year), the inflation rate has been within the agreed targetthroughout that period. For all of 1997 and for 1998 to date, we have not only been within the target,but have been close to the middle of the target. At no point since first entering the target band in1991 have we driven inflation below the bottom of the band, and indeed at no point has inflationgone below the mid-point of the band which applied at the time. This hardly suggests an abysmalforecasting record, nor that the Bank has operated policy excessively firmly. On the contrary:overall, it suggests that the Reserve Bank has done its job well.As an aside, I don’t propose to comment in detail here on why we have had to havepolicy rather tighter in New Zealand in recent years than has been necessary in Australia. Thatmatter has been dealt with in a good article in the Bank’s quarterly Bulletin not long ago. The keypoint is that we clearly experienced a conjunction of inflationary pressures, including quite strongincreases in housing prices, in the mid-1990s, whereas Australia had a rather different experience. Ifinflationary pressures in the two countries converge, I have no doubt that in due course we will findthat monetary conditions in the two countries will converge also. Indeed, that seems to havehappened to a considerable extent in recent months.But is it fair to suggest that the Bank was slow to ease policy in response to the Asiancrisis, or to the drought? It is worth recalling that the present easing cycle began when our MonetaryPolicy Statement was issued in December 1996. At that time, an easing, even the relatively moderateone which we indicated was appropriate, seemed a fairly bold move. Inflation had been outside thetop of the target band all year, the Government had announced a major increase in governmentspending for the next three years, and a major reduction in income taxes, although deferred by ayear, was within the period relevant to monetary policy. Moreover, financial markets were much lessconfident than we were that inflation was trending down, and kept monetary conditions tighter thanwe felt was necessary almost constantly for more than the next four months. Nobody, in NewZealand or elsewhere, was predicting the Asian crisis at that time, though it was at that time that
- 4 -BIS Review   88/1998monetary conditions relevant to economic activity in the first part of 1998 were determined. Nobody,in New Zealand or elsewhere, was predicting the drought at that time.Throughout 1997, the Reserve Bank continued to ease monetary conditionsgradually. During the first months of 1997, most of the easing took the form of lower interest rates.Through the balance of the year, the easing took the form of a lower exchange rate, with interestrates somewhat firmer. But in interest-rate-equivalent terms, we sanctioned an easing of some3 percentage points between December 1996 and 1997.And how reasonable was the assessment in the Monetary Policy Statement we issuedin December 1997? In October that year, the World Economic Outlook published by the IMFprojected that world economic growth would continue at above 4 per cent per annum for the balanceof the decade. This projection was made in the knowledge of the emerging problems in Asia, but inthe expectation that relatively robust growth would continue in the United States and Europe. A fewweeks later, the South Korean economy was clearly in serious difficulty, but the mean of theNovember Consensus Forecasts projected that industrial production in Korea would grow by almost8 per cent in 1998. Industrial production in Japan was projected to grow at what seemed like a verymodest 2 per cent this year. We were suspicious that perhaps the Consensus Forecasts were notpicking up the seriousness of the deterioration in the world situation. For the first time, wedeliberately departed from our traditional use of the mean of the Consensus Forecasts, and insteadused a pessimistic sub-set of those forecasts. We had a hunch that the situation could turn out evenworse than these numbers suggested but, with the overwhelming majority of international forecasterscontinuing to project strong growth in key markets such as Australia, the United States, and Europe,we stayed with that pessimistic sub-set.Even though, with the wisdom of hindsight, it is clear that the growth we projectedfor the New Zealand economy in 1998 was too optimistic, that is not the same as saying thatmonetary policy itself was flawed. Every quarter, the Bank produces a new quarterly projection, andadjusts its position in the light of new data. Perhaps of even greater importance, the Bank allowsfinancial markets very considerable leeway to adjust monetary conditions in the light of new databetween those quarterly projections. The real issue is not whether the Bank’s projections wereabsolutely correct; they will never be. Rather the issue is whether the Bank allowed monetaryconditions to evolve appropriately in the light of new information, and I believe that we did.Over the 10 months since December 1997, the easing of monetary conditions hasaccelerated so that today monetary conditions are the equivalent of almost 10 percentage pointseasier than they were in December 1997, and more than 9 percentage points easier than they wereprojected to be now, back in December 1997. Of course, not all of that easing has been throughreduced interest rates: the exchange rate has fallen substantially also. But 90-day interest rates todayare at levels last seen in early 1994, and indeed, apart from that brief period in early 1994, NewZealand has not seen lower 90-day rates, or lower floating rate mortgages, since the very early1970s! Part of that easing has come about as the Bank has announced its new quarterly projection,but most has occurred as the market has interpreted the new data to mean that inflationary pressuresare continuing to abate even more rapidly than the Bank’s forecasts envisaged. And while we havefrom time to time sought to rein in the speed of the market easing, for the most part we havesanctioned it because we too could see that the emerging data justified easing beyond that envisagedwhen our projections were completed. Remember that when market conditions change and the Banksanctions that change by its silence, the Bank has effectively taken an action. Each Wednesdaymorning at 9.00 a.m. when the Bank says nothing, that silence contains deliberate meaning, whichthe markets understand very well. In my business, silence does not mean abdication.
- 5 -BIS Review   88/1998Certainly, both the March and June quarter GDP figures were weaker than we hadenvisaged when we did our projections. But it is inappropriate to compare our published projection,completed six weeks or so prior to the publication of the GDP estimates, with the estimates ofmarket economists immediately prior to the release of those estimates if by that comparisonsomething meaningful is implied. All of us revise our estimates as new pieces of the jigsaw emerge,and the fact that we have been revising down our own internal estimates is amply illustrated by theextent to which we have been willing to accept conditions very much weaker than envisaged in ourprojections.The last few months illustrate the point rather well. In our August Monetary PolicyStatement, we estimated that the June quarter GDP figure would, when released, show that GDP hadcontracted by 0.2 per cent. On that basis, we estimated that the economy would have a certain levelof unused capacity, resulting in weak inflation pressures. On that basis, we indicated that theappropriate level of monetary conditions, on the MCI, would be around zero during the followingthree months. By 25 September, when Statistics New Zealand released their first estimate of Junequarter GDP, it was clear that inflationary pressures were abating much more quickly than we hadexpected in early August as we completed the Monetary Policy Statement, that GDP had probablyreduced by rather more than 0.2 per cent, and that easier monetary conditions would be appropriate.And in fact monetary conditions just prior to the release of the June quarter GDP numbers on25 September were not zero but -290. We issued a ‘that’s about far enough for the moment’statement on 7 October, by which time conditions had reached -370.To repeat, the real issue is not whether our quarterly projections were correct, butrather whether those projections were reasonable in the light of the data available to us at that time,and whether our response in terms of sanctioning easier monetary conditions was appropriate as newdata emerged. Certainly, monetary conditions have eased very substantially over the last 18 monthsand, as we see it at the moment, that has been appropriate.Do we feel in some sense ‘guilty’ that we did not ease earlier? Even looking back, thedecisions, which we took, seem reasonable in the light of the information available at that time. So,no, we don’t feel ‘guilty’. As President Harry Truman once said, ‘Any schoolboy’s hindsight isbetter than the President’s foresight’.In summary, I have no doubt about the professional excellence of my staff, or aboutthe rigor they bring to our projections four times a year.Inherent in the criticism, which has been made of the Bank in recent weeks, is theview that we have unnecessarily constrained the economy by failing to allow monetary conditions toevolve as the emerging data have suggested was warranted. If that’s true, we will see inflation gonear to, or below, zero. Well, the latest annual inflation number was 1.7 per cent, above themid-point of the inflation target agreed with the Government, and slightly above marketexpectations. I don’t know of too many commentators who are projecting inflation to go anywhereclose to zero over the next year or two.Our projections are not an end in themselves; they are merely a guide to the marketsas to how the Reserve Bank is thinking given current data. Nobody who is informed expects them tocome precisely true, because the world is always changing. That’s why we constantly allow themarkets to adjust monetary conditions as new data emerge.
- 6 -BIS Review   88/1998Why, then, all the criticism? Partly it is that people always want someone to blamewhen times are tough, and the Reserve Bank is an easy target for a cheap shot. Also, I think peopleinstinctively want certainty, even when it is not to be had. In that sense, the Reserve Bank willcontinue to disappoint those who want everything to be black-or-white for as long as the Bankcontinues to be open and honest.What about the rising exchange rate?The only other point I would like to touch on briefly relates to the suddenstrengthening of the New Zealand dollar over the last few weeks. Since 23 September, when theNew Zealand dollar reached 0.492 against the US dollar, the kiwi has strengthened against the USdollar by nearly 9 per cent (as of late 19 October). This is pretty dramatic stuff, and the appreciationhas clearly worried some exporters who fear it may be the beginning of a new period of strongexchange rate appreciation. Indeed, the Meat and Wool Economic Service of New Zealand hasestimated, presumably on the assumption that no forward exchange cover has been taken at lowerexchange rates and that the appreciation is not soon reversed, that a 10 per cent rise in the exchangerate would see farmers’ returns on lamb drop by 17 per cent, on beef by 14 per cent, and on wool by12 per cent.I am bound to say that the present mix of monetary conditions is not one, whichmakes me terribly enthusiastic. Given the propensity of us New Zealanders to borrow as soon ascash-flow constraints allow I worry that at present levels interest rates have become undesirably low.I certainly don’t see much evidence that, at these lower interest rates, New Zealanders will berushing to increase their savings in order to fund our on-going appetite for borrowing.Even at the higher interest rates which prevailed earlier in the year - allegedly thehighest real interest rates in the developed world - New Zealanders were enthusiastic borrowers andreluctant savers, at least in fixed-interest form, suggesting that, whatever the arithmetical calculationimplied about real interest rates, most New Zealanders did not perceive interest rates as particularlyhigh in real terms. Certainly, our real interest rates are not out of line with those in similar countriestoday.In any case, I have long ago had to face the fact that central banks have very limitedability to affect the mix of monetary conditions. To be sure, we could push up interest rates, but onlyat the cost of putting still further upward pressure on the exchange rate. I know of no way in whichthe Reserve Bank can both reduce the exchange rate and increase interest rates. (Of course, we couldease monetary policy further, thereby reducing both interest rates and, presumably, the exchangerate, but the appropriate level of monetary conditions is something which we have to judge in thelight of the overall inflationary pressures, or lack of them.)What we do know is that international foreign exchange markets have been through aperiod of quite extraordinary turbulence in recent weeks. During one 24-hour period, the US dollardepreciated by 10 per cent against the Japanese yen in the biggest one-day movement in thatexchange rate since most currencies were floated in 1973. Over a three-day period, the dollar fell byalmost 20 per cent against the Japanese yen, again an unprecedented movement.In fact, most of the apparent recent strength in the New Zealand dollar has beensimply a reflection of the decline in the US dollar. Against the German mark we had, as of19 October, appreciated by less than 5 per cent; against the Australian dollar we were almost exactlyunchanged; and against the Japanese yen, we had depreciated by 8 per cent. The Trade-Weighted
- 7 -BIS Review   88/1998Index had appreciated by little more than 1 per cent (all comparisons with rates on 23 September).Throughout this recent period of extreme turbulence in international financial markets, the NewZealand dollar has barely been outside a narrow range of 55 to 57 on the Trade-Weighted Index.Moreover, it is also clear that the New Zealand dollar has fallen a very long waysince its peak in April 1997, at 69.1 on the TWI. There seems not the slightest risk of ourapproaching these levels again in the near future. Indeed, there is some evidence to suggest that thecurrent ‘bounce’ in the New Zealand dollar has a great deal to do with turmoil among the hedgefunds in New York. Certainly, market gossip suggests that some of these funds have been selling outof so-called short kiwi positions in recent weeks, causing upward pressure on the New Zealanddollar as a result. But before you rush to denounce these funds for putting upward pressure on ourcurrency, keep in mind that they were instrumental in putting some downward pressure on ourcurrency in the process of establishing the short-kiwi positions which they now appear to have beenunwinding. When these short positions have been closed out, the upward pressure on the currencycould well dissipate quite quickly.Having said that, neither I nor anybody else I know has a dogmatic view about theappropriate, ‘fair’, or equilibrium exchange rate for the New Zealand dollar. My own guess is that itis somewhat stronger than the present exchange rate. Certainly, on an inflation-adjusted basis, thelong-term average trade-weighted exchange rate is a little higher than the present level. But just asthe exchange rate almost certainly overshot during the period of almost four years in which it wasappreciating, so it may overshoot ‘on the other side’. Given New Zealand’s large current accountdeficit, and still-heavy dependence on world commodity markets, some further weakness in thecurrency in the short-term would not be at all surprising.One thing we know with confidence, and that is that if financial markets feeldisinclined to continue investing in New Zealand in large amounts at current low interest rates,either interest rates will rise somewhat or the exchange rate will fall somewhat. The Reserve Bank’sresponsibility is to ensure that, whatever the mix of monetary conditions, we continue to deliverprice stability.ConclusionOn 26 June this year, I gave a speech entitled, Monetary Policy in a DangerousWorld. Though delivered about two hours after the release of the weak March quarter GDP numbers,it was, of course, written several days before that release. In it, I warned that we could well be facing‘the most serious shock to hit the New Zealand economy since the oil shocks of the 1970s’. But Ialso said that the reforms of the last 15 years, including a monetary policy committed to deliveringon-going price stability, put us in a good position to weather the storm. Nothing that has happenedsince 26 June has changed my mind, either about the seriousness of the shock or about our ability toweather the storm.

I am honoured to be delivering the keynote address of this Financial Roadshow of HongKong. I shall, as you are aware, be talking about the Hong Kong dollar link. The Hong Kong dollar has beenlinked to the US dollar at a fixed exchange rate since October 1983. Notwithstanding what must be the worstfinancial turmoil in the history of Asia in recent months, and an abundance of events which might haveundermined confidence on the Hong Kong dollar in the past fourteen and a half years of the existence of thefixed link, the exchange rate has remained very stable. Indeed, the Hong Kong dollar is one of the two majorcurrencies in the Asian region that have not been affected by the recent tidal wave of devaluations, the otherbeing the renminbi (RMB) of the Mainland of China. Furthermore, it is the only freely convertible currency inthe region that has survived the turmoil unscathed.dollar over the years and in particular in the past few months when one after another the Asian currenciestumbled. Indeed, to some, the Hong Kong dollar increasingly sticks out like a sore thumb, but to others it isbeing seen increasingly as a pillar of stability in financial markets in the Asian region and an example offinancial prudence. I hope you belong to the latter group of people rather than the former, but I fear that I maybe expecting too much, for indeed it is quite natural when you do not have the chance to examine in detail anapparently controversial matter to be sceptical about it rather than to hang your faith in it. But my task todayis, so to speak, to try and win you over.Exchange Rate Policy3. Let me start with Hong Kong’s exchange rate policy. Here one is often attracted by thesimplistic argument that Hong Kong, which prides itself as the freest economy in the world, should bestoperate with a freely floating exchange rate. I obviously do not subscribe to that view. Hong Kong, as you allknow, is a highly externally oriented economy. Almost all our daily needs are imported, including forexample the water from our tap at home and sand for construction. And almost all our manufactured productsare exported. Furthermore, we are very much an entrepot, handling a large volume of re-exports1, supportedby the largest container port in the world. And our service industries are also very externally oriented,providing financial and other services for the region, in particular for the Mainland of China. The total valueof our external trade in goods and services in a year is equivalent to well over 250% of our gross domesticproduct (GDP).4. Businessmen engaged in these externally oriented economic activities would I am sure beacutely conscious of the currency risk arising from the many international transactions that they enter into.They would obviously prefer clarity and predictability in the exchange rates of the domestic currency againstthose currencies to which their business is exposed. They would, I am sure, prefer fixed exchange rates overfloating exchange rates, unless they are in the foreign exchange business in which case it is understandablethat they would prefer the greater volatility that comes with floating exchange rates. It is of course an uneasyfeeling that profits might be eroded, or for that matter enhanced, by volatile exchange rates. One simplycannot plan one’s business ahead properly with such volatility. Under the circumstances, prudentbusinessmen have no alternative but to hedge their currency exposures at considerable costs. It would clearlybe beneficial for those conducting externally oriented business if currency risks could be eliminated by afixed exchange rate system that has credibility. I believe this is why Europe has largely been operating withfixed exchange rates, the benefits of which are so clear that we shall soon see the unification of Europeancurrencies as the Euro comes into being. And I would be surprised if some of the Asian economies whichfloated their currencies recently are not regretting it. Indeed, there have been serious discussions to try and re-establish exchange rate stability by again fixing their exchange rates, possibly through the adoption of thecurrency board regime.                                                  1 Re-exports totalled HK$1,245 billion in 1997, accounting for 85% of total exports of Hong Kong.BIS Review   19/1998
- 2 -Economic Fundamentals5. But obviously it takes a lot to establish credibility in a fixed exchange rate, or indeed anyfixed exchange rate system. However, I believe that we have a highly credible fixed exchange rate system inHong Kong. Our track record of exchange rate stability is an impressive one. This is against the backgroundof sharp gyrations in the exchange rates of major currencies. The dollar/yen rate, for example, increasedsharply in the mid-eighties to 263 in February 1985 before falling equally sharply over a short period toaround 120 by the end of 1987, meanwhile triggering the worldwide stock market crash in that year. Thesharp gyrations continued in more recent times, with the dollar/yen rate again falling to around 80 in April1995 before increasing to 134 in January 1998. There was also the ERM crisis of 1992, which at the timebrought sharp focus to the viability of fixed exchange rates; and there was the financial crisis in Mexico,which affected many emerging markets at the beginning of 1995. Then there is currently the worst financialturmoil in the history of Asia. On other fronts, there was also an abundance of events which could haveaffected confidence in the currency over the sensitive period of political transition leading to the resumptionin the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong by China on 1 July 1997. But the Hong Kong dollar’s linkwith the US dollar has remained rock solid, with the exchange rate staying very close to the fixed level ofHK$7.80 to US$1.6. There are good reasons why our exchange rate has remained so stable against sucheventful background. Hong Kong’s economic fundamentals are strong2. We pursue sound macroeconomicpolicies. We have an impressive track record of fiscal discipline3. In the last 14 years of the fixed exchangerate link, while most countries were grappling with fiscal deficits, Hong Kong has consistently run budgetsurpluses averaging 2% of the GDP per year. Our fiscal surplus in the financial year 1997-98 was 5.8% ofGDP. As a result, we have over the years built up strong fiscal reserves. These are deposited with theExchange Fund which holds the foreign reserves of Hong Kong, including those backing the issue of ourcurrency. As at the end of 1997, Hong Kong’s foreign reserves stood at US$92.8 billion, which was the thirdlargest in the world after Japan and the Mainland of China, providing not just 100% backing, but nearly 800%backing for the currency4.7. Moreover, the structure of Hong Kong’s economy is flexible and efficient, encouraged bya small government5 with a strong commitment of public policy towards free markets. This enhances HongKong’s resilience in absorbing external shocks and its ability to adjust quickly. The best example is the labourmarket. Owing to massive relocation of manufacturing processes across the border to the southern part of theMainland of China, employment in the manufacturing sector had declined by nearly 65 percent from 870,000in 1986 to 310,000 in September 1997. In most economies, one would have seen a jump in structuralunemployment and much politicized demands for government intervention. But not in Hong Kong. In fact,the labour market is so flexible and efficient in relocating workers to the service industries6 that theunemployment rate in Hong Kong has remained low throughout at between 2 and 3 percent.                                                  2 During the past 14 years under the linked exchange rate system, the Hong Kong economy achieved an average annualgrowth rate of 6.1% in real terms. Inflation rate, measured by Consumer Price Index (A), averaged 7.5% during this period. Inthe tradable goods sector, inflation was more subdued, with the unit price of exports rising by around 2.2% per annum. Theunemployment rate stayed at a low level of 2 to 3% throughout the period.3 This has further been enshrined in Article 107 of the Basic Law which specifies that “the Hong Kong SpecialAdministrative Region shall follow the principle of keeping expenditure within the limits of revenues in drawing up itsbudget, and strive to achieve a fiscal balance, avoid deficits and keep the budget commensurate with the growth rate of itsgross domestic product.”4 The amount of foreign reserves as at end-1997 at US$92.8 billion was equivalent to 7.8 times the amount of currency notesand coins in circulation, 7.1 times the monetary base, 3.8 times Hong Kong dollar M1, 54% of GDP or 15 months of retainedimports.5 Public expenditure, which comprises total government expenditure and expenditure by public sector organizations, currentlyaccounts for only around 18% of GDP.6 Employment in the services sector rose from 1.1 million workers in 1986 to almost 1.8 million in September 1997,absorbing more workers than the job losses incurred by the contraction of the manufacturing sector during the period.BIS Review   19/1998
- 3 -8. Hong Kong’s robust financial system has also provided an important foundation forexchange rate stability. We have seen many examples in which the maintenance of a stable exchange rate hasbeen undermined by a fragile financial system. Examples include the Mexican peso crisis in 1994 and therecent currency turmoil in Asia. In Hong Kong, however, we have a robust monetary managementmechanism, a modern system of prudential supervision and a sophisticated financial infrastructure. Ourbanking system, for example, is strong, with the capital adequacy ratios of locally incorporated banksaveraging around 17% and problem debt ratios of less than 2%. Although the irrational exuberance that hasbeen a feature of asset markets in the Asian region was also present in Hong Kong, prudent risk managementpractices have enabled our banks to absorb the inevitable asset price deflation that has occurred as thecontagion of financial turmoil spread in the Asian region7.9. The prudent behaviour of our banks has also encouraged prudent business practicesgenerally. There is, in the non-bank sector of Hong Kong, much less of a maturity mismatch in borrowingshort-term money to make long-term investments and a currency mismatch in borrowing foreign currencywithout foreign currency income. These are some of the tragic errors responsible for the dire state that someof the Asian economies have now found themselves in. Furthermore, with the benefits of financialliberalization creating an euphoria that regrettably encouraged neglect on the need to build a robust financialsystem in order to cope with the associated volatility in financial flows, it seems inevitable, at least with thebenefit of hindsight, that there could be tremendous pressures on their currencies. Not so for Hong Kong,already with a long history of liberalized markets and the absence of any forms of exchange control. We havelearnt our lessons in the early eighties and have been meticulous in building ourselves a robust financialinfrastructure and continuously upgrading it. We even managed to do so, in certain issues, ahead of timerather than catching up in a crisis induced situation. Yes, there were still business failures - indeed this is aninevitable feature of free markets - but there is little moral hazard for the public sector. Yes, there were stillcracks showing up in unregulated areas that require mending, for example recently in equity marginfinancing, but nothing of a systemic nature or of any threat to the stability of our currency.10. These strong economic fundamentals of Hong Kong also do not require Hong Kong toget involved in the process of competitive devaluation of currencies recently seen in the Asian region. In thesecond half of 1997, the Thai baht depreciated by 49%, the Indonesian rupiah by 56%, the Korean won by48%, the Malaysian ringgit and the Philippine peso both by 35%. Even the relatively strong economies ofTaiwan and Singapore had allowed their currencies both to depreciate by 15%. Notwithstanding this, theHong Kong economy is still expected to grow in 1998 by 3.5% in real terms. Although this is somewhatbelow the growth rate of 5.2% recorded in 1997, it is a highly respectable growth rate in the light of thecircumstances that we face in the Asian region and is higher than most of the economies in the region thathave devalued their currencies. Most developed economies would be delighted to achieve such a growth ratein 1998. The slowdown is also considered healthy, given a degree of irrational exuberance seen in assetmarkets in the past couple of years. Indeed, inflation this year will slow down further to 5% from 5.8% in1997, with the unemployment rate staying low and the current account remaining broadly in balance. Thusthe Hong Kong economy will not be too much affected by the devaluation of the exchange rates of ourcompetitors. This is understandable for a highly service-oriented economy which Hong Kong now is8.One Country, Two Currencies11. Perhaps I should digress a little here and address a related issue which has been thesubject of some attention, with considerable apprehension amongst observers. This concerns whether thecurrency of the Mainland of China, the RMB, would be forced into devaluation by the Asian financial turmoiland if so what would be the implications for the Hong Kong dollar’s link to the US dollar. The Chinese                                                  7 As an illustration, residential mortgage loans, which account for roughly 25% of total domestic loans extended by thebanking sector, have been of very high quality, helped by the prudent lending policy of the banks, including for example amaximum loan to valuation ratio of 70%. As at the end of September 1997, the actual average of this ratio was only 52%. Thedelinquency ratio, measured by loans overdue for more than 90 days as a percentage of total outstanding loans, stood at only0.1% as at end-September 1997. Even during the property downturn in the second half of 1994 and 1995, the delinquencyratio remained low, at around 0.2%.88 The contribution of the services sector to GDP is now about 85%.BIS Review   19/1998
- 4 -leaders have clearly and repeatedly said that the RMB will not be devalued9. The cynics would of courseimmediately remind us that in the monetary history of the world, devaluations of currencies were frequentlypreceded by strong denials and that these matters are determined by market forces and not the words ofgovernment officials. But I hope the cynics would also spend a little time to look at the facts.12. First, there are still capital controls in the Mainland of China. That makes the control ofthe exchange rate much easier. Indeed, the foreign exchange market in the Mainland of China is dominatedby one large player sitting on about US$140 billion of foreign reserves and that is the State Administration ofForeign Exchange (SAFE) of the People’s Bank of China (PBoC). One simply cannot take a short positionagainst the RMB and so technically the RMB is not exposed to speculative attacks.13. Second, there are political and policy considerations for the Mainland of China to refrainfrom involving itself in competitive devaluation. A devaluation of the RMB would risk creating trade friction,particularly with the United States given that the trade surplus of the Mainland of China with the UnitedStates has risen to almost US$50 billion in 1997, very close to Japan’s trade surplus with the United States atUS$55.7 billion. On the multilateral front, a devaluation may also undermine China’s re-entry to the WorldTrade Organization because it could be seen as a move to gain undue competitive advantage and increase itstrade share. It would also be highly destabilizing for the currencies and financial markets of the Asian region,including those of Hong Kong which the Mainland is very keen to avoid. It could even be destabilizing forfinancial markets beyond the region, and all this would inevitably in the end impact on the Mainland of Chinaitself. A devaluation would also adversely affect the flow of foreign direct investments into the Mainland andrenew inflationary pressures, which would be a pity after winning the tough battle against inflation in the pastthree years10.14. Third, there are other less risky and more effective means of maintainingcompetitiveness. Continuing reform of the state-owned sector, confirmed by the decision of the PartyCongress in September 1997, unleashing the powerful forces of the market, will achieve more efficientallocation of resources and enhance productivity of the economy. There is also continued trade reform11,liberalizing import barriers and cutting import tariff rates on more than 4,800 product categories by over 26%effective from 1 October 1997. The reform of export tax rebates will also benefit exporters. Continuingefforts to strengthen financial markets and the financial infrastructure12 will enable more effective financialintermediation and promote economic growth and development.15. Fourth, in any case, the competitiveness of the Mainland of China is based on broaderstructural factors including underlying factor costs, market leadership and the trade policies of majorimporters. Even after the marked depreciation of Asian currencies, labour costs in the Mainland of China isstill lower than most of Asian economies, perhaps with the exception of Indonesia13. And there is in China acontinued access to a huge labour pool made up of redundant state sector workers and surplus labour in ruralareas. The effect of devaluation on the manufacturing costs in the Asian economies, on the other hand, are                                                  9 Chinese Vice-Premier Mr Zhu Rongji said on 14 January 1998 that ’the renminbi will be maintained at a stable rate.... itwill not be devalued’. Governor of the People’s Bank of China, Mr Dai Xianglong, reiterated this on 16 February 1998.10 Based on the Mainland’s consumer price index, inflation declined from 24.1% in 1994 to 2.8% in 1997 and, based on theretail price index, from 21.7% to 0.8%.11 According to European Union (EU) Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan who led an EU team to visit Beijing in February1998, China had promised to submit to the WTO in March 1998 detailed tariff cuts as part of its bid to re-join the trade body.12 The General Bank Clearance Centre was established by the PBoC in December 1997 to help prevent financial risks andmaintain a stable payment order. The PBoC has also abolished credit quotas for working capital loans for all state-ownedcommercial banks since January 1998. Besides, in a banking conference held at that time, PBoC Governor Dai Xianglonghighlighted four major banking reform directions, namely reorganizing the PBoC’s branch network, streamlining commercialbank operations, converting co-op banks into commercial banks and cleaning up non-performing loans.13 Based on Goldman Sachs and World Bank’s studies, the estimated total worker compensation (i.e. wages plus socialsecurity benefits) per week in the manufacturing sector in 1998 is US$30 for China, US$21 for Indonesia, US$71 forMalaysia, US$47 for the Philippines, US$56 for Thailand, US$244 for Korea and US$329 for Taiwan.BIS Review   19/1998
- 5 -likely to be offset by higher inflation, higher costs of imports and higher interest rates. China has alsoestablished market leadership in a variety of products in world markets. It is difficult to see this dominantposition being significantly eroded, particularly with the existence of international trade barriers which limitthe extent of the possible shift of export orders from China to other Asian economies.16. Fifth, the economic fundamentals of the Mainland of China are strong. Economic growthin 1998, forecasted to be 8% in real terms, is only a shade below the growth rate of 8.8% achieved in 1997.Furthermore, inflation is expected to be below 3%. Last year, the Mainland of China ran a trade surplus ofUS$40 billion, equivalent to 4.5% of GDP. Foreign direct investment amounted to US$45 billion. Its foreignreserves are the second highest in the world. Its foreign debt amounted to only about 14% of GDP andconsisting of mostly long-term loans from official sources such as the World Bank and the AsianDevelopment Bank, and the debt service ratio at well below 10% of exports. The fiscal deficit in 1997 wassmall at below 1% of GDP and the monetization of such deficits is now prohibited. My contacts in Beijinghave told me that even on the basis of very extreme assumptions with the amount of foreign directinvestments and the growth rate of exports being halved in 1998, there will still be a balance of paymentssurplus. In the circumstances there really is no pressure to devalue the RMB.17. The stability or otherwise of the RMB, understandably, would appear to some observersto have implications for the Hong Kong dollar’s link with the US dollar, particularly given the economiccloseness between Hong Kong and the Mainland of China. But this does not necessarily mean that the HongKong dollar will need to move in sync with the RMB, in the highly unlikely event that the RMB is devalued.The Hong Kong dollar is linked to the US dollar and not to the RMB. The economic relationship has alwaysbeen very close between Hong Kong and the Mainland of China. There has always been separate currenciesfor Hong Kong and the Mainland, and “one country, two currencies” is further enshrined in the Basic Lawgoverning Hong Kong for 50 years after the resumption of sovereignty14. The many differences betweenHong Kong and the Mainland of China argue for monetary segregation and not monetary union. In 1994when measures were taken in the Mainland to unify the official and market exchange rates for the RMB,involving a de facto devaluation of the RMB of 33% on an unweighted basis and 7% on a weighted basis.15But this did not affect the Hong Kong dollar at all. So why should a devaluation in the exchange rate of theRMB, which in any case has been ruled out by the Chinese leaders, affect the stability of the Hong Kongdollar’s link to the US dollar now or in the foreseeable future?The Currency Board System18. Technically, the Hong Kong dollar’s link to the US dollar is a very strong form of fixedexchange rate system which is called, in academic terms, a currency board system. It is quite different fromthe pegged exchange rate system that is more widely known and which requires active intervention in theforeign exchange market by the central bank to keep the exchange rate within pre-determined levels. Bycontrast, a currency board system does not require this type of foreign exchange market intervention. Instead,it requires the monetary base, defined in the case of Hong Kong as the amount of Hong Kong dollar banknotes issued and the Hong Kong dollar clearing balance of the banking system held with the Hong KongMonetary Authority (HKMA), to be fully backed by US dollars at a fixed exchange rate16. In other words,                                                  14 Article 111 of the Basic Law provides, among other things, that “the Hong Kong dollar, as the legal tender in the HongKong Special Administrative Region, shall continue to circulate”.15 As a matter of fact, in the fourteen and a half years since the Hong Kong dollar’s link was established in October 1983, theRMB has depreciated by a total 76% against the US dollar.1616 Insofar as the banknotes are concerned, since the inception of the linked exchange rate system in October 1983, the issueand redemption of bank notes, through the note issuing banks, are required to be made against US dollars at the fixedexchange rate of HK$7.80 to US$1. However, at the time when the linked exchange rate system was introduced, there was noinstitutional arrangement whereby banks in Hong Kong maintained clearing accounts with the currency board. This situationwas rectified in 1988 through the so-called Accounting Arrangements which required the Hongkong and Shanghai BankingCorporation Limited, as the Management Bank of the Clearing House of Hong Kong Association of Banks, to maintain aclearing account with the then Monetary Affairs Branch of Government for the account of the Exchange Fund. Thus themonetary base was only clearly defined then. The Accounting Arrangements were subsequently replaced by anotherarrangement, on the occasion of the introduction of Real Time Gross Settlement for interbank transactions in Hong KongBIS Review   19/1998
- 6 -any change in the monetary base has to be matched by a corresponding change in the amount of US dollarreserves held by the HKMA, and the change brought about by the HKMA rather passively converting HongKong dollars in the monetary base into US dollar reserves and vice versa at much the initiative of the banks.19. The advantage of such a requirement is that whenever there is capital outflow, whichwould take the form of the sale by the banks of Hong Kong dollars to the HKMA for US dollars at the fixedexchange rate, there will, on settlement of the deals, be a shrinkage of the clearing balance of the bankingsystem. This will lead to Hong Kong dollar interest rates in the interbank market increasing. The greater theoutflow, the larger will be the fall in the clearing balance of the banking system and the higher will be theinterest rates in the interbank market. And this process is very much an automatic one which does not requirethe exercise of discretion on the part of the HKMA. There is no active foreign exchange market interventionas such, and certainly no money market operations for recycling Hong Kong dollars sold to the HKMA whenthere is capital outflow; or sterilization of Hong Kong dollars passively provided to the market by the HKMAwhen there is capital inflow. Even until now, after we have been operating such a system successfully forover fourteen years, this technical strength of our exchange rate system and the important technicaldistinction from other fixed exchange rate systems are still not very widely appreciated. But I cannot reallyblame the uninformed. Perhaps we have not done enough to keep them informed on these admittedly ratheresoteric monetary issues.20. And the situation is not helped by ourselves also armed with the usual central bankingarmoury of being in a position to exercise discretion to influence monetary conditions in the interbank marketby virtue of the fact that we run the interbank clearing system and therefore also serve as the lender of lastresort in facilitating day to day interbank clearing. There has been some concern that the HKMA might thenbe subject to political influence to exercise discretion and use the central banking armoury to create money inorder to relieve the interest rate pain and in the process undermine the credibility of the currency boardarrangement itself. Whilst this is a legitimate concern, given the experience in other monetary systems, thesituation in Hong Kong is actually quite different. For as long as the monetary policy objective is exchangerate stability within the framework of a currency board system, the additional armoury available to theHKMA, the authority of which was derived from the same legislative foundation for the currency boardsystem, cannot be used in a manner inconsistent with the objective of the currency board itself. In otherwords, it is arguably ultra vires for the HKMA to conduct money market operations or other market activitiescontrary to the objective of the maintenance of exchange rate stability. This is a legal nicety which is againnot well appreciated.21. The events leading to the sharp interest rate increase seen on one day last Octoberillustrate quite clearly how our system works. There was substantial capital outflow earlier that week, causedby people taking a short position in the Hong Kong dollar and sparked off by Taiwan allowing its currency todepreciate in order to maintain its export competitiveness17. The outflow caused the clearing balance of thebanking system to shrink sharply, in accordance with the discipline of the currency board system, as thebanks sold Hong Kong dollars to the HKMA for US dollars. There was in fact not enough Hong Kong dollarin the clearing accounts of the banks to effect settlement with the HKMA. So many banks were bidding formoney that, collectively speaking, did not exist in the interbank market. As a result, the interest rate forovernight money shot up to almost 300%18. Contrary to press reports and comments from analysts, the highinterbank interest rates were the making of the banks themselves and not the result of the HKMA squeezing                                                                                                                                                                   towards the end of 1996, requiring all licensed banks to maintain a clearing account with the HKMA for the account of theExchange Fund. In operating the Accounting Arrangements (1988 - November 1996) and the settlement accounts (sinceDecember 1996), the Monetary Affairs Branch and subsequently the HKMA have ensured that the whole of the monetarybase is subject to the discipline of the currency board arrangement.17 On 17 October 1997, Taiwan’s central bank vice governor Liang Cheng-chin said there was “no need for the central bankto intervene” and it was “the right time” to let market forces determine the Taiwan dollar rate.” As a result, the Taiwan dollarclosed 3.3% lower at T$29.5 per US dollar on that day.18 This was only for about an hour on 23 October 1997. When speculative shorting of the Hong Kong dollar was quicklyreversed, the overnight interbank interest rate came down quickly and closed at 100%-150% on 23 October and further to 7%on 24 October.BIS Review   19/1998
- 7 -the money market. We were just sitting there passively, on settlement day, waiting for the banks to give us theHong Kong dollars that they had sold to us - Hong Kong dollars that they did not have.22. In the circumstances, the banks had only two alternatives. First is for them to borrowHong Kong dollars from the HKMA at the end of the settlement day, through the Liquidity AdjustmentFacility (LAF), Hong Kong’s version of a discount window. This would obviously not be cheap, particularlyfor repeated borrowers, as the HKMA is not in the business of providing cheap Hong Kong dollar funding tothose shorting the Hong Kong dollar. And this would only be for overnight money. Second is for the banks toobtain Hong Kong dollars more permanently from the HKMA by selling US dollars back to the HKMA,which the HKMA again takes passively in accordance with the discipline of the currency board system. Thisis exactly what happened on 23 October 1997 and the speculative capital outflow then was as quicklyreversed as it had started, in a matter of only two days, with the system operating very much on auto-pilot.Interest Rates23. But it had taken a little time for interbank interest rates for term money to come backdown, notwithstanding the fact that the crucial part of the monetary base, as represented by the clearingbalance of the banking system, has in fact returned to a level which is a lot higher than before the speculativeattack and that the HKMA had been accumulating more foreign reserves in the process19. I would attributethis to market sentiment being affected by the continuing financial turmoil in the region. There is now clearlyan Asian premium in the interest rates for Asian currencies and Hong Kong, notwithstanding our currencyhaving remained very stable throughout, is not immune. This Asian premium will remain, for as long asfinancial turmoil in the region lingers on and with uncertainties in the financial system of Japan looming largein the background.24. The higher interbank interest rates for the Hong Kong dollar could also be attributed to arealization on the part of the banks of the need to be a lot more careful in their funding strategies. On the onehand, they might have mistakenly provided cheap funding to finance speculative shorting of the Hong Kongdollar by their customers. In doing so they put themselves in a difficult position when the interbank markettightened to beyond their expectations implicit in the pricing of their lending to the speculators. On the otherhand, the contagious nature of financial turmoil with globalized financial markets is such that the possibilityof further attacks on our currency, unsuccessful as they inevitably would turn out to be, could not bedismissed. The banks have therefore been somewhat reluctant to lend longer term money in the interbankmarket since the October shock, even though they are flushed with liquidity, as reflected by the clearingbalance of the banking system being at a high level. This perhaps reflects a lack of depth in the debt marketwhich we have been separately trying to address. As a result, while the short term interest rates of the HongKong dollar, for example for overnight money, have fallen to quite low levels, significantly belowcorresponding US dollar interest rates, the yield curve has become sharply upward sloping, with one-monthand longer term money commanding a significant premium over corresponding US dollar interest rates.25. But I believe the Hong Kong dollar yield curve will in time flatten further, as it has doneso after the sharp hike on 23 October 1997. There will, nevertheless, be occasional jumps, as sentimentcontinued to be affected by events in other economies in the region and possibly beyond. Interestingly, thehigher interest rates have been attracting some inflow of funds into the Hong Kong dollar, as investors tookadvantage of the higher return and as borrowers chose to finance their activities by raising US dollars andswitching them into Hong Kong dollars, being comfortable about a little currency mismatch given our strongcommitment to the link with the US dollar. As a result, Hong Kong’s foreign reserves have continued to                                                  19 Foreign currency assets as at end of: US$ billionJune 1997     82.9July 1997     81.7August 1997     85.3September 1997     88.1October 1997     91.4November 1997     96.5December 1997     92.8January 1998     98.1BIS Review   19/1998

There is no doubt, however, that the discipline of the currency board system requiringrather harsh adjustments through interest rate changes means that there are innocent parties who may ratherunfortunately be affected. I am conscious of the plight of, for example, the businessmen who happened tohave interbank rate related loans due for interest rate fixing on 23 October 1997, or the home mortgagepayers who have now to live with a mortgage rate, after two increases, which is 150 basis points higher thanbefore, or those who have been investing their life long savings in the stock market, the property market andother asset markets, seeing these markets fall under the influence of higher interest rates. Although someconsolidation has been overdue in these asset markets which had overshot as a result of irrational exuberance,when they do fall sharply our exchange rate link with the US dollar inevitably would be blamed as the culprit,at least when everybody was in the heat of it all.27. Thankfully, it is perhaps in the nature of human beings that even the innocent parties whowere unfairly hurt are capable of appreciating the big picture and rationally assessing what the alternativemight be. Interest rate volatility is the price to pay for a stable exchange rate. Clearly it would not be in theirinterest for Hong Kong to get involved in the process of competitive devaluation of others in the region andsuffer even higher interest rates. And why should we, given that our competitive position, as very much aservice oriented economy, is not really very sensitive to exchange rate changes? The currencies of the Asianeconomies, other than the Mainland of China, have recently been on a free fall. I am sure even theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) is surprised by the extent of the devaluation seen in the Asian currenciesafter they were floated.28. All concerned might have underestimated the effect of a general realization of the needfor hedging when a currency moves from a fixed exchange rate system into a floating exchange rate system.It has now become quite clear that there has been overshooting in the depreciation of some of the Asiancurrencies. It must be doubtful if these very large depreciations are necessary for correcting the imbalances inthese economies. There are economic and financial problems that needed to be put right, but the plunge intheir currencies and asset markets seems excessive. I believe the people of Hong Kong realize this. Theyrealize that the implications for Hong Kong of a break in the linked exchange rate system are clearly a lotworse than the rather short term pain that they have had to bear and which is now hopefully easing. Bycontrast, the pain of economic adjustment that some of the Asian economies have to go through is muchgreater, is now only beginning to be felt and likely to last for some time.29. I believe, however, that the ability of the Hong Kong economy to tolerate the pain ofadjustment could be enhanced, thereby further strengthening the robustness of the currency boardarrangement. First, the risk of interest rate volatility, particularly for the innocent parties, could be alleviatedby the promotion of fixed rate borrowing as a matter of consumers’ choice. Clearly those on fixed ratemortgages would not be affected by hikes in short term interest rates. There is hitherto a lack of long termfixed rate funding for banks and so mortgages are predominantly arranged at floating rates. Here the newlyformed Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation does have an important role to play. The Corporation should nothave any difficulty in raising long term fixed rate funds from the market, particularly with the forthcominginstitutionalization of savings through the establishment of a Mandatory Provident Fund scheme. Second, theHKMA will continue to reinforce successful efforts in the past to ensure that the banks in Hong Kong are in aposition to manage prudently their risks, having regard to the special circumstances of Hong Kong’s currencyboard system, and pay special attention to the quality of their assets so as not to be overly exposed to thosewhich are vulnerable to interest rate volatility. A consultant study on the future development of the bankingsystem of Hong Kong covering this aspect, amongst others, is to be conducted in the near future.Support for the Link30. There is wide support amongst the community of Hong Kong on the exchange rate link.In early December last year an opinion poll carried out by one of our leading newspapers reported that onlyseven percent of the people of Hong Kong think that our link with the US dollar should be broken. Seventy-BIS Review   19/1998
- 9 -one percent think that it should be kept and twenty-two percent express no opinion20. This degree of publicsupport - support from those having Hong Kong dollar assets - is crucial to our success in maintaining theexchange rate link, whereas the sceptical views of those without Hong Kong dollar assets are ratherirrelevant.31. The authorities in the Mainland of China, whilst repeatedly emphasizing that theresponsibility for monetary policy in Hong Kong is for Hong Kong, in accordance with the principle of “onecountry, two systems”, have also expressed unequivocal support for the Hong Kong dollar’s link to the USdollar. There is a standing offer for extending help, if help is required, in the use of the Mainland’s foreignreserves. There is also a clear commitment of not devaluing the RMB, with full and convincing economicjustifications in their own right, but also out of concern on the possible adverse psychological impact on theHong Kong dollar’s fixed link with the US dollar.32. But we obviously should not be complacent. Typically in financial markets there areinevitably those who feel that a doomsdayish forecast will bring them headline attention, without botheringtoo much about the facts. And as always responses from officials supported by hard facts are given only verylittle attention. But we shall continue to stick firmly to our policy, as we did in the past fourteen years, withoutwavering. We did so through an abundance of events, including the stock market crash in 1987, the events inthe Mainland of China in June 1989, the collapse of BCCI in 1991, the ERM crisis in 1992, Mexico in 1994,Barings in 1995 and now financial turmoil in Asia, and every time the Hong Kong dollar remained rock solid.33. We are also acutely aware that the credibility of our exchange rate policy is quitecrucially dependent upon our ability to pursue sound economic policies. This we do with vigour anddetermination, to the satisfaction of many with a keen interest in our affairs, including the IMF who year afteryear gives us a clean bill of health in its annual Article IV Consultations on Hong Kong. They were in HongKong for the 1997 Consultation towards the end of October 1997 and witnessed the after effects of thecurrency attack. And the report was full of praise on how we handled the situation, which is to me quitecomforting, in contrast to the criticisms then from all sides which had been heaved at the HKMA for inflictingtoo much pain in our defence of the currency. Little do these critics know, as I explained to you earlier, thatour system operates on auto-pilot without the need for the HKMA to exercise discretion in intervention ineither the foreign exchange or the interbank markets. This the IMF concurred and in its report saidspecifically that “it is important to recognize that allowing interest rates to rise in response to exchangemarket pressures is an essential element of the currency board mechanism that lies at the heart of HongKong’s monetary arrangements. Recent events demonstrate that the system is working exactly as intended.........“21Review of Currency Defence34. We have also been prudent over the years in strengthening our monetary system througha series of monetary reform measures. These were not crisis induced, but were put together in quiet timesafter careful consideration and consultation. I would not wish to bore you with further technical details, otherthan to say that these reform measures implemented in the past ten years, inconspicuous they might be at thetime of introduction, have each proven to be most useful and effective in ensuring the stability of ourcurrency under rather stressful conditions.35. Notwithstanding this, we have taken advantage of the occasion arising from the currencyattack last October to conduct yet another review of our currency defence to see if there is still room forimprovement. We have met with many of those who have a keen interest in this area, including theacademics, the analysts and the bankers. And I have personally been in correspondence with the IMF and acouple of Nobel Laureates. The review was completed in January this year. I am pleased to say, first of all,                                                  20 The poll was conducted by Asian Commercial Research Limited and its results were published in Sunday Morning Post on7 December 1997.21 Concluding Statement of the IMF Article IV Consultation Discussions with the People’s Republic of China in respect ofthe Hong Kong Special Administrative Region dated 4 November 1997.BIS Review   19/1998
- 10 -that there was unanimous support on the Hong Kong dollar’s link with the US dollar. No one thought that itshould be abandoned. And we have received a few suggestions on how we should improve upon theoperation of our system. We welcome these discussions which have sharpened our own thinking in theprocess of debate and analysis. Whilst one or two of these idea may have some psychological but possiblyonly short term value, they also carry considerable downside risks of undermining confidence in a well triedsystem. I am also pleased to say, therefore, that we have indeed been quite thorough in our monetary reformin the past ten years.(a) Role of interest rates36. One school of thought promoted by a group of academics in Hong Kong with specificproposals for various schemes, which I must confess I have found difficult to appreciate, seems to be basedon the notion that one could maintain stability in both the exchange rate and the interest rates at the sametime. No matter how these schemes are dressed up, involving insurance products, guarantees, options or otherfancy derivatives of one type or another, I fear that they have very little likelihood of success. Keepinginterest rates artificially down when there is capital outflow amounts to providing cheap funding to those whoare shorting the currency. It requires massive intervention in the forward market or a contingent commitmentof foreign reserves that even those with very large foreign reserves would find the situation difficult to hold.It also sends a clear message that one is not prepared to bear the interest rate pain. It is a demonstration ofweakness and the lack of resolve in the defence of the currency. This was the case in 1992 when sterlingdeparted from the ERM. This was also the case I believe in the troubled Asian economies when theyintervened both in the forward market as well as the spot market.37. The academics have, in this connection, further argued that the contingent liability arisingfrom these derivatives can be contained by limiting the amount involved and possibly also by suitable pricingmechanisms for such derivatives. But the fact of the matter is that the limited supply of such derivativeswould benefit only those with access to the product and that there will be irresistible political demands forsupplying it to all - speculators, those with a genuine need to hedge and the man on the street. Where wouldthis end? More likely in misery than greater confidence in the currency link. The pricing of the derivativeproduct is also a tricky issue. If one allows the free market to price the product, by auction or by tender,chances are that the price would reflect the market interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollarand the US dollar, which would defeat the original purpose of the product of trying to dampen the interest ratepain. If alternatively the pricing of the product is administratively determined, thus involving a subsidy, thenthe difficulty is again to target equitably a group of beneficiaries entitled to the comfort afforded by thatproduct.38. We have, as part of our review, invited the IMF also to look at these schemes suggestedby the academics. The response from the IMF confirmed our reservations. The best guarantee that the linkwill not be changed is for us to stick to our guns and not to invent fanciful derivatives which may have thepolitical and psychological attraction of ourselves “putting money where the mouth is”, while really what itmeans is that the credibility of a simple, rule-based and well tried system could well be undermined to thedetriment of Hong Kong.(b) Liquidity Adjustment Facility39. Another area of controversy arising also from discussions with the academics concernswhether the HKMA should lend to banks at the end of the day through the LAF. They identified this practiceas the HKMA playing the role as lender of last resort whereas it is merely a lender of convenience so thatbanks can settle interbank payments outstanding at the end of the day. The HKMA runs a real time interbankpayment system in which each of the 180 licensed banks in Hong Kong maintains a clearing account with theHKMA to effect the settlement of interbank transactions. It is one of the most robust interbank clearingsystems in the world, and is a very important piece of financial infrastructure contributing greatly to financialstability in Hong Kong. But in running the system, the HKMA cannot avoid lending to the banks at the end ofthe day to effect what are really residual interbank payments. But in providing such liquidity money is createdin the form of a larger overnight balance of the banking system that appears not to be directly matched by anincrease in the holding of foreign reserves by the HKMA.BIS Review   19/1998
- 11 -40. However, the manner in which this “last resort” liquidity is provided does not involveany real conflict with the discipline of the currency board system. Lending through the LAF is organizedlargely through a repo arrangement of paper issued by the HKMA22. Such paper, in the form of ExchangeFund Bills and Notes, are liabilities of the HKMA which are fully backed by foreign currency assets. TheHKMA runs an Exchange Fund debt programme involving the issue of debt instruments of maturity fromthree months to ten years. The proceeds of such issues have largely been switched into foreign currencyassets. In any case, with a real time payment system, overnight lending in the term of repos through the LAF,though essential, is infrequent and the money is to be repaid the first thing in the following morning. Further,the HKMA discourages the repeated use of the overnight facility by charging repeated borrowers, which isclearly defined, very penal interest rates23.41. Were the HKMA to suspend the operation of the LAF, interbank interest rates would beeven more volatile as banks, in the case of capital outflow, scrambled for liquidity which may not be there. Inthe end, transactions could not be settled, creating chaos in the interbank market which would in turn damageconfidence on the banking system as a whole. This is the reality of modern day finance that we all have toaccept and monetary authorities have a responsibility to guard against.(c) The auto-pilot trigger42. Yet another area of controversy concerns the exchange rate level at which the HKMApassively buys or sells US dollars against the Hong Kong dollar balances in the clearing accounts of the banksin accordance with the discipline of the currency board system, thus triggering the auto-pilot adjustmentmechanism. There seems to be three alternatives. First is for the HKMA to do so passively always at the fixedexchange rate of HK$7.80 to US$1. This is the most transparent alternative. But the effect of this is that allHong Kong dollar against US dollar transactions will then be conducted with the HKMA, thus on the onehand killing off the foreign exchange market in Hong Kong and on the other hand generating much greatervolatility in interest rates as the liquidity in the banking system changes along with each and every one ofsuch transactions done with the HKMA.43. Second is a variation of the first alternative by introducing a spread around the fixed rateof 7.80 amounting to, say, half a percent or one percent or whatever, by which the HKMA would passivelybuy or sell US dollars against the clearing balance of the banking system. This alternative is also transparentand allows an exchange rate range within which the foreign exchange market would function freely. But itcreates identifiable targets for currency attacks which is undesirable. Every time the exchange rate trades nearthe upper or lower limits, perhaps even only for seasonal reasons, there may be speculative position takingagainst those limits.44. The third alternative, which is the current practice, is to leave the foreign exchangemarket alone under normal circumstances but for the HKMA to establish its passive presence only whenexchange rate instability is detected, for example, when there is a currency attack as in the case of Octoberlast year. The HKMA would do so at a level of defence, which would of course be close to 7.80, consideredsuitable by the HKMA in the light of prevailing market conditions. There is therefore an element of“constructive ambiguity”. This approach is arguably less transparent but I am not in favour of showing all mycards to speculators. Furthermore, it is very much in accordance with Hong Kong’s free market philosophythat the foreign exchange market be left very much alone. I therefore see no reason why our approach shouldbe changed.                                                  22 The HKMA also accepts certain high quality private sector debt securities as eligible securities for Repo under LAF.However, the interest rate charged by the HKMA on LAF Repo involving those private sector paper is set at 25 basis pointsabove that for the Repo of Exchange Fund Bills and Notes. Private sector debt securities normally accounts for less than 10%of LAF Repo activities.23 To improve market order and remove uncertainty towards the banks’ access to the LAF, the HKMA issued a circular tobanks on 12 November 1997 clarifying the definition of “repeated borrowers” upon which a penal rate may be charged onLAF borrowing. “repeated borrowers” are defined as those licensed banks which have borrowed through LAF on eightoccasions in any period of 25 days or on four consecutive days in which LAF is open.BIS Review   19/1998
- 12 -(d) The exercise of discretion45. It is obvious that, even after so many years of operating the exchange rate link under thecurrency board arrangement, the rationale behind the HKMA’s occasional presence in the foreign exchangeand money markets, whether or not involving the exercise of discretion in the use of its monetary armoury,does not seem to be clearly understood. Certain of its actions in the markets have been subject to all sorts ofinterpretations. Yet there is a practical need for the HKMA to be in the markets performing its other functionswhich do not have any implications on the management of the exchange rate. One example is the investmentmanagement of the fiscal reserves. When fiscal surpluses are transferred from the Government’s accountswith the banking system to the HKMA, a shortage of interbank liquidity would be created if the money is notsomehow recycled into the banking system. This is sometimes misinterpreted as the HKMA conducting openmarket operations of a discretionary nature, akin to a central bank engaging in discretionary monetarymanagement, whilst the intention of the HKMA’s presence in the market in the performance of these otherfunctions is, as a rule, to ensure that the monetary base is not affected. There is a need, therefore, to have thecircumstances in which the clearing balance of the bank system, the crucial part of the monetary base, will beaffected clearly set out for all concerned to see. These are outlined as an annex to this speech.Conclusion46. We shall continue to listen to constructive ideas for strengthening our monetary systemand examine them vigorously as we have diligently done so in the past ten years or so. Prudentmacroeconomic policies, our rule-based monetary system, sound regulatory framework and robust financialinfrastructure are the best guarantee for the stability of the currency, more precisely the durability of theHong Kong dollar’s fixed link to the US dollar. We shall continue to be, in the words of Michel Camdessus ofthe IMF, a pillar of stability for the Asian region.*       *       *ANNEXThe Clearing Balance of the Banking System1. This note sets out the circumstances in which the clearing balance of the banking system,the crucial part of the Hong Kong dollar monetary base, will be affected. The clearing balance of the bankingsystem is the sum of the Hong Kong dollar balances in the clearing accounts that all licensed banks maintainwith the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) for the purpose of effecting the Hong Kong dollarsettlement of transactions between the banks themselves and transactions between the banks and the HKMA.Inflow and Outflow of Funds2. In line with the discipline of the currency board system, the clearing balance of thebanking system will be affected by the flow of funds into or out of the Hong Kong dollar.3. Specifically, when there is an inflow of funds involving the HKMA passively buying USdollars sold to it by the banks and providing the Hong Kong dollars, the clearing balance of the bankingsystem will rise. This is the result of the HKMA, in the settlement of the deals, crediting the clearing accountsof the banks selling the US dollars to it with the Hong Kong dollars required for settlement.4. Conversely, when there is an outflow of funds involving the HKMA passively selling USdollars and buying Hong Kong dollars from the banks, the clearing balance of the banking system will fall.This is the result of the HKMA, in the settlement of the deals, debiting the clearing accounts of the banks theHong Kong dollars required for settlement.5. The HKMA adheres strictly to this discipline which in effect involves the clearing balanceof the banking system varying with the amount of US dollars sold to or bought from the HKMA at theinitiative of the banks.BIS Review   19/1998
- 13 -Exceptional Circumstances6. There are, nevertheless, exceptional circumstances in which the HKMA may vary theclearing balance of the banking system directly without the corresponding change in its US dollar holdings.These operations, as set out below, are carried out for the benefit of promoting general market stability,having regard to the level of sophistication of present day financial arrangements:(a)when Initial Public Offerings of shares and other large scale Hong Kong dollartransactions risk creating extreme conditions in the interbank market and affectingthe stability of the exchange rate, the HKMA may lend to or borrow Hong Kongdollars from the interbank market temporarily to dampen such extreme conditions;and(b)the HKMA may enter into intraday repurchase arrangements (Repos) of ExchangeFund Bills and Notes and other eligible paper and overnight Repos through theLiquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) to facilitate the smooth settlement of interbanktransactions. It does not, however, encourage “repeated borrowings” from LAF, aterm which has been clearly defined in the HKMA circular dated 12 November1997.Other HKMA activities7. In all other activities conducted by the HKMA which may have the effect of varying theclearing balance of the banking system, the HKMA ensures that such effect is neutralized as the case may be,by recycling or sterilizing Hong Kong dollar liquidity. For example:(a)a transfer of fiscal surpluses from the Government held temporarily in commercialbank accounts to the HKMA for the account of the Exchange Fund will be recycledto ensure that there is no effect on the clearing balance of the banking system. Thiswill be done either through the purchase of foreign assets when market conditionspermit or through lending Hong Kong dollars in the interbank market;(b)similarly a drawdown of fiscal reserves by the Government will be sterilized toensure that there is no effect on the clearing balance of the banking system. Thiswill be done either through the sale of foreign assets when market conditions permitor through borrowing Hong Kong dollars in the interbank market; and(c)proceeds from the issue of Exchange Fund Bills and Notes not for redemption ofearlier issues will be recycled either through the purchase of foreign assets whenmarket conditions permit or through lending Hong Kong dollars in the interbankmarket.BIS Review   19/1998
Mr. Meyer gives his views on the US economic outlook and the challenges facingmonetary policy   Remarks by Mr. Laurence H. Meyer, a member of the Board of Governors of theUS Federal Reserve System, before the Economic Strategy Institute, Washington, D.C. on 8/1/98.Three forces are likely to shape the outlook to which monetary policy will have torespond in 1998. The first is the momentum in the cyclical expansion. The second is the set of factorsthat have recently restrained inflation, despite persistent strong growth and a decline in theunemployment rate to the lowest level in a quarter century. And the third is the spillover from theAsian turmoil.The dominant story in 1997 was the near stand-off between the first two forces. Thestrength of the cyclical upswing kept monetary policy alert, but -- given the quiescence of inflation --mostly on hold, during the last year. The continued robustness of the expansion into the fourthquarter, including further tightening of the labor market in October and November, might, in myjudgment, have tilted the balance toward the case for additional monetary restraint, notwithstandingthe continued excellent inflation readings.But, at that very time, the growing dimension of the Asian turmoil began to cast ashadow over the forecast for 1998. It has reinforced prospects for some spontaneous slowing of theeconomy, introduced a downside risk that had not previously been an important consideration inpolicy deliberations, and added an additional restraining force on inflation immediately ahead.The task of the Federal Reserve in the coming year will be importantly shaped by themagnitude of the downdraft from the Asian crisis, how it interacts with the remaining cyclicalstrength in domestic demand, and the degree to which its effects on import and commodity priceshelp keep inflation in check. But before I return to the prospects for 1998 and the challenges formonetary policy, I will offer a retrospective on 1997.Let me emphasize that the views I present this afternoon, both about the outlook andabout monetary policy, are my own views and should not be interpreted as the views of the FOMC.Retrospective on 1997In my days as a forecaster, I found it a useful discipline to begin the year by criticallyreviewing the experience of the previous year, identifying the key themes that shaped the outlook,trying to learn from the forecast errors, and drawing implications for the outlook. I will follow thispractice this morning.The most dramatic feature of the 1997 macro experience was clearly the combinationof faster-than-expected growth and lower-than-expected inflation. This “odd couple” has spawned asearch for explanations. I have led a few expeditions myself and will try to extend my analysis furtherthis afternoon.Growth over 1997 probably exceeded 3½% from the fourth quarter of 1996 throughthe fourth quarter of 1997, while inflation, measured by the CPI, was only about 2% over the sameperiod. This is a remarkable outcome, particularly in relation to the consensus forecast at thebeginning of 1997. In February of 1997, for example, the Blue Chip consensus forecast projected just2% growth in GDP over 1997 and a 3% increase in the CPI. The FOMC consensus forecast and myown were not very different from this expectation.I would characterize the pace of output growth over 1997 as unsustainable, meaningthat it was faster than the expansion of productive capacity and would ultimately be restrained goingBIS Review   3/1998
- 2 -forward either by physical capacity constraints or by higher utilization rates, higher inflation, andpolicy tightening. The unemployment rate declined by about ¾ percentage point this past year,consistent with the observation that growth was above trend. Most estimates would put the actualunemployment rate at the end of the year perhaps ¾ percentage point below the NAIRU. The picturethat emerges is of an economy operating above its point of sustainable capacity and growing beyondits sustainable rate.But we clearly have not faced the usual consequence of over-taxing capacityconstraints -- namely, an acceleration in prices. While wage gains did increase, albeit very modestly,over the year, inflation remained extraordinarily well contained. The core measure of the CPIdecelerated about ½ percentage point and the overall CPI slowed more than 1¼ percentage points.StoriesI always think of defending a forecast or rationalizing an outcome relative to theforecast in terms of telling a story. By that I mean developing a theme or set of themes that tietogether the projected or realized outcome and bring coherence to the data. What, then, is the storythat brings coherence to the surprises of 1997?   Goldilocks. The most talked-about story for 1997 is Goldilocks. This is a referenceto Goldilocks finding a bowl of porridge that was neither too hot nor too cold. The analogy is to aneconomy where growth is neither too fast nor too slow, allowing a comfortable and peacefulexpansion without inflationary overtones.I like the story, but it is not the right one for 1997. In economic terms, Goldilocksshould be a story about a “soft landing”, a situation where growth slows to trend just as the economyreaches full employment and inflation stabilizes at a satisfactory level.But growth over 1997 did not slow to trend, and, as a result, the unemployment ratedeclined to a level where overheating would normally be evident. Yet we did not get the increase ininflation. The story for 1997 ought to be one that conveys a spirit of surprise, a surprise that, at leaston the surface, appears to “break the rules” and that results in a remarkably favorable but unexpectedoutcome.A Traditionalist’s Story: Temporary Bliss. My first inclination, as a model-basedforecaster, would be to identify the sources of forecast error in the traditional macro model that wasthe basis for my forecast. The overall forecast errors for output growth and inflation, in such a model,can be described in terms of some combination of errors made by the model’s equations and incorrectassumptions about variables imposed judgmentally on the forecast. For example, consumption mighthave been stronger than predicted from the realized path of income and wealth, the determinants ofconsumption in the model. Or, the assumed path for oil and food prices might have turned out to beincorrect.I call the story that emerges from this exercise “temporary bliss”. It is a story of acoincidence of favorable surprises, one set yielding stronger-than-expected growth and another setrestraining inflation. It is a happy story. But it does not promise continued bliss. And, indeed, it maylean the forecast for 1998 toward slower growth and higher inflation, if one cannot identify anothersequence of similarly fortunate shocks going forward.My colleague at Washington University, Murray Weidenbaum, has suggested thatforecast errors are often offsetting, reflecting the work of a saint who watches over forecasters. Hername is St. Offset. Her work is often observed when a forecaster gets a forecast for GDP in aparticular quarter almost perfect, but misses by a wide amount on nearly every component of GDP!BIS Review   3/1998
- 3 -St. Offset took a vacation in 1997. Nearly every major component of aggregate demand came instronger than fundamentals (i.e., the model equations) would have justified. While I am basing myjudgment here on the error patterns in the equations of the Federal Reserve’s model, I expect manyother models yielded similar results.Unexpected demand shocks are typically amplified by what is commonly referred toas the muliplier-accelerator process. That is, an unexpected demand shock results in higher outputand income, which, in turn, further boosts consumption and investment, reinforcing the effect of theerrors on income and output. This is also part of the story of faster-than-expected output growth in1997.But unexpected strength in aggregate demand is usually damped by more restrictivefinancial conditions, by some combination of monetary tightening and movements in longer-terminterest rates. While a ¼ percentage point increase in the funds rate was implemented last March,financial conditions, more broadly, became increasingly supportive rather than more restrictive as theyear progressed. Real long-term interest rates, measured using surveys of inflation expectations, weresteady to declining over the year, likely reflecting a smaller-than-anticipated budget deficit and anunwinding of expectations of tighter monetary policy. Nominal rates matter, too, especially forhousing, and longer-term nominal rates fell, due to the lower-than-expected inflation. Equity pricesunexpectedly soared, reinforcing the strength of both consumption and investment. So, instead offinancial conditions dampening the demand shocks, as would normally be the case, more supportivefinancial conditions actually reinforced them. This is another piece in the puzzle.Financial conditions remained supportive partly because the better-than-expectedinflation outcome kept the Fed from raising the federal funds rate, except for the single ¼ percentagepoint move in March. The decline in inflation, in turn, reflected reinforcing effects of a sharp declinein energy prices, a significant slowing in the increase in food prices, and a further decline in coreinflation. Overall CPI inflation was widely expected to slow because of a projected reversal of thesharp rise in oil prices over 1996. About one percentage point of the slowing of overall CPI inflationover 1997 was, in fact, due to the relative movements of food and energy prices over 1996 and 1997.This was a somewhat sharper effect than was anticipated at the beginning of the year and accounts fora small part of the forecast error on inflation. But the greater surprise was the decline in coreinflation.A major source of this error was the unexpected further appreciation of the dollar andthus the renewed decline in import prices. The dollar had been expected by many to stabilize in 1997.Instead, it appreciated sharply, by 11½% based on the multi-lateral trade weighted index of otherG-10 currencies and by even more for broader indexes that include other major trading partners.Continuing sharp declines in computer prices and the failure of medical benefit costs to rebound alsocontributed to the surprisingly favorable inflation outcome.There was upward pressure on wage change from the low and decliningunemployment rate and from the increases in the minimum wage. But this was moderated by theeffect on wage change of lower price inflation.There was also a sharp acceleration in productivity over 1997, which held down unitlabor costs. In my view, most of this acceleration in productivity was cyclical, meaning it was inresponse to the faster pace of output growth. Cyclical increases in productivity mainly, in my view,result in higher profits, rather than lower prices. But, there likely was some small moderatinginfluence on inflation from such a cyclical increase in productivity.Putting the story together, the stronger-than-expected growth is explained byunexpected strength in aggregate demand, reinforced by more supportive financial conditions.

A second story that could also explain the 1997pattern of faster-than-expected growth and lower-than-expected inflation is a structural change or aseries of structural changes that ushered in a new era of faster economic growth, perhaps loweraverage unemployment rates, and lower inflation. I will focus specifically on the possibility of anincrease in trend productivity growth, allowing faster output growth and, at least temporarily, slowerinflation at the same time. But there are other potential candidates for structural change that aresometimes included as part of this story.In this story, part or all of the faster economic growth over 1997 is matched by fastergrowth in productive capacity, so it does not have inflationary consequences. In addition, if theincrease in the productivity trend is unexpected, it will generally result in lower inflation for a while,as wage gains, based on the previous trend of productivity, are more than outpaced by the fasterincrease in productivity, lowering unit labor costs and hence inflation. This allows, in principle, fasterreal growth, lower unemployment rates, and lower inflation. An increase in the productivity trend, byraising the profitability of investment, also is consistent with an investment boom, strong corporateprofits, and soaring equity prices.This has the advantage of being a simple, unified explanation, meeting the Occam’sRazor test. From my perspective, however, I do not see clear evidence of a break in the productivitytrend in the data. As I noted earlier, I view the acceleration in productivity over 1997 as a normalcyclical phenomenon. There was some surprise about how low productivity growth was during 1994through 1996. But now the level of productivity has returned to where it would be expected to be inlight of the cyclical rebound in output.I have kept the traditionalist and new era stories strictly distinct -- either, or. But, thetruth could well be a blend of the two.Lessons and QuestionsWhat are some of the lessons and lingering questions arising from the growth andinflation outcomes last year? First, the strength of consumption over the year reaffirmed, in my view,the importance of the wealth effect.Second, the excellent price performance in 1997, in the context of the surprise of ahigher dollar and the resulting sharper-than-expected decline in import prices, suggests to me that wemight be underestimating the effect of import prices on overall inflation. Many models, in particular,ignore the role of falling import prices in undermining the pricing power of producers ofimport-competing goods. This seemed to have been a clearly important factor in pricing decisions inthe domestic auto industry, for example, over the past year. Based on the experience last year, Iwould revisit this channel.Third, the pattern of wage change and inflation did not definitively reject the estimatesof NAIRU and trend growth that underpinned my forecast; but neither did the outcome entirelyreinforce my confidence in them. The poor forecast of inflation was not principally due, in myjudgment, to errors in the wage and price equations. Nevertheless, I would have made smallerforecast errors if I had used an estimate of NAIRU a bit below my current estimate of 5½% andwould have made a smaller error forecasting inflation if I had used a slightly higher estimate of trendgrowth. The experience in 1997 did not put to rest these questions.BIS Review   3/1998
- 5 -Fourth, I wonder whether the divergent pattern in unemployment and capacityutilization rates contributed to the lower-than-expected inflation last year. I believe this issue deservesmore attention.Traditionally, these two measures of excess demand move together over the cycle. Inthe current episode they have diverged. The capacity utilization rate for manufacturing barely budgedover 1997, remaining slightly below the point at which it has traditionally been accompanied by anincrease in inflation. If the historical relationship between unemployment and capacity utilization hadbeen operative in this expansion, the capacity utilization rate would be more than two percentagepoints higher today.The failure of capacity utilization rates to move into a range that typically isassociated with upward pressure on inflation likely has much to do with the perception of an absenceof pricing power by firms. It also may have encouraged firms to alter the way they operate in labormarkets, encouraging them to avoid increases in wages that they were going to have difficultypassing along in higher prices. The net result is that there may be less inflation pressure than wouldnormally be associated with the current rate of unemployment.Prospects for 1998Economic growth is likely to slow over 1998 and inflation may rise somewhat, butremain modest. However, a slowing in growth appears to be a higher probability than an increase ininflation.The economy ended 1997 with still very positive fundamentals, notwithstanding someapparent weakness in demand in the fourth quarter. Momentum in income growth, a high level ofwealth, a record level of consumer confidence, lower mortgage rates, and ready availability of jobssupport the household sector. Firms are highly profitable and can finance investment on attractiveterms. Inflation is low. There are few imbalances in the U.S. economy that would appear to be threatsto the expansion.It is from this base that growth is expected to slow over 1998 as a result of thecombined effect of some spontaneous slowdown and the spillover from the Asian crisis. Theslowdown should move growth closer to a sustainable rate, rather than threaten recession. A key formonetary policy will be whether growth slows to or below trend or remains above trend. This willdetermine whether utilization rates, especially in the labor market, stabilize, rise further, or begin toreverse. This, in turn, will be an important consideration in the inflation outcome next year and risksof higher inflation thereafter, and will, for me, be an important consideration in the decision aboutmonetary policy.A Slowdown in GrowthAn important rationale for a spontaneous slowing -- that is, one occurring withoutfurther Fed tightening -- is that the pattern of consistent upside surprises across aggregate demandcomponents over 1997 is unlikely to be repeated. In this case, the explanation for the faster-than-expected growth over 1997 provides a rationale for a slowdown over 1998.The further appreciation of the dollar over 1997, even predating the effects of theAsian turmoil, suggests a continued drag from net exports over 1998, another factor suggesting someslowing in the expansion going forward. The mix of output in the fourth quarter may also provide animpetus for a slowdown in production going forward. GDP growth appears likely to have exceeded3% again in the fourth quarter. The production side data -- employment, hours worked, and industrialproduction -- certainly seem to point to solid growth, but the available data on demand componentsBIS Review   3/1998
- 6 -have been on the weak side. This tension could be reconciled by an increase in inventory investment.A combination of slowing final sales and rising inventory investment in the fourth quarter would be anatural prelude to a slowing in the pace of production immediately ahead.The spillover effects from the Asian turmoil should further slow growth over 1998.The degree of slowing in growth and the size of the depreciation in the exchange rates in the regionstill will be affected by policy actions to be taken by those authorities and the uncertain timing of anyimprovement in investor confidence. As a result, developments in Asia clearly add a considerabledegree of uncertainty to the outlook, though around a forecast of slower growth and lower inflationthan would otherwise have been the case.At this point, I expect, the direct effect of the shock from Asian developments on U.S.net exports would slow the growth in our GDP by roughly ½ percentage point. The further multipliereffects, in this case, would yield an overall slowing in U.S. GDP in the range of ½ to ¾ percentagepoint. This estimate, as noted above, is subject to a considerable margin of error, given the evolvingnature of developments in the region. But it does suggest that the spillover from Asia will importantlyshape the U.S. outlook for 1998. A slowdown of such a magnitude could be expected to substitute forsome or all of the monetary tightening that otherwise might have been justified.Cross-currents on InflationLooking ahead, powerful crosscurrents should still be operating on inflation. First, Iexpect upward pressure on wages from the prevailing tightness in the labor market. Second, thedecline in inflation over the last year should be an important moderating force on wage change goingforward, partially offsetting the first factor. Third, the set of forces that have restrained inflation overthe last year, the factors I have referred to as favorable supply shocks, will continue to restraininflation.The unemployment rate is well below most estimates of NAIRU. The resultingupward pressure on wage change and price inflation can be offset or even overwhelmed at times, as itwas last year, by other influences. Nevertheless, the role of this consideration in inflation dynamicsshould not be overlooked or underestimated. It starts me with a bias toward higher inflation. Thequestion is then whether there will be enough offsetting influences in 1998 to prevent inflation fromrising.One such offset is the virtuous cycle set in motion by the lower inflation in 1997. Thelower inflation last year should moderate the cyclical pressure for higher nominal wages over 1998.That is, the real wage increases produced by the lower inflation substitute for nominal wage gainsthat would otherwise have been required to achieve the higher path of real wages.The pattern in food, energy, computer, and import prices and in benefit costs willagain be important factors shaping the inflation outlook this year. The movements in these prices arenot closely tied to the balance of supply and demand in overall labor and product markets and areoften subject to wide swings and rapid reversals. Forecasts of these prices are, as a result, often wideof the mark. It appears that energy, import, and, of course, computer prices will decline again over1998 and food prices increases will again be modest. While there is likely to be at least a modestrebound in benefit costs, we should add to the list of factors restraining measured inflation the one totwo-tenths decline in CPI inflation associated with technical revisions to be introduced by the BLSthis month.The restraint likely from favorable supply shocks this year has recently beenreinforced by a further decline in crude petroleum prices and the projected effect of the Asian crisison import prices. On balance, it now appears that these forces will continue to restrain inflation overBIS Review   3/1998
- 7 -1998 perhaps by about as much as was the case over 1997. In this case, favorable supply shockswould be neutral factor on inflation this year, neither contributing to higher or lower inflation.On balance, I expect a small increase in inflation in 1998. The upward pressure oninflation will also depend on what happens to utilization rates over the year, which in turn willdepend on precisely how much growth slows. One final influence is the sharp cyclical slowing inproductivity I expect. This will raise unit labor costs and mainly undermine profit growth. But itcould put some upward pressure on prices as well.Two Scenarios and the Challenges Facing Monetary PolicyThere are many possible outcomes, particularly given the uncertainty about the degreeof spontaneous slowing and the dimensions of the spillover from the Asian crisis. Because upside anddownside risks for growth and inflation appear to be more balanced than had been the case earlier, Ibelieve monetary policy also needs to be in a more balanced position.The course of monetary policy will, of course, depend on how much growth slows,what happens to utilization rates, and how the movement in utilization rates interacts with the othercross-currents affecting inflation. A much larger spillover from the Asian crisis could encourage aneasing. Continued above-trend growth and a further rise utilization rates, on the other hand, couldencourage further tightening. But I want to focus on two intermediate outcomes, both because I viewthese as more likely and because they would raise more interesting questions for monetary policy.The first scenario I call a graceful “reverse soft landing”. This is my interpretation ofthe private sector consensus forecast. As I noted earlier, in a soft landing, growth slows from anabove-trend to trend rate just as output converges from below to its full employment level. But Ibelieve output is already beyond the full employment level. A soft landing in this case requiresgrowth to run below trend for a period to allow productive capacity to catch up to demand and toallow utilization rates to ease to sustainable levels. Ordinarily, inflation would be rising during thetransition, given initial conditions of output in excess of sustainable capacity. But, in the currentepisode, the virtuous cycle in play and renewal of forces that have recently been restraining inflationwill continue to damp inflation over 1998, at least moderating the rise in inflation that wouldotherwise occur.In this scenario, real growth slows to around 2% or slightly lower, the unemploymentrate edges upward, but remains below NAIRU over 1998, and inflation is slightly higher. This is apath back toward full employment, leaving inflation higher but still modest once full employment isreached, perhaps by the end of 1999. How should monetary policy respond in this scenario? Shouldpolicy ease in response to the sharp slowing in growth and rise in the unemployment rate? Or shouldpolicy remain on hold, allowing the economy to converge slowly back to full employment and a stillmodest inflation rate?Given the momentum in domestic demand, the still favorable financial conditions andother fundamentals, questions about the degree of spontaneous slowing, and uncertainty about themagnitude of the spillover from the Asian crisis, an equally plausible forecast is that growth slows,but only to trend. In this case, the unemployment rate would remain near its current level andinflation would increase slightly more than in the first scenario, though it would still be damped in1998 by the virtuous cycle forces and the continued favorable supply shocks. This scenario would,however, imply greater inflation risks going forward, in light of prospects that the favorable supplyshocks eventually will abate, while the prevailing high labor utilization rate will continue to pushwage gains higher.BIS Review   3/1998
- 8 -How should monetary policy respond in this case? Should policy remain on hold,given the return to a sustainable rate of growth and stable utilization rates? Or, should there be atightening of policy in light of the prospects for a gradual but persistent updrift in inflation associatedwith the still very high utilization rates?The latter scenario is valuable in highlighting that the risks of higher inflation arerelated to the level of utilization rates, not to the rate of growth of output itself. The point is that evenif growth slows to trend, utilization rates could be left at unsustainable levels, leaving a risk of risinginflation over time.Unfortunately, I have run out of time before I had the opportunity to answer thesequestions. I will leave it to you to provide your own answers. In time, the FOMC, of course, willprovide its own answer, provided these were the right questions.BIS Review   3/1998
1BIS Review 133/1999Mr Hofmann gives a lecture on“Ratings and the emerging new equity standards:a symposium on the BIS proposals”Lecture delivered by Mr Gerhard Hofmann, Head of Banking Supervision Department on behalf ofMr. Edgar Meister, member of the Directorate of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the symposiumarranged by the Center for Financial Studies and New York University, held in Frankfurt am Main on2 December 1999.*      *      *ILadies and Gentlemen,The new Basel capital regulations in general, and the proposed prudential use of ratings in particular,are major milestones in the history of banking supervision. I am especially pleased to see that, besidesthe many banking supervisors and bankers who are taking an interest in the Basel discussion paper,academic economists are likewise joining in the debate on the new supervisory rules morevociferously than they did in the past. Hence today’s gathering also helps to foster the dialoguebetween academics and practitioners.IIA need to take action has arisen in the area of the Basle Capital Accord of 1988, since, on the onehand, the nature, scale and complexity of the transactions differ considerably from the conditionsprevailing in the late eighties while, on the other hand, the available risk-management techniques haveimproved substantially in recent years. The old fixing of prudential capital by rather rough-and-readymethods has led in some cases to misallocations, and the incentive for big banks, in particular, toconserve capital (by means, say, of asset-backed securities transactions) has assumed greatersignificance. Credit derivatives and netting arrangements are likewise growing in importance.Novel methods of measuring credit risk enable differences in credit-worthiness between individualborrowers to be quantified more accurately. As a result, the existing subjection of all enterprises to auniform risk weighting of 100% is too generalised. The old risk weighting scheme is to be replaced byup-to-date methods, especially ratings, which permit a more sophisticated and more precisemeasurement of risk.By these methods, the capital to be held for supervisory purposes will approximate more closely towhat is known as the “economic capital”, which every bank assesses for itself internally to cover creditrisk.At the same time, however, other risks – such as interest-rate risk on a bank’s loan book andoperational risk – have become a focus of interest. The objective of safeguarding the stability of thefinancial system can be duly taken into account only if such risks, which have hitherto been coveredonly indirectly, become subject to capital charges. Whether, and to what extent, a capital savingultimately results for the banking industry as a whole cannot be said for certain in advance; the answerwill differ anyway from one bank to another.
BIS Review 133/19992IIILadies and gentlemen, in future capital alone will be able to ensure the stability of an individual bankand of the financial sector as a whole to a lesser extent than it could in the past. That is why the BasleAccord rests on three well-known pillars which stand side by side with equal status:• The first pillar relates to the minimum capital requirements needed for covering credit risk,market risk and other risks.• The second pillar, known as the “supervisory review process”, comprises an enhancedqualitative examination of the individual risk profile of a bank.• As the third pillar, supervision is to be supplemented by greater market transparency.All three pillars serve in a sense (to remain in the same picture) to carry the roof, meaning tocontribute to the stability of the global financial system, also in the future. Credit institutions andbanking supervisors alike consider that there is a special need to preserve the “level playing field” andprevent distortions of competition.IVCompetitive considerations, especially as between the United States, with its capital-market-orientedfinancial system, and Europe, with its banking-oriented financial system, play a major role, especiallyin the recognition of external ratings.Thus, for enterprises that take advantage of the capital market, an external rating is normally anessential condition for informing bond buyers about a firm’s credit standing. Under the credit-orienteduniversal banking system, by contrast, the bank, as an intermediary, must arrive at a credit appraisal ofits own. The differences between banking systems are naturally also reflected in the number ofexternal ratings of enterprises: some 8,000 external corporate ratings in the USA compare with onlyabout 600 such ratings in Europe.Even if, happily, three new private rating agencies have recently been established in Germany, it willbe some years before they have compiled a significant number of corporate ratings. To preventdistortions of competition, it is therefore imperative that, as an alternative to recourse to externalratings, internal bank rating systems be used, which are inherently of equal value and come into forcesimultaneously.In connection with the proposals on the external rating of countries, the question of the treatment ofpublic authorities below the level of the central government also arises. In the German view, the statusquo should be retained, that is to say, there should be no change to the present right to choose asupervisory authority for the risk weighting of Land and local governments. The zero-weighting ofloans to Land and local governments would then still be possible. To my mind, it would not be fittingfor every minor municipality to have a rating of its own, if only to have an appropriate risk appraisal inthe future.VQuite apart from the competition argument, in the light of the above-described “rating gap” betweenthe United States and Europe, there are a number of substantive criticisms that can be levelled at theprudential use of external ratings.For instance, external ratings may prompt a bank to exercise less care in granting credit. That would becontrary to the avowed aim of supervisors of setting the supervisory framework in such a way that thebanks themselves have every interest in improving their own risk-management techniques. In addition,it might be objected that rating agencies are being given too much power in the context of regulatingbanks, because they determine by their rating how high the capital requirements for banks should be.
3BIS Review 133/1999Moreover, it is feared that strong competition among the agencies might lead to a watering-down ofthe results, or that enterprises requiring a rating might engage in a kind of “rating shopping”. Finally,the Asian crisis is cited, in which, it is claimed, external ratings contributed to the herd instinctexhibited by the banks.I share the view which is occasionally expressed that the banks’ function of assessing risk by means ofan examination of creditworthiness is in essence not “outsourceable”, but that a risk examination oftheir own, and thus made on their own responsibility, prior to the granting of credit, is fundamentallyindispensable.As a result of the amendments being prepared in Basel and Brussels, I expect that internal ratingsystems for the computation of capital will in future play the crucial role in the banking systems ofEurope. Besides that, however, external ratings in the field of capital-market transactions, e.g. in thecase of asset-backed securities constructs or corporate financing through debt securities and the like,will likewise increase in significance.VIThe authorisation of internal bank ratings – like that of external ratings – will be linked to qualitativeand quantitative minimum standards. A working party of the Basle Committee is currently engaged inelaborating the framework of an “internal ratings-based approach” to the capital charges. The keystoneof any capital computation is the probability of default exhibited by individual rating categories towhich borrowers are assigned. The expected cost of default sustained by a bank results from thatprobability of default and the expected losses in the event of the insolvency of a borrower. Bothvariables (default probability and expected loss ratios) are to be related to the size of the creditgranted, and should be included in the calculation of the interest charged on loans.When the conditions for the internal rating system are fixed, the German representatives on the BaselCommittee will see to it that the structures of our banking system are duly taken into account. Inparticular, the conditions in Basel and Brussels must not be set so restrictively that small and medium-sized institutions have no chance from the outset of clearing the hurdle erected in this area by thesupervisory rules.If internal ratings are recognised for a broad range of credit institutions, no drawbacks will arise withrespect to an adequate and low-cost provision of credit for the business community. That goes aboveall for small and medium-sized businesses.The proposal for an internal rating system recently put forward by the Federal Association of GermanBanks points in the right direction, namely at making internal bank rating systems comparable bymeans of default probabilities that arise on account of the division of borrowers into creditworthinessand risk categories. In addition, that proposal provides for the inclusion of expected loss ratios in theevent of the borrower’s insolvency.In this proposal, I see some significant common ground with the debate which is now going on in theinternational arena. In the international supervisory bodies, the German representatives will argue thatinternal rating systems should initially be applicable only to specific segments of the credit portfolio,so as to make it easier for the banks to introduce this new procedure. Moreover, we will try to ensurethat the model is neutral in its effect on competition at both the international and, if possible, thenational level.The question of a good rating system and its credibility is being asked not only by practitioners, butalso increasingly by academics. How far the fourteen principles for rating systems drawn up byProf. Krahnen and Prof. Weber will be generally accepted is hard to tell at the moment. Personally, Ihave a favourable opinion of that initiative, but the principles must still be discussed in more detail.What is plain, for example, is that external ratings awarded by rating agencies pursue differentobjectives – namely, a more long-term orientation towards the entire credit cycle – from internal bankratings. The topic of “completeness” is naturally also of great significance in the case of internal bank
BIS Review 133/19994systems. I assume that “partial use” will also be possible here. To that extent, the rating would then beincomplete.Ladies and gentlemen, the debate on a rapprochement of the prudential to the economic capital ofbanks by the deployment of management instruments of their own naturally involves uncertainties andrisks. The “self-assessment” by the banks planned for a substantial part of the risks in the computationof the capital to be maintained in respect of the risks incurred therefore calls for a supervisory audit ofthe internal bank methods used. It is at this point that the two other pillars of the new Accord comeinto play. In particular, banking supervisors will be obliged – as stipulated by the second pillar of thediscussion paper (the supervisory review process) – to gain a clear idea at first hand of the instrumentsused in banks’ risk controlling and risk management. That applies all the more since the market canhardly function as an external monitoring body for internal bank ratings.VIILadies and Gentlemen,It is not only at the international level that a “level playing field” must be ensured. That is scarcely lessimportant at the national level as well. As you know, the Basle Accord is primarily applicable tointernationally operating banks. On the basis of the Basel proposals, the same subjects are beingaddressed in Brussels, too, so that ultimately the entire banking sector will be affected by theregulations. After the implementation of a corresponding EU Directive, those provisions will bebinding on all credit institutions within the EU.We advocate, firstly, that the final regulations should coincide in Brussels and in Basel, and shouldcome into effect at the same time. By that means, a duplication of efforts should be avoided by thosecredit institutions which will have to apply both sets of regulations. Secondly, it is our aim that, inprinciple, all institutions – regardless of their size – will be able to apply the new regulations. Hence,we welcome the efforts being made by the banking associations to assist their member institutions inimplementing internal rating systems. It would be conceivable, for instance, for certain demands of therating process (e.g. the collection and processing of data) to be satisfied centrally by the associations.That naturally gives rise to questions of definition and implementation. Which element of internalrating can be shifted to outside bodies, such as associations? Each institution’s inherent responsibilityfor its internal rating system must on no account be called into question, and internal ratings must befully integrated in the in-house decision-making process.VIIIAllow me to elaborate briefly on a further important feature of the first pillar of the new CapitalAccord. This is the area of “risk mitigation”, i.e. the use of risk-minimising methods, such as nettingarrangements, credit derivatives and the extended authorisation of collateral and guarantees.What is the connection between risk-minimising methods and ratings?On the one hand, there is the option of including a risk-minimising method in the internal rating itselfby rating the probability of loss (e.g. owing to collateral) correspondingly lower. On the other hand,risk-minimising measures might make themselves felt ahead of the rating process proper, by reducingthe credit-risk position, as a yardstick for the rating, by the risk-minimising measures. Both optionsare still under discussion. The second variant is likely to be easier, above all for small and medium-sized institutions, i.e. the computation of a “net exposure” ahead of the rating.IXLadies and gentlemen, external and internal ratings should not be viewed in isolation, but in theoverall context of the planned new Basle Capital Accord or comparable Brussels regulations. That isto say, especially in the context of other risks to be subjected to capital charges (interest-rate risks and
5BIS Review 133/1999operational risks), and in the context of the other two pillars. For this is not a matter of individualelements at a technically higher level, but rather a matter of making the financial markets stabler.XLet me therefore also say a few words on what is known as the “Supervisory Review Process”. Thereview process is nothing completely new, either in international terms or in Germany. The FederalBanking Supervisory Office can already specify “negative special conditions” and order a capital ratiohigher than 8%. Unlike conditions in the United States and United Kingdom, which have long knownmore comprehensive audit operations for a bank as a whole, in Germany only specific parts of a bankhave hitherto been audited by banking supervisors. As examples, I may mention the audits ofcommercial transactions and of market-risk models. The experience gained in the process may serve asa basis for further deliberations.The frequency, scale and intensity of audits depend on the size and risk content of the bank. In myopinion, global players therefore require more intensive supervision, since they are more significant interms of systemic risk.Two developments are prefigured by the supervisory review process. In the first place, bankingsupervision will become more individual, since the respective risk profile of the bank will bemonitored by the supervisors. That will be as specified with some individual supervisory measures.Secondly, the road is being traversed from a banking supervision primarily based on compliance withquantitative standards to a qualitative form of banking supervision. As is already the case, thesupervisory review process may lead not only to the imposition of conditions in specific cases but alsoto explicitly higher capital ratios, exceeding the present 8% limit. This option must be available as akind of last resort.XIFinally, the Basel edifice is completed by a third pillar, which calls for more extensive disclosurerequirements on the part of credit institutions − requirements which are intended to make it easier forthe markets to assess risks. Enhanced market transparency is supposed to contribute to greater marketdiscipline. Here, too, there are again direct connections with the other pillars of the Accord.As far as the issuing of disclosure standards is concerned, however, banking supervisors have noautonomous powers of their own; hence only the legislature can take the appropriate action here. Butthe supervisors could elaborate a catalogue of requirements which might constitute the basis forlegislative measures.XIILadies and Gentlemen, I have attempted to sketch in for you the outlines of a new, uniform globalsupervisory standard. Let me briefly sum up the principal points once again.1. More sophisticated risk appraisal and measurement, by the use of external and internal bankrating systems and risk-mitigation techniques.2. External and internal rating systems should be systems of equal value which, in principle,should be accessible to all institutions and, in my opinion, should be introducedsimultaneously.3. Explicit capital charges for risks that have hitherto been included implicitly in credit risk, forinstance, interest-rate risk and other risks.4. Progress towards a qualitative form of banking supervision based on the individual riskprofile of banks.
BIS Review 133/199965. Enhanced market transparency, and thus a buttressing of banking supervision by marketdiscipline.All these measures should enable supervisors and the market alike to recognise future risks at an earlystage, so as to be able to respond in timely fashion and proactively in the interests of preserving thestability of the financial system.The complex evolution of banking business and the concomitant increase in risk can no longer becoped with by the traditional instruments. The globalisation of the financial markets calls for adeparture from purely national rules and regulations, and the adoption of greater flexibility and greaterproximity to the bank on the part of supervisors, so as to foster financial market stability. Europecannot disregard these trends if it wants to hold its own in the international competition for marketshares. Furthermore, European banks will have to adjust to the introduction of internal rating systemsif they do not wish to get out of touch with the United States in the field of up-to-date techniques ofcredit-risk management.Market players and others are called upon to lend a hand in shaping the definitive regulations duringthe consultation phase that is now in progress and subsequently during the second such period fromautumn 2000 onwards. Academic economists, in particular, can likewise help to answer the stillunresolved issues posed by the Basle Accord. We should face up to this major challenge, which is notleast an intellectual competition for the best proposals, by making a joint effort.
Mr. Heikensten looks at the intellectual framework for monetary policy inSweden   Address by the Deputy Governor of the Bank of Sweden, Mr. Lars Heikensten, at theMonetary Policy Forum held in Stockholm on 26/5/97.Economic policy developments during the early 1990s were marked by theafter-effects of the overheating in the 1980s. At the beginning of 1993--after the krona hadfallen--the Riksbank made clear its intention to meet an inflation target. An important task sincethen has been the firm establishment of a policy of low inflation in Swedish society and theclarification of the principles that guide monetary policy.We think that we have now come a long way in the effort to secure low inflation.At the same time, support for the policy of low inflation has increased.  The Government and theRiksdag have positioned themselves behind the policy and recently proposals have been putforward to, among other things, make price stability an objective of the Riksbank prescribed bylaw. Against this background it may now be appropriate to try to clarify the intellectualframework within which the Riksbank is working. To contribute to such a more fundamentaldiscussion on the principles of monetary policy formulation, I will today consider four relatedissues:First I intend to comment on how I view the connection between price stabilityand growth for different time perspectives. One issue that I will dwell on somewhat is how thebalance between the two appears in the short term.Next, I shall discuss how uncertainty and the degree of credibility with whichmonetary policy is associated influence policy formulation. These two factors play an importantrole in practice.The third issue concerns the exchange rate. For small open economies this issue isone of the most important determinants of inflation at the same time as it is also an importantmeasure of how stable economic policy is seen to be. How changes in the exchange rate ought tobe handled when monetary policy decisions are taken has been an important monetary policyissue in Sweden in recent years.Finally I shall discuss the issue of how the monetary policy goal has been definedand should be interpreted.The Inflation/Growth ConnectionThe Riksbank’s chief task is the achievement and preservation of price stability,which should be interpreted as keeping the rate of inflation at a low and stable level. Behind thisview of the role of monetary policy lies the understanding that growth and employment cannotin the long run be achieved via an inflationary policy. There are other factors that determinegrowth: technological development, the way in which the economy functions, human resourcesdevelopment, etc.Attempts to stimulate the economy in the short run by allowing higher inflationtend to rebound in the long run.  Swedish experience in the last decade, and also experiences inother countries, demonstrate this.  Participants in the economy see through the policy, revisewage demands upwards and raise prices. When inflation expectations are taken into account, theoutcome of an inflationary policy is normally worse rather than better economic development .BIS Review   56/1997
- 2 -The best contribution that monetary policy can make to good growth in the longterm is to see to it that an environment with stable prices is created and maintained. Within thesebounds a central bank can support economic development in general. In the short term thepossibility may exist to influence the economy’s activity level with monetary policy instruments.For that to be possible, monetary policy objectives would need to be completely credible.A central bank should have as its primary objective price stability. Given the timelags that exist in monetary policy, it takes from one to two years before the effects of an interestrate change make themselves fully felt on inflation. Therefore policy must be be guided by theforecasted inflation, not by the inflation existing in the present situation. If an inflation forecastfor the coming two years shows that there is a risk that the inflation target may be missed, theinstrumental rate should be changed so that inflation is driven back in line with the target.If inflation is expected to be lower than the target, there is room in practice formonetary policy to take the activity level into consideration.  The Riksbank can then lower theinterest rate and in such a manner stimulate production and employment temporarily. In thesame manner, interest rates will normally need to be raised in situations in which future inflationtends to get excessive as a consequence of a too high resource utilization.Consequently, when an inflation forecast shows that future inflation does notappear to be in line with the target, policy must be altered. In these situations there is a balancingproblem. The question is how forceful the interest rate change should be. If it is dramatic, theadjustment in the rate of inflation to the established target may be faster, but the repercussions inthe short term in the form of fluctuations in production and employment will probably be biggeralso.Figure 1Price Stabilization: Alternative Paths2%t+4t+8tptThe reasoning can be made clear with a simple diagram (Figure 1). By choosinginterest rate path 2 rather than path 1, the adjustment to the inflation target will be somewhatslower; however, the development in the economy will also be less spasmodic.BIS Review   56/1997
- 3 -The fact that the Riksbank--when the price stability objective was introduced in1993--chose to postpone its application for about 2 years (the decision that evaluation wouldonly be made when the direct effects of the krona’s weakening had died away in 1995) can besaid to have been a way of taking into consideration the above reasoning. In recent years,however, this sort of consideration has not played such a prominent role. There are severalinterrelated explanations for this. Monetary policy thus far has been aimed to a great extent atestablishing a regime of low inflation and engendering understanding for it. In practice, thescope is also limited for monetary policy decisions of a fine-tuning character by the uncertaintythat prevails, inter alia, about future developments and by the degree of credibility for the lowinflation policy.2. Uncertainty and CredibilityThere are various kinds of uncertainty that in practice play an important part inmonetary policy and are also important for the speed and scale with which changes in interestrates are made:-  One type of uncertainty has to do with the economy’s basic mechanisms..Which model of the economy shall we use for our analysis? A major problem here in recentyears has been that the shift to low inflation and a flexible exchange rate by itself can change therelationships in the model.-  A second type of uncertainty concerns the interpretation of new informationthat is constantly coming in. It is important in this connection to assess what effects aninterference or a shock have, which, inter alia, is linked with whether it is permanent ortemporary.-  Finally there is uncertainty about the effect of the measures that the Riksbankcan take--in practice, changes in the instrumental interest rates. The question is how theso-called transmission mechanism looks and in what time frame interest rate changes affectinflation.If a central bank overestimates the deviation from the inflation target orunderestimates the effect of a change in its interest rate policy, there is a risk that it will raise orlower interest rates too much. In such a situation, the policy in the end will become excessivelyrestrictive or expansive and it may become necessary for the central bank to shift its policy inthe opposite direction. Such a change may create instability and reinforce cyclical swings.Therefore it would appear that there is reason to proceed with some caution when the policy ischanged. Central banks also tend to adjust interest rates in relatively small steps.Nevertheless, the conclusion that a central bank should proceed carefully is notself-evident. The question is how the markets players interpret a certain behaviour.  Ever sosmall changes in the instrumental interest rates, which may be interpreted as the first step inpolicy change, can have a big impact. (cf. the Federal Reserve’s increase in February 1994).There is probably no obvious and simple rule for action. Most likely, the central bank’s task is toaccount for, as clearly as possible, both its long-term plans and the uncertainty that is inherent inits assessment.BIS Review   56/1997

If complete credibility in monetary policy and a low-inflation regimehave not been achieved , it will naturally influence the pace with which interest rates are loweredor raised. In situations of this kind, the result may be that the central bank has its instrumentalrates set at either a too high or a too low level compared with what would have been warrantedin an environment of high credibility.Developments during 1996 can illustrate the effects on policy of both uncertaintyand insufficient credibility. At the beginning of the year, the Riksbank estimated that activity inthe economy was declining and that inflationary pressure was falling. Both the demand situationand the indicators that exist for inflation expectations pointed in the same direction. (Figure 2).However, the forecasts of inflation, which were made by private players, werestill not wholly in line with the Riksbank’s target. Nevertheless, the Riksbank’s assessment wasthat in this situation there was room to begin lowering interest rates without threatening theinflation target.Initially, the Riksbank chose to lower the repo rate in equal intervals of 25 basispoints (Figure 3). Prudence was warranted by our wish to receive further information whichcould confirm our picture of falling inflationary pressures. Moreover, we estimated that it wasurgent that the decreases not be interpreted by the market as an indication that the Riksbank hadbegun to tinker with the inflation target, with possible negative effects primarily on long-terminterest rates and the krona. The series of small decreases in the repo rate continued to the end ofthe year, when the rate had been lowered to 4.10 per cent, that is to say, a total decrease of 4.81per centage points. In the spring, new information came that supported the brighter picture.Inflation and budget figures were improving gradually at the same time as the policy generallyappeared to be stabilising. This supported monetary policy.These events give an example of how difficulties in interpreting the informationreceived can be handled. The Riksbank’s policy is based on forecasts, which are necesssarilyBIS Review   56/1997
- 5 -uncertain, and it also has to be designed so that it is perceived as consistent in the long term andcredible.Figure 3Actual and Expected Repo RatePer centSource: The Riksbank334455667788991010jjaann--9966mmaarr--9966jjunun--9966sseepp--9696ddecec--9696mmaarr--9977jjunun--99773344556677889910105 5 MMaarr..’’96965 5 JJununee’’969624 24 SSeepptt.’.’969610 10 MMaarr.’.’9797RReeppo o rraattee13 13 MMaayy’’9977The conclusion is that there may be reason and scope for the Riksbank, within theframework of a policy with price stability as its objective, to pay attention to real economicdevelopments.  In fact, this possibility is inherent in a monetary policy based on an inflationtarget. In practice, however, the possibilities of an active stabilisation policy are limited by thegeneral uncertainty that prevails.The Exchange RateIn small, open economies, the exchange rate has an important influence oninflation. At the same time, it is a variable that has fluctuated considerably in recent years forreasons which have not always been easy to foresee and interpret.How changes in the exchange rate should be handled in practical policy dependsabove all on how lasting a change in the exchange rate is judged to be. More enduring changesthat have an effect on inflation forecasts obviously have to be taken into account  In order todecide on the duration and what is a reasonable reaction, one normally has to know whatbrought about the change. Several different cases can be discerned:A nominal change in the exchange rate can be a result of a change in the realequilibrium exchange rate. This case is in principle simple to manage since it normally does notlead to a changed picture of inflation and thereby does not occasion any specific policymeasures. Changes in the real equilibrium exchange rate have not been an especially commonreason for changes in the exchange rate in recent years, at any rate since the krona fell inconnection with the changeover to a flexible exchange rate in 1992.A change in the nominal exchange rate may also have to do with a change in thelong-term view of the steadfastness in economic policy, or what is termed credibility. In practiceit is not always so easy to distinguish between what is important for credibility and variousfactors can interact in a complicated manner. Two cases can, however, be discerned:BIS Review   56/1997
- 6 --  In the first case, the problem of credibility is primarily based on a lack ofconfidence in the central bank as such and in monetary policy. In the long-term perspective, thetask is then the establishment of a trackrecord. Laws that guarantee independence can be animportant support in this process. In the short term, there is probably most often not much thatcan be done other than to show by action--increases in interest rates--that one is sticking to one’sobjectives.-  More difficult to assess and manage are situations in which the currency’sdepreciation is a consequence of weakening credibility in the general direction of economicpolicy. Investors in the financial market may, for example, think that the risk has increased for achange of regimes in the future, when the target for price stability may be abandoned at leasttemporarily as a result, for example, of government financial problems. In Sweden this wasprobably the most common explanation for the recurrent periods of exchange rate turbulenceduring the 1990s. In situations of this type, monetary policy itself cannot do the job, and what isworse, in the short term the costs of monetary policy measures may be considerable. Yet there ishardly any other alternative for a central bank than to respond by raising interest rates and insuch a way demonstrate its intention to counter inflationary tendencies.  At the same time thereis reason to try to influence developments in other ways by clarifying the nature of the problems,so that financial policy is turned in the right direction.Figure 444,,0044,,2244,,4444,,6644,,8855,,00jjunun--9966jjuull--9966sseepp--9966nnoovv--9966jjaann--9977mmaarr--9977mmaajj--997766,,0066,,2266,,4466,,6666,,8877,,0077,,2277,,4477,,6677,,8888,,00The Swedish Exchange Rateversus USD andDEMSSEEKK//UUSSDDrriigghht t aaxxiis s SSEEKK//DDEEMMlleefft t aaxxiissSource: The RiksbankAnother, often complementary, reason for fluctuations in the nominal exchangerate may be unrest or disturbances in the international currency and capital markets. If suchdisturbances can be deemed to be pure market phenomena and thus of short duration, theyshould make hardly any difference to the bank’s behaviour.  However, this is not the mostcommon case. What we saw in the international financial markets—after the bond markets’crash in 1994 or the Mexico/Barings unrest in 1995—is an interaction between markettendencies in a more limited sense and weak public finances or other credibility problems. Highinternational interest rates and currency unrest have aggravated the problem of public finances,BIS Review   56/1997
- 7 -so that on these occasions economies such as Sweden’s have moved from a virtuous to a viciouscircle.Examples of how one could analyse exchange rate developments in the aboveterms can also be found in events of the last half-year.An explanation of developments with respect to the krona has to do with theposition of the Swedish and continental economies in the business cycle. In recent months thedollar and the pound especially have appreciated relative to continental currencies. Monetarypolicy in the USA and Great Britain has been relatively tight. (Figure 4).This is still not the entire explanation. The krona has also fallen somewhat againstcontinental currencies, especially during the winter and spring. In part, this has coincided withconcerns with respect to the EMU process, possibly strengthened in Sweden’s case becauseSweden’s position on the EMU issue is unclear. In addition there has been some uncertaintyabout the steadfastness of long-term economic policy connected with, inter alia, continued highunemployment.The studies that have been done by the Riksbank indicate that there is room for anappreciation of the krona. Not only are government finances in considerably better conditionthan they were earlier (in fact, Sweden is one of the relatively few EU countries, which,according to the EU Commission can be expected to have a budget deficit in 1997 that complieswith Maastricht targets with a margin), but also Sweden has a large current account surplus andthe inflation forecasts are positive. Despite that, the krona has depreciated by 6 to 7 per cent ineffective terms since October last year.How should monetary policy handle such a situation? We can use ‘open-mouthoperations’ and inform the markets and other players of our assessment of what has beenhappening. Maybe this can influence developments in some measure. If the krona’s downwardtrend cannot be stopped, it will eventually have an effect on demand -- something the Riksbankhas to take into account when the instrumental rates are decided. Accordingly, a depreciatingexchange rate is an important factor that can affect the estimate of future inflation and thus thedirection of monetary policy.Target VariableTo conclude, I intend to discuss a few issues that have to do with the design andinterpretation of the price stability objective. The line of argument I am going to take can hardlybe perceived as controversial. Even with  the general support for a price stability objective thathas been achieved, a number of questions of a more practical nature concerning how monetarypolicy should be implemented remain. Price stability, as everyone realizes, may be defined inmany ways, with somewhat different consequences for the execution of monetary policy.When the index for measuring inflation is chosen, a number of differentconsiderations have to be taken into account. The index has to be reasonably broad and give apicture of price developments in the economy as a whole. It is an advantage if it is also wellestablished and regularly published with a short time lag. In addition, it is desirable that theindex is seldom revised.  All these factors bear out the suitability of the consumer price index(CPI) . Thus, the Riksbank’s inflation target has been expressed in terms of a change in theofficial consumer price index.BIS Review   56/1997

Such influences can be changes in indirect taxes and subsidies or the price of oil. Tothe extent that such changes only have an initial direct effect on the price level but are notdeemed to influence the future rate of inflation, they should not precipitate interest rateadjustments.A special case of the temporary effects is what happens when the Riksbankchanges its policy and raises or lowers the instrumental rates. This affects the interest costs ofhousing, thereby influencing the CPI. Hence, interest rate changes can make it more difficult toreach the price stability objective in the short run.The CPI has varied significantly more than the various measures of underlyinginflation that the Riksbank produces (Figure 5). One example is 1996, when interest rates werereduced rapidly. The CPI then fell much more than the underlying inflation, which was due to areduction of the interest costs for housing. In this way, annual inflation ended up somewhatbelow the one per cent lower limit of the tolerance interval.  At the same time, all indicators ofunderlying inflation show that it has edged downwards and has recently kept relatively stable inthe interval of 1-1.5 per cent.The problem of temporary influences can be managed in different ways:1.  One possibility is to clearly specify in advance which deviations from the CPIare acceptable. This is the method used in New Zealand. It could lead to greater transparency.On the other hand, it would be less clear exactly how the valid objective is defined. In addition,it is difficult to foresee all the corrections warranted and to quantify their exact price effects.Finally, it is a problem that corrections of this kind are so highly dependent on the central bank’sown asessments, which can influence credibility negatively.2. A closely related alternative is to use a measure of underlying inflation astarget. Compared to the first alternative, it has the advantage of giving a clear definition of theBIS Review   56/1997
- 9 -objective. It would, however, lead to difficulties similar to those of alternative 1 with respect toproblems of defining and quantifying the effects of various disturbances.3. Another possibility is to supplement the CPI by one or several measures ofunderlying inflation. In Canada the objective is expressed in terms of the CPI whereas a measureof the underlying inflation--which descibes the process of inflation better--is the operative target.In the long run, the final goal is reached since there is a clear link between it and the operativetarget. A ”softer” variety on the same theme is to clarify how practical policy is influenced byunderlying inflation, since it can often give a clearer picture of the process of inflation.It is important to note that the big changes which occurred in the repo rate andthus in the interest costs of housing in recent years were linked to the transition from the highinflation regime of the seventies and eighties to a regime of price stability. A continuedconfidence in the low inflation regime would imply that such large changes in the interest ratecomponent are less likely in the future.It is evident from what the Riksbank has said earlier in various contexts that thereare price effects, which will not be caught within the tolerance interval and which we do notneed to counteract fully by monetary policy measures. Attempts to do so could destabilise theeconomy further, partly due to time lags in the effects of monetary policy. Consequently, ifunexpected disturbances were to occur, or if taxes and subsidies were to be changed, forexample in connection with a major change in the tax system, we would have to accept that thiswould have an immediate effect on the price level. Temporary deviations from the targetedinflation rate may therefore happen. What is important with respect to such deviations is to driveinflation back to the target within the horizon where monetary policy has its biggest effect onprice developments.The possibility to achieve the inflation target is accordingly affected not only byhow the target variables are defined, but also by what time perspective is used when the policy isevaluated and how wide the applied tolerance level is. The Riksbank has emphasized that oneshould see the price stability objective in an annual perspective—nothing more precise than that.As to the width of the band, we have started from an interval of +1 per cent, which is fairlynormal among countries with an inflation target.SummaryThe policy with an inflation target has functioned well in Sweden and in othercountries that have chosen to work with an inflation target. Inflation has become low. In additionan increased understanding of a policy directed at price stability has been created in Sweden aswell as in other countries with an inflation target. This is especially noteworthy because many of the countries which now work with an inflation target arethe very same countries that earlier had problems with inflation.When monetary policy is conducted with an inflation target, production andemployment are normally stabilised too. For example, increased demand usually implies anincreased rate of inflation. When inflation forecasts indicate that a risk for inflation will exceedthe target, raising the instrumental rate is warranted, thereby also slowing down demand growth.In practice the room for an active stabilisation policy is circumscribed by theuncertainty about future inflation. Another important complication relates to how credible thepolicy is. Increased credibility of monetary policy creates more room for both rapidly shiftingBIS Review   56/1997
- 10 -policy in a more expansionary direction in situations of weakening demand and deferringinterest rate hikes. Measures to strengthen central bank independence should inter alia be seen inthis light.How the exchange rate is to be managed within the framework of a policy with aninflation target is an important matter. The countries with inflation targets have differentapproaches. In all circumstances, it is important to assess how durable an exchange rate changeis likely to be. This normally implies a picture of what caused the change. Durable changesinfluencing the inflation forecast have to be taken into account when the instrumental rates areset. Increased credibility of economic policy in general makes this problem easier to handle. Thehigher the credibility, the smaller the exchange-rate fluctuations are likely to be.The question of how the target is formulated and interpreted (for example, inrelation to the measures describing the underlying inflation process) is worth discussing. Severalfactors have to be taken into account when the target variable is chosen. First, the capacity ofmonetary policy exactly to forecast and control inflation in the very short run is small. Second,the economy may be hit by disturbances that could create a conflict between a short-terminflation target and an ambition to stabilise the real development. Third, the outcome of the CPIis not a perfect indicator of the underlying inflation trend. This problem is handled in differentways in countries having a price stabilization objective.The Swedish monetary policy with a price stability objective has been successfuland seems well balanced in view of present inflation forecasts. However, this should not preventus from deepening the discussion about how monetary policy is conducted against thebackground of the experiences in Sweden and other countries.BIS Review   56/1997
1BIS Review 131/1999Mr Grenville deliberates on Asia’sfinancial markets and on capitalising on reformNotes for a talk given by Mr Stephen Grenville, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, tothe Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Seminar, held in Sydney on 30 November 1999.*      *      *Causes of the crisisIn early diagnosis of the cause of the Asian crisis, there was much emphasis on the mistakes ofdomestic policy. There was talk of over-valued exchange rates, and much emphasis on “cronycapitalism”. There were, it needs to be emphasised, serious problems in domestic policy in thesecountries, and some of these were an important ingredient in the problems. But it should be noted that,no matter how unattractive crony capitalism, it existed during the 30 years of outstanding economicperformance.Over time, serious commentators came to realise that, whatever the problems of domesticpolicy-making, there also seemed to be serious problems in the international financial order,particularly relating to the volatility of foreign capital flows. So it was not too long before a morebalanced and operationally useful assessment appeared, in which the central issue was identified as thejuxtaposition of two fatal flaws – huge and volatile foreign capital flows, and a fragile and poorlyfunctioning domestic financial system.How to address these problems?The answer is not to draw back from the broad path of development these countries were on, relyingpredominantly on markets for the allocation of resources. No one, to my knowledge, has suggested afundamental departure from the market-based path. The issue, rather, is the recognition that thetransition from regulated to unregulated financial markets is a difficult one, with very significantvulnerability along the way. It seems that when the transition is over, and markets and institutionshave adapted, many of the dangers disappear, and the benefits are more prominent. It is like therelatively calm waters above and below the Niagara Falls, but with very significant turbulence in thetransition between the two tranquil states. This problem has produced a number of different imageswith a common theme: the central bank governor in one of the crisis countries said that they wereasked to host a house-warming party while the house foundations were still being constructed.Another observer talked about the problem of plugging into a high-voltage power grid.Some have drawn the connection with the old sequencing debate, common in the economic literaturefor some decades. The broad thrust of this message was that the most general, ubiquitous andfar-reaching elements of deregulation should be done last. In particular, financial deregulation shouldcome last, because, if it did not, the price distortions inherent in a regulated economy would beexacerbated, exaggerated and exploited by a deregulated financial system. But the reality is thatderegulation can and should take place when the opportunities are available. Carpe diem is thewatchword of reformers. This was certainly the case in Australia, where financial deregulationpreceded other important deregulation – most notably, in the labour market. So there is no simpleanswer in sequencing. The uncomfortable reality is that much of the “plumbing” that needs to be putin place during the process of financial deregulation – in terms of the experience, reputation andinstitutional structures – takes time to create. Waiting for some propitious moment does not solve theproblem, because it is largely a process of “learning by doing”. But at least if the transition isrecognised as tricky, then it may be possible to spread it out over a period to reduce the vulnerability.It might be worth noting that in Australia we went through this awkward and vulnerable transitionperiod, with the most obvious manifestation being the “Banana Republic” difficulties in themid-1980s. We clearly did not come through this unscathed, but we were lucky that our foreign
BIS Review 131/19992exchange problems (which occurred in the mid-1980s) did not coincide with our prudential problems(which occurred in the late-1980s and early-1990s). The two elements – often seen coinciding in thetransition – were nicely out of phase for us, and we should be thankful for that.What could be done? In the course of looking at possible changes to the international financialarchitecture, various ideas have been put forward which, provided they are not seen as panaceas, mighthelp. There are efforts currently underway to obtain more disclosure from hedge funds, and to developsome procedures for “bailing in” private-sector creditors. Some have suggested that collective actionclauses should be built into bonds, and this seems broadly a good idea. Other suggestions about privatecontingent credit lines seem, to me, less likely to contribute much to “shock-proofing” the transition,principally because those providing the private-sector contingent credit lines will have an incentive todo offsetting transactions if it seems likely that the contingency will arrive.One helpful change is one of attitude. One problem with the process of financial deregulation that hastaken place in the Asian countries over the last 10 years or so is that it was driven partly by doctrine.This doctrinal imperative reflected two separate forces, which came together more or less by accident.The first of these forces was the dominance in academic circles of the “efficient markets paradigm”.This is a powerful analytical device, which has taken thinking in economics down very usefuldirections. But it, like all paradigms, is an imperfect representation of the real world. Perhaps moreseriously, in the course of academic debate, it became quasi-religious, with beliefs and facts becomingconfounded. This made it hard to leaven the efficient markets paradigm with some real-world facts –principally, that markets are imperfect. The second force was a simple commercial imperative on thepart of foreign financial institutions to gain access to new markets and compete in the most vigorousway. This commercial imperative was successfully transplanted into the political processes, so wesaw, for example, the OECD insisting on capital market deregulation as a condition of Korea’smembership of the organisation. These forces combined to form powerful rhetorical pressures, toderegulate as fully as possible, with special virtue being attached to those who opened their markets atthe most breakneck speed. One of the notable manifestations of this was the Bangkok InternationalBanking Facility, whereby small Thai businesses were presented with a frictionless conduit tointernational financial markets, where they could borrow at attractively low interest rates, in foreigncurrency. In Australia, we know, from our small taste of the Swiss loans in the 1980s, how dangerousit is to have relatively unsophisticated borrowers given the opportunity and incentives to take onsophisticated products involving foreign exchange risk. But in Australia this was relatively modest inmacro-economic terms. In Thailand, the inflow through the Bangkok International Banking Facilitywas not far short of 10% of GDP.With this change of attitude, it should be easier to insert some common sense into the process ofderegulation, and have the courage to say “no” (or “not yet”) to some aspects of deregulation whichseem to make countries more vulnerable. So it may be quite sensible, from this viewpoint, to putvarious restrictions on short-term capital inflows, and on foreign-currency borrowing. This iscompatible with free-market principles, because these are properly seen as transition measures, to bemodified and ultimately abandoned.The other place where common sense might usefully prevail over doctrine is in recognising that,despite the very strong pressures for uniformity of rules and regulations internationally (inThomas Friedman’s terminology, adoption of the “Golden Straitjacket”), there is still someopportunity for tailoring the set of rules to the particular needs (and political consensus) of a country.Just to give one example, it would be a mistake to think that the full minutiae of bankruptcy laws haveto be translated precisely and uniformly across all countries. The particular balance between debtorand creditor which is seen in Anglo-Saxon law is a product of the particular social values of thesesocieties. Other countries have come up with different relationships – I have heard it said that oneimportant reason why creditors have traditionally been in a weak position in Indonesia is the consciousrecognition that creditors would often be Chinese businessmen and money-lenders, and the societaljudgment was that it was not going to give powerful legal remedies to these creditors. The forcestending to push people towards a rather uniform Golden Straitjacket are powerful indeed, butindividual countries can assess to what extent they can and should modify these rules, to make themmore palatable to their societies, without at the same time making them more costly. This debate has
3BIS Review 131/1999yet to be joined, or even defined, but it is nonetheless important. The central point here is thatThomas Friedman’s Golden Straitjacket is not an axiom of market economics, but rather is a set ofrules which have emerged to meet the needs of current-day developed-country markets.The role of banksOne of the lessons commonly drawn from the crisis experience is that countries should quicklydiversify their financial institutions, to become less dependent on banks and foreign bank inflows.Chairman Greenspan has referred to the need for a “spare wheel”, which he envisages to be alternativeforms of funding when bank financing dries up. There may well be a good case for developing newfinancial markets, particularly in bonds. But one of the intrinsic problems is shortage of knowledge,particularly commercial intelligence. In a world where information is scarce and at a premium (wherethe “model” is not well defined), markets which are continuously repricing assets will tend to be veryvolatile, as small accretions or revisions to information are absorbed by the market. It would seem tome to be a mistake to shift quickly away from the world in which banks are the fundamental financialintermediary, because banks are, par excellence, the institutions which focus on information collectionand the assessment of idiosyncratic risk. Information about borrowers is their stock-in-trade. They donot have to reassess and reprice their assets continuously. Given past performance, there seems littlelikelihood that the credit-rating agencies can quickly improve their performance to the stage wherethey can provide sufficient information to allow investors to make smooth, non-disruptive investmentdecisions in markets which are constantly being repriced. If this assessment is correct, then the task isto make sure that the banks do a better job in acting as the guardians of the gateway to investment.This is a formidable task, but there seems a better prospect that banks will be able to act as a filter andprovide a second opinion on investment projects, rather than rely on the much more sophisticated,information-intensive and indirect process that we see operating in developed financial markets.GrowthIn the wash-up to the Asian crisis, one could easily come to the view that the answer was to shift downa gear and grow more slowly. Within reason, this may be sensible and inevitable. But it would beneither sensible nor inevitable for these countries to adopt the lower rates of growth which areregarded as normal in developed countries. The problem is that higher growth is far more vital to thesecountries than it is to us. For us there are unfilled needs in education and health, but the reality is thatmuch of any extra growth in Australia would go to far less pressing priorities. Given the extraordinaryproblems and pressing nature of the needs in the crisis countries of Asia, it is not sensible to see theanswer being to slow growth. So whatever system and changes are put forward to address theproblems of the last couple of years, they should pass the test of being compatible with a good pace ofgrowth. One shouldn’t be too pessimistic about this, because if the sort of efficiency-enhancingreforms which are being pursued on so many fronts are successful, then the potential rate of growth ofthese countries should be enhanced rather than diminished.In conclusionIt is a pleasure to take part in this symposium, which addresses so directly what seems to me to be thecentral issue – how to make Asia’s financial markets work better. I have touched, today, on some ofthe measures which go under the rubric of the International Architecture, but I have no doubt that themain task is in the hands of the policymakers of these countries. Central to this is to work much harderon prudential supervision, to create a set of rules which is both feasible of application andthoroughgoing in keeping the banking system as a whole safe. It is a formidable task, which will takededication and the persistent application of common sense. I wish them well.

Awell-known US central banker once said, however, that it is, in principle, always a mistake to invite acentral banker as one’s speaker, since he is not allowed to say anything that is of interest to hisaudience, while the audience mostly already knows everything that he is allowed to say. Today I shalltry to get round that dilemma as best I can.The launch of the euro for 11 Member States of the European Union constitutes the most far-reachingchange in the international monetary order since the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1973.For the first time, 11 sovereign states bearing continued national responsibility for their fiscal andeconomic policies have set up a supranational central bank bearing the sole responsibility for theircommon monetary policy.The launch of the euro has aroused both political and economic expectations: politically speaking, thetransition to the single currency marks a further – consistent – milestone on the road to Europeanintegration. In the meantime, the European Union comprises 15 Member States (the United Kingdom,Denmark, Sweden and Greece have failed to join the monetary union – for very different reasons); 12other European states are seeking admission to the EU. In economic terms, it is hoped that the launchof the euro will likewise yield substantial benefits: it is anticipated that the disappearance of exchangerisk within the Eurosystem and the intensification of competition in the European financial,The euro is a new currency which has superseded the old currencies in 11 of the 15Member States of the European Union.11 sovereign states, while retaining national responsibility for their fiscal and generaleconomic policies, have set up a supranational central bank which bears the soleresponsibility for the common monetary policy.The launch of the euro is associated with both political and economic expectations:politically speaking, with hopes of favourable repercussions on European integration; ineconomic terms, with hopes of further progress towards the enhancement of thecommon market through the disappearance of exchange risk and the intensification ofcompetition.The launch of the euro - a milestone on the way to European integrationFigure 1
BIS Review 130/19992merchandise and services markets will have a favourable impact on the further enhancement of thecommon market.Don’t let yourselves be confused by the fact that the old currencies, such as the Deutsche Mark orFrench franc, are still in circulation in the 11 euro countries. Euro banknotes and coins will not belaunched until the year 2002 because of the immense logistical trouble it will cause.Actually, in statutory and economic terms, the euro is already the sole currency in the eurozone; theold currencies are – as we say in the jargon – nothing but the “non-decimal denominations” of theeuro.At this juncture, I have no wish to bore you unduly with figures. As regards the dimensions of the euromonetary area, it is enough to say that, in terms of their population and economic performance, theeurozone and the United States are roughly comparable (290 million EMU Europeans compare with270 million US Americans; in terms of economic performance, the euro area, accounting for 15% ofglobal GDP, is second only to the USA, at 20%).IIThe statutory and institutional prerequisites of the euro are laid down in what is known as theMaastricht Treaty.According to that Treaty, the so-called “Eurosystem” consists of the European Central Bank and thenational central banks of the 11 Member States. Hence the Deutsche Bundesbank is integrated in theEurosystem, rather than sunk – a small but significant distinction. I am not addressing you today asone of the last representatives of a species doomed to extinction.The primary objective of the Eurosystem is the maintenance of price stability. That institution isindependent of instructions from government bodies. It is required to support the Community’sgeneral economic policy only insofar as that is possible without endangering the objective of pricestability. That is a not entirely insignificant difference from the duties assigned to the Fed system.EuropeanCentral Bank (ECB)                        +  11 nationalcentralbanksPrimaryobjective:maintenance ofprice stability,accompanied by independencefrom instructionsfromgovernment institutions (the generaleconomic policy oftheCommunityis endorsed onlyinsofar asthe primacyoftheobjectiveofprice stability is not injeopardy).TheEuropean SystemofCentral Banks (“Eurosystem”)Figure 2

According to thatprinciple, the European Central Bank is required to avail itself of the services of the national centralbanks to execute transactions, insofar as that seems possible and appropriate. In practice, operationaltransactions are almost all conducted by the national central banks.The monetary constitutions of the ESCB and the Deutsche Bundesbank show distinct parallels. Theprimacy of the maintenance of price stability is common to both systems, as is the high degree ofmonetary autonomy and the decentralized execution of duties.The Executive Board  President       Vice-President                           Four other membersThe Governing Council11 Governors of national central banksDecision-making bodies of the ECBTask of the Governing Council:Formulation of the monetary policy of the Community.Task of the Executive Board and the national central banks:Implementation of monetary policy in accordance with the guidelines and decisionslaid down by the Governing Council.Figure 3The twin pillars of the monetary policy strategy of the EurosystemThe quantitativedefinitionof price stability:Medium-term year-on-year rise of less than 2% in theharmonized consumer price index (HCPI) for the euro area For assessing the outlook forprice movements and therisks to price stability:ongoing analysis of a broadrange of leading economicindicators, such as wages,exchange rates, bond pricesand yield curvesAnnouncement of a reference value for thegrowth of themoney stock M3Figure 4

BIS Review 130/19995The Governing Council has defined its primary objective, namely that of maintaining price stability, inquantitative terms. According to that definition, price stability obtains if it is ensured over the mediumterm that the year-on-year rise in the harmonized consumer price index (HCPI) for the euro area is lessthan 2%.To realize the objective of price stability, a monetary policy strategy which rests on two pillars wasdevised. In the first place, the Governing Council announced a reference value for the growth of themoney stock M3; secondly, a broad range of leading economic indicators is constantly being analyzedin order to assess the prospects for price movements and the risks to price stability.Central bank money is mainly provided through open market operations, a weekly tender beingoffered with a maturity of two weeks and a monthly one with a maturity of three months. Through theinstitution of two standing facilities, the movement of the overnight money rate is curbed by aninterest-rate corridor, i.e. a ceiling and a floor to the overnight money rate.The Eurosystem also has a wide range of fine-tuning instruments. Owing to the buffer function of theminimum reserve system, however, a comparatively steady development of the money-market rates isassured, so that the Eurosystem has not had to intervene in the market with fine-tuning measures evenonce since the start of monetary union. You can gather the full range of the monetary policyinstruments of the Eurosystem from the figure; unfortunately, I am unable to go into more detail here,for time reasons.In my opinion, the monetary policy strategy and arsenal of instruments of the Eurosystem areconvincing and fully in keeping with international standards. The particular significance of the twostanding facilities is demonstrated, for instance, in connection with the Y2K problem. The marginallending facility sets the ceiling on the overnight money rate, since the counterparties of the ESCB canobtain overnight liquidity on an unlimited scale against the lodging of sufficient collateral. Unless I ammuch mistaken, the Fed has just set up a similar facility for the turn of the year.IIIJust under 11 months after the launch of the euro, it seems legitimate to take initial stock:As regards domestic price stability, i.e. the movement of the inflation rate, the history of the euro hasso far been a “success story”. The rise in the harmonized consumer price index, currently at 1.2%, isstill a good way off the absolute limit of “less than 2%” set by the Governing Council. Even so,increased vigilance is needed here since a certain upward pressure on consumer prices has to beexpected, not least on account of the steep rise in oil prices. For this reason the Governing Council ofthe ECB decided at its meeting on 4 November 1999 to raise the ECB’s three main interest rates by50 basis points each. The Governing Council is convinced that the timely rise in interest rates willavoid the need for stronger measures later; on balance the prospects for sustained price stability remaingood. [Figure 6] – not available“There is no light without shadows”, says a German proverb, and that brings me to a topic which hasbeen much discussed among the public at large, namely the movement of the external value of theeuro:The expectations about the positioning of the euro in the global financial markets were very mixed.“Euro over-optimists” had reckoned with a rapid appreciation of the euro against the US dollarbecause they were expecting central banks, institutional investors and private investors to take earlyand marked advantage of the euro in order to diversify their portfolios, which often focused on thedollar. By contrast, “euro sceptics” drew attention to the fact that it needs a long time before a new anduntried currency is accepted as an investment, reserve and transaction currency.
BIS Review 130/19996As a matter of fact, the euro made a promising start in the foreign exchange markets, with a rateagainst the dollar of 1.18. But the exchange rate soon began to edge down, reaching an all-time low, at1.0124, on 12 July.The main reasons for this depreciation were no doubt the astonishing resilience of US business activityand the associated distinct interest-rate advantage of the United States.In the meantime, the reference rate of the euro against the dollar has picked up distinctly, and for sometime past has been moving within a range of 1.03–1.09 (on ... the current level is ...). This upwardmovement is undoubtedly due to the improved economic outlook and rising interest rates in theeurozone.The movement of the external value of the euro can be viewed with relative composure from thestandpoint of a European central banker. Since the euro became the single currency of 11 Europeancountries, foreign trade between those countries has been conducted without any exchange risk orexchange-rate fluctuations. In other words, only foreign trade with non-EU countries is affected byexchange-rate movements; hence the “openness” of the euro-area countries, i.e. their vulnerability toexchange-rate fluctuations, has decreased significantly.IVWhat, then, have been the repercussions of the launch of the euro on the European financial markets?To begin with, a few words on the European money market, i.e. the direct field of operations of theECB.As far as the unsecured money market is concerned, it has long been fair to speak of a single Europeanmarket. In this sector, a highly liquid market with a tight bid-ask spread and considerable transactionvolumes evolved very quickly. A large part of the trade between “big players” is meanwhile beingtransacted with counterparties abroad; this trend is undoubtedly being fostered by the smoothfunctioning of the European payment system, TARGET.Distinct progress towards integration has likewise been made in the secured money market. Even so,there are still certain shortcomings here. Particular problems are posed by the coexistence of differentDegree of integration of the European money marketUnsecured money market:completelyintegrated- highly liquid- with substantial transaction volumes- large proportion of “big player” trade  nowadays cross-border- cross-border payments settled smoothly  by the TARGET systemSecured money market: making distinct                                          progress towards                                         integration, but                                         certain deficits         remain- divergent legal systems- cross-border settlement of securities   transactions sometimes poses problemsFigure 7
BIS Review 130/19997legal systems, as reflected, for instance, in divergent master agreements. To cite an example, alongsidethe PSA/ISMA master repo agreement customary for international transactions, there are a number ofnational framework agreements, e.g. for Germany or France.Finally, there is also a degree of friction in connection with the cross-border settlement of securities, asa result of which particular securities are being traded only in their domestic markets. In general,however, all those concerned are faring satisfactorily as far as the European repo market is concerned:for instance, the European Banking Association is in the process of preparing a European master repoagreement, which will be put on the market very shortly.With reference to the European capital markets, it must be said that developments in the bond andequity markets have so far diverged very markedly:In the market for fixed interest securities, a large and liquid market came into being very quickly afterthe disappearance of the price differences owing to inflation and exchange rate changes; in themeantime, the euro bond market is the second largest in the world, after the US bond market. Themain reasons for that were, firstly, the decision taken by the principal issuers not only to launch newissues in euro, but also to convert fungible large-scale old issues into euro. Secondly, market playershad agreed in the run-up to monetary union to standardize their highly divergent national marketpractices into internationally customary market rules and regulations.I suppose that the formation of a single European equity market will take some time. It is true thatefforts are now being made to set up a pan-European stock market, so as at least to overcome thepronounced segmentation of European stock markets, but national differences in underlying conditions– meaning corporate law, tax law and balance-sheet law – constitute a serious stumbling block to that.VAltogether, the chances of the further auspicious development of the euro financial markets are to berated very favourable. The substantial progress towards integration that has already been made atteststo the rapid pace of growth of the euro area; the attractiveness of the euro to international investors andissuers alike will probably go on increasing.Degree of integration of the European capital marketBond market: largely integrated- large-scale old issues converted  into euro- uniform market practices laid down - highly liquid- world’s second largest bond market  after the USAEquity market: some progress towards integration, but still no little need for adjustment- segmentation of European stock markets(but: efforts to create a pan-Europeanstock market)- national differences in corporate law, taxlaw and balance-sheet lawFigure 8
BIS Review 130/19991Mr Macfarlane’s statement to the House of Representatives Standing Committeeon Economics, Finance and Public AdministrationOpening Statement given by Mr L J Macfarlane, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to theHouse of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration on29 November 1999.*      *      *It is a pleasure to be here in these dignified surroundings to appear before the Committee again. Asyou know, we take these hearings very seriously because we regard them as an important channel forParliament, through its representatives, to question the Reserve Bank in depth. It thus plays animportant role in ensuring the Bank’s accountability and in the democratic process.As usual, I would like to make an opening statement, but it will not be comprehensive because we putout our Semi-Annual Statement on Monetary Policy earlier in the month. Its contents are still verycurrent and I will refer to it from time to time during the hearing.Also following past practice, I would like to start by reviewing what I said to you in June about howwe saw the economy developing. There was still a fair bit of uncertainty around at that stage as to theextent of the expected slowdown in GDP growth from the 4½% plus that had occurred in 1997 and1998. That is why we had a relatively wide range of projected outcomes from 3% to 4%. The top ofthat range would indicate almost no slowdown, while the bottom would probably indicate we wereheading still lower and would represent genuine weakness in economic activity.We think the position is a little clearer now – our forecast for growth through 1999 is 3½%, andthrough the financial year 1999/2000 is 4%. A through-the-year growth rate of 4% implies ayear-on-year growth rate of 3½%, the same as the Treasury is forecasting in its mid-year review. Thus,these numbers do show a modest slowdown for the Australian economy, but most of it is behind us. Itincorporates the low June quarter figure and reflects weakness in business investment, and particularlya decline in net exports in the first half of 1999. Because the latter is unlikely to be repeated, we expectto see growth of around 4% through the year ahead.There has been no reason to change our view on inflation. We thought inflation in the year toDecember quarter 1999 would be 2%, whether measured by the CPI or some underlying measure. Westill think 2% for the CPI and a shade over 2% in underlying terms. When we look out to June 2000,our guess for the CPI is 2¾%, with 2¼% for underlying.On unemployment, we have also not changed our view. When we met last time, the unemploymentrate had been averaging 7½%, and we expected it to edge down over the remainder of the year. This iswhat it has done, so that now it has averaged 7.2% over the past three months. We expect that it willgo down further so that we will see some numbers less than 7 by June next year.The balance of payments has also turned out very much as expected. For quite a while, we had beenforecasting the quarterly current account deficit to reach 6% of GDP, and it finally did so in the Junequarter and will probably remain at about this level through this financial year. It was surprising thatthe current account did not deteriorate faster and further, given the disparity between our growth rateand that of our trading partners. While the slowness of the deterioration has been a pleasingdevelopment, we think that the improvement could be some time in coming.In summary, we are expecting that the current financial year will be another good one for theeconomy. Growth will be a little lower than its recent peak, but still good, and inflation should bewithin the average we aim for. Considering that this is the ninth year of the expansion, such a resultwould mean that no major imbalances had emerged. The aim, as usual, is to keep the expansion goingand to avoid the emergence of problems that would threaten its continuation.
BIS Review 130/19992Monetary policyThis brings me to monetary policy. The most important development here was the tighteningimmediately after our November Board Meeting when the overnight cash rate was raised from 4.75%to 5%. While I think this adjustment has been quite well received by the community, it is still worthspelling out some aspects which lay behind the decision.I would like to start by putting it in the international context, not because we have to follow what othercountries do, but because there are some international developments that are a common background toall countries. One such development was the changed perceptions about the world economic outlookin 1999 and 2000. If you remember, 1998 was a weak year for the world economy, largely because ofthe widespread fallout from the Asian crisis. At the beginning of this year, things looked as thoughthey were getting worse, and most forecasters – public and private – expected 1999 to be weaker than1998. In the event, it turned out the other way – 1999 has been better than 1998, and 2000 should bebetter again.As our Semi-Annual Statement said:“This change has led to an increase in both short-term and long-term interest rates in mostindustrial countries, as markets questioned the continuation of the accommodative monetarystance central banks have generally been following over the past year or two. The upwardpressure in interest rates began in the US, the country most advanced in its economic cycle,but quickly spread to other English-speaking countries and, more recently, to Europe.”The market reaction was a bit quicker than it needed to be, but it was broadly correct. The UnitedStates was the first to tighten, followed by the United Kingdom. Our tightening in early Novemberwas quickly followed by the European Central Bank, and the central banks of Sweden, Canada andNew Zealand.I would now like to turn to the Australian economy, where a similar expectation of weakness in 1999did not come to pass. Real GDP grew by over 4% in the 12 months to the June quarter (the latest datawe have) and will probably still be showing a similar rate in the 12 months to the September quarter.This measure may slip for a time as we drop off some of the high quarterly growth rates from ourcalculations but, as explained earlier, we think growth will be about 4% in the 12 months to June2000.Similarly, the quite lengthy period during which inflation was undershooting our target seems to havecome to an end. The CPI inflation rate would already be a bit over 2% apart from the Government’sreduction in the Health Insurance Rebate. Although some of this result has been due to rises in oilprices, measures of underlying or core inflation, which are largely unaffected by oil prices, have alsorisen by about 2% over the past 12 months.Thus, the period where the Australian economy was experiencing a contractionary impact from abroadand where the outlook was for weaker growth and sub-2% inflation has now passed. The monetarypolicy that was appropriate for that period is no longer appropriate to the new circumstances that weface. That is the reason behind the tightening of monetary policy we undertook after our NovemberBoard Meeting.At the risk of being overly technical, I would like to spell out some aspects of our flexible inflationtargeting regime a little more fully at this stage. In doing so, I want to distinguish between two typesof situation: the first is where inflation has been comfortably averaging 2 point something per cent forsome time and the economy is performing roughly in line with its potential so there is no obviousupward or downward pressure on the inflation rate. The second is where the starting point is eitherabove or below the range we expect inflation to average.In the first case, where inflation is where we want it, monetary policy would be set to keep it there.The economy would be in a type of dynamic equilibrium and there would be no need for policy action.We then ask ourselves what are the circumstances under which we would wish to change monetarypolicy. Would we do it if our forecast for inflation rose from 2½% to 2¾% or fell to 2¼%? My answeris that we do not worry about small variations in inflation of that magnitude. To trigger a change in
BIS Review 130/19993policy would require a forecast which had inflation going clearly above 3% or below 2% and likely tostay there for a while. Our flexible inflation targeting framework does not aim for rigorous fine tuning,and requires a significant variation in the inflation forecast to trigger monetary policy action.This brings me to the second type of situation. This is where we start from a position where inflation isabove or below our desired target range. In this case, where the initial situation is one of dynamicdisequilibrium, the prescription is a little more complex. Let us look at the situations defined by thetwo possible starting points.• The first is when inflation is above the target. In this situation, the inflation targetingframework would say to raise interest rates to a setting which would bring inflation back tothe target. But once the higher rates had done their job, they should be gradually reduced tomore normal levels. This is what happened in 1996. We did not wait until our forecast hadinflation falling below 2% before we started to ease.• The second is when inflation is below the target. In this case, the framework would first callfor a setting of interest rates which would, over time, allow inflation to go back up to thetarget. Once it is clear that such a setting had done its job, the framework calls for it to bereplaced by one more likely to keep inflation at the target. The framework does not envisagethe low interest rate setting being maintained until something goes wrong.It is this reasoning which lies behind the recent tightening of monetary policy and why we refer to it aspre-emptive. To argue against it on the grounds that we should not act until our inflation forecastclearly exceeded 3% would be to argue for a very “stop-go” approach to monetary policy. It would beequivalent to saying that the most expansionary setting reached during the downward phase of theinterest rate cycle should be maintained until such time as a move to a clearly restrictive setting isrequired, and only then should a move be made. This would virtually guarantee that such a movewould be a large one.What about the GST?Not everyone will be convinced by the arguments I have used above. Some people still cannotunderstand why you would tighten unless the economy was overheating, and assume that there mustbe a hidden agenda. Others are keen to play the old game of trying to find a political dimension tomonetary policy. This has led to claims that the real reason is our fear of the inflationary effects of theGST, but that we are too diplomatic to say so. I am sorry to disappoint the proponents of this view, butthat is not the case.• If the GST was the reason for tightening monetary policy, why have the Fed, the Bank ofEngland, the ECB, the Bank of Canada, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, etc. tightenedmonetary policy? As I have said elsewhere, I am not aware of the forthcoming introductionof a GST in any of these countries.• Our starting point has always been that the imposition of the GST will affect the level ofprices, but not the ongoing inflation rate. This will require that businesses do not engage inopportunistic pricing by raising their prices by more than is warranted by the net impact ofthe GST and reductions in indirect taxes. If that is the case, the GST should not have aneffect on wages because wage earners will gain more from the accompanying fall in incometax rates than they will lose from the introduction of the GST. The net effect of the taxchanges will be to increase the disposable income of wage earners by more than the increasein their expenditure, as is evidenced by the fact that the package involves a cost to theBudget.• Monetary policy is based on a view that inflation will be within the target immediatelybefore the GST is introduced and that it will be back within the target a year later. This view,in turn, is based on the assumption that there will be no second round effects due to higherwage outcomes or opportunistic price behaviour as outlined above. If we started to observebehaviour that indicates that this assumption was not correct, then monetary policy would act
BIS Review 130/19994upon it. We are not acting at present on the expectation that this assumption will be violated– we are acting in the expectation that it will hold.Y2K and all thatI would now like to make a few comments about Y2K, which is very topical because there are nowonly 32 days to go to the new century.When I appeared before the Committee in June, I said that Australian banks, building societies andcredit unions were very well prepared for Y2K. They had not completed all their final testing at thatstage, but now they have, and everything has been done to make sure that their computer systems willbe able to handle the change into the new century. This includes not only all their internal accountingand record-keeping systems, but also their ATM, EFTPOS and credit card systems. As well as makingsure their systems are compliant, they have also been sending out very clear messages to theircustomers about the safety of their deposits. We are very pleased to see this because, as I said in June,the simple fact is that deposits are safe and records are not at risk from Y2K-related problems.I should also say a few words about my own institution. You will not be surprised to know that wehave also put a lot of effort into our own systems to make sure they are Y2K compliant. One of ourmost important is our electronic direct entry system which handles all of Australia’s pensionpayments. You will be pleased to know that all these payments will be made on time.I mentioned last time that it is not just a matter of getting the technical side right, but it is alsoimportant that we do not run into a problem of public over-reaction. All the indications here are thatthe vast majority of the public are taking a sensible and calm approach and have not been influencedby alarmist stories or predictions of doom – not that there have been a lot of these anyhow. In ourjudgment, the Australian media coverage, with only a few exceptions, has been accurate and balanced.I am often asked by people whether they should take out extra cash to see them over the New Yearperiod. My advice is generally along the following lines:• don’t take the risk of having too much cash on your person or in your home;• the safest place for your savings is in the financial institution that it is presently in;• don’t fear that the country will run out of cash. We have printed enough notes to provide forany conceivable demand; and• remember you are only really dealing with a long weekend. Banks, building societies andcredit unions will be open on the three days before New Year’s Day, which is the Saturday,and will re-open on the Tuesday.New Year’s Eve is going to be rather unusual this year in that a lot of people will not be out enjoyingthe festivities but will be at work to make sure that nothing goes wrong. At the Reserve Bank, we willhave a team in place, including myself, and a communications centre to receive up-to-date informationfrom financial institutions on what is happening. This centre will be linked to the CommonwealthGovernment’s National Coordination Centre in Canberra and to various international networks thathave been established.Because Australia (and New Zealand) will be the first countries to enter the new millennium, therewill be a lot of international attention focussed on us, including a fair bit of live television coverage toother countries about what is happening in Australia. Remember the United States will only be startingits working day on Friday when we cross over into the new millennium. I am confident that Australiawill acquit itself well once again in the eyes of the world when the great day comes.
1BIS Review 129/1999Mr Liebscher wonders whether financial crises are really here to stayLuncheon speech delivered by Dr Klaus Liebscher, Governor of the Oesterreichische Nationalbank, atthe Ost-West Konferenz of the Oesterreichische Nationalbank on the theme of “Financial crisis - anever ending story?”, held in Wien on 23 November 1999.*      *      *Ladies and Gentlemen,I have my doubts whether financial crisis is a topic that lends itself well to a luncheon speech, sincepart of what I am going to say may sound like the analysis of a nutrition expert who warns about badeating and drinking habits which are not conducive to health and fitness. So when I talk about toomuch appetite for risk and unsound financial systems and so on, this will hopefully not spoil yourappetite for lunch. If it does, I apologize in advance.What I am going to serve you is not a light dessert but a rather heavy main dish with the followingingredients:• First, a reminder of some features of the financial market trends, including the lessons to bedrawn for economic policy;• second, a brief note on recent work in official international fora on financial stability;• third, an assessment of the relationship between public policy and markets;• fourth, an outlook on the course policymakers should pursue in the future;• and fifth, some reasons why financial stability issues are of concern to central bankers.1.With the new millenium approaching, we clearly have not reached the end of history as one authorsuggested several years ago. We are rather in the process of transforming our economies, and financialmarkets have become a driving force behind this transformation, mostly supporting it, but capable ofseriously disrupting it at times. Global finance, driven itself by technology and liberalization, hasbrought continents closer to each other and thus increased spillover effects. The trend towardsdisintermediated finance is going on and financial instruments are becoming yet more sophisticated.Financial capital is becoming less complacent vis-à-vis policy errors and more demanding as far as therequired return is concerned. The recent crises have shown that policy mistakes tend to be sanctioneddrastically by financial markets, and the longer the sanction is delayed the harder it turns out to be.What has further become clear is that stability is a prerequisite for long-term efficiency and sustainablegrowth - a lesson that appears to be easily forgotten as long as everything goes well. But when thingstake a bad turn, it becomes obvious that financial crises tend to be costly not only for creditors andbanks but also for the economy as a whole. This is not to say, though, that stability is an excuse forfinancial repression which distorts economic decisions. If the financial market doesn’t work like amarket any more, the backlash can be strong. After the crumbling of central planning, stability was ina way discredited, and financial speculation developed against the backdrop of insufficiently regulatedand supervised financial institutions with only a limited capacity to serve the needs of the realeconomy.2.Public policy is actively addressing the issues posed by the trends and changes I have just mentioned.During the last months a lot has been achieved: IMF and World Bank have increased the transparencyof their policies and thus helped financial markets to make better decisions.
BIS Review 129/19992At the BIS the Basle Committee worked out a consultative paper on capital requirements, whose mainthrust is a pronounced individualization of supervision, designed to give banks a more adequatesupervisory treatment. Generally, awareness has been created and agreement on principles has beenachieved. These principles must now be implemented, which will be the most arduous part.In response to the recurrent crises in recent years the Financial Stability Forum has been set up. It is aplatform of collaboration between international supervisory authorities and the Bretton Woodsinstitutions; a platform that opens up the opportunity to detect crises at an early stage and to strengthenglobal cooperation.Finally, the European System of Central Banks has specified its role in financial supervision on thebasis of the allocation of competencies set out in the Treaty.3.The process of change in the financial landscape - with change sometimes evolving smoothly, andsometimes less so - is also a process of interaction between public policy and financial markets:financial markets influence policy, but policy influences financial markets as well. It is fair that marketparticipants should be informed well in advance about the framework conditions for doing business.Policymakers, likewise, need to know the views of financial market participants. The dialoguebetween policy and markets is therefore important. It must be clear, however, that policy has to fulfilits role by setting the rules for efficiently functioning markets. Adequate prudential regulations andoversight mechanisms are essential in this respect. One crucial question we must tackle in the futureis: how far can we go in letting the markets regulate themselves? How far can private entities be asubstitute for public commitment? As we saw during the Asian crisis, rating agencies can get it wrong,in some instances confirming only the new direction the market itself has already taken. While theprimary responsibility for the overall soundness of the financial system lies with policy, market forcesshould be used as an indispensible complementary tool to exert discipline. This requires policymakersto be aware of the mechanisms according to which markets work, and sometimes fail to work.Eventually, behind the seemingly anonymous markets there are human beings trying to maximize theirindividual well-being according to the incentives which they are given. By contrast, public policyneeds to have in mind what is optimal for society as a whole.4.I would like to point out three broad avenues that public policy should take in the future.First, make the market function more efficiently so that risk is priced correctly. If market failuresoccur and consequently the price mechanism doesn’t work, public policy should look into theincentives existing for financial market participants and - if need may be - adapt the framework. Toobig an appetite for risk is at the heart of subsequent financial crises. It is encouraged by explicit orimplicit guarantees which weaken the hard budget constraint that ought to characterize any efficienteconomic system. To avoid moral hazard, public policy should dissipate a false sense of securitywhich might arise because financial markets feel the “too big to fail” doctrine or the “too complex tofail” doctrine will be applied anyway. Constructive ambiguity - based on knowledge of the facts andthe risks - might help to make operators more cautious. What we have learned during the Asian crisisis that “ambiguity” sometimes is not only appropriate when dealing with possible financial support butalso in exchange rate policies. When there is a lack of fundamental convergence in the medium term,exchange rate pegs can invite short-term speculative capital movements and unsustainable investmentand consumption patterns.This brings me to macroeconomic policies in general, the second big avenue, the importance of whichI would like to stress. The globalization of finance has put a premium on good policies. Publicauthorities are thus well advised to pursue policies which do not lead to macroeconomic imbalancesthat threaten price stability and long-term growth. Furthermore, if such imbalances arise policies mustadjust quickly. Finally, countries need to be transparent so that there will be an additional incentive to
3BIS Review 129/1999identify the build-up of macroeconomic imbalances at an early stage and to take adequate action. Thehighly valuable ongoing efforts to increase the functioning of the international financial system wouldbe wasted if they cannot build on the preparedness of any country in the world to keep its own housein order. If this effort is pursued collectively, for example on a regional level, a higher leverage can beachieved. Monetary and fiscal discipline in the euro area and structural reforms making the economymore flexible will both make the euro area less prone to originate shocks but also less vulnerable tooutside shocks.The third avenue public policy should take is to give more attention to the legal infrastructure offinancial markets, covering both bankruptcy procedures and effective corporate governance. Thiscould also be a standard feature of international surveillance. “Ordnungspolitik” thus has to getprominence in the design of worldwide integration and liberalization strategies. The liberalization ofcapital movements, as desirable as it is, must go hand in hand with the establishment of sound andefficiently supervised financial systems; otherwise not only the countries which liberalize prematurelywould suffer from a potential sudden reversal of capital flows and the ensuing exchange rate andeconomic crisis, but also the world economy as a whole would be hit. Let me just mention that - due tothe Asian and Russian crises - some regions of the euro area will experience substantially lowergrowth this year than last year, and for the same reasons real growth in the euro area as a wholedropped from around 3% in 1998 to an estimated 2.1% this year.To sum up, public policy in general and financial supervision in particular thus have an important roleto play. They have to keep the long-term stability and health of the financial system in mind,correcting for the - very often - rather short-term orientation of financial markets. Public policiesshould be designed to avoid the headache after the party, by moderating exuberance and exaggeration.This is certainly more easily said than done and probably not always popular. But are watchdogs thereto be popular?5.Let me now turn to the question of why financial stability issues are of concern to central banks.First, central banks must nowadays even more than in the past know what is going on in financialmarkets. They need to be in a position to assess how the transmission mechanism is influenced bychanging financial market conditions. Moreover, monetary policy must have an interest in the smoothfunctioning of the financial system. As the Japanese example shows, monetary policy may becomeineffective when there is a liquidity trap or when bank lending is restrained by the need to rebuildcapital in the aftermath of a financial crisis. A lowering of the policy interest rate would - under suchconditions - provide no stimulus to the economy.Second, as one of the classical functions of a central bank is to extend emergency liquidity assistance,central banks need adequate information not only on financial markets in general but also onindividual institutions. As monetary stability might be affected when a big player gets into difficulties,central banks should be in a position to form a view if a certain institution is illiquid or insolvent, andif the latter is the case, whether this institution is of systemic importance or not. An additionalchallenge here is that institutions outside the supervisory umbrella - such as hedge funds - tend togrow significantly. Moreover, the growth of financial markets in general and the growing importanceof financial conglomerates in particular go hand in hand with a greater opaqueness of the size anddistribution of risks. This puts additional demands on the analytical capacity of those concerned withfinancial stability.Third, with financial liberalization, asset price and credit cycles may have become more prominentand suggestions have been made that monetary authorities should react to this cycle, for instance byraising interest rates when stock markets are clearly overvalued. Central banks may thus have aninterest to contribute to the discussion of prudential rules, which could contribute to a dampening ofthe asset cycle. Prudential rules, and not interest rate changes, are there to safeguard financial stability.This is not to deny a role for asset prices in the monetary policy strategy. In the context of the ECB’smonetary strategy they are monitored to draw conclusions about future price developments, but there
BIS Review 129/19994is no reaction to movements on financial markets as such. As the priorities within the Eurosystem areclear there is no risk that the central bank loses sight of its primary goal of price stability for fear of anegative reaction of the stock market.Ladies and Gentlemen,To shield the real economy as far as possible from financial instability and prevent instability in thefirst place, continued adaptation of public policy to the changing financial landscape is required. Tokeep monetary policy effective, a smooth functioning of a diversified financial system is also in theinterest of central banks. Monetary policy can contribute to financial stability by keeping expectationsabout future inflation as low as possible and thus reducing inflation risk premia to a minimum. Evenwhen monetary policy cannot eliminate excessive risk-taking and speculation it can at least try toavoid fueling it. Let me conclude by saying that we must never lose sight of why we need bothmonetary and financial stability. They are not an end in themselves but contribute to long-term growthand raising of living standards.
1BIS Review 128/1999Ms Hessius speaks on a number of topicsincluding the “new economy”, the “long boom” and the actualand potential role of asset prices in monetary policySpeech delivered by Ms Kerstin Hessius, Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at the MjärdeviScience Park, Linköping on 29 October 1999.*      *      *It is no exaggeration to say that the prospects for Sweden’s economy look much brighter today thanwhen I spoke here in Linköping a year ago. At that time there was discussion of whether privateconsumption, which was then the main driving force behind demand, would be able to reverse thenegative trend in the industrial sector. However, as it turned out, the financial turbulence in the globaleconomy had limited real impact, and the turnaround in Asia came much earlier than expected. Thelowering of interest rates by central banks probably contributed to the rapid recovery.The international economic outlook is therefore much brighter today. There is great optimism inSweden about the future, both in households and business, and domestic demand is expected to remainstrong in the years to come. Employment is also increasing at a satisfactory pace and public financesare being consolidated.Most observers, including the Riksbank, have substantially revised their forecasts for GDP growth forthis year and for following years. As the economy has improved, expectations that inflation will risehave increased slightly, but they are still at a low level. The repo rate is currently 2.9% and monetarypolicy is expansive, which may cause real GDP to increase faster than the economy can cope with inthe long run. If this is allowed to continue for too long, different types of bottleneck problems andinflationary tendencies will emerge. Such a development must be prevented.During earlier booms, in the 1970s and 1980s, the brakes were often applied too late, as a result ofwhich the growth in production and employment came to an abrupt halt. This must not be allowed tohappen this time. The purpose of monetary policy is to adjust GDP growth to the long-term growthtrend, thus promoting continued growth in employment and an unemployment rate that is as low as thestructure of the economy will allow.To sum up, the future for Sweden’s economy looks rather bright, and it is the task of monetary policyto try to prolong this period of favourable economic development.The “new economy” and the “long boom”A common view, mainly inspired by the debate in the US, is that this favourable development not onlyreflects a cyclical economic recovery, but is largely attributable to “the new economy”. Definitions ofthe “new economy” vary, but most people seem to mean that for various reasons the growth potentialof today’s economy is higher than before. Among the reasons given for this are increased globalisationand the development and dissemination of information technology.This is an interesting hypothesis, but it must be pointed out that it is difficult to prove whether, and, ifso, how much growth potential has actually changed. This obviously restricts the room for manoeuvrein monetary policy to a certain extent. What we must do here is to strike a balance between notholding the economy back more than necessary while at the same time making sure that the credibilityof our inflation target policy, which has taken so much effort to build up, is not lost.
BIS Review 128/19992However, there is another aspect of the American debate that has received much less attention than the“new economy”, but that I think is at least as important, and that is the role that monetary policy isassumed to have played in the favourable developments of the last twenty years. There is much talk inthe US about the “long boom”, i.e. the period lasting from the early-1980s to the present, which hasbeen characterised by a high rate of growth, with only one rather mild recession in 1990-91.There are various theories about the reasons for this positive trend. However, it is often assumed thatthe monetary policy pursued by the American central bank (“the Fed”) has played a decisive part. TheFed’s policy during the last twenty years differ from the policy in the preceding period in their moreactive and determined use of monetary policy to keep inflation low and stable. As a result, it has beenpossible to avoid both the overheating and the recessions that often occur when an overheatedeconomy suddenly comes to a halt. In other words, the Fed is credited with succeeding in makingrecessions fewer, smaller and shorter, mainly by ensuring that the economy does not becomeoverheated. It is important to point out that the favourable trend in the US economy during the lasttwenty years is not, as you might gather from following the Swedish debate, due to the Americancentral bank “leaning back” and basically letting the economy “take care of itself”. Quite the contrary,in fact.If we were to try to draw a lesson from all this that would be relevant to the Swedish context, it wouldmean that in future the Riksbank should try to avoid the great fluctuations in economic activity thatwere caused by the devaluation policy of the 1970s and 1980s. During those years there was a longsuccession of cost crises and exchange rates were adjusted so many times that in the end devaluationswere virtually accepted as a fact of life.Obviously, it is difficult to decide exactly how much interest rates should be increased in order toensure that the present surge in the economy does not lead to overheating, particularly since thecurrent monetary policy regime with declared inflation targets has never really been subjected to sucha test. We simply do not have any experience to fall back on. However, most people, including theExecutive Board of the Riksbank, agree that the current repo rate will have to be raised sooner or later,although opinions differ as to when and how much.Whatever the Riksbank decides to do, the main lesson of the long boom in the USA remains valid: along period of sound real economic growth is not necessarily the result of any exceptional externalevents, such as the emergence of a “new economy”. It is just as likely to be the result of a carefullyconceived monetary policy which applies an active and sometimes rather forceful policy to make sureHousehold sectors’ saving rate anddebt ratio in USA606570758085909510080828486889092949698-20246810Source: Ecowin
3BIS Review 128/1999that overheating - and subsequent deep recessions - are avoided. Naturally, a more detailedcomparison between the USA and Sweden would have taken into account other differences too, suchas the functioning of the labour market.The role of asset pricesI should like to devote the rest of my speech to another topical issue in the American debate, and thatis the actual and potential role of asset prices in monetary policy. The debate in the USA focuses onthe stock market, which many consider to have been overvalued for a long time, even if there has beena slight fall in the Dow Jones Index recently.The main question at issue seems to be if, and in that case how, a central bank should act when certainasset prices rise very sharply. Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Fed, has famously said that stockprices seem to be the result of “irrational exuberance”.Although the current discussion of the role of asset prices in monetary policy focuses mainly on thesituation in the USA, I think this issue is relevant to the Swedish debate too. For one thing, it is amatter of general interest and of principle, and for another there is no guarantee that, sooner or later,Swedish asset markets will not experience a situation similar to that in the USA today.How do fluctuations in asset prices affect the economy?One question of crucial importance in this connection is how fluctuations in asset prices affect the realeconomy. There are several different factors involved here. One mechanism is the wealth effect, whichGDP growth in USApercentage changeSource: Ecowin-3-2-101234707274767880828486889092949698-3-2-101234US Stock Market Prices050100150200250300350400450050100150200250300350400450Index: 1980-1989Index: 1970-1979Index: 1990-1999
BIS Review 128/19994means that households consume more since rising asset prices make them feel richer, and vice versa.Another factor - which many regard as at least as important - has to do with the interaction betweenthe credit market and companies’ balance sheets. When asset prices rise, the value of the collateral thathouseholds and enterprises can provide when they borrow for consumption and investment rises too.Higher assets make it easier for them to borrow, or to borrow at lower cost, as a result of whichaggregate demand increases. Large fluctuations in asset prices can have substantial effects on the realeconomy.Why should a central bank worry about the development of asset prices? One obvious reason is that itis natural for a central bank with a declared inflation target to follow asset price trends since, as I justmentioned, they can affect aggregate demand in the economy. And changes in demand in turnultimately affect inflation, as we all know.However, the discussion in recent years has mainly focused on another reason why the central bankmight want to keep an eye on asset price trends, and this is that the collapse of inflated asset marketscan have a serious impact on the real economy and in some cases eventually threaten the stability ofthe financial system. Apart from protecting monetary value, which is perhaps their best-knownfunction, it is also the task of central banks to promote financial stability, whether directly orindirectly. This is even suggested by the Swedish legislation, which lays down that the Riksbank shallseek to “promote a secure and effective payment system”.Dramatic events following the collapse of asset markets are usually assumed to be triggered by theconsequences in the credit market and company balance sheets. When asset prices rise more thaneconomic fundamentals justify, a fall in prices is inevitable sooner or later. Such an adjustment can bevery costly if financial institutions have widely accepted assets as collateral for loans during the periodof rising asset prices. When there is a sudden sharp fall in prices, the value of the collateral diminishes.In such a process falling asset prices can cause losses to banks and other financial intermediaries and,if the worst comes to the worst, a full-scale financial crisis. These problems can, moreover, beexacerbated by exchange rate fluctuations. In the crisis in Southeast Asia, which is the mostspectacular example of such a financial crisis in recent memory, the real value of foreign currencyloans often rose when domestic currencies depreciated sharply.This kind of dramatic event only occurs when asset prices rise higher than the levels justified byunderlying economic factors. This kind of situation in an asset market is what is known as a bubble.It might be worthwhile at this point to stop and reflect for a moment on the fundamental relationshipbetween monetary policy and asset markets, on the one hand, and product and commodity markets onthe other. The purpose of explicit inflation targeting policy that has been introduced in Sweden andmany other countries in the last decade is to address recurrent overheating in product and labourmarkets. It might be said - even if it is strictly speaking not quite correct - that the aim is to avoid the“bubbles” that tend to appear in these markets from time to time. Generally speaking, inflation targetshave hitherto proved their worth in this respect, and inflation targets appear today to constitute acredible basis - a nominal anchor - for price and wage formation. However, no corresponding anchorexists in asset markets. This means that there is nothing to prevent the prices of various assets rising tolevels higher than those justified by economic fundamentals owing to psychological factors, or“irrational exuberance” if you like. The fact that low inflation is not sufficient to achieve a moderateprice trend in asset markets is illustrated by the development of the American stock market in the lastfew years. Naturally, this represents something of a dilemma.What should central banks do?Does this mean, then, that monetary policy should, to a greater extent than hitherto, be used to takefirm action in response to rapid price increases in asset markets? There is no easy answer to thisquestion, but the predominant view nowadays is that the answer is no. Nevertheless, as adecision-maker I must keep my options open on this one. Situations may arise in the future that wecannot predict today in which monetary policy might have a role to play.
5BIS Review 128/1999Perhaps the main reason why it is normally not advisable to try to influence asset prices is that it isextremely difficult, if not impossible, to be sure when a bubble has formed and when rising prices aredue to improvements in underlying economic factors. The appropriate monetary policy must bedetermined by the fundamental causes of the rise in asset prices. Let us assume, for example, that arise in share prices reflects better prospects of higher future corporate profits as a result of fasterunderlying growth in productivity. In that case, the rise in prices is the result of an improvement infundamental economic factors, which means that it is based on “real”, rather than psychological,causes. That being so, monetary tightening would not be a very good move and might in fact becounterproductive, since future inflation would probably actually be lower as a result of higherproductive capacity in the economy due to the underlying growth in productivity.Another reason why it is not usually a good idea to use monetary policy to take action against rises inasset prices is that even if you do succeed in identifying a bubble, it is probably very hard to burst itwith such precision that you do not damage the financial markets and the rest of the economy in theprocess.Therefore, the general view nowadays is that central banks should not try to use interest rate policy tocontrol asset price trends by seeking to burst any bubbles that may form. The normal strategy is ratherto seek, firmly and with the help of a great variety of instruments, to restore stability on the fewoccasions when asset markets collapse.Inflation targets are an effective instrumentAccording to many observers, the kind of monetary policy regime with declared inflation targets thatis applied in Sweden and other countries is a suitable instrument for dealing with the problemsassociated with fluctuating asset prices. One reason for this is that setting inflation targets means thatmonetary policy automatically has a stabilising effect in the event of instability in asset markets. Sinceasset prices, as I have already mentioned, affect aggregate demand in the economy, interest rates willbe raised when asset prices rise and vice versa. Although we know from experience that there are noguarantees, this is likely for various reasons to have a stabilising effect on asset markets. For onething, macroeconomic stability in itself has a stabilising effect on financial markets. For another, thereis less likelihood of over-reaction, since participants in the financial markets will expect central banksto pursue a policy dictated by their inflation targets. Thirdly, lowering interest rates helps to mitigatethe imbalances that may occur as a result of rapid falls in asset prices. In addition, a credible inflationtarget allows monetary policy more room for manoeuvre when it comes to preventing a financialcrisis.However, a monetary policy strategy that waits until the market collapses before responding tochanges in asset prices may, at least hypothetically, pose a dilemma. The fact is that we still do notknow very much about how the incentives of players in asset markets are affected by such“asymmetrical” action on the part of a central bank, i.e. being largely passive while asset prices arerising and then acting forcefully when they fall. Perhaps the devaluation policy that was pursued inSweden in the 1970s and 1980s is a relevant parallel in this context. During that period expectationsabout the rate of inflation were determined by an economic policy which responded to excessive risesin prices and wages by devaluing the krona. According to one theory, similar mechanisms couldemerge in response to an asymmetrical policy vis-à-vis asset prices. If central banks took action tostop asset prices falling below a certain level, the players in financial markets might attach lessimportance to a rigorous analysis of economic fundamentals. The strategy of waiting for bubbles toburst by themselves might then establish a climate that actually encouraged bubbles. This must ofcourse be regarded as an unproven but interesting theory, and it certainly calls for a great deal morecareful thought.ConclusionIn my speech today I have dealt with some issues that at the moment are being debated particularly inthe USA. This is not due to a special interest in developments in the USA but because the conditions
BIS Review 128/19996under which monetary policy is pursued in the USA and Sweden are quite similar. Many of theproblems and issues that are being addressed there are also of interest here, or may be so in the future.Therefore I feel that we have something to learn from them.As I see it, one important lesson is that monetary policy, at least today, should take a greater interest inthe “long boom” than the “new economy”. In other words, I think that it is a wiser basic strategy toconcentrate on making sure that the economy does not overheat - which leads to recessions - than tocount on large hypothetical improvements in future productivity which, if they do not materialise, willinvolve loss of credibility and a drastic slowing down of the economy similar to those we have sooften witnessed in the last couple of decades.I have also discussed various aspects of fluctuations in asset prices. One encouraging conclusion that Ithink we can draw in this connection is that the present monetary policy framework in Sweden, withbuilt-in inflation targets, provides a reasonable basis for tackling any problems that may arise.
1BIS Review 128/1999Mr Welteke examines the extent to which markets need guidanceand in which specific areasStatement given by Mr Ernst Welteke, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the FrankfurtEuropean Banking Congress, held in Frankfurt on 19 November 1999.*      *      *ITo address the main question of this panel: yes, financial markets do need guidance. But this is not asufficient answer in itself. In a market economy the real question is the extent to which markets needguidance and in which specific areas? The differences which may exist in the three areas (accountingstandards, electronic money and the New Basel Accord) are mainly a consequence of differences inunderlying financial systems, but they are also the result of different traditions. The US financialsystem relies much more on capital market instruments than the European financial sectors. Theissuance of bonds and stocks listed on the stock exchange is a more widely used instrument in raisingcapital for enterprises. Market capitalisation of outstanding shares as a percentage of GDP amounts toabout 180% in the US, compared with 53% in Germany.Most European financial markets are based on bank/customer relationships focusing on the traditionalloan business. In Germany, for example, capital market financing (including shares) amounts to onlyabout 38% of total funds raised by enterprises (in the US this ratio is about 70%). As a consequence,securitisation is not as widespread in Europe as in the US, and both the depth of the European capitalmarkets and the volume of financial transactions cannot yet fully compete with the Anglo-Saxonmarkets. However, I expect that the euro will gain increasing importance and live up to its fullpotential as a transaction, reserve and investment currency. This should also contribute to a furthernarrowing of national financial markets’ roles and structures, and, on the whole, strengthen Europeancapital markets.IIWhat does this all mean for the issue of guidance for financial markets ?Let me start with a general principle which is widely accepted: regulations should provide aframework that best suits the specific market conditions. This means that regulations are a reflection ofmarket developments and structures and not a driving force for changing markets. Constraints onmarkets and developments are only justified where financial stability or issues of competition,protection of depositors and investors, or the functioning of the markets in a more general sense are atstake. As long as differences in financial market structures exist a detailed “one size fits all” approachwill not be fully compatible with the goal of creating or even improving the level playing field.However, it is also clear that the globalisation of financial markets and increased merger activity exertpressure on those markets to adapt, to become more and more integrated, and similar. Firstly, in termsof the kind of financial transactions which are considered “state of the art” and, secondly - this willtake more time - also in terms of market structures. Therefore, harmonisation as well as closecooperation between supervisors around the world are highly desirable. This is well understood andalready common practice, as is demonstrated by the multilateral cooperation in international forums.
BIS Review 128/19992IIILet me now turn to the three specific areas, addressed in the question.In the area of accounting, the G7 assigned the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC)the task of establishing a worldwide harmonised set of core accounting principles. I strongly supportthis initiative and very much hope that we move towards a true world standard on this basis. IAS(International Accounting Standards) should in my opinion be the requirement for a listing on allmajor stock exchanges of the globe. German legislation already allows banks to set up theirconsolidated accounts on the basis of the IAS.The IAS are currently reviewed by the Basel Committee, the IOSCO (regulators for securities firms)and the IAIS (regulators for insurance firms). Some differences of opinion still exist, especially on theissue of “fair value” accounting. The IASC obviously prefers “fair values” (which means marketvalues) for all financial instruments including the loan portfolio. The majority of regulators (includingGermany) favour such accounting only for instruments traded on financial markets. For tradedinstruments we can easily calculate “fair values” whereas this is much more difficult for assets andliabilities of the banking book. The European Commission has taken up this issue with the aim ofarriving at a common standard for IAS and the European accounting legislation.IVWith regard to the regulatory framework for e-money the US and Europe take a different approach. InEurope, the issuance of e-money will probably be regulated (although the relevant EU directive hasnot yet passed the European legislative process). Most European countries perceive a need for suchregulation in order to ensure sound market practices, to protect those who use e-money, and to takeadequate account of both systemic and monetary policy concerns. The envisaged rules will allow forenough freedom for the e-money business to evolve, and technological progress will not be hindered.The United States is taking more of a “wait and see” approach before they issue regulations fore-money. Nevertheless, I would not be concerned about possible competitive disadvantages for Europeresulting from the different speed of regulatory initiatives in this field. The reason is quite obvious:e-money should remain a national or European business for quite some time and transatlantic e-moneyservices may not evolve easily. In addition, the regulatory demands for e-money business should notpose a real constraint for well run e-money systems. Moreover, we must not miss the optimal point oftime for regulating e-money. Waiting for too long could mean that we end up with very divergentsystems in Europe. This in turn would make it extremely difficult to have a European passport andsingle market in this area. Against that background the envisaged European directive on e-money isexpected to improve market development.VThe third area you mentioned is the current review of the capital adequacy framework by the BaselCommittee. Naturally, differences of opinion exist. One prominent example, which has been citedvarious times in the press, is the use of external versus internal ratings for assessing the banks’ creditquality. With regard to the Basel Accord as such, aspects of competition may arise for both thebanking sector and non-banks, especially small and medium-sized companies. It is important that theBasel rules do not cause competitive disadvantages for countries or specific sectors of the economy.For this purpose, common European positions should be formulated wherever possible. Withoutprejudging the negotiations in Basel, there are good prospects that competitive distortions will beavoided by, for example, allowing the use of banks’ internal ratings.Considering the revision of the Basel Accord as a whole, there are still many details which have to beworked out and require our full attention. But, in essence, there seem to be fewer differences ofopinion than press reports sometimes suggest. Americans and Europeans alike favour a morerisk-based assessment of credit portfolios, the introduction of a supervisory review process to betterhighlight qualitative aspects of financial oversight, and the strengthening of transparency and market
3BIS Review 128/1999discipline. The recent financial crises in Asia should have revealed to all regulators (and, in myopinion, to the public at large) the need to promote financial stability worldwide.I am optimistic that the Basel Committee will resolve all outstanding issues by autumn 2000 andpropose a harmonised regulatory framework which will be appropriate for capital market-oriented aswell as bank-based financial systems. To close, let me underline that the new guidance we are givingto banks in the form of the revised Basel Accord should, to a large extent, reflect “sound marketpractises”. To obtain an optimum result, it is essential that banks contribute to this regulation byproviding technical input.
1BIS Review 127/1999Mr Alweendo discusses Namibia’s current exchange ratearrangement and its implications for the country’s monetary policyAnnual Speech 1999 given by Mr Tom K Alweendo, Governor of the Bank of Namibia, on17 November 1999.*      *      *IntroductionI would like to welcome you all to this first Annual Speech by the Governor of the Bank of Namibia.It is common in many countries that the Central Bank takes the opportunity once a year to inform themost important stakeholders of economic issues the Bank considers to be of particular importance.The intention is to also make this an annual event in Namibia.The Annual Speech shall not be a review of economic developments in Namibia and abroad; that youwill find in our Annual Reports. I will rather try to give the Central Bank’s views and outlook onselected topics. Today, I will mostly deal with Namibia’s exchange rate arrangement. From the outset,I would like to stress that there are no other reasons for this choice, other than the fact that it isimportant for many of our stakeholders to fully understand the current exchange rate arrangement. Theissues involved are many and complicated, and it is my intention to give a comprehensive overview ofthe current arrangement and its implications for monetary policy in Namibia.The CMA arrangementAs you all know, Namibia is a member of the Common Monetary Area (CMA). Within a monetaryarea, exchange rates between the participating countries are fixed and there are no paymentrestrictions. The CMA has many of the characteristics of a monetary union, as the exchange ratesvis-à-vis other member states are fixed and capital flows are free. As a consequence, interest rates andthe money supply cannot be directly influenced by the individual country. Monetary policy in such asystem is at best subordinated to exchange rate policy, as domestic credit creation must be kept withinlimits in order to ensure a sufficient volume of net foreign assets of the banking system. In monetaryunions there is usually also a high degree of policy coordination, which in my opinion could beimproved in the current CMA arrangement. This is an issue I will return to later.The formal agreementNamibia’s membership of the CMA was formalised by the accession to both the multilateralagreement with Lesotho, Swaziland and the Republic of South Africa in 1990 and a separate bilateralagreement with the Republic of South Africa in 1992. Two dominant features of this arrangement are:(1)a commitment by the Bank of Namibia to exchange the domestic currency for a specifiedamount of the reserve currency - the rand - “without restriction subject to a normal handlingcharge” at a fixed exchange rate; and(b)an explicit requirement that at least a major proportion of its monetary liabilities be backedby the reserve currency or other foreign assets. More specifically, Article 4, Section 1, of thebilateral monetary agreement  states that, and I quote:“Against the aggregate amount of Namibia dollar currency issued by the Bank of Namibia,the Bank of Namibia shall maintain a reserve equivalent thereto in the form of rand assetsand freely usable foreign currencies in such proportion as the Bank of Namibia considersappropriate…”.
BIS Review 127/19992In addition, the bilateral agreement also provides that either contracting party has the right to issue itsown national currency. It is also a part of the agreement that either party may introduce measures fordomestic resource mobilisation in the interest of the development of their respective countries.I will in particular draw your attention to two issues in the provisions cited above. First, there is underno circumstances room for changing the exchange rate, and second, the backing rules of the currencymust be observed at all times. These two characteristics remain both the source of strength as well asthe most limiting aspects of the present monetary arrangement. The fixed exchange rate and thebacking rule confer a degree of credibility that is usually not found in the conventional peggedexchange rate arrangements. However, we must also clearly state that this credibility is obtained at acost. In monetary policy decisions, as in most other aspects of life, there is “no free lunch”!The decision to join the CMA was influenced by the long economic relationship with South Africa,and was perceived as the most appropriate arrangement under the prevailing circumstances. The extentto which the country has benefited from this arrangement will depend on a careful assessment of itsmerits and constraints.Benefits of the CMA arrangementLet me start by first analysing the benefits.Price stabilityBy far one of the greatest benefits of a fixed exchange rate arrangement is that it provides pricestability in the domestic economy. It is now widely accepted that the main objective of the monetaryauthorities in most countries is to achieve price stability. By pegging the domestic currency to thecurrency of a low-inflation country, its ability to maintain price stability is enhanced, provided there isa strong commitment on the part of the authorities to maintain the exchange rate. The arrangementconstrains monetary expansion, restrains excessive government spending, and sends out crediblesignals to private agents about prospects for inflation. This is normally achieved when money growthin the peg currency country approximates that in the anchor currency country. The measured inflationrate may diverge because of the price of non-tradable goods, but in most cases they are cointegrated.In Namibia, the available evidence seems to support this conclusion. Since 1993 the domestic inflationrate has closely mirrored the prevailing rate in South Africa.CredibilityMany governments in developing and developed countries have for a number of reasons experienceddifficulties in making their policies generally credible. The credibility problem arises from the fact thatwhen the authorities announce a monetary policy objective in one period, they may have an incentiveto deviate from the policy in subsequent periods. This is so because private agents have formed theirexpectations and entered into wage and other contracts. There may be possibilities for government toengage in surprise monetary expansion, even if that was considered not to be the best long-termsolution. Another credibility problem arises from the fact that even if the current government ispursuing prudent macroeconomic policies, investors may fear future governments will not have thesame preferences. Changes in government can bring forward interest groups, whose demands forsubsidies could lead to a relaxation of fiscal policy.Acquiring a reputation for fiscal prudence in a longer-term perspective is a lengthy process. Therefore,tying governments hands by either creating a policy rule or delegating control of certain policyinstruments to an independent agent is a welcome arrangement, especially during the period when thecountry is passing through the learning curve and institutions are being put in place. Under thesecircumstances, membership of the CMA and the rule-based policies, such as the restrictions placed ongovernment borrowing from the Bank of Namibia, are instrumental in raising the government’scredibility and therefore making its policies time consistent. A time consistent policy is a policy thatwill be sustained as circumstances change over time. Time consistency bears the advantage of
3BIS Review 127/1999credibility because of the predictability of the future. It therefore reduces monetary disturbances andeliminates the doubts of the financial and real sector markets, thus creating a healthy and attractiveenvironment for investment and economic growth.Exchange rate fluctuationsAnother major advantage of the current arrangement is that it helps to avoid exchange rate fluctuationsand reduces the unfavourable effects of exchange rate uncertainty on trade and investment. As SouthAfrica is Namibia’s main trading partner, a major benefit of CMA membership for Namibia is theelimination of uncertainty associated with exchange rate variability. Since Namibia is a net importer ofgoods and services from South Africa, the benefits derived from CMA membership may in this respectbe large.The emphasis here is on exchange rate volatility, which is of a short-term nature and is not due to theflexibility of exchange rates by itself. Market determined exchange rates are prone to excess volatilitythat can be damaging to the real economy. Overshooting of the exchange rate could have some realnegative economic effects. The elimination of such fluctuations promotes economic stability. This isparticularly important given the volume of Namibian trade with South Africa. Overshooting of theexchange rate between countries doing little trade may not matter much, but between countriesengaged in substantial trade, it does. A stable exchange rate will ensure the stability of the prices oftraded goods and hence eliminate volatility - not only in the exchange rate - but also in wages andprices and hence enhance economic performance.The advantage here is derived from the benefits of a fixed exchange rate arrangement and thesuitability of the exchange rate as a nominal anchor.  But this goes beyond that. At independence in1990, the nation gained from this linkage to the rand as it ensured confidence in the fledging domesticfinancial system and the economy given its historical and trade association with South Africa.Reduction of transaction costsA related benefit is the reduction of transaction costs associated with the fixed exchange rate betweenthe Namibia dollar and the South African rand. Transactions costs include the spread between the buyand sell price, computed as the difference between the rate at which banks buy foreign currency andthe rates they charge for sales of foreign currency. Other costs involve the commission charges forengaging in foreign exchange transactions. The commission varies with the size of transactions, andthere are usually different rates for various forms of foreign currency transfers.The gains from the elimination of transaction costs are a function of trade flows between members of amonetary union. With high volumes of trade, the gains are substantial. Furthermore, if the country’sdirection of trade was highly diversified, fixing the exchange rate against the currency of only one ofthe trading partners would not eliminate all the transactions costs. Elimination of exchange rate risksremoves the hedging of exchange rates as an argument in a firm’s decisions regarding the geographicalconcentration of activities. It is difficult to arrive at precise estimates of the magnitude of savingsinvolved. For small economies that are highly dependent on international trade and investments, thesesavings could be substantial.This is the case for Namibia. Due to its membership of the CMA, Namibia saves on the transactioncosts involved in exchanging the Namibia dollar into the South African rand and the spread betweenrates charged for sales and purchases of foreign currency. This benefit is increased due to the fact thatthe rand is legal tender in Namibia and there are no costs involved in converting the Namibia dollarinto the South African rand. An estimated saving of 3.8% of GDP has been suggested in a previousstudy. Compared to an estimated saving of 0.5% of GNP from the common currency in the EU, themagnitude of this advantage for Namibia appears to be quite sizeable. This is to be understood giventhe fact that close to 90% of Namibian imports come from South Africa.
BIS Review 127/19994Access to financial marketsThough not the least important, a major benefit from the CMA arrangement is the free flow of capitalbetween the member countries. This provides wider access to financial markets and thus helps insatisfying extraordinary financial requirements for the infrastructural projects in the country. It is achallenge for the private sector in Namibia to make full use of this advantage.CostsAgainst these benefits of the CMA arrangement, we shall now consider the costs which can beassociated with the present system.Loss of autonomy in monetary policyBy far the most often discussed setback of the arrangement is the loss of autonomy in monetary policy.A major cost of CMA membership to Namibia is foregoing the use of a nominal exchange rate orinterest rate policy as an instrument of macroeconomic adjustment. The Central Bank cannot controlthe supply of money because the money supply is determined wholly by the balance of payments.With increased capital mobility, there exists limited scope for influencing the interest rate. These twoconditions also apply to any fixed but adjustable peg arrangement.The exchange rate is a key determinant of the balance of payments, and can serve as a nominal anchorfor the price level. Therefore, movements of exchange rates in response to balance of payments shocksaffects output and price stability. For instance, a country may experience faster growth in productivity,say in agriculture due to more abundant rainfall compared to other countries, or the discovery of newmines that bring in additional export revenues or save on imports. In such cases, a real appreciation ofthe exchange rate is called for. Under the present arrangement, the country cannot use the exchangerate as a policy tool to control the increase or decrease in the supply of money. This has often been asource of resentment against this exchange rate arrangement as economic management is taken out ofthe hands of the domestic monetary authorities.Related to this is the whole issue of the ability of the Namibian economy to absorb external shocks.Namibia is a highly open economy and - given its membership of the CMA - it can hardly useexchange rates or interest rates to mitigate the impact of external shocks. Namibia has had a number ofunfavourable shocks in the past 20 years. The cumulative net loss in income due to the terms of tradeshocks is estimated to have amounted to an average of 2.1% of GDP. The export earnings andinvestment were also negatively affected.From time to time a country could also suffer shocks that are specific to it. The inability of the countryto embark on appropriate and timely policies, through for instance the use of exchange rate policy, toescape such shocks creates a feeling of frustration. But there can also be a trade-off between monetarypolicy credibility and smooth economic adjustments promoted by the exchange rate. The question iswhether this trade-off exists in the case of Namibia and South Africa. Flexible exchange rates hasten acountry’s adjustment to country specific economic shocks by facilitating rapid changes in the terms oftrade. However, when two countries experience broadly similar economic shocks, changes - if any - inthe bilateral terms of trade may not significantly aid adjustments of specific economic shocks in anyone country.Moreover, if factors of production, particularly capital, are highly mobile, the use of the terms of tradeas an adjustment mechanism may prove to be inadequate. Finally, where the reserve currency countryis also the peg currency country’s major trading partner, as in the case of South Africa and Namibia,exchange rate flexibility as a policy tool becomes less effective.Stability of the rand as a reserve currencyThe issue of a choice of reserve currency is very crucial in deciding to peg the domestic currency.Among factors that may have determined the choice of the rand as a reserve currency are the direction
5BIS Review 127/1999of trade flows, the denomination of imports and exports, the deep financial market offered by SouthAfrica and the correlation among cyclical movements between the economy of Namibia and SouthAfrica. One other important consideration, which in recent times has become a source of deepconcern, is the stability in the value of the rand. South Africa has in recent years experienced rapiddeterioration of the rand: the Namibia dollar has depreciated in tandem with the rand, particularlyduring the financial crisis that engulfed South Africa in the early part of 1998. The exit by investorsfrom the emerging markets, South Africa included, led to a speculative attack on the rand. Thesubsequent depreciation affected the Namibia dollar. The response to the crisis by the South Africanmonetary authorities translated into high interest rates, which led to an increase in the cost ofborrowing.Generally, we would expect a depreciating rand to translate into increased exports for the Namibianeconomy as domestic goods become more competitive in the international markets. These benefitshave been limited as Namibian exports consist mainly of commodities whose prices are determined inthe international commodity markets.The answer to the question about the stability of the rand is not obvious. First, events since the crisisthat shook the rand in 1998 have proved the resilience of that currency as witnessed by the rapid rateof recovery of the South African economy and the present stability of the rand. Internationalexperiences tell us that most currencies undergo periods of strength and weaknesses. It is their abilityto survive such tremors that determine their relevance. Secondly, even if the Namibia dollar is notpegged to the rand, it would still have to occasionally undergo shocks that could lead to itsdepreciation like any other national currency. The fact that such depreciation cannot be translated towindfall gains for the economy has more to do with the export structure than the pegging to the rand.Persistence of capital outflowsOne other disadvantage of the present arrangement is the persistence of capital outflows in favour ofSouth Africa. Inter-country movement of labour is minimal, but market related net movements ofcapital tend to be one-sided in favour of South Africa. Among the CMA countries, South Africa hasby far the most sophisticated financial markets, suggesting that capital flows are likely to beconcentrated in that market to the detriment of the countries at the periphery, where financial marketsare still at the early stages of development.This, in turn, could hamper the development of financial markets in Namibia. For example, Namibianpension and portfolio funds are channelled to South Africa, which deprives the local economy ofinvestible funds and makes the regional disparities even worse. This, however, has to be balancedagainst the advantage of the pooling of risk and the availability of investment opportunities created bythe free flow of funds within the CMA, which eventually could also give depth to financial markets inNamibia. Moreover, a significant portion of Namibia’s foreign direct investment inflow has beencoming from South Africa, thus partly offsetting the outflows in the long-term funds. Further,Namibia’s savings continue to be in excess of the country’s present investment demand, implying thatefforts must be made to create investment opportunities in order to increase the level of investment.Here, the government and the private sector have a joint responsibility.Loss of seignorageJoining the CMA has also involved costs such as the loss of seignorage. The issue could be viewedfrom two perspectives.  In a growing economy, there is a need for individuals and businesses thatparticipate in economic activities to increase their holdings of financial balances for economictransactions. A part of these balances will be in the form of currencies issued by the Central Bank, forwhich the Central Bank pays no interest. Secondly, the government may “tax” existing real balancesby creating additional money and causing inflation. Inflation tax - as it is often called - is a kind offorced savings, which enables the government to acquire goods and services. In a number of countries,inflation tax revenue is an important part of government income.
BIS Review 127/19996As a member of the CMA, the scope for inflationary financing is limited. Based on our discussionsearlier, the ability to increase real balances in line with growing productivity, and hence generateseignorage, could be constrained by strict backing rules. The second aspect of seignorage payment hasto do with the payment to Namibia for the circulation of the rand in her territory. With the decline inthe circulation of the rand after the introduction of the Namibian national currency, the compensationderived by Namibia for the use of the rand has also contracted significantly. However, this secondfactor may not have contributed to the overall contraction in the earnings from seignorage.Nevertheless, the crucial question to ask here is whether inflation tax - or the benefits from earningseignorage - are significant enough to warrant foregoing the advantages of a stable financial system.Inflation tax has been a major source of financial instability in many countries since it constitutes a taxon the financial system.Lender of last resortOne principal criticism against the present arrangement, is that it limits the ability of the Bank ofNamibia to perform the role of “lender of last resort”. Though the system guarantees the convertibilityof domestic currency at a fixed exchange rate, and thus enhances monetary credibility, a guarantee ofthe convertibility of bank deposits is not explicitly dealt with in the formal agreement. As we all know,no country can fully protect itself from a banking crisis that could lead to substantial macroeconomicshocks. I do not intend to spend too much time on this argument for a number of reasons. There isnothing in the CMA arrangement that precludes the Bank of Namibia from undertaking an appropriatelender of last resort function should the need arise. All that is needed is an adjustment in its foreignreserve coverage beyond the current 100% minimum. Secondly, the Bank of Namibia Act specificallyempowers the Bank to undertake a lender of last resort function if there is a need for it. Third, a majorantidote for bank failures is an adequate prudential and supervisory arrangement. In the past few years,the Bank Supervision Department together with commercial banks have been engaged in standardisingprudential requirements. Commercial banks have also complied with these requirements. To us, this isa more relevant factor in the prevention of bank failures.Issues emerging from the present arrangementLet me now turn to a discussion of some broader economic issues that emerge in relation to the presentarrangement.Stability at the expense of developmentAn important question to be asked is whether the relative stability achieved through the currentexchange rate regime has been obtained at the expense of development.(a)Slower economic growth?It has been argued that this arrangement in ensuring price stability tends to constrain domestic growth.The arrangement can impose a contractionary bias to domestic money supply, as this may not expandin step with growing domestic production. The question we must ask is whether price stabilitynecessarily constrains long term economic growth. Strong empirical evidence abounds to show thatthe long-run trade-off between price stability and growth does not exist. On the contrary, increasingempirical evidence is emerging which suggests that a reduction in the rate of inflation is beneficial toeconomic growth. If it is the case that stable prices can help to generate a faster trend rate of economicgrowth, whatever short run costs a country may initially incur in attaining the objectives of pricestability, would have to be balanced against the long run benefits of economic growth.In a recent study, comparisons made on macroeconomic performance between countries with this kindof monetary arrangement and less extreme forms of exchange rate arrangements show that inflation isabout 4 percentage points lower in the former. On average, data from countries with this arrangementover a ten-year period show that these countries are growing faster than countries with either peggedor floating arrangements. It is true that an exchange rate arrangement alone could not have been
7BIS Review 127/1999responsible for the observed differential, but at the same time, the evidence does not lend credence tothe assertion that this exchange rate arrangement leads to sluggish growth.(b)Impediments to trade diversificationThere are, however, other aspects of this potential conflict between stability and development. In thisregard, I would like to draw on experiences from the Irish currency arrangement, which has strongsimilarities with our CMA arrangement. The Irish pound was introduced in 1927 at a one-for-oneparity with sterling and the arrangement lasted until Ireland decided to participate in the EuropeanMonetary Arrangement in 1979. Full convertibility with sterling was ensured and all notes issued wereto be backed 100% by a reserve consisting of gold and sterling balances.One consequence of the sterling link was that trade to a large extent was directed towards the sterlingarea. It has been argued that for this reason Ireland did not benefit from the “post-war dynamism” inEurope following the Second World War. Having the alternative to avoid the costs of currency riskand foreign exchange transaction, the Irish exporting enterprises were reluctant to establishing tradingrelationships with other markets in continental Europe and elsewhere. Because of the one-for-one link,trade with the sterling area involved no greater financial complexity than internal trade.The analogue to the Namibian situation is striking. As mentioned, Namibia is still importing close to90% from the CMA countries. The arrangement therefore requires vigilance and determination todiversify our pattern of trade and commerce.(c)Capacity buildingA similar argument can be made with regard to the financial system. The limited use of monetarypolicy instruments under the currency board arrangement and the use by the local banks of the Londonmoney market for their liquidity needs, were not conducive to the development of risk managementand trading skills in Ireland. The acquisition of such skills was largely delayed until the emergence ofa domestic money market in the early-1970s and of a foreign exchange market even later.Again, these are relevant points when analyzing the Namibian situation. One point that is oftenoverlooked by those arguing for an adoption of an independent monetary policy, is the issue ofpreparedness. The development of an active interbank market and secondary markets as well as localcapacity in liquidity forecasting and management is a pre-requisite for the successful implementationof monetary and exchange rate policy. This process requires active promotion and assistance by theCentral Bank. While some progress has been made in this direction by the consolidation ofgovernment bonds, the fine-tuning of reserve requirements and the introduction of a call accountfacility at the Bank of Namibia, more needs to be done to equip the bank to intervene in the domesticmoney market. The capacity of the Bank to formulate and implement appropriate and timely monetarypolicy measures also needs to be built up. The appropriate channel for the transmission of monetarypolicy has to be investigated. There is a need to examine carefully the choice of intermediate andultimate targets of monetary policy, and other operational variables that are appropriate to the localeconomy. Building adequate capacity to undertake the aforementioned functions in the bank takestime and effort. Thus, there is a need for caution in this regard until appropriate institutional capacityis put in place.(d)Regional cooperationThe experience of the 14 sub-Saharan African countries belonging to the CFA franc zone can providesome interesting lessons with regard to the benefits and shortcomings of regional cooperation in thearea of exchange rate management. Since 1948, these countries have made up a monetary union with afixed exchange rate against the French franc. The French Treasury guarantees the convertibility of theCFA franc into French franc, which is effectuated through the establishment by regional central banksof an operational account with the French Treasury with market related yields and charges.Initially, this arrangement appeared to work well. Following some 30 years of strong growth and lowinflation compared with other sub-Saharan African countries, the growth performance of the CFAfranc zone countries began to weaken from mid-1980, mainly due to a sharp deterioration of the terms
BIS Review 127/19998of trade. Moreover, fiscal imbalances and external public debt increased substantially in relation toGDP. These countries also experienced a major weakening of the soundness and financial position ofthe banking system.Against this background, a decision was made in January 1994 to devalue the CFA franc by 50% andto implement restrictive incomes and credit policies and a range of structural and institutional reforms.This policy package has contributed to a resumption of growth in real per capita incomes and areduction in inflation and fiscal imbalances. Despite the progress made since 1994, the CFA countriesare still struggling with heavy external debt burdens and their economies are suffering under structuralrigidities.A relevant question for us here is why these countries have not managed to take more advantage of thestability provided through the fixed exchange rate regime. One important limitation has been that until1994, the degree of economic and financial interaction and regional cooperation among the countriesof the CFA franc zone was relatively limited. There are surely many reasons for this, partly related tovarious administrative restrictions, different tax treatments and protectionist trade policies. But alsopolitical considerations, influenced by a perceived need to maintain special economic and politicallinks to France, appear to have dominated at the expense of regional economic considerations. After1994, efforts have been made to strengthen regional economic and monetary integration. The objectiveis to establish a common market based on a customs union and the harmonization of the tax system.Economic policy coordination through regional surveillance has also been put on the agenda.One overriding lesson I will draw from these experiences is that the current exchange rate regime canbe a basis for stability and economic growth. However, economic development does not followautomatically from this monetary policy arrangement.Consequences of inflation targeting in South AfricaAs monetary conditions in Namibia are so closely linked with those in South Africa, the conduct ofmonetary policy in that country is naturally of special interest to us. The adoption of a formal inflationtargeting framework for monetary policy is a move which the monetary authority and the financialcommunity in Namibia has to follow closely.First, it is important for us to understand what inflation targeting is all about. Under this system, aspecific target for inflation in the medium term is publicly announced. Inflation targeting is therefore amonetary policy framework that explicitly recognizes price stability as a medium-term objective. Withinflation targeting, monetary policy decisions are guided by expected future inflation relative to theannounced inflation target. This system has been adopted in a number of countries in recent years,replacing either a formal intermediate monetary target or an exchange rate target.Second, we have to ask ourselves whether the adoption of an inflation targeting system will have anyconsequences for monetary conditions in the CMA countries. One important reason given by theSouth African authorities for the change is that an explicit inflation targeting framework will be moretransparent than the previous framework. To the extent the inflation targeting system and the monetarypolicy decision-making process is perceived by market participants to be more transparent, this will bea positive development for the other CMA countries and for Namibia. This should reduce unwarrantedmarket reactions, which at times result in disruptive movements in exchange rates and interest rates,with negative consequences for trade and other economic activities.It is also important for us to note that the adoption of inflation targeting will not in any significant waychange the practical implementation of monetary policy. The main operational instrument willcontinue to be the repo mechanism and the Reserve Bank does not foresee any need to change theinstruments used today for the fine-tuning of the liquidity and interest rates in the South Africanmarket.There is, however, one possible consequence which we should be aware of and prepared for. In theeconomic literature on inflation targeting, a concern has been expressed that direct inflation targetingcould easily lead to excessive short-term - and even medium-term - fluctuation in the nominal (and
9BIS Review 127/1999real) exchange rate. This has been a common experience in inflation targeting countries. There aremany causes for the observed fluctuations in the exchange rates. In some countries strong fiscal andstructural policy adjustments have given a support to such changes, as well as portfolio shifts. In thecase of South Africa, the exchange rate is included as an important element in the macroeconomicmonetary policy model used by the Reserve Bank. Exchange rate changes come out as a result of thepolicy process and not as an independent objective.Greater nominal exchange rate changes, if these should materialize, is a concern for Namibia forreasons I already have touched upon. However, these consequences are not likely to be severe.Exchange rate fluctuations are nothing new to the financial and commercial community in Namibia. Itshould also be emphasized that an inflation target could in itself promote considerable stabilization ofthe nominal exchange rate. So far, experiences with inflation targeting regimes indicate that the largestfluctuations are prompted by a lack of credibility of the regime. As credibility improves, the exchangerate variability should generally be limited to normal fluctuations in the real exchange rate.International trends in exchange rate arrangementsAs we are entering a new decade, fixed exchange rate systems seem generally to be replaced withfloating exchange rates. The international foreign exchange market is now dominated by three majorcurrencies - the US dollar, the Yen and the euro - which are floating against each other. None of thesethree will have explicit inflation targets as the objective for monetary policy, but in practice theirorientation of monetary policy is one of implicit inflation targeting. In the US, for example, theFederal Reserve has made it very clear that it is its assessment of inflationary pressures and theoutlook for inflation that is the major determinant of any monetary policy adjustments. Although theEuropean Central Bank has adopted a system of monetary targeting, in practice the monetary policyregime resembles inflation targeting quite closely. It is more difficult to classify monetary policy inJapan, but the fact is that inflation has been brought down to very low levels. The trend amongindustrial countries and emerging economies appears to be the adoption of formal inflation targeting.Although it can hardly be characterised as a trend, some countries still adopt a pegging of theirexchange rate and groups of countries are opting for cooperation in a currency area or monetary union.Alternatives for NamibiaNamibia is indirectly linked to what appears to be the present norm in exchange rate arrangements.This is because the Namibia dollar is linked to the rand, which is floating and its fluctuations will inthe future be influenced by a monetary policy based on inflation targeting. If for some unknownreasons the present arrangement should be terminated some time in the future, the most relevantalternative would be that Namibia adopts a floating exchange rate of its own. It is the Bank ofNamibia’s view that the benefits of the present membership of the CMA outweigh the costs. A pegarrangement will also continue to remain the optimum as the country battles with an attempt to reducefiscal deficit. For the foreseeable future, therefore, Namibia should not take any initiatives to terminateits membership.But there is another alternative. The present arrangement should - to the extent possible - be managedin such a way that the stability is utilised in promoting the development of the national economy. Inmy opinion, Namibia would benefit from evolution of the CMA arrangement toward a full monetaryunion. As mentioned earlier, this would require a closer coordination of economic policy in thecurrency area.  Political structures would have to be established and made operational. The group ofcountries that comprise the CMA could be extended to include countries in our region with similareconomic structures and development priorities.I am fully aware that the realisation of this objective can only be achieved in a long-term perspective.In the meanwhile, Namibia’s benefits from the CMA arrangement could be increased by extendedconsultations between the member countries. For example, the adoption of the inflation targetingframework in South Africa would be a good occasion for extending the discussion on the framework
BIS Review 127/199910itself and, later, on the implementation of monetary policy in response to the monetary authorities’expectation of future inflation. Such extended consultations should not be limited to monetary matters,but apply to other areas of economic policies as well.In the end, the achievement of monetary union will require that countries in the region committhemselves to confront the process of solving conflicting national interests in a fair and democraticmanner. In order to reach a common objective of monetary stability and economic prosperity, aregional solution may also be the route to take for us here in Southern Africa.ConclusionIn conclusion, I hope that my explanation of this complex issue has raised your awareness of theproblems involved and given you a basis for further discussions. It is also my hope that thisexplanation will create a better understanding of the actions of the Bank of Namibia with regard tomonetary policy related matters.
1BIS Review 126/1999Bank of Japan’s November report ofrecent economic and financial developments1Bank of Japan, Communication 15 November 1999.*      *      *The Bank’s view2Japan’s economy, which had stopped deteriorating, is currently turning to improve, with exports andproduction increasing. However, clear signs of a self-sustained recovery in private demand have notyet been observed.With regard to final demand, business fixed investment has been on a downward trend, although thepace of its decline is slowing. Recovery in private consumption continues to be weak through lack ofnotable improvements in employment and income conditions. Housing investment has recently peakedout, and public investment seems to have stopped rising. Meanwhile, net exports (real exports minusreal imports) have increased further due to an upturn in overseas economies.Reflecting such developments in final demand and continued progress in inventory adjustment,industrial production is increasing. Additionally, corporate profits have started picking up. In thissituation, corporate sentiment continues to improve. Regarding the employment condition, there aresome indicators that suggest a slowdown of the decrease in the number of employees. The positivedevelopments in corporate profits and sentiment, however, have not necessarily stimulated businessactivities, because firms still strongly feel that they have excess capacity and employees and that theyshould reduce their debts to restore financial soundness. In addition, efforts by firms to reducepersonnel expenses have prolonged the severity of households’ income conditions.As for the outlook, improvements in the overall financial environment partly due to the monetaryeasing by the Bank, along with a series of economic measures taken by the government includingthose announced recently, are expected to continue underpinning the economy. Moreover, the positiveimpact on domestic production of the recovery of overseas economies, especially of Asian economies,is likely to continue for some time. By contrast, it is highly probable that housing investment willremain flat for the time being. In addition, under cautious sales outlook, firms are expected to continuecorporate restructuring to improve their profitability. Such restructuring is unavoidable to enhancemedium-term growth of the corporate sector and thereby that of the overall economy. In the short run,however, it reduces fixed investment, and also delays an improvement in employment and incomeconditions, thereby discouraging household expenditure. Moreover, it seems that the recentappreciation of the yen will have an adverse effect on corporate profits in the near term. Under suchcircumstances, it is still difficult to expect an immediate self-sustained recovery in private demand,even though an upturn in economic activities, such as production, is expected to give favorable effectsto corporate and household income gradually. Consequently, economic developments still requirecareful monitoring, although the economy is turning to improve. Further, it is important to promotestructural reform in order to encourage a recovery in private demand.With regard to prices, import prices are increasing somewhat due to the rise to date in internationalcommodity prices, such as crude oil prices. Domestic wholesale prices, notwithstanding the fall inprices of electric machinery, are flat due to an increase in prices of some products closely related to1This report was written based on data and information available when the Bank of Japan Monetary Policy Meeting washeld on 12 November 1999.2The Bank’s view on recent economic and financial developments, determined by the Policy Board at the Monetary PolicyMeeting held on 12 November as the basis of monetary policy decisions.
BIS Review 126/19992international commodities, such as those of petroleum products. Consumer prices remain unchanged.Corporate service prices are still falling slowly. As regards the movements of overall prices in thefuture, they are likely to be flat despite the continued fall in prices of some goods and services, as therise in crude oil prices to date will continue to be passed on to prices of other products for a while.However, substantial narrowing in the output gap led by a recovery in private demand is unlikely forthe time being, and wages continue to follow a declining trend. Thus, downward pressure on prices isexpected to remain.In the financial market, the overnight call rate has stayed at nearly zero, and financial institutions havebeen confident about the availability of overnight funds. The amount outstanding of funds in the callmoney market has remained generally stable since the middle of June.As for interest rates on term instruments, short-term rates maturing before the year-end have remainedat a historically low level. Meanwhile, rates maturing beyond the year-end are rising due to marketparticipants’ concern over the Year 2000 problem.The Japan premium has continued to be nearly zero for short-term transactions, but there remains asmall premium for transactions maturing beyond the year-end.Yields on long-term government bonds rose to around 1.9 per cent in late October. They declinedsomewhat thereafter and are presently moving between 1.7 and 1.8 per cent again. The yield spreadbetween private bonds (bank debentures and corporate bonds) and government bonds once stoppedcontracting. However, there has recently been a conspicuous narrowing in the spread, primarilybetween private bonds with relatively low credit ratings and government bonds.Stock prices, after having declined in October against the background of the weak tone in U.S. stockprices, rebounded reacting to the recovery in U.S. stock prices, and are currently moving around18,000-18,500 yen.In the foreign exchange market, the yen has recently been traded at around 104-107 yen to the U.S.dollar.With regard to corporate finance, private banks have basically retained their cautious lending attitude.However, constraint that had been caused by severe fund-raising conditions and insufficient capitalbase has eased considerably. Under these circumstances, major banks are gradually becoming moreactive in extending loans, while carefully evaluating the credit risks involved.However, credit demand for economic activities such as business fixed investment remains weak. Inaddition, some firms have been trying to reduce debts using their on-hand liquidity. As a result, creditdemand in the private sector has continued to be basically stagnant, and thus private banks’ lendinghas remained sluggish. Corporate bond issuance has been steady. Meanwhile, CP issuance has beenincreasing with the year-end approaching.The year-to-year growth rate of money stock (M2+CDs) has declined to 3.0-3.5 per cent mainly due tothe weakness in credit demand in the private sector.In this financial environment, credit conditions have eased somewhat.The following continue to warrant careful monitoring: how actively investors will take risks; how farprivate banks will ease their lending stance; and how these changes will affect economic activities.
1BIS Review 126/1999Mr McDonough focuses on issues related to hisresponsibilities as Chairman of the Basel Committee on Banking SupervisionRemarks by Mr William J McDonough, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal ReserveBank of New York, before the Foreign Policy Association Conference on Global Capital Markets anda New International Financial Architecture, held in New York on 17 November 1999.*      *      *I am delighted to take part this afternoon in the Foreign Policy Association’s conference on GlobalCapital Markets and a New International Financial Architecture. It is a special pleasure to be hereamong so many old friends and colleagues.In my remarks today, I will focus primarily on issues related to my responsibilities as Chairman of theBasel Committee on Banking Supervision. First, I’d like to give you a brief update on the Committee’sefforts to implement globally an agreement reached initially in September 1997 on Core Principles forEffective Banking Supervision. Second, I’ll describe the Committee’s work to promote improvementsin risk management, including some related lessons drawn from the LTCM episode. Third, I willdiscuss the Committee’s proposal for a new capital adequacy framework to replace the 1988 CapitalAccord and give you some idea of what on our timetable is going forward. Many of these efforts wereinitiated prior to the Russian financial collapse in the summer of 1998. There is no doubt, however,that all went into significantly higher gear thereafter.Let me turn first to updating you on the status of the Core Principles for Effective BankingSupervision. This is an initiative the Basel Committee embarked on in the mid-1990s in the belief thatthere was a need to foster more effective banking supervision throughout the global financial markets.In developing the Core Principles, the Committee sought to craft a document that would have thelegitimacy, quality, and flexibility to meet the needs of bank supervisors around the world. To thisend, the Committee made it a key point to consult broadly with other supervisors throughout thevarious stages of the project, particularly those from emerging market countries.The Core Principles document that resulted from this process brings together concisely in one place allof the fundamental elements needed to carry out effective banking supervision - a remarkableachievement in its own right. Equally important, in my view, the document also balances the desire toset high standards for supervisory practices with a pragmatic recognition that not all countries are inthe same stage of financial market development. As such, the Core Principles document is ofparticular importance for emerging market countries because it establishes a clear set of standardsagainst which each country’s current approaches and progress can be measured.I am convinced that the flexibility embodied in the Core Principles - combined with the valuablesubstantive guidance the principles provide - is the right model for achieving sustainableimprovements in financial market practices. The fact that a number of other international groups havein recent years also developed “core principles” in their respective areas of expertise confirms to methe value of the Basel Committee’s approach.Today, approximately 120 countries endorse the Core Principles. Just last month, I am pleased toreport, the Basel Committee, in cooperation with the IMF and the World Bank, produced a follow-upreport called the Core Principles Methodology. This follow-up report was initiated in response torequests from a number of countries for additional guidance on how to interpret and implement theCore Principles. What the methodology report does is to develop specific criteria to evaluate how theCore Principles are being implemented in individual countries. The new methodology provides twosets of criteria for each Core Principle. One set of criteria focuses on issues deemed essential for theminimum implementation of the Core Principles; the other focuses on those issues deemed torepresent “best practice.”
BIS Review 126/19992The IMF and the World Bank currently use this new methodology to assess the banking sectors inindividual countries. Looking ahead, the Basel Committee plans to bring together some time next yearsupervisors from emerging market countries and representatives from the IMF and World Bank todiscuss the lessons learned from this initiative. The projected meeting is part of the Basel Committee’songoing commitment to ensure that the Core Principles remain on point and relevant to bankingsupervisors worldwide.I must stress, however, that the most important efforts to implement the Core Principles continues tobe the job of the individual countries. Without the support and backing of national authorities tofollow through with the implementation of these principles, our broader efforts simply cannot beeffective.In this connection, the Basel Committee has long recognized the need for effective training andseminars for participants in the global bank supervision community. Over the years it has sponsorednumerous programs which have been beneficial in allowing supervisors from different countries toshare experiences and exchange ideas for improved practices. Building on its longstandingcommitment to these outreach efforts, the Basel Committee, together with the Bank for InternationalSettlements, jointly established the Financial Stability Institute in 1998. The Institute currentlyconducts leadership training targeted to supervisors in emerging market countries, facilitates technicalassistance in individual countries, and provides training on a regional basis.The Basel Committee also plays a key role in the Financial Stability Forum that was established by theG7 Finance Ministers and Governors in early 1999. Through the Forum, the Basel Committee is ableto share its experience in implementing the Core Principles with other organizations that haveembarked on similar initiatives, such as IOSCO, the International Organization of SecuritiesCommissions. More broadly, the Financial Stability Forum is coordinating an effort to improveawareness of and accessibility to training for regulators and supervisors worldwide.Turning to the Basel Committee’s efforts to promote improvements in risk management, let mecomment first on the work related to highly leveraged institutions. As I have discussed in othersettings, the LTCM episode and the proper supervisory response to it are fundamentally about twothings: leverage and good judgment. Leverage is an important part of our financial system and most ofthe time it plays a positive role in enhancing market liquidity and ensuring a more efficient allocationof resources. At times, however, financial institutions can go too far in extending credit. This is wherethe critical role of good judgment comes in. Let’s not forget that a banker’s two most importantdecisions are whom to do business with and how far that business relationship should be pursued.One of the fundamental aims of supervisors is to ensure that banks are using the right tools to makethese difficult decisions. These tools include risk measurement methods and risk managementtechniques that are appropriate to the nature of the risks involved.Following the LTCM episode, the Basel Committee put together a working group to focus on therelationship between banks and highly leveraged institutions. Our goal was to provide a framework foridentifying the broader issues raised by LTCM, the policy responses for supervisors, and the key riskmanagement challenges for the industry going forward.Under the leadership of Jan Brockmeijer of the Netherlands Bank, the Basel Committee’s report wascompleted in January 1999. It revealed a number of deficiencies in banks’ risk management practices.In particular, we observed an imbalance among the key elements of the credit risk managementprocess, with too strong an emphasis on the role of collateral to protect against credit loss. This undueemphasis caused many banks to neglect other critical elements of effective risk management,including in-depth credit analyses of counterparties, effective exposure measurement, and the use ofstress testing.To make sound credit decisions, banks need to obtain sufficient information about the borrower toprovide a comprehensive and timely picture of its risk profile and credit quality. This is true regardlessof whether the extension of credit occurs via a loan or through a counterparty trading relationship. Yetthe Basel Committee’s report found that banks did not obtain sufficient financial information to assessthe types and extent of risk assumed by large, highly leveraged institutions. In particular, banks did not
3BIS Review 126/1999obtain the information needed to assess leverage, risk concentrations in particular markets, or theliquidity risk profile of individual institutions.The Basel Committee report also concluded that banks should develop more effective measures ofpotential future exposure, which refers to the possibility that credit exposures can change over time asmarket conditions fluctuate. The ability to measure potential future exposure is critical when dealingwith large trading counterparties such as highly leveraged institutions, especially in volatile marketconditions. Unfortunately, methods for measuring potential future exposure have not kept pace withthe growth and composition of trading activity.The Basel Committee’s report also showed that banks must develop approaches that better account forcredit risk under distressed market conditions. A key lesson of the LTCM episode is that credit andmarket risk cannot be seen as completely distinct, but are liable to interact and reinforce each otherunder highly stressful conditions. The use of more rigorous stress testing, therefore, could have givenbanks better warning of the types of exposures they faced.Together with this January 1999 report, the Basel Committee issued a sound practices documentsetting forth guidance for banks and supervisors on these topics. For example, these sound practicescalled upon banks to:• establish clear policies governing their involvement with highly leveraged institutions;• adopt credit standards addressing the specific risks associated with these institutions;• establish meaningful measures of potential future exposure as well as credit limitsincorporating the results of stress testing; and• monitor exposure on a frequent basis.I am pleased to report that the Basel Committee’s recommendations on highly leveraged institutionshave been reinforced by the recommendations of subsequent efforts, including reports by thePresident’s Working Group on Financial Markets and the Counterparty Risk Management PolicyGroup. There is clearly widespread agreement among both the private sector and the officialcommunity about the steps that firms need to take to address the weaknesses in risk managementidentified in the LTCM episode. The key remaining issue is the strength of the private sector’s resolveto implement these measures.For its part, the supervisory community is carefully monitoring the efforts of banks to follow throughwith the implementation of improved risk management practices for highly leveraged institutions. TheBasel Committee intends to prepare a follow-up report on the progress banks are making. In my view,the degree of improvement will signal whether the industry has truly absorbed the lessons of theLTCM episode.The approach the Basel Committee has taken with respect to highly leveraged institutions mirrors itsefforts in addressing other risk management issues. A primary aim of the Committee is to describe andpromote prudent risk assessment and control practices by banks. By setting out the current state of theart in key areas, the Committee provides banks and their supervisors worldwide with the tools tomeasure industry progress toward the goal of effective risk management.In recent years, the Basel Committee has engaged in a sustained effort to develop and publicize soundpractices in a variety of areas. These have included papers on such topics as:• the management of credit risk;• loan accounting and credit risk disclosure;• guidance for managing foreign exchange settlement risk;• enhancing corporate governance in banking organizations;• a framework for internal control systems in banking organizations;• operational risk management; and
BIS Review 126/19994• risk management for electronic banking and electronic money activities.For anyone interested, the details of these reports are available on the website of the BIS.Before turning to capital adequacy issues, I would like to highlight some key elements from two recentpapers on sound practice. In July, the Basel Committee issued for comment a report on themanagement of credit risk. This is a particularly important topic since the major cause of seriousbanking problems continues to be directly related to poor practices regarding credit risk management.A key focus of the report is on the need for banking organizations to develop an overall businessstrategy for credit risk that incorporates the tolerance for risk and the level of profitability the bankexpects to achieve from incurring various credit risks. A strategic approach to credit risk provides acoherent framework for practices in such areas as credit-granting criteria, credit limits, and credit riskmonitoring.The Basel Committee issued a second paper in September that addresses the subject of corporategovernance in banking organizations. As you know, corporate governance, especially the role ofboards of directors, is of particular interest in this country. More intense competition, rapid change,and increased complexity in many business activities mean that responsible and independent oversightby boards of directors plays a more crucial role in ensuring that the firm’s business strategy is soundand its leadership effective.I am convinced that the need for strong corporate governance is equally great in emerging marketcountries, where banks and other financial institutions face comparable pressures. The BaselCommittee’s September paper outlines several elements that are critical to a sound corporategovernance process. These elements include the installation of qualified boards of directors withclearly defined responsibilities, the importance of oversight by directors and senior management, theneed for clear lines of management responsibility and accountability, and the effective use of internaland external auditors.Both the July and September reports provide a flavor of the Basel Committee’s efforts to promotestronger risk management practices within the global banking community. Although these effortssometimes receive less public attention than our work on capital adequacy, I believe that they playsignificant roles in helping to set standards for prudent risk-taking that can be used by banks and theirsupervisors worldwide.Lastly, I would like to update you on the Basel Committee’s major effort to revise the 1988 CapitalAccord. In June, the Committee released a Consultative Paper laying out our vision for a new capitaladequacy framework. Our proposed timetable is to seek comments from both supervisors and industryparticipants through 31 March 2000 and then to publish, hopefully by late next year, a comprehensiveset of proposals which are responsive to the comments and industry input we have received.During the comment period, the Committee and its subgroups are working hard to refine and furtherdevelop a number of the proposals put forth in the consultative document. The Committee alsocontinues to consult actively with banking industry representatives and organizations through holdingseminars, inviting presentations at working meetings, and conducting surveys on various topics.The Consultative Paper represents an evolution in the Basel Committee’s approach to capitaladequacy. In addition to establishing minimum capital requirements, the paper places an increasedemphasis on the supervisory review of capital adequacy and the role of market discipline. We refer tothese elements as the “three pillars” of our proposed capital adequacy framework, which togetherpromote safety and soundness. This evolution in the Committee’s thinking about capital follows frommuch of our recent work on risk management and the surveys we have conducted on banks’ disclosurepractices.In our view, the three pillars to assess capital adequacy are mutually reinforcing, each addressing thechallenge of aligning capital relative to risk in banking organizations somewhat differently. TheCommittee’s belief is that by combining the approaches of the three pillars, we can better achieve ouroverall objective of ensuring an adequate capital cushion across the banking system that at the sametime recognizes and encourages prudent risk management.
5BIS Review 126/1999Let me highlight briefly each of the three pillars and provide some perspective on the key challengesthat the Committee faces in relation to each. The first pillar has to do with minimum capitalrequirements. The 1988 Capital Accord allowed supervisors in the G10 countries for the first time touse a common yardstick for measuring the capital adequacy of banks. While the 1988 Accord was amilestone achievement, its simple risk-weighting scheme has had difficulty incorporating innovationsin the way banks today manage and mitigate credit risks.More fundamentally, the 1988 Accord does not adequately differentiate among degrees of credit risk.As a result, banks have had incentives to take on higher risk exposures within each of the Accord’sbroad risk categories. Banks have also tended to engage in transactions that lower capital requirementswithout reducing economic risk. The effect of these developments has been to erode the significanceof the Basel ratios as an indicator of a financial institution’s capital adequacy, particularly for thelarge, internationally active institutions which were the original targets of the Accord.To address these shortcomings in the 1988 Accord, the Basel Committee proposes two primaryapproaches: (1) a standardized approach that ties risk weightings to external credit assessments such ascredit ratings, and (2) an internal ratings-based approach that would begin by mapping internal riskratings into standardized risk weightings but might eventually evolve into something closer to the fulluse of credit risk models. Each approach treats the trade-off between simplicity versus accuracysomewhat differently and thus one or the other is likely to be relevant to banks with different levels ofsophistication.Importantly, both proposed approaches attempt to introduce greater risk sensitivity into the minimumcapital standards. In my view, it is essential that we move forward in this fashion in order to enhancethe responsiveness of required capital to risk and to address the unfortunate incentive problems thathave evolved from the 1988 Accord.Because of the Committee’s desire to produce a capital adequacy framework with a greater sensitivityto risk, some observers may note that we inevitably introduce a dynamic element into our standards.That is, the capital requirements for loans to troubled borrowers will tend to increase at just the pointwhen such trouble is becoming apparent. I see an important positive aspect to such an outcome.I would argue that the global financial system needs to become better prepared to address potentialcredit problems pre-emptively, before these problems have time to grow from minor disturbances intomajor disruptions. Implementing capital standards that are more responsive to the dynamics of riskcould help move us in this direction and away from a mindset that waits too long to address problems.In particular, the Committee is interested in hearing views on how we should think about these issues.The second pillar in the proposed new capital adequacy framework has to do with the supervisoryreview of capital, a critical complement to minimum capital requirements. The Consultative Papercalls on supervisors to ensure that each bank has sound internal processes in place to assess theadequacy of its capital based on a thorough evaluation of its risks and capital structure, thus movingthe Accord beyond a ratio-driven minimum capital standard to a comprehensive approach forassessing capital adequacy. In general, supervisors have expected and continue to expect banks to holdmore than the regulatory minimum amount of capital. In proposing this supervisory review of capital,the Basel Committee intends to foster a more active dialogue between banks and their supervisors withrespect to the actual level of capital banks choose to hold.I want to stress, however, that this proposed approach to assessing capital adequacy in no way intendsto replace the judgment and expertise of bank management. Nor is this approach meant to shiftultimate responsibility for the adequacy of bank capital to the supervisors. On the contrary, I believethat managers are the ones with the most complete understanding of the risks that their institutionsface and it is they who must have the primary responsibility for overseeing these risks.The task for supervisors in this framework is to evaluate how well banks are assessing their owncapital needs relative to their risks, including whether banks are appropriately addressing therelationship between different types of risks. To this end, the Basel Committee is currently developingguidance to help supervisors evaluate internal capital assessments conducted by banks. In the event
BIS Review 126/19996that a bank’s internal capital adequacy process is lacking, supervisors must have the knowledge andauthority to take corrective action.There can be no doubt that implementing the supervisory review of capital will require considerableinsight and flexibility on the part of supervisors because they will have to tailor their efforts to theunique risk profiles of particular institutions. At the same time, this approach should allow supervisorsto draw on their cross-institutional knowledge as they assess the strengths and weaknesses of a bank’srisk management and capital allocation processes relative to those of its peers.The G10 supervisors recognize the obvious implications that this approach will have for supervisoryresources. In order to keep pace with industry innovation, it is clear that we will have to step up ourtraining and consider effective ways for making the most use of our limited resources. The BaselCommittee also recognizes the importance of these issues for the non-G10 countries and is workingtoward providing the training and other types of support needed to allow these countries and theirsupervisors to move in this direction.The third element in the proposed new capital adequacy framework has to do with market discipline- another critical component of a safer and more stable financial system. More extensive disclosureand greater dependence on market forces complement improvements in risk management, bankingsupervision, and minimum capital standards. Of course, to add value over and above the minimumcapital standards, improved disclosure must go beyond the simple reporting of minimum capital ratios.When banks disclose timely and accurate information about their capital structure and risk exposures,market participants can better evaluate risks and act accordingly. The disclosure of timely and accurateinformation, in turn, is an incentive for banks to ensure that the market perceives them not only aseffectively managing their risks, but also as being adequately capitalized. Market reactions to thepublic disclosures of banks can also play an important signaling role for supervisors in assessing theadequacy of a bank’s capital.A further reason to encourage disclosure beyond the reporting of regulatory capital ratios is that theseratios have become the primary focal point for investors and industry analysts. The result has been thatbank managements have had an incentive to focus solely on improvements in these ratios, even whenthe ratios are not fully reflective of risks. More comprehensive disclosure could lessen this incentive.With these considerations in mind, the Basel Committee is seeking to design an expanded set ofdisclosure guidelines, taking into account the proprietary information needs of banks. I believe thatfuller disclosure for all banks can take us a long way towards effective market discipline. We alsoencourage banks to include in their fuller disclosures information specific to their risk profile.The timeliness and the quality of disclosure are important. The frequency of disclosure should reflectthe nature of the risks involved. Moreover, as transactions that shift risk become more common andcomplex, disclosing the associated residual exposures takes on added importance. Such reporting, inturn, requires that banks have in place the appropriate systems to identify and measure these risks sothat the risks can be documented for the marketplace. Finally, as we move toward improveddisclosure, we must keep in mind that the goal is useful and reliable information - not simply a largevolume of information. More is not necessarily better.In the area of disclosure, I should also mention that my colleague, Peter Fisher, is chairing aMultidisciplinary Working Group on Enhanced Disclosure, comprised of representatives from thebanking, securities, and insurance industries in a pilot effort to formulate a set of public disclosureguidelines that make sense for an increasingly integrated financial market. The working group willassess the extent to which the pilot data can provide a meaningful basis for comparing riskmanagement practices as well as the level and types of risk across institutions and across countries.The Basel Committee supports this pilot approach. It limits the burden on the banking industry and atthe same time makes clear that the private sector has a key role to play in improving disclosure andenhancing market discipline. Firms participating in this program will have the opportunity to shape theexercise and influence the interpretation of its results. Through their participation, these firms will besending a clear signal about their willingness to improve market discipline.
7BIS Review 126/1999These have not been easy times for banks. As a regulator, I cannot help but underscore the essentialrole banks play in the global marketplace. By intermediating credit between savers and investors andproviding liquidity to the financial sector, banks are the essential link in well-functioning economies.Thus, while capital levels and risk management policies are without question important, they do nottake precedence over the responsibilities of bankers to serve their purpose in a Schumpeterian world ofcreative destruction. This most fundamental of responsibilities involves the use of credit judgment. Bythis I mean that bankers must not lend to excess when times seem good and then lend too little whentimes appear more difficult. This is an ongoing obligation of banks and is no less so as we approachthe century date change.With roughly six weeks to go before year-end, I believe it critical that banks approach the new yearwith these thoughts in mind and I call on them to be attentive to providing for their customers’reasonable needs. By reasonable needs, I have in mind that banks should think twice about hugedemands based on what seems to be customers’ excessive concern about Y2K, but grant appropriatecredit for realistic needs, even if this involves somewhat greater use of their own balance sheets thanwould usually be the case.To aid in the year-end transition period, the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Reserve Bank ofNew York have announced a variety of steps to assure adequate liquidity in wholesale markets andpromote financial market stability. We approved last month an expanded range of acceptable collateralfor discount window and payments system risk purposes. In addition, there are in place a number ofmeasures to ensure that an ample supply of cash will be available to meet possible increases in thedemand for cash over the transition period. Further, the Federal Reserve created a century date changeSpecial Liquidity Facility for lending to depository institutions from 1 October 1999 through7 April 2000. Among other things, this facility should help institutions to commit more confidently tosupplying loans to other financial institutions and businesses through the rollover period.Finally, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York announced a number of measures in early Septemberintended by the Federal Open Market Committee to promote the smooth functioning of money andfinancing markets and to gain greater assurance that we will be able to manage banking systemreserves during the century date change. The measures include the expansion of collateral accepted inrepurchase transactions, the extension of the maximum term of the Bank’s repurchase transactions to90 days, and the introduction of a Standby Financing Facility.The next several weeks will be a challenging period, for private and public sector participants alike.By working together in the short term to ensure a smooth transition and over the longer term toimprove risk management practices for banks and develop a meaningful international capital adequacyframework, I am confident that we can be successful in not only preserving, but also enhancing, ourglobal financial system as we enter the next century.
1BIS Review 125/1999Mr Repse gives a short speech onmonetary policy in Latvia and exchange rate strategiesSpeech given by Mr Einars Repse, Governor of the Bank of Latvia, at the ECB Seminar on theAccession Process, held in Helsinki on 11 November 1999.*      *      *Ladies and Gentlemen,Accession to the European Union (EU) is a strategic aim of Latvia, and we see joining the EuropeanMonetary Union (EMU) as an integral part of this process. We strongly hope that the EuropeanCouncil will accept the Commission’s recommendations and a decision will be made to commenceaccession negotiations with Latvia in year 2000. The Bank of Latvia will be well prepared for thesenegotiations, as we have already established our status and policies with a perspective of futuremembership in the EU.The Bank of Latvia enjoys a high degree of independence, fully compatible with the requirements ofthe EMU. Price stability is clearly defined as the main objective of the Bank of Latvia, and itsmonetary policy instruments and procedures largely correspond to the monetary policy frameworkused within the European System of Central Banks. And we are implementing a very conservativemonetary policy, which, as we believe, is in line with the policy principles of the European CentralBank (ECB).Since 1993, Latvia has been using the exchange rate based stabilisation programme. In February 1994,the Bank of Latvia pegged the national currency to the SDR basket. We based our decision on thebelief that a fixed exchange rate regime, if it is durable and credible, reduces uncertainty, eliminatescurrency risk and provides businesses with a sound basis for planning and pricing. It fostersinvestment and international trade, which are of a particular importance for the restructuring of asmall, open economy like Latvia.The Bank of Latvia has indeed ensured that the exchange rate arrangement is credible and durable, andthe Latvian economy has benefited from the stability. Inflation has declined to a level consistentlybelow 3%, there has been considerable growth in exports, especially to the EU countries, and it hascontributed to the strong GDP growth over the last years. The achieved macroeconomic stabilityallows us to set the target of fulfilling the nominal convergence criteria at the time of Latvia’saccession to the EU.Pegging the national currency to the SDR rather than to a single currency, the Bank of Latvia hasmade the lats fluctuate less against any individual currency than it would otherwise. Furthermore, thestructure of Latvian foreign trade by settlement currencies largely corresponds to the composition ofthe SDR basket, thus providing extra rationale for the current peg.To sustain the current exchange rate regime, the Bank of Latvia intervenes in the foreign exchangemarket by selling or buying the national currency at a predetermined exchange rate, thus acting in aclose analogy with the currency board arrangement. We are also in line with another important featureof the currency board: Latvia’s monetary base is permanently covered by Bank of Latvia’s net foreignreserves at more than 100%. At the same time, the Bank of Latvia is not bound by the legal andinstitutional restrictions of the currency board arrangements. As a full-fledged central bank we flexiblymanage liquidity in the banking system by steering short-term interest rates. The current exchange ratearrangement has allowed us to develop the full set of market-based monetary instruments andoperational practices.In our opinion, the present exchange rate regime is the best option for Latvia on our way towards themembership in the EU and the EMU. Therefore we intend to maintain the existing peg to the SDRuntil the accession to the EU.
BIS Review 125/19992We are aware of the currency stability requirement as set out in the Maastricht Treaty and the Protocolon the convergence criteria. It is our understanding that the current interpretation of said criterionprescribes mandatory participation of the new Member States, including those with a fixed exchangerate regime, in the ERM II before the eventual adoption of the euro. This requirement does notrepresent any difficulty for Latvia. Due to its peg to the SDR, exchange rate fluctuations of the latsagainst the ECU (and later against the euro) have not exceeded 10% in either direction for the last sixyears. In effect, we are already observing the required fluctuation margins without a formalparticipation in the Exchange Rate Mechanism. The Bank of Latvia is strongly committed to ensurestability of the national currency also in the future, so formal participation in the ERM II will hardlyaffect our daily operations.Let me conclude by saying that we highly appreciate the opportunity provided by the ECB toexchange opinions on the challenges the candidate countries will be facing in the coming years. Welook forward to increased cooperation with the Eurosystem and individual central banks of theEU countries.
1BIS Review 137/1999Bank of Japan’s December report ofrecent economic and financial developments1Bank of Japan, Communication 21 December 1999.*      *      *The Bank’s View2Japan’s economy, which had stopped deteriorating, has recently started to improve, with exports andproduction increasing. The economic environment surrounding private demand is graduallyimproving, as seen in the continuing increase in corporate profits. However, clear signs of a self-sustained recovery in private demand have not been observed yet.With regard to final demand, housing investment has recently peaked out, and public investmentseems to have stopped rising. Recovery in private consumption continues to be weak through lack ofnotable improvements in employment and income conditions. Business fixed investment, which hadbeen on a downward trend, shows signs of leveling off. Meanwhile, net exports (real exports minusreal imports) continue to expand due to an upturn in overseas economies.Reflecting such developments in final demand and continued progress in inventory adjustment,industrial production remains on an uptrend and an increase in corporate profits is becoming distinct.In this situation, corporate sentiment continues to improve. Regarding the employment condition,there are some indicators that suggest a slowdown of decrease in the number of employees. Thepositive developments in corporate profits and sentiment, however, have not necessarily stimulatedbusiness activities, because firms still strongly feel that they have excess capacity and employees andthat they should reduce their debts to restore financial soundness. In addition, efforts by firms toreduce personnel expenses have prolonged the severity of households’ income conditions.As for the outlook, improvements in the overall financial environment partly due to the monetaryeasing by the Bank, along with a series of economic measures taken by the government, are expectedto continue underpinning the economy. Moreover, the positive impact on domestic production of therecovery of overseas economies, especially of Asian economies, is likely to continue for some timeand have favorable effects on corporate profits and then on household income. By contrast, it is highlyprobable that housing investment will remain flat for the time being. In addition, firms are expected tomaintain a cautious stance toward business fixed investment based on their modest prospects for sales,although corporate restructuring is improving profitability to some extent. Moreover, it seems that theappreciation of the yen since the summer will have an adverse effect on corporate profits in the nearterm. In these circumstances, future economic developments still require careful monitoring in spite ofthe gradual recovery in the environment for private demand. Furthermore, it is important to promotestructural reform in order to facilitate a recovery in private demand.With regard to prices, import prices are declining somewhat due to the appreciation of the yen.Domestic wholesale prices, notwithstanding the fall in prices of electric machinery, are flat mainly dueto the rise in prices of petroleum and chemical products reflecting an increase in crude oil prices.Consumer prices remain unchanged. Corporate service prices are still falling slowly. As for theoutlook, overall prices are likely to be flat for the time being despite the continued fall expected in1This report was written based on data and information available when the Bank of Japan Monetary Policy Meeting washeld on December 17, 1999.2The Bank’s view on recent economic and financial developments, determined by the Policy Board at the Monetary PolicyMeeting held on December 17 as the basis of monetary policy decisions.
BIS Review 137/19992prices of some machinery. This is because the supply-demand balance is improving gradually, asshown in the decline in inventories, and because the rise in crude oil prices to date will continue to bepassed on to prices of other products for a while. However, attention should still be paid to thedownward pressure on prices, as clear signs of a self-sustained recovery in private demand have notyet been observed and wages continue to fall.In the financial market, the overnight call rate has stayed at nearly zero, and financial institutions havebeen confident about the availability of overnight funds. The amount outstanding of funds in the callmoney market has increased slightly as transactions are becoming active with the year-endapproaching.As for interest rates on term instruments, rates maturing beyond the year-end rose until the beginningof December mainly due to the influence of the Year 2000 problem, but plunged subsequently asfinancial institutions made progress in securing year-end funds amid ample funds provision by theBank of Japan.The Japan premium has almost disappeared even for transactions maturing beyond the year-end.Yields on long-term government bonds rose slightly to nearly 1.9 percent from the middle of to lateNovember reflecting improved confidence in the economy, but then fell back due to the yen’sappreciation and other factors, and are presently ranging between 1.70-1.75 percent. The yield spreadbetween private bonds (bank debentures and corporate bonds) and government bonds continuesnarrowing, primarily that between private bonds with relatively low credit ratings and governmentbonds.Stock prices, after rising in November against the background of improved confidence in the economyand firmness of U.S. stock prices, weakened slightly due to the strengthening of the yen and otherfactors, and are currently moving around 18,000-18,500 yen.In the foreign exchange market, the yen appreciated further against the U.S. dollar in late November,and is recently been traded in the range of 102-104 yen.With regard to corporate finance, private banks have basically retained their cautious lending attitude.However, constraint that had been caused by severe fund-raising conditions and insufficient capitalbase has eased considerably. Under these circumstances, major banks are gradually becoming moreactive in extending loans, while carefully evaluating the credit risks involved.However, credit demand for economic activities such as business fixed investment remains weak. Inaddition, some firms have been trying to reduce debts using their on-hand liquidity. As a result, creditdemand in the private sector has continued to be basically stagnant, and thus private banks’ lendinghas remained sluggish. Corporate bond issuance has been steady. Meanwhile, CP issuance isincreasing with the year-end approaching.The growth of money stock (M2+CDs) has slowed somewhat mainly due to the weakness in creditdemand in the private sector.In this financial environment, the financial position of firms is easing, and the lending attitude offinancial institutions as perceived by firms is becoming less severe. It continues to warrant carefulmonitoring how these favorable developments in corporate financing environment will affecteconomic activities.
1BIS Review 137/1999Mr Bäckström discusses the prospects for the Swedish economyon the threshold of the new millenniumSpeech given by Mr Urban Bäckström, Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank and Chairman of the Boardof Directors and President of the Bank for International Settlements, at the Umeå School of Economicsand Business Administration on 3 December 1999.*      *      *First a word of thanks for the invitation to Umeå to discuss the prospects for the Swedish economy onthe threshold of the new millennium.In an economic perspective, the last century of this millennium appears to be unique. The dramaticimprovement in prosperity and living standards that has taken place during the 20th century isunparalleled in the history of our country. As recently as the 19th century, Sweden was poor, perhapseven one of the poorest European countries.History teaches us that material prosperity can never be taken for granted. Countries and areas cansuddenly rise up and become culturally and materially prominent only to subsequently fall back againinto poverty. There are examples of this in the present millennium as well as in those preceeding it.Economic growth is not just a matter of the usual economic aspects, i.e. accumulation of real capitaland population increase. There are cases where countries with a high rate of capital investment andrelatively high population growth have failed to transform this into rapidly increasing materialprosperity. The former planned economies are clear examples of this.Something more is evidently required. There are interesting lessons to be drawn here and challengesfor the new millennium. Let me first briefly describe the last century of this millennium in economicterms. This can provide a good perspective for assessments of our future economic prospects.The 20th century was a fantastic century in many respectsIn many respects, the 20th century has been a fantastic century in Sweden. The standard of living -measured as GDP per inhabitant - has risen almost ninefold in a hundred years. Total production,GDP, has increased almost twenty times, while the population has doubled. This can be comparedwith the 19th century when the standard of living only doubled or at most tripled - the lack of statisticsmakes it difficult to be more exact.During the 20th century, annual GDP growth has averaged around 3%, though the increase inproduction has been far from evenly distributed over time. In the 1920s, as well as in the post-waryears from the 1940s to the 1960s, growth was above the average for the century.Towards the end of the century, however, the annual increases in production slackened. Growthbecame increasingly weak during the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. The average growth rate for the 1990sis in fact the worst in the entire century. However, the average for this decade is pulled down by thenegative growth from 1990 to 1993. From 1994 onwards, the growth rate has returned to the previousaverage and the annual change is close to 3%. Hopefully, the weaker trend during the period thatbegan in the early 1970s has been reversed in the past few years. However, this cannot be taken forgranted. One explanation for the recent stronger growth is that the deep recession left a reserve ofunutilised resources that could gradually be taken into use. Nevertheless, potential GDP growth is nowoften said to be between 2% and 2.5%, since most analysts consider that the productivity trend hasimproved slightly in recent years.

In 1820 it totalled2.6 million; at the beginning of the 20th century, it was almost 5 million, and the figure today is almost9 million.2.

GDP-growth during the20th centuryAnnual average per decadeAverage 3%
3BIS Review 137/1999These figures mean an average annual population growth rate of around 0.7%. That is not the casetoday; the current figure is closer to approximately half of this level. According to the forecast ofStatistics Sweden, the population will only increase by around 0.1-0.2% this year and during the firstdecade of the 21st century.With GDP growth of 3% and a population increase of around 0.7% a year, a rough measure ofproductivity is obtained which shows that it has increased on average by 2.3% per year during the20th century as a whole. Nowadays, the figure is lower; most analysts estimate that trend productivityis under rather than over 2% per year, although there has been some improvement in recent years.The standard of living has accordingly not risen as quickly during the 1990s as it did during a numberof earlier decades during the century.Figure 3. GDP per capitaIn order to obtain an idea of developments in Sweden we can look at the United Kingdom. Sweden isconsidered to have become industrialised about hundred years after the UK. GDP per capita thereforegrew more quickly in Britain than in Sweden during the first half of the 19th century. From 1870onwards, however, the relationship between the two countries changed. Growth per capita became thesame in both countries and after 1890 and up to 1970, Sweden took the lead. The Swedish economyexperienced a fantastic period of growth. After 1970 growth slowed and Sweden fell behind othercountries.Annual inflation has averaged around 4% in the 20th century. However, this average concealsrelatively sharp fluctuations in the rate of inflation at the beginning of the century and a successivelyrising trend in the post-war period. This rising trend was first interrupted during the 1990s.In the closing stages of World War One, a remarkable increase of the inflation rate took place.Inflation rate in 1918, for instance, was almost 40%. This inflation period was changed into a period ofdeflation in the early 1920s when prices fell for three years in a row. Altogether, the price level fell byover 40% between 1921 and 1923. This was truly a period of deflation.3.

For the entire period from 1830 up to today, the average rate is around 2.5%, which accordsrelatively well with our inflation target.Figure 5. Employment in different sectors4.

Employment in differentsectors during the 20th century
5BIS Review 137/1999The employment trends in different sectors, as a proportion of total employment, shows the Swedisheconomy’s transformation during the 20th century. Three different stages are especially clear.Firstly, fewer and fewer people earn a living from agriculture over the years. Having providedemployment for around 60% of the labour force at the beginning of the century, agriculture nowengages only a couple of per cent. This change reflects a dramatic increase in agricultural productivityand thereby internal migration. The population in rural areas falls and large cities such as Malmö,Gothenburg and Stockholm grow. It is also primarily in these regions that growth is generated.Secondly, the shrinking agricultural sector is reflected in a corresponding increase in industrialemployment. Manufacturing occupied over 30% of the labour force in the 1950s when this part ofSweden’s corporate sector was largest in terms of employment. Thereafter, the proportion of employedin this sector has fallen.Finally, the really dramatic development as regards increased employment is the expansion of theservice sector. At the end of the 20th century, the service sector provides employment for overtwo-thirds of the labour force in comparison with around 20% at the beginning of the century. In thebeginning, it involved expansion of the private service sector, but from the late 1950s and thebeginning of the 1960s, public employment grew at a fast rate. The share rose from around 10% toapproximately a third of the labour force in the 1990s.An important factor behind the rapid expansion of the service sector is that women started to take paidemployment. This created a demand for the production of both public and private services. Women’sentry into the labour market meant that a previously untapped labour reserve was used.These changes have meant large transformations which have had an impact on people’s everydaylives. However, these have probably been necessary to bring about the marked increase in materialprosperity.Figure 6. Volatility in inflation and growthFinally, I should like to illustrate the fact that the transformation of the economy in the 20th centuryhas not always taken place in calm and harmonious forms. There have been some large ups and6.

BIS Review 137/19996downs. The situation was most turbulent in the early 1910s and the 1920s. A period of high inflationand rapidly growing demand was followed by deflation and a large fall in total production.Otherwise, development has been relatively uniform and stable since the breakthrough of industrialismin the mid-19th century apart from the 1870s and also the early 1930s, which is not so clearly visiblein the diagram.Challenges on the threshold to a new millenniumAt the end of the 20th century, the new information technology is making rapid progress. As far as wecan see today, it will affect production and distribution processes as well as consumer behaviour. Thatin turn makes the environment more competitive and calls for further change in Sweden’s corporatesector.Put to good use, this transformation can probably create stronger potential growth, lead to higherproductivity growth and lower inflation, and benefit employment. The favourable changes that haveoccurred over a number of years in the Swedish economy since the 1980s suggest that such adevelopment is within our grasp.All forecasts to date about the spread of the Internet have been on the low side. In the United States, itwas 38 years before 50 million households had radio sets, while the intervals for television sets andcable television were 13 and 10 years. The Internet, however, had reached 50 million households afteronly 5 years and according to some estimates the number of users will increase greatly during the nextfew years.It has been said that whereas conventional telephony in Sweden is growing by 7% a year, traffic on theInternet is currently rising at this rate every week. It is not just that more and more people aresubscribing; those who surf on the Internet are doing so more and more. The number of surfers ismeasured by Sifo Research & Consulting; the figures show that almost 3.5 million people in Swedensurf, which is not quite half of the population aged 12 to 79. Of these, as many as 2 million stated thatthey surfed on a daily basis. Another noteworthy figure is that in the age group 50-79 years, almost20% are active users of the Internet. So the Internet is not something that only young people findattractive.Furthermore, Sweden is one of the absolute leaders in information technology (IT), both as regardsInternet users and in broader terms such as the number of computers and mobile phones. In suchsurveys, the United States usually comes out top.The Internet makes it simple to obtain information, communicate with others and trade in goods andservices. Price comparisons are already feasible and one can buy some goods and services, not leastbank services. In these ways the Internet cuts distances, overcomes borders, contributes to a morecompetitive environment and enables consumers to be better informed. Everyone can get theinformation he or she needs easily and painlessly, often dispensing with intermediaries.Besides affecting consumer behaviour, the Internet and information technology in general haveconsequences for production processes. In addition to more informed consumers, we have firms withbetter oversight of production, material inputs, distribution processes and sales.Information technology compared with the railwaysSimplifying somewhat, the advent of the Internet can be compared with the era of railroadconstruction in Sweden in the second half of the 19th century.In the initial phase, there was a boom for those who constructed the railways and manufactured rollingstock. In the closing decade of the century, Swedish firms began to produce locomotives; previouslythat had been the preserve of British manufacturers. The Swedish firms took over the domestic marketand were even able to export their products. Much the same happened with the manufacture ofpassenger carriages and goods wagons.
7BIS Review 137/1999Today we can see similar developments in the IT industry. Besides the giant Ericssson, Sweden hasmany different IT enterprises. But growth is still being driven not so much by users of the newcommunication facilities as by the production of new possibilities.To continue with the comparison, in the next phase people started to travel by rail. A journey fromStockholm to Gothenburg admittedly took 11 hours and 45 minutes in 1865 but that was nothingcompared with a horse-drawn carriage. Travelling became quicker and more efficient; people gainednew impressions and learned new things. Sweden became smaller.Today we travel on the Internet by gathering information simply and efficiently from all over theworld, largely for the price of a local telephone call. Millions of people in all parts of the world areindeed using this facility and in that sense the world has now become smaller.The really important phase, however, was when the railways began to affect processes for productionand distribution. Previously, production in Sweden had been located in the vicinity of iron ore andforests. The units were numerous and not particularly efficient; transportation was slow. In the countyof Värmland, for example, there were sixty different sites for the production of iron in 1870. When therailways had been constructed, it was easier to concentrate production to fewer sites; by around 1900there were only six sites and they were accordingly considerably more efficient. This is just anexample to illustrate how the railways played a major part in Sweden’s industrial upswing in the late19th century. Productivity and growth rose.For the information technology, this phase of the process probably lies ahead. The new technology hasnot yet seriously altered either production and distribution processes or consumer behaviour. Progressis still a little hesitant as more and more people use the new technique for surfing and learn the newtechnology. The potential will also be limited as long as the technique is not entirely user-friendly.IT generates pressure for changeWhen the new information technology really catches on, it will probably lead to a rapid expansion andtransformation of capital stocks. The entire economy will then be involved in intensive investment andhigh productivity growth. Old technology will be replaced by new and each unit of capital equipmentwill then require a smaller input of labour. Unprofitable units or firms will be closed down,accompanied by new establishments. Structural changes generate developments that are often referredto at present as a new “economy”. The marked improvement in productivity maintains profits andkeeps prices down. During the transformation, a good circle is created but it is difficult to tell howlong it will last. It can be described, if you like, as a period of extensive rationalisation and heightenedefficiency. The growth trend is raised for an indefinite period, enabling the economy to expand morerapidly without inflation taking off.It should be borne in mind that the adaptation to the new information technology does not occurautomatically. It is not the case that one day we suddenly find the new technology has begun to beimplemented in ways that are leaving their mark on economic developments in general.During recent decades economists have increasingly highlighted institutional aspects in a broad senseas an explanation as to why some economies grow more rapidly than others. This approach underlinesthat the rate of economic growth is related to the system of rights and incentives that is adopted in acountry and the determination to maintain this system in a credible way. In economic jargon, it isusually asserted that the incentive structure and its impact on economic growth is formed by theexisting institutional structure.The late 19th century provides important lessons about the necessary conditions for this good circle.At the beginning of the 1800s, as I said before, Sweden was still a poor country with an unstable formof government, a chaotic monetary system and a general shortage of credit facilities. Ninety years laterthe Swedish economy had undergone a dramatic transformation. Inflation was low, with an orderlymonetary system. The nation was bursting with vitality in every field. An impressive range ofproducts, many of them world leaders, were being developed on the basis of Swedish inventions.Swedish financial experts were engaged in the exploitation of the inventions at an early stage.
BIS Review 137/19998Employment was provided for more and more people, living standards rose and growth was among thehighest in the world.Opinions about the causes of the pronounced change in the Swedish economy are not completelyunanimous. An increasingly stable form of government presumably contributed. A series ofconstitutional reforms provided a guarantee of stability.The stable prices presumably played a part. When inflation is low or the price level is stable, thosewho have to plan for the longer run face less uncertainty. After a rather chaotic period in the history ofthe monetary system, the introduction of the silver standard in the early 1830s and subsequently thegold standard led to price stability.Another significant factor was probably the credit system’s development. Banks were established andthe abolition of interest controls was followed by more financial expertise. That made it possible toexploit the inventions and finance investments in the emerging industries.Economic activities benefited from the abolition of trade guilds, freedom to trade and the reform ofjoint-stock companies. The reform of elementary education was, of course, another important step thatultimately promoted human capital.This catalogue is not intended to be a complete account of all the factors behind Sweden’stransformation from a poor country into a rapidly expanding industrial nation. The point I want tomake is that a variety of institutional changes seem to have been needed to provide a stable frameworkfor the subsequent process of industrialisation. It is just this stability in the fundamental conditions foreconomic activities that was no doubt important for the process that resulted in the industrialrevolution, which in itself was full of commercial risks and uncertainties.Improvement in opportunities for changeA similar gloss can be applied to the realignment of economic policy from the second half of the1980s. There have been a number of reforms aimed at creating stability and opportunities. The creditand currency markets have been deregulated, components of the social security system have beenreformed, a tax reform has been implemented, targets have been established for government finances,price stability is enshrined in law and the Riksbank has been given an independent status.All this represents good possibilities of the Swedish economy facing a stable future as we step over thethreshold to a new millennium. It is important that wage formation also functions properly. It remainsto be seen whether the Swedish economy has changed in this area. Otherwise, there is a risk that firmswill be under pressure from two fronts. Profitability will be depressed both by increased competitionand by rising wage costs. Investment will be held back and the transformation will proceed too slowlyor not at all. There will then be no quick renewal of capital stocks. Companies will not draw thebenefit of the new information technology at a sufficiently rapid rate and will then lag behind. Othercritical factors that may affect the rate of transformation are, for instance, the tax system, theeducational system, etc.Various factors that hamper or check an adjustment could thus result in the Swedish economyfollowing a lower instead of a higher, path for long-term growth, with a stronger, not a weakerinflation propensity and a continuation of high unemployment instead of a reduction to the low levelthat most people want. These risks seldom feature in the general discussion about the new economy.ConclusionFrom an economic perspective, the 20th century has been a fantastic century. One of the explanationsfor this has been the existence of an ability to adapt the economy to new conditions and this has alsoled to rapidly rising living standards.The changes that many people refer to as the new economy unquestionably present a number ofchallenges to the Swedish economy at the end of the 20th century. The notion of a new economy is not
9BIS Review 137/1999correct; that is not what it is all about. It is rather a matter of a new challenge in the long series ofchallenges the Swedish economy has had to face ever since the dawn of the industrial era more than acentury ago.Concepts such as development and winding-up are important components in an ongoingtransformation and adaptation of the Swedish economy. It is just as important a prerequisite forincreasing prosperity now that the world is on its way into a new millennium as it was over a hundredyears ago when Sweden was industrialised. The smoother we make such a continuous transformation,the greater the chances will be of looking forward to a new fantastic century.
1BIS Review 135/1999Mr Crockett asks whether the internationalfinancial system needs mendingSpeech by Mr Andrew Crockett, General Manager of the Bank for International Settlements andChairman of the Financial Stability Forum, at the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung in Frankfurt on 8 December1999.*      *      *The collapse of the Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s marked an important turning point in thepost-war evolution of the financial system. Until about that time, the international monetary systemwas a heavily managed and administered one, based on fixed exchange rates, regulated domesticmarkets and restrictions on the cross-border flow of financial capital. As these arrangements crumbledunder the weight of widening payment imbalances and the growing internationalisation of finance, amarket-led system emerged. The process of equilibrium-seeking and adjustment was progressively leftto the forces of competition. Exchange rates were allowed to float, domestic financial intermediationwas liberalised and capital accounts were gradually opened. Some labelled these new arrangements a“non-system” - although there is nothing inherently unsystematic about an economic system based oncompetitive forces and decentralised decision taking.For the last quarter century or so, domestic as well as international financial arrangements have thusrelied on increasingly open and integrated markets as the main engines of adjustment and stability.Spurred by the freedom to innovate, technological progress and the appeal of investment opportunitiesin an increasingly global economy, financial activity has expanded enormously. The role of thefinancial sector in mobilising and allocating resources, both within national economies and acrossgeographic boundaries, has expanded commensurately. For the most part, an open internationalfinancial system has operated to the benefit of economic activity and wider social welfare. It haschannelled savings to countries with productive investment opportunities, it has been a vehicle for thetransfer of managerial and technological know-how, and it has served as a source of discipline onunsustainable and harmful macroeconomic policies. An open trading and financial environmentenabled many Asian countries to lift their peoples out of poverty in the space of a single generation.Recent years, however, have witnessed events that show the darker side of these market forces. Aparticularly virulent crisis enveloped several Asian economies in 1997. Only shortly thereafter, Russiaand Brazil succumbed to financial turmoil. And even financial markets in the more mature economiestook fright as the globalisation of markets allowed contagion to spread beyond the emerging marketeconomies. The social costs, while not wiping out earlier gains, were severe.Do these crises demonstrate that the post-Bretton Woods model of financial arrangements hasoutlasted its useful life? Do financial markets show an inherent and damaging instability which arguesfor a return to administrative control? Is now the time to consider a fundamental change in the wayfinancial activity is organised, in the way it is monitored and managed, and in the way losses and gainsare shared? Many indeed are calling for a “new financial architecture”, though concrete proposals ofwhat this new construction could look like have yet to be formulated.My own view is that the basic components of today’s system of financial intermediation continue to bethe only reliable and efficient ones, but that the rough edges of the market-led system need bettermonitoring and in some cases repair. In other words, the architecture or design of the financial system– the basic rule of decentralised, market-led decision-making – remains sound, but its internal wiringand plumbing – the preconditions which ensure that markets can indeed operate efficiently and stably– may require upgrading.*      *      *
BIS Review 135/19992Which are the areas of vulnerability or failure which cause markets to display excessive instability,and lead to such severe costs? And why are financial markets particularly prone to such failures? Atthe risk of over simplification, I propose to focus on three sources of market failure which have beenparticularly prevalent in the recent episode of worldwide financial turbulence. They are: first, the lackof relevant information and its asymmetric distribution across market participants; second, thepresence of externalities that can give rise to undesired and unintended market outcomes; and third,the difficulty of establishing an adequate infrastructure in financial markets. Note that I make hardlyany distinction between the domestic and the international financial system. With the globalisation offinance and the lifting of controls, the two have basically merged. As I will argue, however, dealingwith market failures at the international level may be much more complex than in a domestic setting.Information and financial activityLet me start with the first area of financial market vulnerability, that of information deficits. Financialactivity is particularly information-intensive. More than any other sector perhaps, financial marketshave to cope with a high degree of uncertainty. This is a reflection of the fact that by nature finance isan intertemporal activity: services to which counterparties commit themselves in financial contractsare delivered over sometimes very long periods during which circumstances can change in unforeseenways. Moreover, with finance having become increasingly borderless, exposures have grown tocounterparties and markets much less familiar than those at home. The global and the intertemporalcharacter of financial intermediation therefore puts a premium on ensuring that clear andcomprehensive information is at the disposal of market participants.Yet such information is often not readily available. It may be expensive, or it may be distributedunevenly across market players. Not all participants are willing to bear the cost of collecting thenecessary information, in particular when it is easy for others to free-ride on their efforts. Decisionsmay then be taken on the basis of a less-than-complete information set and risks may be run which in amore informed environment would have been avoided.Another frequent occurrence in financial markets is that participants have unequal access toinformation. Borrowers typically are several steps ahead of lenders in knowing the probabilities ofsuccess of their projects and how gains and losses might be shared. Lenders may be unaware that thefunds they provide flow to the most risky investments, or are wasted on less productive activities. Toprotect themselves against this information deficit, lenders may ration their finance or even withdrawfrom participation altogether. In the economic literature, these problems, known as adverse selectionand moral hazard, have been shown to have a negative impact on financial market efficiency,especially in a cross-border setting.The recent Asian crisis is a good example of how lending and borrowing decisions can be biased bylack or uneven distribution of information. Few investors realised to what extent the massive flow offoreign-currency funds into several Asian economies was diverted into activities with little or noprospects of generating foreign-currency resources, or, should the economy turn down, of yielding anyreturns at all. Confidence in official reserve data was greatly shaken as it became clear to what extentforeign exchange assets were mortgaged by massive short forward positions in Thailand or byplacements in overseas branches of Korean banks facing problems themselves in meeting foreigncurrency obligations.Moral hazard was also a problem. Given that they believed that their liabilities were implicitlyguaranteed, Korean chaebol embarked on a largely unfettered investment spree. At the same time,domestic banks and foreign investors in South East Asian countries took unwarranted comfort fromgovernments’ commitments to maintain fixed exchange rates, or from expectations that theinternational community would help safeguard private investment. These expectations prolonged theperiod of excessive capital inflow; and thus rendered more costly its eventual reversal.
3BIS Review 135/1999Market outcomes: the sum of its parts or somewhat less?A second problem in financial markets is that the sum of individual decisions which on their own areperfectly rational may not always lead to a stable equilibrium or a socially desirable outcome. Asudden loss of confidence in one particular bank can sometimes lead to an indiscriminate run on theentire banking system. Similarly, evidence of an isolated foreign debt servicing problem can bemagnified into a generalised “rush for the exits”. The crisis which follows almost always seems topush the domestic currency beyond an equilibrium level with damaging social consequences. In bothof these examples, attempts by individual agents to protect their financial positions generateexternalities which precipitate the very consequence against which these actions are designed to guard.Many other examples of similar problems of aggregation in financial markets can be given. Herdinstinct is often identified as one of the main factors behind the surges in capital flows and theirsudden shifts in recent years. Such herd behaviour may be rational in the context in which it occurs.Fear of under performance runs deep in the highly competitive financial industry and induces portfoliomanagers to mirror each other’s investment strategies or to stick close to benchmarks. Often, too,attitudes are more lenient towards those who are wrong in good company, than to those making awrong bet on their own. Whether understandable or not, herd behaviour nevertheless adds to anunacceptable degree of volatility in financial markets.In the East Asian case, herd instinct undoubtedly played a part in the over-lending that preceded thecrisis. Western banks and fund managers were fearful of being left behind in the rush to participate inthe Asian “miracle”. Then, when sentiment turned, investors wanted to reduce their exposure asrapidly as possible, fearing a currency and banking collapse that would threaten their investments.With limited reserves and borrowing possibilities, the countries in the region all saw their currenciesovershoot. The succeeding interaction of banking and currency problems imposed costs out of allproportion to the original policy mistakes.At times, these aggregation problems are in part self-inflicted. If short-term lending enjoys morefavourable risk weights than longer-term credit exposures, as is the case in the 1988 Basel CapitalAccord, creditors may want to shorten the maturity of their cross-border claims even further, inparticular when the economic climate becomes more gloomy. However, if all lending becomes shortterm, the vulnerability of borrowers will rise substantially and the intrinsic liquidity of their liabilitiesmay be much lower than if the maturity of their exposures had been kept more medium term.In sum, instead of helping to build a stable equilibrium for a diversified set of profit-maximisingagents, the market mechanism may at times fall prey to one-dimensional views and become one-sided,producing highly volatile outcomes and price overshooting. It would be too much to say this was thecause of the Asian crisis, but it may have contributed to its unexpected virulence.Inadequate infrastructureA final major area of fragility in financial markets is that of an insufficiently developed infrastructure.Financial market infrastructure covers a very broad range of elements. It includes modern contract lawand efficient law enforcement procedures. It deals with accounting rules and valuation standards, withprudential regulations, effective supervision and appropriate disclosure requirements. It also covers thecreation of well-functioning payments and settlement systems and the design of safety net provisions.In many respects, this infrastructure is a public good. It is of benefit to all, but market participants willnot be able or willing to supply or fund it fully. It will therefore be left to the relevant authorities toensure that the necessary infrastructure is put in place and ways are found to share its cost amongparticipants.Financial history if replete with cases of crisis which were caused by poor supervision, inadequatelegal frameworks or deficient payment and settlement arrangements. This shows how complex andexpensive a well-performing infrastructure is, in particular in an international context. It also explainswhy so often these public goods are being undersupplied and markets often remain immature.
BIS Review 135/19994Moreover, the financial infrastructure may propagate biased incentives and excessively riskybehaviour as long as its design is faulty and pricing inappropriate.In the case of countries affected by the recent crises, financial supervisory arrangements were almostalways deficient in some respects. Accounting conventions were applied insufficiently rigorously, andfinancial institutions were allowed to become excessively exposed. In some countries, bankruptcyarrangements were virtually non-existent, and in those where they existed, they were often subject todelays. Hence the process of recovering value from impaired financial claims (an essential part of awell-functioning financial system) was burdened by major uncertainties. In Russia, the costs of theabsence of reliable contract law and law enforcement are at their most evident.*      *      *It is now time for me to move from problems to solutions. But first, let me briefly recapitulate theargument so far. Open markets continue to be the most appropriate and efficient arrangement forallocating resources and bringing about adjustment. From this perspective, there is no real alternativeto the present basis for financial intermediation, both domestic and cross-border. However, this firmbelief should not blind us to the inherent vulnerabilities which characterise financial markets. Itherefore now propose to explore for a few minutes the approaches we may take to find solutions tothese market failures.InformationFirst, how to ensure that market participants have adequate access to the information they need? Animpressive list of recent initiatives in this area can be put together. The efforts have moved in threedistinct directions. Some have been aimed at improving participants’ appreciation of the risks in themacroeconomic environment. The IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard is an example of thiskind of initiative, as are efforts to improve the consistency of international reserve data. Others havesought to increase our understanding of the potential implications of the build-up of market positionsand price trends in particular markets; examples of this effort are the more timely internationalbanking statistics provided by the BIS. Still others aim at sharpening awareness of thecreditworthiness of counterparties; the work of private sector groupings in laying down more rigorouscounterparty credit guidelines should improve disclosure practices in this area.But rather than elaborate on specific initiatives, I would prefer to make two more general observations.First, unlike what financial news services would like us to believe, the main issue that confronts us isnot so much to generate more information, but better information. Relevant, clear and comprehensiveinformation, and its efficient disclosure and dissemination, are what is called for. From the point ofview of the authorities, the challenging task here will be to transmit the correct guidance to financialmarkets and participants. Blanket guarantees and time-inconsistent commitments to exchange ratetargets have all too often been part of the messages which the authorities have conveyed to financialmarkets. The recent crises in much of the emerging world have shown how counterproductive, if notdisastrous, this market guidance can be.My second point is that not only do we need to consider carefully what the right information is, wealso have to put in place the appropriate incentives for participants to use and disclose it. Awareness ofthis incentive issue can be found in the proposed revision of the Basel Capital Accord. For instance,sovereign risk weights are expected to be lower for those countries which have reached internationallyaccepted standards with respect to data dissemination. More importantly perhaps, the new accord’scall for more comprehensive qualitative supervision, rather than the mechanical checking ofquantitative ratios, is likely to induce banks to focus on their risk management and monitoringcapabilities, and thus on their ability to incorporate all information that is relevant to risk control.There is little doubt in my mind that the encouragement of a credit culture which requires lendingofficers to realistically appraise the credit and market risks of their portfolio or investment decisionswill generate many incentives to use and disclose market-relevant information.
5BIS Review 135/1999ExternalitiesI come now to the second area of market vulnerability, that of undesired externalities and aggregationproblems. This may be even more complex. In theory it is course possible to consider the radicalsolution of forcing financial institutions to reduce their leverage and increase the degree of theirliquidity so much that a run on them becomes highly unlikely. Similarly, one could consider pushingcountries into holding a sufficiently large stock of international reserves which would reduce thelikelihood of currency runs to a minimum. However, the costs of such measures in terms of efficiencyand economic growth would be large. The financial sector makes its contribution to the widereconomy by adding to the liquidity of intersectoral claims. This depends on leverage. To reduce itscapacity to this would involve economic costs. We therefore need to strike a balance betweenefficiency and stability objectives.Much more constructive, I feel, would be to improve our understanding of how financial regulationcan give rise to aggregation issues and generate externalities. Greater awareness of the link betweenindividual behaviour and market outcomes can contribute to better rules and more appropriate marketguidance. As a result, the incidence of capital flow volatility would be less. More discriminating andcritical behaviour on the part of market participants may be promoted, and a bunching of particulartypes of lending and investment might be more easily avoided.No doubt, many controversial issues will have to be dealt with in this area, and solutions which seemadequate from one point of view may be questionable when looked at from a different angle. Forinstance, the pressure to maintain prescribed capital ratios is sometimes argued to have undesirablemacroeconomic consequences. The need to satisfy capital requirements can aggravate economicrecessions, if banks feel forced to curtail their lending beyond what the underlying economic situationwould warrant. Similarly, a comfortable capital cushion in economic booms may induce banks toengage in lending sprees. To the extent they have pro-cyclical effects, capital requirements maygenerate externalities and aggregation effects.Some have accordingly argued that institutions should be allowed to run down capital in recessionsand rebuild it in periods of greater economic buoyancy. Whatever the appeal of this argument,however, it ignores the fact that a capital cushion is needed precisely when economic conditions areadverse and confidence is shaky. A policy which appears beneficial to the macroeconomy could thenbe harmful to the soundness of the financial system and, through this channel, put economic stabilityin even greater danger. If, therefore, banks’ capital is to serve its purpose as a cushion in bad times, itfollows that banks should hold additional capital reserves when times are good.Infrastructure and public goodsFinally, what could be done to ensure that sufficient public goods are supplied for an efficientfunctioning of financial markets? Governments have generally accepted the responsibility at thedomestic level to provide the main elements of the infrastructure which financial markets need.Unfortunately, most of these domestic initiatives cannot be simply transposed to the internationallevel. Insolvency arrangements may be effective within national boundaries, but remain complicated,even non-existent, when the insolvency involves sovereign states or relates to cross-border claims.Supervision remains in the hands of national regulatory authorities, creating difficulties ofcommunication and coordination once financial activity becomes more global. The problem is furthercompounded by the fact that different types of financial institution are often supervised separately andaccording to differentiated rules. To a certain extent, the “Core Principles” for effective supervisiondeveloped by the various regulatory bodies, address these problems; however, their implementationstill has to proceed much further.Safety net provisions promote the stability of the domestic financial system, but are discussed at bestin a conceptual or abstract manner at the international level. Even in areas which seem moremanageable, such as the definition of appropriate accounting standards and valuation principles,international acceptance and uniformity are still a long way from being realised. Most of these issues
BIS Review 135/19996are being addressed in various expert groupings, but the complexities of the issues at hand limit thespeed at which progress can be made.*      *      *If we are to make significant progress in proposing solutions to and correcting the main financialmarket failures, strategy will be an important consideration. By this I mean, how does the internationalcommunity go about reaching agreement on how market failures are tackled, then ensuring that thenecessary measures are implemented.The first thing to say is this is not an area that lends itself to international treaties. Prudent financialbehaviour is not something that can easily be reduced to legislative provisions. For a variety ofreasons, the most promising approach appears to be the development of standards of best practice,whose implementation is encouraged by market forces, and effectively monitored by impartialassessment. For this approach to gain broad acceptance, it should, first of all, be the outcome of alegitimate process of standard setting. By this, I mean that the task should be carried forward bynational experts who from their own direct experience are familiar with the practical issues of bestpractice and how to promote it. Legitimacy also implies that a representative sample of countriesshould be involved or consulted.Second, discussions need to focus on the many ways in which measures in one area impact on otherareas. Supervisors of banks, for example, need to be aware of how their activities impact on the choicebetween bank finance and other forms of intermediation. More generally, there needs to be a betterappreciation of how “environmental” factors such as corporate governance practices, accountancyconventions and bankruptcy arrangements affect the balance of risks and incentives in the financialsector. And third, the general purpose of the exercise should be to promote a better understanding andpricing of risks, not so much by administrative directives and regulation, as through the reinforcementof appropriate incentives and behaviour.In much of the committee work done at the BIS, attention is given as much as possible to theseprinciples of strategy. By focussing on the soundness of institutions (via the Basel Committee onBanking Supervision), the functioning of financial markets (via the Committee on the Global FinancialSystem) and the development of the market infrastructure (via the Committee on Payment andSettlement Systems) committees have sought to address the multifaceted nature of financialintermediation. By relying on consensus building among national experts and by encouraging theactive involvement of major emerging market economies, the legitimacy of the “Basel process” hasbecome more widely accepted. And increasingly, the propagation of appropriate incentives have cometo dominate committee recommendations.However, financial stability is not the preserve of a few committees or institutions. It is the combinedresponsibility of central banks, supervisory agencies, ministries of finance, international organisationsand standard-setting bodies that have been created within the various segments of the financial market.The G7, in a report by Hans Tietmeyer, recognised the need to establish an institutional setting inwhich all these agencies charged with financial stability could be brought together. The proposal led tothe establishment earlier this year of the Financial Stability Forum, which I have the honour to chair.Its agenda focuses on increasing the awareness of the inter-relationships between the various aspectsof financial stability, promoting the exchange of information and the identification of gaps, andenhancing the efficiency of standard setting. In other words, the Forum seeks to address the three areasidentified as major sources of vulnerability in financial markets.Its composition reflects the diversity of interests in financial stability, and could so help to fostergreater understanding of the macro/microprudential interface among those charged with supervisionand standard setting and those concerned with macroeconomic stability. Finally, it may also help todeal with what is to be considered the four-letter word in financial stability, namely the issue of “turf”or the unproductive competition or lack of cooperation between agencies charged with overlappingresponsibilities.The Financial Stability Forum brings together a wide cross-section of individuals and institutionsinvolved in the promotion of financial stability. The G7 countries are represented by their Deputy
7BIS Review 135/1999Finance Ministers, Deputy Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision (in the case ofGermany, this means Caio Koch-Weser, Jürgen Stark and Wolfgang Artopoeus). In addition, fourother countries with systematically important financial markets are represented. The majorinternational institutions (the IMF, World Bank, OECD and BIS) also participate, as do the mainstandard-setting bodies – the Banking, Insurance and Securities Regulators and the internationalCommittee on Payment and Settlement Systems.As you see, therefore, the Forum is well constituted to take a comprehensive view of financial stabilityissues. It has also incorporated the views of a wide range of countries not directly represented in theForum through their participation in Working Groups. At its inaugural meeting, the Forum decided toset up three working groups covering, respectively, Highly Leveraged Institutions, Offshore FinancialCentres and Capital Flows. I expect these working groups to deliver their final reports in March. Thereports themselves will contain a number of concrete, implementable recommendations that, whenadopted, will have the effect of making the financial system safer.I mentioned a moment ago the role of standards of best practice as a means of focussing efforts toimprove financial system stability. Of course the drawing up of standards has to be accompanied by ameans to encourage their implementation. The Forum is addressing this issue in a newly-establishedworking group chaired by Andrew Sheng of the Hong Kong Securities Commission. Effectiveimplementation requires incentives to put standards into effect, prioritisation to ensure that the keyweaknesses are tackled first, monitoring to assess compliance, and often technical assistance, to givesupervisory authorities access to relevant knowledge and expertise. I believe the Forum can play a keyrole in bringing together the resources in its various members to help bring all this about.Lastly, let me note briefly the role of the Financial Stability Forum as a source for information. TheForum’s website contains a compendium of the standards (43 in all) that have been developed in thefinancial area. It also contains an inventory of training availability. We will be building up this facilityin the future to provide, we hope, a genuine focal point for sharing information on initiatives in thefield in financial stability.*      *      *In conclusion, the market-led system of financial intermediation has served the world very well, mostof the time. By lifting the liquidity constraints inherent in administrative controls and excessiveregulation, today’s financial arrangements have contributed to output and income growth ofenterprises and households alike. The most vivid illustrations of the potential of open financialmarkets to raise efficiency and improve resource allocation are the spectacular growth rates whichseveral emerging market economies realised over the last two decades.But recurrent bouts of financial turmoil, not least in those high-performing economies, alsodemonstrate that financial markets do not always work efficiently and produce competitive outcomes.I have concentrated here on three types of market failure which can cause major financial shocks anddamaging instability. For some these failures are sufficient ground for advocating a return toadministrative control of financial activity. I do not share this view. But I am honest enough torecognise that much still needs to be done to mitigate the vulnerabilities in financial markets. Andmodest enough to admit that this will be a protracted process, heavily dependent on the political will tosucceed.
1BIS Review 134/1999Mr Desario discusses new approaches to theinternational regulation of credit riskAddress by Dott. Vincenzo Desario, Director General of the Bank of Italy at the 5th ABI Conventionon the Development and Management of Loan Portfolios held in Cernobbio on 15 October 1999.*      *      *IntroductionMy thanks, first of all, to the Italian Banking Association for the invitation to give the opening addressat this conference on new methods for developing and managing loan portfolios.The subject is highly topical. Today, as interest rates converge on the lowest levels since the SecondWorld War, banks’ competitiveness depends more than ever on their ability to select customers andoffer the most appropriate forms of credit, so as to curb credit risk and generate yields above the costof funds.Analysis of the crises that have shaken many credit systems in recent years confirms that the mainsource of bank instability lies in their lending business; cyclical swings in the economy, sharp changesin asset values, high credit concentration, and inadequate procedures for evaluating and managingloans have been the main factors in most bank failures.Inquiry into the causes of instability has been followed by action to reinforce safeguards against crises,strengthen banks’ credit risk management systems, make market discipline more effective, andimprove supervisory authorities’ prudential rules and analytical methods.The Italian banking system’s bad debts rose rapidly in the nineties, although in the last two years loanquality has Improved thanks to companies 1 better profit performance and financial restructuring.Innovative market techniques for credit risk management have recently been introduced and somebanks have begun to use advanced statistical methods of risk measurement.1.Bank credit and the marketIn 1999 the ratio of new bad debts to total lending has fallen to its lowest level in the decade. Theimprovement, which had already been perceptible for some time in industrial lending, has spread toconstruction and services.In August the stock of bad loans held by banks was 5 per cent lower than a year earlier. The reductionwas achieved by means of substantial writeoffs and the disposal of uncollectible claims throughsecuritization.Selling credit assets to the market allows banks to turn their portfolios over faster and broaden theirborrower base, thereby using capital more efficiently and diversifying their sources of income toinclude fees for the services related to the complex procedures of securitization.In the United States the volume of credit securitization business has grown enormously. In 1998 netissues of such securities amounted to more than $300 billion, or 35 per cent of total issues of debtinstruments. Their share of outstanding debt is now more than 20 per cent.In the US market, securitization has centred on loan assets of better-than-average quality, which hasled to the issue of highly rated securities. In Italy, it has been used mainly to reduce the incidence ofdoubtful credits and thus improve the average quality of banks’ assets. Since 1994 some 8 trillion lireof bank loans have been securitized, of which only 400 billion consisted of performing loans.
BIS Review 134/19992The passage in April of a law on securitization opens up business possibilities previously foreclosedby uncertainty about the legal framework. The prospects for growth depend strictly on banks’ abilityand willingness to offer the market good quality claims and to develop the entire gamut of servicesand specializations required. Bank managements will have to acquire the specific know-how neededfor the evaluation of the complex risk-return combinations involved.There is also growing recourse by some leading Italian banks to credit derivatives, which allow creditrisk to be transferred while maintaining title to the underlying credit relationship.The possibility of isolating one or more aspects of the risk associated with credit business andtransferring them to other parties via derivative contracts enables banks to keep only the componentsof risk that they consider they are best equipped to handle. This trend towards specialization explainsthe high degree of concentration in credit derivatives business. In June 1999 the top five US banksaccounted for 80 per cent of the American market with positions totaling $258 billion.Italian banks’ credit derivatives business is mostly channeled through their foreign branches; not onlydoes it respond to the need to diversify risk but it also allows them to penetrate new markets byacquiring positions with customers that it would otherwise have been difficult to establish businessrelations with. At the end of the second quarter of 1999 the notional value of Italian banks’ contractsin the United States amounted to $15.3 billion, or 6 per cent of the total market.The development of credit derivatives in the Italian market is likely to make it easier to implementpolicies aimed at correcting situations of excessively concentrated sectoral and geographical lending.2.The experience with solvency ratiosThe capital adequacy rules introduced by the Basel Capital Accord of 1988 constitute the main pointof reference for supervisory authorities everywhere. The basic elements of the Accord are still fullyvalid today: capital resources as the safeguard of banks’ stability, risk-weighted capital ratios, capitalrequirements for off-balance-sheet assets. Since the publication of the Core Principles of the BaselCommittee on Banking Supervision, to which supervisory authorities everywhere were asked toadhere, at least 140 countries have adopted the Committee’s approach in their regulation of banking.The Capital Accord was intended to raise banks’ level of capitalization, following decades of declinein the main banking systems. It also aimed to enhance the entrepreneurial initiative of bankers within aframework of close correlation between risks and capital resources and, through common prudentialrules, to promote conditions of competitive equality among internationally active banks.Drawing a balance sheet today, the results have been very largely positive.The degree of capitalization has risen almost everywhere, making banking systems more resilient. Theaverage solvency ratio of international banks located in the G10 countries rose from 9.3 per cent in1989 to 11.6 per cent in 1998.Over the same decade the average solvency ratio for individual banks in Italy rose from 11.7 to 13.4per cent.The improvement in capital adequacy has been fostered by the forceful action of the supervisoryauthorities, which has led banks to expand their capital resources in parallel with the rapid growth inhigher-risk assets.Uniform capital requirements have also attenuated competitive handicaps stemming from disparities inthe strictness of national banking regulations. They do not appear to have resulted in significantchanges in the competitive position of banks compared with other, less strictly regulated financialintermediaries. In some countries, including Italy, many non-bank intermediaries have beentransformed into banks.Studies on the impact of capital ratios, conducted mainly in the United States, have found temporaryslowdowns in some markets but not contractions in the supply of credit affecting the aggregate level ofeconomic activity.
3BIS Review 134/1999Ten years of rapid financial innovation and progress in developing statistical methods for measuringbanking risk have highlighted some of the limitations inherent in the specification of the capitalrequirements. The rigidity of the standards has not encouraged the adoption of techniques to reducecredit risk; it has induced practices for circumventing the rules.The current definition of the capital requirements cannot capture the variation in credit risk stemmingfrom cyclical developments; nor does it take account of the correlation between the risks associatedwith various assets and hence of the benefits implicit in well diversified portfolios.The benefit accorded to financial techniques of risk-shifting, in terms of reduced capital ratios, isinsufficient, while banks are increasingly taking measures to lessen capital requirements that do notactually diminish risk.The limited diversification of the risk weights applicable to assets makes it possible for banks to selecthigher risk-return combinations.3.The evolution of prudential rules on credit riskThe Basel Committee has focused on the need to strengthen the set of legal rules safeguarding bankstability by defining capital adequacy requirements in greater detail, improving the structures andmethods for the management of credit risk, reinforcing the discipline exerted on banking enterprisesby the financial markets.In June the Committee released a set of proposed revisions of the capital adequacy rules, asking for thecomments of the banking industry with a view to their definitive formulation in the second half of nextyear. During the summer it distributed documents setting out best practices in credit risk management,disclosure requirements and supervisory activity.For the time the idea of determining the capital needed to face credit risk by means of internal modelsdevised by banks themselves has been shelved, pending resolution of the problems with existingmethods and in view of the costs associated with producing such models. For the future, such modelsrepresent an opportunity to be pursued, in view of the possibility they offer of measuring credit riskmore exactly and more analytically and of factoring in the correlation between different risks. Theygenerate estimates that gauge the capital needed to cover the largest loss that could occur in any givenperiod of time and with any given probability.For lending to firms, the Committee’s proposed changes provide for two distinct methods ofdetermining risk weights: the ratings of specialized agencies, which are only available for a limitednumber of borrowers, and internal ratings, which the banks can assign to all their customers.For the standard method, the Committee has established the requirements that agencies must meet fortheir ratings to be used in determining capital ratios for banks. The requirements refer to agencies’credibility and independence as well as to the objectivity and transparency of their judgments.The criteria for supervisory authorities’ validation of internal rating systems have not yet been fixed.They will certainly include the completeness of the data, the methodological rigour of the proceduresand provision for verification of the results.There remains the complicated problem of defining a common yardstick to which to relate the resultsof the various banks’ internal rating systems, in order to make sure that capital requirements areuniform. Another problem to be faced concerns the comparability of the criteria for weighting the riskon loans to companies with agency ratings and those with internal ratings.4.Credit risk management and banks’ internal organizationThe adoption of internal ratings as the basis for calculating risk coefficients creates a direct linkbetween the regulation of capital requirements and banks’ internal structures for formulating lendingpolicies and for assessing, pricing and monitoring the risks involved in individual operations.
BIS Review 134/19994The Basel Committee has established the guidelines banks are to follow when making arrangementsfor credit risk management.Banks’ directors play a fundamental role in ensuring both that lending policies are consistent withbanks’ ability to handle credit risks and that periodic cheeks are carried out on the results achieved.Clear information on policy choices must be given to all bank structures involved in lending.To ensure that objectives are attained, banks’ top managers must ensure that precise instructions arecirculated setting out the various levels of responsibility, establish operational limits and extend creditrisk management systems to the whole range of bank assets.When granting loans, banks should evaluate all the information available in order to acquire acomplete profile of borrowers, including their exposure to cyclical or sectoral events, grouprelationships, if any, the use to which loans are to be put and the sources of the funds that will permitrepayment.The monitoring of loans should be assigned to qualified personnel working independently of the unitsresponsible for granting credit.Internal rating systems call for close liaison with the crucial aspects of risk management, such aspricing, provisioning and deciding to review loans or ask for their repayment.Exhaustive and continually updated information on borrowers’ financial positions and on the value ofcollateral is fundamental.The flow of information provided to financial markets is essential to ensure that the discipline they canimpose on banks’ managements is effective. The guidelines established by the Basel Committee forperiodic reports to the market cover all aspects of credit risk management: accounting practices,provisioning policies, organization, customer assessment procedures, breakdown of the loan portfolioby class of borrower, doubtful debts, collateral, volumes of derivatives and securitized loans,commitments, expected and actual rates of return on loans.The measures to address credit risk are completed by the activities of supervisory authorities directedat ensuring the adequacy of each bank’s capital resources in relation to its risk profile and corporatestrategies. It is up to supervisory authorities to evaluate whether banks’ internal procedures canperform the tasks of identifying, measuring and managing credit risk, to set higher capital ratios forbanks with particularly high risk profiles, to ensure compliance with capital requirements and to takeprompt action to prevent banks’ capital from falling below acceptable levels.The attention of the Bank of Italy has been directed towards banks’ organizational arrangements forsome time; in 1988 banks were asked to complete a questionnaire on their internal structures, whichprovided additional information on their organizations and served as a useful reminder to the bankingsystem of these issues.The importance of banks’ organizational arrangements is reflected in the regulatory framework.Exactly one year ago the Bank of Italy’s instructions to banks and banking groups introduced acomprehensive set of provisions aimed at encouraging effective and efficient internal control systemsin proportion to each entity’s size and operational complexity. Banks were also asked to report on thesystems they had adopted, their level of compliance with the new provisions, any critical factorsbrought to light and the remedial measures required.While respecting banks’ entrepreneurial independence, general principles have been established thatare consistent with international guidelines; these include the separation between operational andcontrol functions, a clear definition of the responsibilities of banks’ various units and specialregulations to ensure prompt corrective measures.Particular attention has been dedicated to internal auditing, with a view to ensuring continuous cheekson the effectiveness of controls and the preparation of proposals to improve risk management policies,instruments and procedures.
5BIS Review 134/19995.The thrust of current actionBriefly, an internal rating system embraces all the elements needed to measure the probability that aborrower will become insolvent and the share of the loan that, in such case, will no longer berecoverable; together, these two factors give the expected loss for each borrower.While the probability of failure can be assessed in terms of the borrower’s specific features such aseconomic sector, financial structure and income prospects, the recovery rate for any credit linedepends on factors such as the technical form of the loan, the collateral and the lender’s position inrelation to the borrower’s other creditors.Statistical methods of calculating these two components of expected losses require sufficiently longtime series on the frequencies of failures corresponding to each risk bucket and on the losses sustainedfor the various categories of loans and collateral. The issue is made even more complicated by the factthat both the probabilities of failure and recovery rates are affected by economic trends.A survey carried out by the Basel Committee of about thirty leading international banks showed thatthe problem is being addressed in ways that differ in many respects.Internal assessment procedures evaluate the quality of either borrowers or credit lines, and in somecases the two profiles are combined.Evaluations may be based entirely on statistical models, or be supplemented with the opinions ofsectoral analysts and lending experts; in some cases limits are set on the scope for altering the resultsof statistical calculations by adding qualitative considerations.The various systems differ in terms of the variables used to approximate the probability of failure forindividual borrowers, the time horizons considered and the use of sectoral analyses. For many banksthe reliability of the procedures adopted is closely linked to their ability to capture promptly anychanges in a borrower’s solvency position. Others, adopting a similar approach to that of ratingagencies, prefer so-called “across-the-cycle” evaluations, which consider the borrower’s position in ahypothetical unfavourable phase of the economic cycle.A specific probability of failure can be assigned to each internal rating class either on the basis of thebank’s own experience or by using information published by rating agencies on the frequency offailures.Evaluations based on internal rating systems can be used by banks’ directors and top management informulating lending strategies and setting limits to the autonomous granting of loans; they can also beused in loan pricing procedures and to ensure the prompt reporting of any deterioration in borrowers’positions.The survey carried out in the G-10 countries included a number of Italian banks, mostly major ones,and revealed some characteristic features of the approaches adopted in constructing a borrowerclassification system.The business sector is broken down by size; for small and medium-sized firms the first level ofscreening for creditworthiness consists mainly of a statistical classification of borrowers based on dataculled from balance sheets and the Central Credit Register. The results of these automatic proceduresare generally modified, within set limits, by information concerning corporate management andorganization. In assessing larger firms the statistically-based elements carry less weight.The recent start made on the systematic observation of the insolvency rates within each risk bucketand the losses sustained in connection with secondary lending conditions means that the accuracy ofthese procedures cannot be guaranteed, it is still too early to assess the ability of systems to capturechanges in the quality of credit linked to trends in economic activity.Assessments of individual borrowers usually refer to a time horizon of one year, a practice that mostforeign banks also follow. The models in use are not able to take systematic account of the differentmaturities of operations, while economic theory and experience both indicate that the maturity of loanscan have a marked impact on the related credit risks.
BIS Review 134/19996In their risk management procedures, Italian banks are increasingly resorting to models that measureexpected losses; they use the results in deciding whether to grant loans and in reviewing credit lines.The distinction between the units that calculate ratings, those that are involved in marketing and thosethat perform control functions appears to be well drawn. Nonetheless, the integration of thecustomer-classification systems of the different components of banking groups is not entirelysatisfactory.Medium-sized banks, of which one of the strengths has always been their specialized territorialknowledge and entrenchment in the local economic tissue, are also making important changes in theircredit risk management procedures. By opening new branches and acquiring local banks, they haverapidly extended their activities to be present on an inter-regional or national basis.These banks have responded to the need for more effective and efficient loan selection proceduresmainly by reviewing their organizational arrangements, improving their information systems andtightening their internal controls.Specialized operational units have been created according to types of customer, with the granting oflarge loans often being referred to “Committees” composed of particularly experienced head officepersonnel; procedures for assessing creditworthiness have been improved through the use ofinformation technology to coordinate and accelerate the use of available information.The enlargement of distribution networks has proved a strong incentive to decentralizingdecision-making for smaller loans.To meet the requirements of control, special organizational units have been created to providecentralized monitoring of loan positions; these maintain continuous contact with the central andbranch units engaged in granting loans, mostly through the use of computerized procedures thatidentify possible anomalies in positions.The most dynamic banks have supplemented these procedures with profitability indicators forindividual borrowers in order to improve their overall risk-return profiles.Some of the more progressive medium-sized banks use internal rating procedures to support their loanportfolio diversification policies and to establish consistent writedown and provisioning criteria.Personnel training and specialization programmes need to be intensified in order to foster the spreadand acceptance of new methods.6.Specialization profiles of Italian banksWith the spread of innovative techniques of credit risk mitigation, loan portfolios will tend to bemanaged in more dynamic ways than traditionally, when the focus was on selecting borrowers andmaintaining positions until their natural maturity.The forms of lending specialization that emerge clearly today in the Italian banking system are relatedprimarily to the type of borrower, defined in terms of size and product sector. There are importantchanges under way in the composition of loan portfolios: one aspect common to the entire system isthe rapid growth in loans to households, while the pattern of lending to the corporate sector isdiversified.In the nineties loans to households have grown at an average annual rate of around 11 per cent, orabout twice as fast as total lending, and they have risen from 13.8 to 18 per cent of total loans. Withinterest rates declining and productive activity growing only modestly, banks have grasped theopportunities offered by households’ increased demand for credit; at the end of 1998 more than 95 percent of loans to households were held by the banking system, either directly or through subsidiaryfinancial companies.Indicators such as shifts in the market shares of individual banks and the correlation with their interestrates show that competition is intense and growing, partly owing to the entrance into the Italian marketof foreign intermediaries specialized in mortgage lending.
7BIS Review 134/1999The expansion in the volume of business with households has been helped by the spread of technicalforms of lending whereby intermediaries rely to a great extent on credit scoring techniques to selectborrowers.In the consumer credit field, which is characterized by a large number of small transactions, the needto make decisions rapidly and minimize costs encourage the use of automated procedures. In the caseof loans for the purchase of consumer durable goods, the results of credit scoring models arefrequently decisive in deciding whether to lend; in that of personal loans, which are usually for largersums, branch personnel are allowed greater discretion; and, lastly, special agreements coveringspecific groups of borrowers or particular categories of goods are often important.In the case of mortgage loans, the assessment of the desirability of granting a loan hinges both on thecurrent and future ability of the borrower to pay and on the effective value of the collateral.Improvements to the procedures for selecting and monitoring loans to households are possible andnecessary. The proportion of bad debts is high; the impact on banks’ financial situations must beevaluated in the light of the growing share of such lending in their portfolios. Last June - despitefrequent writeoffs of small positions, out-of-court settlements and disposals without recourse tonon-bank companies - 9.4 per cent of household loans were classified as bad debts, as against 8 percent for other loans.As regards loans to enterprises, there has been a shift in their composition: in the eighties the share oflending to small and medium-sized enterprises grew continuously throughout the banking system.Since the early nineties the share of the economic sectors in which small companies predominate, i.e.those for which the average loan was less than 500 million lire at the end of 1997, has fallen at banksinvolved in mergers and acquisitions but has continued to increase for the rest of the system.A similar pattern has already been analyzed in the US banking system, which has seen far-reachingconsolidation in recent years; it merits special attention in view of the importance of small firms inItaly’s industrial fabric. The recent consolidation of the Italian banking system does not allow adefinitive judgment to be passed on the process: the shift in the composition of loan portfolios couldbe the result both of differences in lending policies and of the need to reorganize lending at banks thatare still being integrated; it undoubtedly reflects the need to reduce the riskiness of the loan portfoliosof banks with poor records that have been taken over.The share of long-term credit to enterprises has not changed significantly. Repeated calls have beenmade for enterprises to make more use of medium and long-term financing, which requires banks todevelop more detailed knowledge of borrowers, to make accurate assessments of their earningsprospects, and consider the shocks that they could be exposed to as a result of adverse developments inthe economy or the financial market.In practice lending has continued to be primarily in the form of short-term loans. Last June suchtransactions accounted for 35 per cent of the total credit granted to non-financial companies, basicallyunchanged compared with the preceding years. With reference to the companies surveyed by theCompany Accounts Data Service, lengthening of maturities is restricted mainly to companies incritical conditions that require their debt to be restructured.The tendency of credit to be short-term has often been seen as related to the practice of borrowingfrom several banks, which undermines the discipline the banking system can impose on borrowerscompared with what is possible with relationship banking.The consolidation of the Italian banking system is leading to less fragmented credit relationships; itrequires banks to adjust their policies and organizational arrangements with a view to establishingrelationships with customers in which more attention is paid to their long-term needs and thedevelopment of suitable forms of corporate finance.
BIS Review 134/19998ConclusionsInternational experience clearly shows that the stability of banking systems depends above all on thesolidity of the real economy and its ability to follow a path of sustained and balanced growth.International financial integration offers major opportunities to improve the allocation of savings on aworld scale, accompanied, however, by the risk of unprecedentedly large and sudden systemic crises.Without detracting from the importance of economic and monetary policies or of the action of thebodies entrusted with safeguarding macrofinancial stability, the fundamental aspect consists in thesteps banks take to strengthen their risk-management policies and procedures and to counter thepressure on their margins arising from the growth in competition in national and international markets.In Europe the presence of many large global firms of high standing, the dismantling of the barriersinherent in the denomination of securities in different currencies and the possibility of referring to asingle yield curve will foster the development of the market for private sector securities.For large companies, whose operations cover several national markets and whose financialmanagement involves several different currencies, the new single currency regime will reduce theneed to do business with a plurality of banks. A reduction in the demand for credit from primecompanies appears possible, the spread of private sector securities may cause problems forfund-raising. Though marked by national traits in legal and fiscal matters, the configuration of thefinancial system of the European Union will becorne more similar to that of the Anglo-Saxon systems.The profitability of traditional lending to enterprises is likely to come under pressure; the need todevelop business with different categories of customers and to look for profit opportunities in foreignmarkets will involve both old and new credit risks.The changes under way make it necessary to grasp the growth opportunities offered by corporatefinance services; this will give further impetus to the spread of financial techniques for themanagement of risk and to the growth of the securitization market.The ability to manage risks, above all credit risk, efficiently, will be a competitive strength of crucialimportance; it requires intermediaries to adopt the innovations made possible by today’s statisticalmodels and financial techniques, to integrate them into their internal organizations, and to develop thenecessary professional skills.Active management of the loan portfolio, frequently indicated as the new frontier in lending, cannot beindependent of the effectiveness of the traditional procedures, from the assessment of creditworthinessto the constant monitoring of loan performance.In a market such as Italy’s, in which very little recourse has been made to rating by specializedagencies, banks lacking an internal rating system sound enough to be approved by the supervisoryauthorities would find themselves at a competitive disadvantage. Businesses of high standing wouldstand to obtain better conditions from other banks able to apply capital charges more consistent withthe riskiness of the financing.The revision of the capital adequacy framework is a major challenge for Italian banks. The decisionsregarding the formulation of the systems for classifying credit risk will have to be taken according tothe internationally agreed timetable, in the knowledge that the trend is towards greater use of internalmodels.The Italian banking system has a good knowledge of the world of small and medium-sized enterprisesderiving from its close contact with local economies. In constructing systems for the management ofcredit risk, it can count on statistical sources that are not always available in other countries, such asthe Company Accounts Data Service and the Central Credit Register.Banks are becoming increasingly aware of the challenge; they have the necessary capital, know-howand organizational ability.On the other side the limited availability of external ratings and the small size of the private capitalmarket could prove a serious obstacle to Italian enterprises’ efforts to diversify their sources offinancing and reduce their average cost of borrowing. One is struck, once again, by the competitive
9BIS Review 134/1999disadvantage at which the Italian economy stands owing to the smallness of the share and bondmarkets.The Bank of Italy is stimulating and supporting the efforts of the banking system to modernize itstechniques for managing credit risk. It has taken steps to ensure the proposed new regulations arewidely disseminated and has launched consultations with bankers aimed at jointly assessing thecharacteristics that internal ratings will need to have for prudential purposes.Discussions will also be held with banks as part of normal supervisory activity and the Bank willparticipate in the ad hoc working group set up by ABI, the Italian Bankers’ Association. In addition,the Bank of Italy will be making information available from its archives, above all those of the CentralCredit Register, that will be of help in constructing systems for measuring expected losses on loanportfolios.The Supervision Department is doing research into techniques for measuring capital at risk on thebasis of indicators for the companies surveyed by the Company Accounts Data Service or by usingmeasures of sectoral and locational riskiness to approximate that of borrowers. The estimates ofriskiness obtained in this way have been used in determining the share of bad debts deemed not to berecoverable.These studies are the natural follow-on of the work begun in the early nineties to establish statisticalmethods for measuring the fragility of non-financial companies on the basis of balance-sheet data;further improvements have been made recently by combining the estimates with indicators ofdifficulties in serving loans taken from the Central Credit Register and extending the analysis to asample of rnore than 400,000 companies.The research under way is expected to produce results that will be of help in the analyses and tests thatwill have to be carried out for the validation of the internal rating systems banks adopt.Increasing the competitiveness of the Italian banking system, and of the economy as a whole, requirescontinuous improvements in the methods used for granting and managing credit, and the developmentof the corporate finance services needed to foster small and medium-sized enterprises’ access to thecapital market.It is necessary to capitalize on Italian banks’ greatest strength: the wealth of information andrelationships accumulated over the years in doing business with their customers and turn it to accountin creating effective internal rating systems.I am sure that Italian banks, faced with this new challenge in the most typical of all banking activities,the management of credit, will succeed in developing the instruments and mind-set needed bycompanies operating in markets that have been opened up to competition by the efforts over the lastten years of Parliament, the regulatory authorities and intermediaries themselves.
BIS Review   88/1998Mr. George discusses the prospects for the euro and the attitude towards thesingle currency in the United Kingdom   Speech by the Governor of the Bank of England,Mr. E.A.J. George, given to the Financial Forum of West Flanders in Bruges on 21/10/98.Britain in EuropeIt’s a great pleasure to be here in the beautiful city of Bruges, and I am honored tohave this opportunity to address the Financial Forum here in West Flanders.Mr. Chairman, in just 50 business days’ time - on 1st January next year - elevenEuropean countries will take the long-awaited, truly historic, step of merging their nationalcurrencies into a single “euro”. The United Kingdom will not be among them, but we have a vitalinterest in the euro’s success. I should like to explain to you this evening Britain’s attitude to theeuro, and then say something about the prospects for the new single currency as an element ofstability in today’s turbulent global financial and economic environment.Let me make clear at the outset that, of course, I recognise that monetary union isfundamentally a political issue. It necessarily involves some deliberate further pooling of nationalsovereignty over important issues of public policy - monetary policy and overall fiscal policy - justas the single market involved the pooling of sovereignty over aspects of trade and competition policyand so on.As a central banker I have nothing to say about the politics of monetary union. But itis also, of course, about economics, and the economics of monetary union could go either way. I cansee that if it goes well it will contribute to a broader cohesion within Europe; but equally if theeconomics were to go wrong, then that could blow back on the politics of Europe and give rise totensions. I shall concentrate my remarks this evening on the economics of monetary union.The economic pros and cons have in fact been exhaustively debated in the UnitedKingdom and the arguments are now reasonably well defined, even though different opinionsinevitably attach different weights to them.On the positive side, the crucial and unique economic advantage of monetary union isnominal exchange rate certainty within the euro area - not just the reasonable de facto stability thatmight result from each EU member state individually pursuing disciplined macro-economic policiesin parallel - but nominal exchange rate certainty for the indefinite future. And that is a very realeconomic advantage as any UK exporter who has suffered from the exaggerated strength of sterlingover the past two years or so will readily tell you! One can argue that such exchange rate certainty isnot an essential complement to the European single market - any more than exchange rate fixity isessential to achieving benefits from free trade more generally. But it brings very material benefits -through increased competition as a result of greater transparency of prices and lower transactionscosts, through broader and more liquid financial markets, and through the associated improvement ineconomic resource allocation. And there is no doubt that intra-European exchange rate certainty inparticular will enhance the benefits to be derived from the European single market. Whether or not itis essential, therefore, most people would, I think, agree that, other things equal, the nominalexchange rate certainty that comes with the move to the single European currency is very desirablein this context.What then are the economic arguments against it? Essentially they can besummarised as the risk that the single monetary policy - the single, one-size-fits-all, short-term
- 2 -BIS Review   88/1998interest rate within the euro area, which is a necessary corollary of the single currency - will not inthe event prove to be appropriate to the domestic needs of each of the euro-member countries. Thereis no doubt that such risk exists. It may result from cyclical divergence within the euro area, withsome participating countries needing to stimulate domestic demand while others are alreadyoperating close to capacity. It may arise from differences in fiscal positions even though these are tobe constrained through the Stability and Growth Pact. Or it may result from economic shocks ofsome sort that have a bigger impact on some countries than on others. The rise in oil prices in theearly 1970s or German reunification are classic examples.So the risk of divergent monetary policy needs within the euro area is real. And ifthere were a material divergence of monetary policy needs, that could lead to serious tensions,because alternative adjustment mechanisms, such as labour migration or fiscal redistribution, thatexist within individual countries, and which help to alleviate familiar regional disparities when theyarise at the national level, are simply not well-developed at the pan-European level.The Maastricht Treaty, of course, recognised this risk. The famous convergencecriteria were specifically designed as a means of reducing the risk to manageable proportions byrequiring that, before joining the euro club, countries should have achieved at least a minimumdegree of macro-economic convergence - thereby demonstrating their commitment tomacro-economic discipline both through fiscal consolidation, and through monetary policyconsistently directed at effective price, and exchange rate, stability. And all member countries of theEuropean Union have certainly made great progress towards macro-economic stability over the pastfew years.This has, of course, been a matter of national economic self-interest. But there is nodoubt that the goal of monetary union, and the Maastricht criteria, provided a very powerful externalincentive for many countries - indeed it is barely conceivable that anything like so much progresswould have been achieved across the Continent without this incentive. It is a remarkabledemonstration of political commitment that the eleven participating countries - against all the oddsas seen only a couple of years ago - could reasonably have been judged to have met the criteria,enabling the Heads of Government to agree to the launch of a broadly based monetary union at theirmeeting in Brussels in May.But the risk of divergent domestic policy needs - or of potential regional tensionswithin the single currency area - did not simply disappear during that momentous weekend inBrussels.Remaining cyclical differences are reflected in the persistence of interest ratedifferentials among the first eleven, which will, of course, have to be eliminated by the end of theyear. It may then prove necessary in some countries for fiscal policy to be tighter than wouldotherwise be necessary in order to offset the easing of monetary policy as a result of the move to asingle interest rate.Even without that, a number of Euroland countries enter monetary union with veryhigh ratios of public debt to GDP. And virtually all - to varying degrees - face the prospective burdenon their public finances of ageing populations. All of this means that there will be a continuing needfor rigorous fiscal discipline throughout the area well into the future - as was very clearly recognisedin the EMI’s Convergence Report. That indeed is very much the purpose of the Stability and GrowthPact.
- 3 -BIS Review   88/1998And the potential for external shocks, with asymmetrical effects on differentEuroland countries, of course remains.A particular worry is that macro-economic stability - vitally necessary though it is -will not, on its own, be sufficient to prevent the persistence of unacceptably high levels ofunemployment in a number of the major Continental European economies. Unemployment has beenfor some considerable time, and remains, much the most urgent and important economic issueconfronting us in Europe. I do not suggest for a moment that the right answer would be to abandonmacro-economic discipline and revert to old-fashioned demand management policies. In anythingother than the very short term that would be likely to make matters worse. I share the broadconsensus view that Europe’s unemployment problems originate essentially in rigidities on thesupply-side of the economy. The point is that unless we are all more successful in bringing down thisstructural unemployment, through micro-economic policies designed to improve structural, supply-side flexibility, then some countries could find it difficult to continue to live with a common macro-economic discipline without significant tensions. The nagging doubt is whether the necessarycommitment to fiscal discipline, alongside monetary stability, will prove - in the terms of theMaastricht Treaty - to be sustainable.Some people who basically recognise this concern are inclined to argue that if a euro-participating country were to find itself in this situation - and given that it would have no macro-economic way out, for example, through exchange rate adjustment, or monetary relaxation, or fiscalstimulus beyond the limits of the Stability and Growth Pact - then it would have an overwhelmingincentive to take the sort of supply-side measures which have proved so difficult to implementhitherto. As one of my colleagues once put it to me “when we have exhausted all other possiblepolicy options, we will finally be forced to do what we know to be the right thing!” And thepopulations in those countries would it is true have a similar incentive to accept structural change. Iam not sure how far one can rely upon that. But it does in any event serve to emphasise thatsupply-side flexibility will be more crucially important than ever in the context of monetary union.I should emphasise at this point, Mr. Chairman, that I am not predicting that therewill necessarily be serious tensions within the single currency area. There will no doubt be policychallenges - there always are, with or without monetary union. But it is difficult for anyone to predicthow serious the problems will in fact turn out to be. I am simply describing the sort of economicrisks which might occur, and which have been identified in the debate about monetary union in theUnited Kingdom as the potential downside to be set against the potential benefits of nominalexchange rate certainty which I touched upon earlier. You here in Belgium may think that these risksare sometimes exaggerated - you have after all been effectively in de facto monetary union withGermany for some considerable time. But I don’t think one can reasonably argue, certainly in thecase of a larger country, that the risks can be ignored.It was against the background of this kind of economic debate that the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer announced a year ago that the United Kingdom would exercise its opt-out and notparticipate in the first wave of euro membership. That was a disappointment to some of ourEuropean partners. But it was a considerable relief to others, because UK participation from theoutset would undoubtedly have complicated the project - not least because of the substantial cyclicaldivergence between ourselves and the major countries on the Continent.But the Chancellor also made it clear that the present British Government is notopposed to euro membership as a matter of principle; it will make its decision on pragmaticgrounds - the test being whether membership would be in our economic interests; and it would
- 4 -BIS Review   88/1998submit that decision to Parliament and to the British people in a referendum. The Chancellorrecognised that - barring some fundamental and unforeseen change in economic circumstances - itwas unrealistic to think that a decision could be made during the lifetime of the present Parliament -and that could extend to May 2002. But he stressed that in the meantime the United Kingdom shouldprepare - both for the euro’s introduction on the Continent on 1 January 1999 and for our owneventual participation.This statement was the first by a British Government to accept the principle ofmonetary union. It implied that the United Kingdom is to be regarded effectively as a “Pre-In”. Itrecognised that the single currency will affect us whether we are in or out of it, and that it is clearlyin our national interest to do all that we can to help ensure that the euro is successful.This, in my view, provides a solid foundation for a continuing, positive andconstructive relationship between the United Kingdom and other EU member states, including thoseparticipating in the first wave of the euro. And that must be in the interest of both sides: just as webenefit from a stable and prosperous Europe, so too the Continental European interest lies in a stableand prosperous Britain - and that mutual interest above all is the thing we must all hold on to. Toallow the euro to become a divisive factor in the broader relationship between European Unionmember states would be to cut off our collective nose to spite our collective face!What then can the United Kingdom bring, initially as an ‘out’, or ‘pre-in’, to theEuropean party, in terms of contributing to the euro’s success?There are, I think, two things in particular.First, we can continue to pursue macro-economic - both monetary and fiscal -discipline alongside the euro-area countries. The Government is committed to that course as a matterof national economic self-interest, but it reflects the same philosophy as that which underlies theMaastricht Treaty.One of its very first acts in Government, for example, was to give operationalindependence for the conduct of monetary policy to the Bank of England, and we have been set theobjective of delivering, consistently, underlying retail price inflation of 2½%. That objective appearsto be compatible with the ECB’s target for the European Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices ofless than 2% - in fact while we are, on the most recent data, precisely on track in terms of our owntarget measure, our inflation rate in terms of the harmonised index is down to 1.3%. And on thefiscal side the Government has committed itself both to maintaining the debt to GDP ratio at a stableand prudent level over the economic cycle and to the “golden rule” (under which public sectorborrowing is limited to the financing of investment). These fiscal rules, too, are broadly consistentwith those established for euro-member countries under the Stability and Growth Pact, and willensure that we continue to comply with the Maastricht Treaty fiscal criteria.These macro-economic policies - together with continuing structural reforms toimprove supply-side flexibility - are calculated to make the United Kingdom a more prosperoustrading partner and to ensure that we do not disrupt the policies and the economy of the rest ofEurope. More than that they are calculated to encourage sustainable economic convergence with therest of Europe as a necessary precursor to our eventual adherence of the euro club.Secondly, Mr. Chairman, the United Kingdom can contribute directly to thedevelopment of the euro through the City of London’s financial markets. To take its place alongside
- 5 -BIS Review   88/1998the dollar, the euro needs well developed, pan-European, financial markets. And providing liquid,transparent, competitive and innovative, but well-regulated, financial markets is one of the thingsthat the City of London does particularly well.The City’s strength derives from being a uniquely international financial centre, inwhich the strongest financial businesses from all parts of the world - including from all parts of theEuropean Union - are represented. There are more banks in the City incorporated abroad, forexample, than domestic banks. And more than half the total deposit base (over £1 trillion equivalent)of the UK banking system is denominated in foreign currencies. And while the current globalfinancial turbulence is taking its toll on employment in some financial services activities in Londonas elsewhere, the longer-term trend is for the foreign presence - including that from European partnercountries - to continue to increase.The Bank of England has been working intensively with the City for the past fewyears to ensure that it is as thoroughly prepared for the start of the euro next year as the financialcentres in any of the participating countries. We will be ready to provide financial servicesdenominated in euro to all those that want them from day one. And we are already taking theinitiative with our European partners in creating regional market structures, as you see, for example,in the talks between the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse, which are designed to laythe foundations for an inclusive, pan-European, equity market. You will be able to account, tradeand settle in euro-denominated assets in London just as you can now in Deutsche Mark or Frenchfrancs or dollars or yen. The financial markets of the City are our wedding present to the euromarriage partners. They are not just a national - but a European - asset.There are, of course, some here on the Continent who regard this role of the City assomething of a mixed blessing - perhaps even a threat rather than a promise. There is a view that theeuro should somehow ‘belong’ exclusively to the participating countries and that its introductionshould be used as an opportunity to confer competitive advantage on national financial centreswithin the euro area. If that view were to prevail the main effect would be to inhibit the developmentof the euro as an international trading and portfolio currency, reducing one of the single currency’smajor benefits to both investors and borrowers within the euro area itself.In practice in today’s world of globally integrated markets and liberalised capitalflows there is very little prospect of being able to impose artificial constraints on the internationaluse of the euro. There will inevitably be active euro markets in all the major financial centres,including London. And it is in the interest of financial activity right across Europe that there shouldbe. Like trade in goods, trade in financial services is a positive sum game, so that London’s successis not a threat to other European financial centres. As a major interface between Europe and the restof the world I have little doubt that euro-activity in London will mean more rather than less euroactivity in other European financial centres like Frankfurt, Paris, Milan, Amsterdam or Brussels. Andconversely I have little doubt either that what is good for those centres will be good too for the City.I hope, Mr. Chairman, that I have said enough to persuade at least some of you thatBritish hesitations about participating in the euro from the outset are not just plain obstinacy! Out ofthe first wave we may be - indeed we are - but we remain very much an active and, I would hope, aconstructive partner in the process of European monetary integration in a wider sense, and we clearlywant the euro to succeed. That is why I prefer to think of Britain in Europe which I took as the titlefor my talk.
- 6 -BIS Review   88/1998Let me conclude, Mr. Chairman, with just a few remarks on the prospects for theeuro in the current climate of global financial turmoil.For much of the past two years or so financial markets have shown a degree ofscepticism about the future character of the euro. The sense, from about the autumn of 1996,appeared to be that the process was being driven by the politics of Europe with less emphasis on theimportance of economic convergence; expectations therefore increasingly focused upon the prospectof a broadly-based rather than a narrower euro; and the inference was drawn that this would mean aweaker rather than a strong euro. Together with comparatively subdued economic activity on theContinent, this perception - or misperception - meant that the core European currencies were for atime relatively weak against the dollar, and against sterling.That situation has more recently begun to change. Market scepticism has diminishedwith the growing realization that the European Central Bank will in fact be rigorous in pursuit of itsmandate of maintaining effective price stability throughout the euro area as a whole - that the eurowill in fact be soundly managed. And at the same time domestic demand growth and economicactivity have started to pick up in the core European countries, causing the euro-currenciescollectively to strengthen in the foreign exchange market and helpfully easing some of the cyclicaltensions that might otherwise have complicated the move to a single monetary policy.All this is now overlaid by the successive financial shocks to the global economyfrom Asia, from Russia, and most recently from the need to rescue Long-Term Capital ManagementFund (LTCM).In practice the euro currencies have been remarkably stable in relation to each otherin the face of these shocks - demonstrating the market’s total conviction, in the words of one marketparticipant recently that “the euro is a done deal”. The euro area has in fact been a zone of stabilityin turbulent currency markets - and that performance puts in proper perspective earlier excited talkabout spectators waiting to rip the euro apart. That never was in my view a serious issue, given thepolitical commitment to the process - the economic issue has, as I say, been about the sort ofregional tensions that might subsequently emerge.The big questions now - for all of us, not just for the euro countries - are, first, andmost immediately whether we can avoid new financial shocks; and, secondly, how we shouldmanage the economic fall out from the financial shocks that have already occurred.Developments since the IMF/IBRD meetings in Washington have in my view beenquite encouraging. The Japanese financial package is reassuring, and the strengthening of the Yenhas brought welcome relief to much of the rest of Asia. United States Congressional approval of theIMF quota increase and of the New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB) has paved the way to a vitallynecessary increase in IMF resources. Brazil - which has been widely seen as the next potentialemerging market domino - is clearly committed to taking strong corrective domestic policy action,which would command broad international support. And while there evidently has been a sharpcontraction of wholesale market lending, within the financial sector in particular, in the UnitedStates, and suggestions there of a possible wider credit crunch, no new problems on anything like thescale of LTCM have in fact been uncovered. We are certainly not yet out of the wood, but thefinancial situation looks rather better than might have been expected two or three weeks ago.If we can avoid a new financial shock - and I am hopeful that we will - we still haveto manage the global economic slowdown already underway. In that context there has been a good
- 7 -BIS Review   88/1998deal of talk about concerted interest rate cuts in Europe and the United States to stimulate domesticdemand and offset the effects of recession elsewhere. And it is true that those effects - both lowerworld commodity prices and falling external demand - do mean that interest rates in the industrialcountries generally can be lower than they would otherwise be, which in turn will help to sustainglobal demand. But we do not all start from the same point. Rates have in fact been cut in the UnitedStates and the United Kingdom, where underlying domestic demand growth also shows signs ofslowing. In Continental Europe, on the other hand, domestic demand growth has, as I say, beenpicking up. But even here interest rates have already come down in some of the smaller countriesand are likely to be generally lower than they would have been in the absence of the globalslowdown. Markets are, in fact, now expecting rates to converge by the end of the year on Germanrates, where only a couple of months ago, they expected convergence at significantly higher rates.None of this, Mr. Chairman, it seems to me need affect the prospect for the euro - ifanything it may reinforce the more recent firmer tone of the euro currencies. It would only add topotential tensions within the euro area if the global economic weakness had a disproportionateimpact on some member countries as against others. Although, therefore, the present internationalclimate is less than ideal for the euro’s introduction, that does not alter my conclusion that the newcurrency will indeed prove to be a stable element in an uncertain world, and that continuing growthof the European economy will help to ensure that the present slowdown does not develop into globalrecession. And that is clearly in everyone’s interest.
BIS Review   48/1998Mr. Carse reviews the impact of the Asian crisis on the Hong Kong bankingsector   Speech by the Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Mr. DavidCarse, at the Sixth Conference on Pacific Basin Business, Economics and Finance in Hong Kong on28/5/98.I am pleased to have the opportunity to talk to you about the impact of the Asianfinancial crisis on the Hong Kong banking sector.The Asian financial crisis is one year old this month, though this is a birthday that wedo not want to celebrate. The crisis can be dated from late May when the Thai Baht came undersevere pressure. A renewed attack in early July, while we were celebrating the success of theHandover in Hong Kong, led to the floating of the Baht, which promptly plunged in value. Thecontagion then spread to neighbouring economies, and although Hong Kong was for a time immune,it eventually reached us too.Explaining the origins and causes of the Asian crisis has become a major growthindustry and I have no intention of adding to the debate today. Suffice to say that one point on whichalmost all the commentators are agreed is that weakness in banking systems in the region has beenone of the main reasons which explains the intensity of the crisis and the speed with which it tookhold. In the words of Alan Greenspan, “what turns otherwise seemingly minor imbalances into acrisis is an actual or anticipated disruption to the liquidity or solvency of the banking system”. Whenbanks are already weak, for example because of a high level of non-performing loans, an externalshock such as an attack on the currency will further damage confidence in the banking system.Banks will lose domestic deposits and will find themselves unable to rollover short-term externalborrowing. The resultant capital outflows will put further downward pressure on the exchange rate,force up interest rates and drive down asset prices. The customers to whom banks have lent will getinto financial difficulties, further weakening the position of the banks. With their capital andliquidity impaired, the banks are in no position to lend, and this leads to the “credit-crunch”, andresultant shrinkage of the real economy that we are seeing in so many countries in the region.The reasons for the banking sector weaknesses are various. Lending excesses droveup asset prices and allowed companies to become over-leveraged. Poor risk management on the partof the banks themselves was compounded by ineffective banking supervision and lack oftransparency which provided little scope for market discipline to be exercised until the problemswere glaringly obvious. At that point, the market reaction was extreme. Even if supervisors did havethe will to tackle banking sector problems in their countries, they were often subject to politicalinterference that stood in the way of prompt corrective action. Government influence also directedbank lending into uneconomic projects and non-viable companies. This government involvementlent credence to the view that regional banks were effectively government guaranteed, which made iteasier for these banks to borrow in the global interbank market. This provided the fuel for theirresponsible lending which took place.Hong Kong did not suffer from these structural and systemic weaknesses. But it is thecase that imbalances had emerged in the economy, and this became particularly evident during 1997as confidence grew that the Handover would proceed smoothly - as indeed it did. This was reflectedin soaring residential property prices - up by an average of 48% during the year to October 1997 -and a record level for the Hang Seng Index of 16,820 in August 1997. The boom in asset values wasto a large extent financed by the banks.The sharp escalation in asset prices and in bank lending was clearly unsustainable. Adownward adjustment would have been necessary and would have happened sooner or later. All thatwas required was an external shock to bring it about. This of course is precisely what happened in
- 2 -BIS Review   48/1998the third week of October when the Hong Kong dollar came under speculative attack. The operationof our currency board system meant that the sales of the Hong Kong dollar depleted the clearingbalances which the banks maintain with the HKMA for settlement purposes and the resultantshortage of liquidity caused interest rates to rise sharply. You will recall that the overnight ratereached 280% on 23 October 1997. Although the overnight rate quickly subsided, term ratesremained high for some weeks thereafter and the stock market experienced considerable volatilityand property prices fell. Renewed exchange rate pressure in January again saw interest rates spikeupwards, though the reaction this time was less severe. Nonetheless an inverse yield curve persistedduring much of January with the interbank rates higher than the prime lending rate.Also during this period, the banks have had to contend with the blows to confidencefrom continuing regional upheavals, most notably the liquidity crisis in Korea around the turn of theyear and the dramatic events in Indonesia which are still being played out. Coupled with mountingevidence that the domestic economy is slowing down, it is not surprising that the banks in HongKong are going through more difficult times. The severity of the Asian crisis is a once-in-a-lifetimeevent and no banking system in the region can hope to be unaffected by it. There is bound to be animpact on the banks’ funding and liquidity, their loan growth, their asset quality and ultimately theirprofitability. Apart from the effect on individual banks, the Asian crisis will also have repercussionson Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre, given that so many regional andinternational banks affected by the crisis are based here.How precisely has the Asian crisis impacted on banks in Hong Kong? In the firstplace, banks have become much more conscious about the need to remain liquid. The spikes ininterest rates that occurred in October 1997 and in January 1998 have made the banks more reluctantto rely on borrowing from the interbank market to meet their funding needs. This is because of theinterest rate risk that this entails and because of the reduced amount of funds in the market that areavailable to be borrowed. In particular, the supply of funds to the longer maturities in the interbankmarket has greatly diminished. Banks that do have liquidity prefer to place it at very short term, evenovernight, to ensure that it is readily available. The banks also wish to improve, or at least avoidfurther deterioration in, their loan to deposit ratios. Taking the various factors together, there is nowmuch greater competition for customer deposits than there was six months ago. This is not confinedto the smaller banks: the large banks and the foreign banks are also involved. It is happening at atime when the overall growth in customer deposits has slowed down in line with the economy.The effect of this is evident in the additional margin over HIBOR which banks areprepared to pay in order to attract deposits. This clearly has an effect on profitability: the net interestmargin of the local banks fell to 2.33% (annualised) in the first quarter of this year compared with2.43% in 1997 as a whole. The banks are caught in a vicious circle. On the one hand they want toboost or at least maintain their liquidity. But if they do this by paying over HIBOR for deposits thatthey then place in the overnight interbank market at HIBOR, this is clearly costing them money.Banks do have the option of not paying the going market rate for deposits. But if they do this theircustomers may go elsewhere. The deposit base is therefore less stable than it was.The banks’ desire to stay liquid also means that they are more cautious about lending.Generally speaking, they will want to lend only if they can raise the deposits to do so, and depositsare growing more slowly. This caution also reflects their perception that credit risks have increasedin the current economic environment. Of course, the demand for borrowing has also declined as theeconomy has slowed and the property and stock markets have weakened. But the supply of loanablefunds has probably fallen even more, partly because of the decision of some foreign banks to cutback their lending in Hong Kong. This does not represent a loss of confidence by these banks inHong Kong. Rather, it reflects the need of some banks to downsize their balance sheets and toconcentrate more in the future on profitability rather than volume growth and market share. It also
- 3 -BIS Review   48/1998reflects the fact that some banks are wanting to cut back on their Asian exposure and Hong Kong isone of the few markets where it is possible to do so.This will have the benefit, from the local banks’ point of view, that it will push uplending margins; and over time this will attract more banks back into the market and encourage themto lend. But the appetite for new lending is likely to remain subdued in the short-term.As already mentioned, the fear of increased bad debts is another factor which ismaking the banks wary about increasing their credit exposure. The combination of regionaldifficulties and domestic slowdown makes it inevitable that asset quality will deteriorate this year. Inthe first quarter of the year there was a noticeable rise in loans overdue for more than 3 months,although as a percentage of total loans the figure for the local banks (less than 2%) is still reasonableby international, let alone, regional standards. As to how much worse the situation will get as we gothrough the year, it is difficult to say. But we can take comfort from the fact that although loanarrears in the all-important residential mortgage market are creeping up, the amounts involved arestill very small in percentage terms (only around 0.3% of the local banks’ mortgage portfolio atend-March). Even if property prices do fall further, there is a strong incentive for homeowners tocontinue to service their mortgages.The main problem loans we have seen so far have been in the corporate sector and intrade finance. Some companies have run into unavoidable problems because of the regional situationwhile others may have over-extended themselves. However, it is worth noting that the corporatesector in general in Hong Kong has avoided the excesses seen in the rest of the region. In general,companies in Hong Kong are not highly leveraged compared with their counterparts in the regionand have not poured resources into an indiscriminate build-up of fixed assets. The banks have alsotended to follow more prudent lending policies than those elsewhere and are better protected by theirability to take and realise good collateral. We do not therefore expect to see the collapse of assetquality that has occurred in some regional economies where corporates and the banks have also hadto contend with massive exchange rate depreciation.The local banks in Hong Kong also have the benefit of the cushion provided by theirhigh capital adequacy ratios. This means that even if the banks do have to make higher provisionsthis year, it will be their profitability rather than their solvency that is affected. While lowerprofitability is by no means welcome, it is not, by itself, a cause for concern in terms of the stabilityof the banking system.It is important to keep in mind that the local banks are still making money so far thisyear despite the more difficult operating conditions. Equally, you will not be surprised to hear thatprofits are generally lower than the same period of last year due to a combination of increasedfunding costs, flat lending volume and increased bad debt provisions. The outlook for the year as awhole is uncertain. If banks can record the same profits as last year, they will be doing very well.Certainly, nobody should have exaggerated expectations about the 1998 outturn. It will be a toughyear, but I am confident that the banks can manage their way through it.What kind of strategy are the banks adopting to achieve this? I have alreadymentioned some of the steps: namely, to build up liquidity and to be more selective and cautious intheir lending. Loan review and collection procedures are being stepped up to ensure that banks canidentify problem loans at an early stage and take action to safeguard their position. Banks are alsobeing more proactive in their asset and liability management, particularly in terms of their fundingstrategy and how to price their deposits against the competition. Although banks in Hong Kong arehighly efficient in terms of the cost-income ratio, the pressure on revenues means that they need topay even more attention to costs. A number of banks have therefore frozen headcount and some have
- 4 -BIS Review   48/1998felt obliged to lay off staff. Some branches have been closed. This is an unfortunate aspect of theadjustment process that Hong Kong is currently undergoing.However, not all the moves are purely defensive. Banks are also trying to find waysof delivering products and services to customers more cheaply and efficiently, for example throughtelephone call centres, electronic banking and segmentation of the branch network. There is alsomore emphasis on using the branch networks to cross-sell other products such as unit trusts andinsurance so as to build up non-interest income. Geographically, ambitions to expand in the regionhave obviously been dampened by the financial crisis. But there is a wide recognition that theMainland of China offers substantial opportunities for banks in Hong Kong both to develop newbusiness and to expand their relationship with existing customers.Underlying all the banks’ strategies at present must be the recognition that the Year2000 issue has to be tackled successfully. This is an issue of basic business survival. I believe thatbanks in Hong Kong are aware of this and are working actively to meet the HKMA’s deadline ofend-December 1998 to achieve Year 2000 compliance.How is Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre going to be affectedby what is happening in the region? It is clear that the number of foreign institutions in Hong Kongwill shrink to some extent. A number of foreign banks have already given up their banking licencesbut this has been largely due to problems in their home market or mergers with other institutions.The Asian crisis is likely to result in further rationalisation among the banks from the region as theyare merged and restructured in their home countries. The reduction in business activities such assyndicated lending and trading in regional debt securities may cause other marginal players to leaveHong Kong, simply because they can no longer make money.However, I am sure that the bulk of foreign banks remain committed to Hong Kongand will want to retain a substantial presence here. This is not wishful thinking, but rather foundedon hard logic. First, it simply does not make sense to suggest that within the space of a few monthsAsia, as a whole, has become less relevant to banks with global aspirations. Second, within Asia,Hong Kong retains its unique attractions as the main centre for banks to do business with China.Leaving aside short-term cyclical fluctuations, the economy of the Mainland is clearly on an upwardpath. Foreign, and indeed local, banks will want to share in the financing and advisory opportunitieswhich this brings, and Hong Kong will remain the best location from which to launch theseactivities. The costs of doing business in Hong Kong must however be reasonable; and that it is whythe current adjustment process is necessary as well as painful. I am sure that the Hong Kong bankingsector will not only survive the process, but also go on from strength to strength in the future.
Mr. George discusses macro-economic sustainability in the United KingdomSpeech by the Governor of the Bank of England, Mr. E.A.J. George, at the Chemical IndustriesAssociation: Business Outlook Conference Dinner in London on 14/1/98.I am particularly pleased to be associated with your conference theme ofsustainability. The central banker’s mantra, with which we start our daily prayer meetings, is:“Price stability is a necessary condition for sustainable growth”And sustainable growth we see as effectively synonymous with the long-termmacro-economic prosperity which is what we are, of course, all seeking to achieve.Now I suspect the same is true at the micro-economic level - the level of theindividual firm.There are certainly differences between your perspective and ours. You, in thechemical industry, for example, know what you are doing! I mean you know precisely what you aredoing at least in your production processes - where our business is much less precise - a behaviouralrather than an exact science, if it is a science at all.And you are properly concerned with - indeed responsible to shareholders for - thelong-term prosperity of your individual businesses. Whereas we - much as we would wish to see youall succeed individually - are concerned with stability and sustainable growth, leading to long-termprosperity, in the economy as a whole.Even so, I’d find it surprising if, at the micro-economic level, you, too, did not alsosee sustainability and long-term profitability as necessarily complementary objectives rather thanconflicting objectives. In any event, I take macro-economic sustainability as the theme for myremarks this evening.Many people think that - because the objective of monetary policy is typicallynowadays defined by governments in terms of permanently low inflation - that is seen as an end initself.But in fact, as I say, we see low inflation - effective price stability - not just as an endin itself but rather as a means to the end of sustainable growth and macro-economic prosperity.Rising prices - across the board - are essentially a reflection of imbalance betweenaggregate demand in the economy and its supply-side capacity to meet that demand.There is not much frankly that we can do - directly - to affect the supply-side capacityof the economy. That is a function of its structural characteristics, including the productive abilities ofboth sides of industry, which can be influenced over time by the whole raft of government policies.Monetary policy operates essentially on the demand side - aiming to keep the growthin aggregate demand more or less continuously in line with the underlying, sustainable growth in thesupply-side capacity of the economy.I probably need not remind an industrial audience what happens if we get it wrongand let demand run ahead of supply. The inevitable result is accelerating inflation, with all thedamage that can cause - by distorting the outcome of investment decisions and obscuring the relativeprice signals that direct resource allocation.BIS Review   3/1998
- 2 -In the end we know that demand has to be brought back under control. The choicetypically is not whether or not to tighten policy but whether to tighten sooner or later; and there is astrong presumption that by tightening sooner - before excess demand really takes hold - we will needto tighten less - to moderate the pace of growth of demand rather than bring it to a shuddering halt oreven send it in reverse.Too often in the past the mistake has been to tighten policy too little and too late,contributing to an exaggerated, boom and bust, economic cycle and thereby encouraging an undulyshort-term approach to both financial and physical investment.So in trying to maintain effective price stability, in trying consistently to achieve theGovernment’s inflation target, of 2½% for underlying retail price inflation, what we are really tryingto do is to achieve economic stability in the much wider sense of ensuring that aggregate demandgrows in line with our productive potential. If we are successful in that, then the financial andbusiness communities will become more confident of making longer-term decisions, and in that waywe can contribute indirectly to improving the underlying supply-side of the economy.This objective is now very widely understood and accepted. But it is, of course, muchmore easily said than done.Since the recession of the early 1990s we have in fact been reasonably successful inmaintaining this broader economic stability in this country. Inflation has been brought down to, andmaintained at, the lowest rate we have seen in a generation; but, even more important, we have alsoseen relatively steady growth over this period and a sustained and very welcome fall inunemployment.But it has to be recognised that the going is now becoming more difficult, for twomain reasons.The first is that we began the present period of expansion in 1992 with a good deal ofslack, or spare capacity, in the economy - following the recession - and that slack has now been moreor less reabsorbed.In the past year, in particular, the pace of expansion has picked up, to close to 4%,under the impact particularly of strong domestic demand, and that is well above any realistic estimateof the sustainable rate - the underlying rate of growth of supply-side capacity. And this is showing upin the labour market in evidence of skills shortages and in some signs of higher pay settlements andearnings.If we are not now to run into a period of excess demand and accelerating inflation, therate of growth of the overall economy needs to moderate - quite soon and quite sharply.And it almost certainly will moderate during the course of this year, and may indeedhave begun to do so. The growth of domestic demand is likely to be held back by the relatively tightfiscal policy as well as by the monetary policy tightening since May; and the effect this year of“windfalls” as a result of building societies’ demutualisations will be very much smaller.And we expect a deterioration in our net external trade position as a result of thestrength of sterling’s exchange rate and now, too, as a result of the recent developments in Asia.The difficult questions for policy relate to the timing and the extent of the slowdownthat is necessary on the one hand and likely on the other. These are difficult judgements at any time.They are particularly difficult when the economy is already close to full capacity. It is not surprisingBIS Review   3/1998
- 3 -that commentators differ in degree in their assessments. Economics is not - as I say - a precisescience. Neither we at the Bank nor anyone else know with any great precision exactly where we arein relation to full capacity or exactly how fast capacity is growing; and we don’t know preciselyeither how demand will in fact respond to the policy tightening that is already in place. Our ownbest - and very carefully informed - guess is embodied in the forecasts that we publish each quarter,and we monitor immensely carefully the new information that becomes available day by day in thelight of that forecast for early warning signs of emerging imbalance.The second major difficulty in our present situation relates to the strength of theexchange rate. We are, of course, acutely aware of the problems that this is creating - and has beencreating for the past year or so - for those sectors of the economy that are engaged in internationaltrade and exposed to international competition. Given that the UK chemical industry exports nearlytwo-thirds of its output, and that this country imports nearly 60% of the chemicals we consume, it isjust possible that one or two of you are suffering from the strong exchange rate. I only ask you tobelieve that we both understand and share your concern. From a macro-economic standpoint it is - asI say - important that the pace of growth of aggregate demand should slacken. But it is clearly notdesirable - either in terms of sustainability or in terms of the balance of the economy - that theslowdown should simply be a result of a sharp deterioration in our balance of payments. Ourproblem, potentially, is excess domestic demand.And that is the root of the dilemma. We have needed to tighten policy to moderate thestrength of domestic demand. That has no doubt contributed to the continuing strength of theexchange rate - although you can’t plausibly explain anything like all of that strength in terms ofrelative interest rate movements here and abroad. It certainly has a good deal to do with marketperceptions about the future strength of the euro.We can, and have, and I hope will, take account of the exchange rate in our tacticalapproach to monetary policy. But with the best will in the world, what we cannot sensibly do, is toignore the strength of domestic demand in order to shelter the exposed sectors. That would put thewhole of the economy at risk to accelerating inflation - including those sectors we were seeking toprotect. And it would not be of much help to them in anything other than the short term. Themonetary policy option is - as I say - not whether or not, it is sooner or later, and ultimately less ormore.The elements of hope that I can hold out to you - and central bankers can never giveguarantees on this kind of thing - are first, that as we move into the euro process the markets willbecome increasingly persuaded that the ECB will, in fact, be committed to the stability of the newcurrency, as I am sure it will: and, secondly, that relative monetary conditions will change as activitypicks up on the Continent and domestic demand moderates in this country.Our present exchange rate dilemma, Mr. Chairman, illustrates rather well theconflicting arguments about the euro project itself.The strengthening of sterling and its effect on the exposed sectors of the economypoint up very vividly the very real advantages of the exchange rate certainty across the EuropeanUnion area which only the euro can provide. If I were going through what many of you are nowgoing through in your individual businesses, I think I would find the prospect of exchange ratecertainty overwhelmingly attractive - given of course a reasonable starting point.The potential downside, from a macro-economic standpoint, is that just as nowdirecting monetary policy to lowering the exchange rate would mean losing control over domesticdemand, so too, as a member of the euro area we might find that the single euro interest rate was notnecessarily appropriate to our domestic situation. We would certainly be facing a build-up of excessBIS Review   3/1998
- 4 -demand, and inflationary pressure, now, for example, if we were constrained to German-level interestrates. At other times interest rates that were appropriate in Europe as a whole could imposeunnecessary stagnation and rising unemployment in this country.Serious divergence of this kind between the domestic monetary policy needs withinthe euro-area is not, of course, inevitable. But, if it is to be avoided it is important that the economiesof the euro-member countries should have shown at least a minimum degree of sustainableconvergence - before the project goes ahead. That was recognised very clearly in the famousconvergence criteria written into the Maastricht Treaty.Assessing the extent to which sustainable convergence has in fact been achieved is theunenviable task facing the European Finance Ministers and Heads of Government at their historicmeeting at the beginning of May. Whatever they decide more widely, it is clear in my view that, for anumber of reasons, including the cyclical differences between our situation and that on the Continent,we cannot now be confident that this country could live reasonably comfortably with a singleEuropean interest rate. That is why I welcomed the Government’s decision last October to exercise,for the time being, our opt-out, but to plan the technical preparation for our future participation, whenwe are more confident that sustainable convergence has indeed been achieved.BIS Review   3/1998
Mr. Meyer discusses the economic outlook and the challenges facingmonetary policy in the United States   Remarks by Mr. Laurence H. Meyer, a member of theBoard of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Forecasters Club of New York on24/4/97.It is a pleasure to be here and discuss the economic outlook and monetary policywith fellow forecasters. I am going to offer some interpretations of the outlook as a context forthe recent policy action by the Federal Reserve and explain how I view this action as part of aprudent and systematic strategy for monetary policy. The Forecasters Club of New York is anideal forum for me to offer this commentary because, in my view, the recent policy action mustbe understood not in terms of where the economy has been recently, but rather in terms of thechange in the forecast, a change in expectations about where the economy likely would be in sixor twelve months in the absence of a policy change.Before proceeding, let me emphasize that the views on the economic outlook andmonetary policy strategy I present this afternoon are my own. I am not speaking for either theFOMC or the Board of Governors or for any other individual members. If you want to know theviews of the FOMC, you will have to do your homework–-for example, read the announcementissued at the end of the last FOMC meeting, the Humphrey Hawkins testimony of the Chairman,the speeches and other comments by the full complement of participants in the FOMC, and theminutes of the last meeting when they become available.First, I shall discuss some aspects of the analytical framework or model thatunderlies my forecast, which in turn underpins my reasoning for the recent policy action.Second, I’ll discuss the outlook context of the policy decision. Third, I’ll describe the evolutionof policy from a period of steady policy and asymmetric directives to the recent preemptiveaction. Fourth, I’ll offer several interpretations of the policy action in relation to what I believeare important aspects of the strategy of monetary policy. Finally, I’ll discuss some of the factorsthat will influence my views of the appropriate course of policy in the months ahead.The Analytical FrameworkLet me remind you at the outset of the framework I have been using to explain thechallenge facing monetary policy in the current environment of healthy growth and high levelsof resource utilization. The risk of higher inflation in this environment has two dimensions.First, there is the risk that current utilization rates are already so high that inflation willgradually increase over time. Second, there is the risk that the growth in output will be abovetrend going forward, implying that utilization rates will rise from their already high level,compounding the risk of higher inflation.Some apparently believe there are no speed limits, and no utilization rate can beso elevated that it threatens higher inflation. The reality is that above-trend growth raisesutilization rates and, after some point, excessively high utilization rates result in higher inflation.But it is also true that threshold utilization rates and trend growth can change, that the currentthreshold levels for both utilization and growth rates are uncertain, that inflation can be affectedby factors other than excess demand, and that policy is not infallible. Such uncertainty is a factof life for both forecasters and policymakers. Just as forecasters do not stop forecasting becausethe job is difficult, policymakers have to adjust to uncertainty and not be paralyzed by it.BIS Review   48/1997
- 2 -The recent Federal Reserve policy action was clearly a preemptive one. Thismeans that it was undertaken not in response to where the economy and inflation were at thetime of the policy change, but in response to where the economy and inflation were projected tobe in the future, absent a policy change. Such policy action necessarily involves a forecast andsuch a forecast typically is grounded in some model that relates growth, unemployment, wagechange and inflation, among other variables. So let me be specific about the causal structure ofthe model that underpins my judgment with respect to appropriate monetary policy action.I am a strong and unapologetic proponent of the Phillips Curve and the NAIRUconcept. Fundamentally, the NAIRU framework involves two principles. First, the proximatesource of an increase in inflation is excess demand in labor and/or product markets. In the labormarket, this excess demand gap is often expressed in this model as the difference between theprevailing unemployment rate and NAIRU, the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment.Second, once an excess demand gap opens up, inflation increases indefinitely and progressivelyuntil the excess demand gap is closed, and then stabilizes at the higher level until cumulativeexcess supply gaps reverse the process.There is a third principle that I subscribe to, which, though not as fundamental asthe first two, also plays a role in my forecast and in my judgment about the appropriate postureof monetary policy today. Utilization rates in the labor market play a special role in the inflationprocess. That is, inflation is often initially transmitted from labor market excess demand to wagechange and then to price change. This third principle may be especially important today because,in my view, there is an important disparity between the balance between supply and demand inthe labor and product markets, with at least a hint of excess demand in labor markets, but verylittle to suggest such imbalance in product markets.It is important to understand that the Phillips Curve is a model of inflationdynamics, not a model that determines the equilibrium inflation rate. For this reason, the PhillipsCurve paradigm is not at all inconsistent with the view that inflation is, in the long run,exclusively a monetary phenomenon. Perhaps the easiest way to appreciate this is to recall thatthe long-run Phillips Curve is widely understood to be vertical. In other words, NAIRU isconsistent with any constant rate of inflation, including zero. The Phillips Curve thereforecannot determine inflation in the long run because it is consistent with any constant rate ofinflation. What does determine the rate of inflation in the long run? The rate of money growth,of course, though one needs to assume a stable money demand function to get a stablerelationship between money growth and inflation. What does the Phillips Curve explain, if notthe long-run level of inflation? The answer is that it explains the dynamics of the inflationprocess, how the economy evolves from one inflation rate to another, for example, in responseto an increase in the rate of money growth. The dynamics of changes in inflation operate throughexcess demand in labor and/or product markets. Thus the Phillips Curve indicates that, if theunemployment rate is maintained at a level below NAIRU, inflation increases over time,progressively and indefinitely.The initial source of an increase in inflation can be anything which producesexcess demand in labor and output markets. It could also be a supply shock, but I am ignoringthis possibility so I can focus exclusively on the implications of the current strength in aggregatedemand. Under an interest rate operating procedure, an increase in aggregate demand whichincreases output, utilization rates, and, ultimately, inflation will itself generate an increase in themoney supply to support the higher nominal income. Money is not pinned down in such aregime, but passively adjusts to changes in nominal income.BIS Review   48/1997
- 3 -Despite the sharpness and force of the Phillips Curve/NAIRU model, it can bedifficult to implement in practice. Still, this relationship was about the most stable tool in themacroeconomists’ tool kit for most of the past 20 years; those who were willing to depend on itwere likely to be very successful forecasters of inflation, and the record speaks for itself on thisscore. Nevertheless, the combination of the 7-year low in the unemployment rate and 30-yearlow in inflation was a surprise to those using this framework. The challenge is to understandwhy we have been so fortunate. But, it should also be noted that monetary policy has respondedappropriately to this surprise. That is, monetary policy has been careful not to be tied rigidly to aconstant estimate of NAIRU. Instead, in my view, monetary policymakers have, in effect,implicitly adjusted their estimate of NAIRU to reflect the incoming data; this might be viewedas following a procedure like the time-varying parameter estimation technique applied by RobertGordon and others.In the short run, there are many factors, in addition to aggregate demand, thatinfluence inflation – including changes in the minimum wage, shocks to food and oil pricesunrelated to the balance between aggregate demand and supply in the U.S., changes in theexchange rate, and exogenous effects on health care costs, etc. Some of these can be and havebeen effectively incorporated into the Phillips Curve model, but some of these factors havegenerally been outside the model. One explanation for the better than expected performance ofcore inflation in relation to the unemployment rate focuses, for example, on a series of favorablesupply shocks – including the slowdown in benefit costs and the decline in import prices – thattraditionally are not incorporated in estimated Phillips Curves.In addition, even adjusting for the above factors, NAIRU is not a constant, butcan and has changed over time. For example, the evidence suggests that changes in thedemographic composition of the labor force affect NAIRU and it is also likely that governmentprograms, including unemployment compensation and welfare, also affect NAIRU. Further, theevidence suggests that, even accounting for demographics, government programs, and supplyshocks, NAIRU may have edged lower over the last couple of years. The consensus in theprofession is that NAIRU may have declined from around 6 percent in the decade ending in theearly 1990s to perhaps 5½ percent today, though some believe that the decline is even larger,while others believe that any appearance of decline is due to temporary factors so that NAIRUwill ultimately settle back to close to the earlier estimate. Clearly, one of the challenges ofmonetary policy is to set policy in the context of uncertainty about the precise value of NAIRU.The second element in the analytical framework is the link from output growth tothe level of excess demand. The economy has a capacity to grow over time that is limited by thesum of the trend rate of growth in the labor force and the trend rate of growth in laborproductivity. While both components can change over time and labor force and productivitygrowth are subject to both cyclical variation as well as secular shift, the historical recordsuggests that the trend rate of output growth changes very slowly over time. Currently, the trendrate of labor force growth is near 1 percent per year (based on population growth and leaving,for later, the interpretation of the recent rise in the participation rate) and the trend rate ofproductivity growth is slightly above 1 percent per year (though there is more than the usualuncertainty about this estimate, in part due to conflicting indications in measures of productivityderived from the product and income sides of the national accounts), resulting in trend outputgrowth in the 2-2½ percent range. A key relationship is that when actual growth in output equalstrend growth, utilization rates are constant; and when actual growth exceeds trend growth,utilization rates increase.BIS Review   48/1997
- 4 -Now we can put the causal structure of the inflation process together, connectingup growth, unemployment rates, and inflation. Growth above trend raises utilization rates.Rising labor force utilization rates raise wage change relative to productivity growth. Anincrease in wage change relative to productivity growth raises labor costs and an increase inlabor costs results in higher price inflation.Quiz time! Does growth cause inflation? Not exactly. Certainly, higher trendgrowth does not raise inflation. Indeed, an unexpected increase in trend productivity and hencetrend growth in output would likely result in lower inflation for a while; if the rate of moneygrowth were held constant, a permanent increase in productivity growth would result in apermanent decline in inflation. Although above-trend growth in output does not directly causeinflation, to the extent it results in increases in utilization rates, after some point, sustainedabove-trend growth will result in higher inflation.There are, to be sure, a number of uncertainties in this causal structure that arehighly relevant to the current circumstances. First, we have to worry about whether there mayhave been a change in trend growth, for example, due to a rise in trend productivity growth or achange in the trend in labor force participation. If trend growth has increased, whether becauseof higher labor force growth or higher productivity growth, then we would observe that rapidgrowth does not raise utilization rates. Second, we have to worry about whether NAIRU may bedeclining or, at least, may be lower than currently estimated. If NAIRU is lower than we expect,then the current unemployment rate is less likely to be associated with excess demand in thelabor market and therefore poses less risk of higher inflation.Checks and balances are essential here. For example, it is important to confirmthat utilization rates are rising before continuing very long to tighten policy to damp presumedabove-trend growth. This will prevent a persistent mistake in the face of an unexpected shift inthe economy’s trend rate of growth. Monetary policy usually avoids this mistake by focusing onutilization rates and not growth. The second check is to confirm that, following a decline in theunemployment rate, wage change is moving higher, consistent with increased excess demand inthe labor market. In addition, we have to take into account temporary forces related to, forexample, minimum wage, health care costs, and exchange rates. Finally, we have to makeallowances for the dynamics of the process, including the tendency for inertia to result in only avery small initial increase in inflation once excess demand has developed and the tendency ofthe initial rise in wages in excess of productivity to be tempered by a decline in profit marginsbefore leading to higher prices.The Outlook ContextNow let me summarize the key features of recent macroeconomic performance.The economy advanced at a 3.1 percent rate over 1996, including a 3.8 percent rate in the fourthquarter. Growth in the first quarter appears to have been at least as strong as the pace in thefourth quarter, and the economy seems to have solid momentum in the current quarter. In short,the economy appears to be growing at an unsustainable above-trend rate.By the way, is the prevailing trend rate of growth both historically low anddisappointing? Yes. Would it be desirable, therefore, to raise the trend rate of growth? Yes. Canmonetary policy accomplish this worthy task? No. Can the Congress and the Administration,through judicious combination of deficit reduction and saving and investment incentives, raisetrend growth (at least for a while)? Yes. Are there opportunities for monetary policy toBIS Review   48/1997
- 5 -contribute to steady growth? Yes. First, to the extent that policy can avoid a cyclical rise ininflation, it can avoid the subsequent monetary policy response to limit and then reverse the risein inflation; the result of avoiding the boom is avoiding the bust. Disciplined monetary policytherefore encourages steady growth, with the emphasis on the steady. Second, to the extent thatprice stability encourages saving and investment and a more efficient allocation of resources, asis widely believed, a monetary policy that promotes price stability is the one that bestencourages steady growth, now with the emphasis on growth. Now back to the economicoutlook.The unemployment rate which has fluctuated in a rather narrow band over the lastyear and a half has recently been inching lower and is now equal to its cyclical and 7-year low. Isuspect that the unemployment rate is now below NAIRU, though the steady rise in wage changeover the last year suggests that the unemployment rate may have been somewhat below NAIRUfor a while.Another aside. Don’t I like wage growth? Yes, but only to the extent it is real;that is, only to the extent that it does not yield increases in inflation that in turn prevent thepurchasing power of wages from advancing. Shouldn’t workers share in the bounty of a healthyeconomy? Of course. But workers will best share in the bounty when there is sustainable growthand will pay a high price for unsustainable growth in the cyclical instability that would surelyfollow such excess. Let me add one more complication. It is possible for wages to increase fasterthan productivity for a while to allow a rebound in real wages, for example, if real wages hadearlier in the expansion advanced at a rate less than allowed by trend productivity. In this case, arebound in real wages could be unwinding a temporary increase in profit margins and couldtherefore be accommodated without an increase in inflation.Wage change, as I just noted, has been rising. The 12-month increase in averagehourly earnings is now 4.1 percent, a percentage point higher than a year ago. Compensation perhour, as measured by the ECI, has to date accelerated more modestly, with the slowing rise inbenefit costs tempering the effect of a sharper rise in wage costs. The first quarter ECI bearswatching for signs of a further rise in wage change and possibly a bottoming out of the recentslowing in the pace of increase in benefit costs.Core inflation remains at a cyclical and 30-year low, with the 12-month increasein the core CPI at 2.5 percent. Note, however, to correctly measure the change in inflation, acomparison of core inflation over the last couple of years has to be adjusted to account for themethodological revisions to the CPI. To date, BLS revisions have lowered inflation cumulativelyby around a quarter point over the past two years. The point of the policy action, of course, is totry to prevent any significant increase in core inflation.Clearly the recent performance has been extraordinary. I have noted previouslythat it is not only better than virtually anyone had forecast, it is better than historical regularitieswould have suggested was possible. The explanations for the continuing decline in coreinflation, despite an unemployment rate that in earlier periods would have been associated withrising inflation, include some combination of temporary coincidences and longer-lastingstructural changes.First, the labor force has been growing about twice as rapidly as a trend rate basedon population growth. It is as if demand is calling forth its own supply. Part of the explanation isa rebound from a sharp decline in participation rates over 1995. Part reflects a normal cyclicalrise in participation rates, delayed in this expansion. A small part could be the early effects ofBIS Review   48/1997
- 6 -changes in welfare laws and previous state efforts to trim welfare roles. As a result, the recentstrength of output growth has not resulted in much of an increase in resource utilization rates. Ido not expect labor force growth to continue at its recent rapid rate, though the underlying trendover the next several years may well be augmented by an upward trend in participation rates.The net result is that output growth must slow from recent levels to prevent further increases inutilization rates. Second, increased job insecurity appears to have moderated the pace of wagechange, relative to what we would have expected at current levels of labor force utilization. It isimportant to note here that the effects on inflation of an increase in worker insecurity may beonly temporary. Even with the higher worker insecurity, wages are clearly on a rising trend.Third, a slowing in the rise in benefit costs (primarily via slower increase in health care costs)has moderated the rise in labor compensation associated with wage pressures. As a result, therise in compensation and hence labor costs has been muted, compared to the faster pace of wagegains. Fourth, declining import prices – directly and indirectly-–have restrained price inflation.Some judgment has to be made in any forecast about the persistence of the specialforces that have contributed to restrained wage and price change over recent quarters. The leastlikely to continue to act as a restraining influence, in my judgment, is health care and thereforebenefit costs, based on surveys of prospective health care insurance premiums. Given the recentfurther appreciation of the dollar, import prices may decline further, though the restraining effecton inflation may be less important going forward than it has been over the past year.From an Asymmetric Directive to Preemptive Policy: Why Now?During the period from July of 1996 through February of 1997, monetary policyremained unchanged but operated with an asymmetric directive. Utilization rates were high --high enough to suggest some risk of rising inflation, but wage gains -- while trending higher,remained modest and core inflation remained on a downward trend, perhaps due to decliningimport prices and the slowing of the rise in health care costs. The anxiety associated with highutilization rates was clearly tempered by the excellent performance of core inflation, resulting ina posture of “watchful waiting.” The Federal Reserve remained alert during this period, but onthe sidelines. While growth was at times well above my estimate of trend, various factors madeit reasonable to expect a slowdown in growth toward trend immediately ahead, suggesting thatutilization rates would likely remain within their recent ranges.The asymmetric directive reflected a view that the risks in this environment wereasymmetric, that there was a greater risk that inflation would rise in response to the prevailinghigh utilization rate (and to still higher utilization rates if growth continued above-trend growth)than that the economy would slow to below trend growth. The asymmetric policy posture was,therefore, a reflection of concern that our forecast might be wrong and that if it were wrong itwas more likely to underestimate inflation going forward.What was different in March, compared to this earlier period? Not utilizationrates. They were still within the narrow range that had prevailed during this period, thoughadmittedly close to the bottom of that range. Not core inflation. If anything, core inflation waslower. No, the difference, from my perspective, was not in the data for utilization rates, wagechange, and inflation, but in my forecast of the future path of these variables. The change in theforecast, to be sure, was prompted by incoming data suggesting persistent strength in aggregatedemand. Instead of projecting a slowing to trend immediately ahead, it now appeared to me thatwe were in a period of sustained above-trend growth that would push utilization rates higherand, in particular, would push the unemployment rate below its recent range. A tightening ofBIS Review   48/1997
- 7 -monetary policy was motivated, from my perspective, not by the prevailing data onunemployment rates, wage change, and inflation, but rather by a forecast of where I expectedutilization rates and inflation to be six months and a year from now, if monetary policy remainedunchanged. Whereas I supported the earlier asymmetric directive based on concern that myforecast might be wrong, the preemptive policy action was motivated for me by concern that my(new) forecast might be correct!The case for a preemptive approach is that it alone holds the promise of sustaininga durable expansion with continued healthy, balanced growth. The greatest threat to expansionsdoes not come from a spontaneous weakening of demand, from lethargy, but rather fromover-exuberance and overheating. Once overheating unleashes an increase in inflation, theattempt to first control and then reverse the higher inflation often results in recession. This givessubstance to the well-known worth of “an ounce of prevention.”Interpreting the Policy Action as Part of a Strategy for Monetary PolicyLet me now interpret the tightening in relation to several descriptions of monetarypolicy strategy. The first three really are alternative perspectives on a single essential principleof prudent monetary policy, the importance of leaning against the wind by enforcingpro-cyclical movements in short-term interest rates. The fourth reflects one way in whichmonetary policy might take into account the uncertainty in the outlook.A Taylor Rule perspectiveI have noted in a number of previous speeches that I view the Taylor Rule ashighlighting a couple of important requirements for prudent monetary policy. First, the TaylorRule links Federal Reserve policy to a long-run inflation target and thus ensures that, in the longrun, policy will force the actual inflation rate to converge to the long-run target. The Taylor Rulethus imposes a powerful nominal anchor on monetary policy. Second, the Taylor Rule generallyimposes a pro-cyclical pattern on real short-term interest rates, so that monetary policy leansagainst the cyclical winds and thereby stabilizes the economy, in much the same way thatautomatic stabilizers in our fiscal institutions, via cyclical swings in government budget deficits,damp business cycles.Nevertheless, the traditional specification of the Taylor Rule does not provide ajustification for tightening in March, relative to the earlier decisions to hold policy unchanged.According to the Taylor Rule, the federal funds rate should adjust over time to changes inutilization rates (the gap between actual and potential output or between the unemployment rateand NAIRU) and to changes in inflation. Because utilization rates had not increased (at least hadnot increased outside the range of the last year) and core inflation was actually lower in Marchcompared with earlier, the Taylor Rule did not dictate a tightening. The Rule did suggest,however, that monetary policy would have had to tighten over time if the forecast of risingutilization rates and higher inflation proved correct. But it did not dictate immediate action.There is however an alternative specification of the Taylor Rule that doesmotivate an immediate tightening. I call this a forward looking version of the Taylor Rule. Thetraditional specification is forward looking to a degree in relation to inflation, in that it sets thefunds rate in relation to both the utilization rate (an advance warning of future increases ininflation) and to inflation. But the forward-looking specification I have in mind replaces actualBIS Review   48/1997
- 8 -inflation and utilization rates in the rule with forecasts of future inflation and utilization rates.This approach to policy reaction functions was pioneered by Steve McNees of the FederalReserve Bank of Boston in the mid 1980s and there has been a renewed interest in such anapproach, in the context of the Taylor Rule, during the last couple of years. Such aforward-looking specification would rationalize and justify an increase in the funds rate inresponse to the forecast of rising utilization rates in the future.This leaves an interesting question. Does following a Taylor Rule based on anuncertain forecast outperform a Taylor Rule based on actual data? That, of course, depends onthe quality of the forecasts. This is an interesting question, one that deserves scrutiny. But it isreally the same as the question: Should policy be preemptive or reactive? As a forecaster, I aminclined to believe in the forward-looking approach and therefore in preemptive policy. But Irecognize that further work should be done on this subject.An IS-LM perspective on leaning against the windI would interpret the recent strength in demand, from the perspective of an IS-LMmodel, as a shift in the IS curve. Such an interpretation of cyclical swings is, of course, in theKeynesian tradition: output is demand determined in the short run (reflecting price stickiness)and swings in output are dominated by autonomous changes in aggregate demand.How should monetary policy respond to cyclical swings in demand? Shouldmonetary policy hold short-term interest rates constant, in effect imposing a horizontal LMcurve? In order to do so, it would, in general, have to respond to rightward shifts in the IS curveby adding reserves and facilitating faster money growth, so as to prevent interest rates fromrising. This might be appropriate very early in an expansion, when the unemployment rate ishigh and inflation is declining, but it is not, in my judgment, prudent in the mature stage of anexpansion, and it is most surely imprudent once utilization rates have increased toward orbeyond their capacity levels. The alternative is to maintain an upward sloping LM curve. In thestatic model, this is the case when the money supply is fixed; allowing for trend growth andinflation, it would be equivalent to holding money growth constant, assuming a stable moneydemand function. In this case, a shift in the IS curve would raise interest rates as the IS curvemoved along the upward sloping LM curve. This is an example of monetary policy “leaningagainst the wind.” The resulting pro-cyclical movement in interest rates increases the stability ofthe economy in much the same way as cyclical swings in the federal budget deficit.Some might argue, however, that even if short-term interest rates do not rise,long-term interest rates, equity prices, and the dollar may change in ways that damp the cyclicalswing in demand and thereby lessen the necessity of a direct response of monetary policy. Thisis sometimes referred to as the “gyroscope” theory (the bond market is the economy’sgyroscope) and the active part of management of the cycle is in the hands of so-called “bondmarket vigilantes,” some of whom are undoubtedly in the audience this afternoon.When long-term rates rise in response to a cyclical strengthening, it reflects, inlarge part, the expectation of higher short-term interest rates. Specifically, it reflects expectationsabout monetary policy. While monetary policy cannot be a slave to the bond market, when thecyclical state of the economy suggests the desirability of a pro-cyclical response in interest rates,the Federal Reserve should pat the bond market on the back and appreciate its help, but notexpect the bond market to carry the entire burden. Monetary policy in this case needs to validatethe movement in the bond market, rather than resist it. If it does not, surely real long-termBIS Review   48/1997
- 9 -interest rates and the dollar will decrease, eroding the market restraint, and in the future marketswill be less likely to perform this stabilizing function. Of course, there will be times when thebond market is, in our view, misreading the strength of the economy and hence also misjudgingthe future course of our policy. In this case, we should ignore the bond market and provide ananchor for long-term interest rates to adjust back toward.Implications of a money growth ruleAs I have just noted, a pro-cyclical path for short-term interest rates would resultfrom following a money growth rule. For an extended period, money demand has beeninsufficiently stable to allow the monetary aggregates to play a constructive role in the monetarypolicy process. More recently, the relationship between M2 and its determinants has stabilized,but the period of a more stable relationship has been relatively brief and has coincided with arelatively stable economy. As a result, there is not yet much inclination to place increased weighton M2 in the policy process.What I am offering here is therefore only a thought experiment. Assume that themoney demand function for M2 has stabilized and that we could conduct policy by enforcing aconstant rate of M2 growth. Assuming policy maintained a fixed rate of money growth (perhapsthe better way to define an unchanged policy), what would be the effect of a cyclicalstrengthening of the economy (an increase in nominal income growth)? The answer, of course, isthat short-term interest rates would rise. This is of course just another way of telling the IS-LMstory. What would it take to prevent interest rates from rising? The answer is that an increase inthe rate of money growth would be required to accommodate the faster pace of nominal incomegrowth. But would this be prudent? I think not.Policy in an interest rate regime: the importance of flexibilityNote that under a money growth strategy, it is possible to operate without achange in policy (no change in money growth) while nevertheless imposing an important degreeof stability to the economy through the resulting pro-cyclical movement in interest rates. Aconstant rate of money supply will not always be optimal, but it will keep you out of a lot ofserious trouble you could otherwise get into. The Federal Reserve and virtually all other centralbanks operate in a policy regime in which we set some short-term interest rate -- in our case, thefederal funds rate. For a variety of reasons, this is generally viewed as the best choice ofoperating strategy. In this type of regime, however, it is more dangerous to be passive and fail torespond to changing economic conditions. The prudent pro-cyclical pattern in interest rates, inparticular, must be actively put in place, rather than passively served up as would be the casewith a policy of constant money growth. It is important to recognize the importance of movinginterest rates in response to changing conditions and the potential for destabilizing policy whenpolicy resists the natural tendency for interest rates to rise during cyclical upswings, especiallywhen the economy is near its potential. Indeed, the major monetary policy mistakes in the pasthave not originated in overly aggressive movements in interest rates, but in the failure of policyto adjust interest rates in a timely fashion to changes in cyclical developments.BIS Review   48/1997
- 10 -Tightening as a maximin solutionI noted at the outset the uncertainties in the outlook. As a result, it is possible tomake policy mistakes. Another way of interpreting the policy action is as an attempt to avoid theworst possible errors in an uncertain environment. I call this a maximin solution to the policyproblem. It involves comparing the relative costs of two potential policy mistakes in the currentuncertain environment: tightening when such a move turned out to be inappropriate and failingto tighten when a tightening would have been appropriate. The maximin solution (patterned afterthe solution to the “prisoners’ dilemma”) is to select the option that would yield the smaller costif the policy turned out to be a mistake. This analysis does not, in this case, help one tounderstand why the policy action was taken in March, rather than earlier. But it does provide aperspective on the role of uncertainty in the setting of monetary policy.If the Fed tightens and it turns out to have been unnecessary, the result would bethat utilization rates turn out lower than desired and inflation lower than would otherwise havebeen the case. In the context of the prevailing 7-year low of the unemployment rate, thattranslates into a higher but still modest unemployment rate and further progress toward pricestability, a central legislative mandate. This may not be the best solution. I would prefer, in thenear term, trend growth at full employment with a continuation of the prevailing modestinflation rate. But the alternative outcome just described is not a bad result -- indeed, it would bea preferred result for those who favor a more rapid convergence to price stability.If the Fed fails to tighten when it would have been appropriate, the result wouldbe higher utilization rates and higher inflation than desirable. To the extent that the result is apersistent excess demand gap, inflation will steadily rise over time. This outcome will yield whatI call the Taylor Rule’s “triple whammy.” Once inflation takes off, interest rates will have to beraised first to prevent a decline in real rates, second to erase the increase in output beyond theeconomy’s productive capacity, and third to lower inflation relative to the inflation target. Thisis an affair that almost always turns out be ugly, and poses a much greater threat to a sustainedexpansion, in my view, than a premature tightening.What Lies Ahead?I always taught my students that there was an answer that worked remarkablywell most of the time to interesting questions in economics: “It depends.” And this is the onlyanswer I can offer to this second question of the day. But let me discuss some of theconsiderations likely to condition my judgment about policy in coming months.I would make a sharp distinction between the action of March 25 and the initialmove in February 1994. Before the tightening in February 1994, monetary policy had been in anunprecedentedly stimulative posture into the third year of an expansion -- with the real federalfunds rate at zero! This was justified by the unusually slow and erratic nature of the recovery upto this point. However, once the economy moved into a self-sustaining mode, as was the caseduring 1994, it was clear that the funds rate would quickly move toward its longer-runequilibrium level, meaning at least a 200 basis point increase, and the market was jolted into thisrealization by the Fed’s initial move. In the current environment, entering the seventh year of theexpansion, the real federal funds rate is already above its longer-term average.Looking ahead, monetary policy decisions will, as one would expect, depend onhow the economy evolves in coming months. I will be focusing, in particular, on whetherBIS Review   48/1997
- 11 -growth is continuing above trend with utilization rates rising further and whether inflationpressures are mounting at current utilization rates.ConclusionIf I have made the setting of monetary policy in an environment characterized bynumerous uncertainties appear to be a challenging task, I have accomplished one of my goals.While such uncertainty can affect the timing and aggressiveness of policy action, it is importantthat uncertainty does not paralyze monetary policy, especially under an interest rate policyregime. It is essential that monetary policy “leans against the wind,” and the best way to do so isby enforcing a pro-cyclical pattern in short-term interest rates. This requires that real interestrates rise as long as growth is above-trend and utilization rates are rising. An exception to thisregularity is in the early stages of an expansion, when utilization rates are at a cyclical low andinflation may be falling. In addition, as production approaches capacity, it is appropriate thatpolicy become still more preemptive. One way for policy to be more preemptive is to respond toforecasts of rising utilization rates and higher inflation, especially when supported by a recentpattern of strong growth and evidence of continued momentum.One can take an optimistic or pessimistic view of the recent Fed tightening. Apessimistic reading would be that the move was unnecessary and that the economy is going toquickly move from rapid growth into a slump, or at least that the Federal Reserve is constrainingthe economy from achieving its maximum sustainable rate of growth. An alternative pessimisticassessment is that the policy move was too little, too late, so that the failure to act more swiftlyand more aggressively has set the stage for a resurgence in inflation that will threaten theexpansion.An optimistic assessment is that the March 25 move was a small, prudent, andpreemptive step to lean against the strengthening cyclical forces and will increase the prospectsof a continuation of an expansion with healthy but sustainable growth and continued modestinflation. Count me among the optimists.BIS Review   48/1997
1BIS Review 133/1999Mr Noyer briefly outlines the historic evolution of EMUand summarises the experience gained with the euroSpeech delivered by Mr Christian Noyer, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, at the LondonSchool of Economics and Political Science on 6 December 1999.*      *      *Ladies and Gentlemen,It is a pleasure and an honour for me to speak here at the London School of Economics and PoliticalScience today. Since the introduction of the euro, this distinguished university has attracted numerousspeakers from the European Central Bank (ECB). In my remarks I should like to briefly outline thehistoric evolution of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) and to summarise the experience gainedwith the euro in this first year. By subsequently addressing forthcoming challenges, I should then liketo span the bridge towards the future.The single currency offers a great opportunity to achieve the objective of sustained and widespreadprice stability in Europe. For the euro to become a “success story” as the single currency for around300 million people, the confidence of the population in the stability of the new currency and in theEurosystem, i.e. the ECB and the national central banks (NCBs) of the 11 participating Member Statesof the European Union (EU), plays a crucial role. The Eurosystem has already made a great deal ofprogress in building up its credibility and gaining a sound reputation in financial markets for itsmonetary policy in its short history.The establishment of a “stability culture” throughout the euro area will contribute to the stability of theeuro. The foundations of this stability culture are to be found in a broad consensus among Europeansthat the maintenance of price stability is of utmost importance. A stability culture also facilitates theachievement of other objectives, such as high employment.Let me emphasise that the establishment of Monetary Union marks an outstanding historicalachievement. With the introduction of the euro, integration in Europe has gained a new quality bothfrom an economic and from a political perspective.Launching the euro - historic evolutionThe “short past of the euro” was preceded by a long period of preparation and discussion about closermonetary integration. Let me briefly recall the major milestones in this process. First steps towards theintroduction of a single European currency were taken almost 30 years ago when the six initialMember States of the European Economic Community proposed a plan for the creation of aneconomic and monetary union. This culminated in the so-called Werner report which was named afterthe former Prime Minister of Luxembourg who chaired the group in charge of the study.Following the collapse of the Bretton-Woods system of quasi-fixed exchange rates, with the US dollaras a “gold-convertible” anchor currency, most countries in Europe switched to flexible exchange rates.For many observers, this world-wide retreat from fixed exchange rate systems came close to an earlyknock-out for the idea of monetary union in Europe. However, in reaction, the European EconomicCommunity adopted a new resolution which established a fluctuation band of 2.25% within which thecurrencies of Member States were permitted to float. This so-called “snake in the tunnel” lasted only afew years. It demonstrated the difficulties in maintaining fixed exchange rates in Europe amongcountries with diverging inflation rates and a lack of co-ordinated economic policies.European monetary integration received a fresh impetus with the establishment of the EuropeanMonetary System (EMS) 20 years ago. The EMS was designed as a symmetric system of fixed butadjustable rates. It allowed member currencies to float within bands of 2.25% above and belowbilaterally fixed central exchange rates. Symmetric intervention obligations aimed at stabilising the
BIS Review 133/19992exchange rates of members within the bands were part of this exchange rate mechanism. In cases ofmisalignments, the possibility of realigning parities was foreseen.In June 1988, under the chairmanship of Jacques Delors, a former President of the EuropeanCommission, a report regarding the introduction of a single currency was initiated. This reportconcluded with the recommendation to achieve Economic and Monetary Union in a three-stageprocess. The first stage already started on 1 July 1990 and focused mainly on the increasedco-ordination of economic and monetary policies between the Member States. With a view toincreasing the integration of financial and capital markets during this stage, existing barriers weregradually removed. In November 1993 the Maastricht Treaty was ratified, thereby creating the legalfoundations for a supranational monetary union in Europe.In 1994, only 5 years ago, the second stage of EMU began. At that time the European MonetaryInstitute (EMI) was created as the precursor to the European Central Bank. Its task was to carry outpreparatory work and to contribute to the realisation of the conditions necessary for the transition tothe third stage of EMU. In that phase, Member States increased their efforts to conduct disciplinedeconomic and monetary policies so as to fulfil the necessary conditions for the adoption of a singlecurrency, in particular the so-called convergence criteria which concerned inflation rates, budgetdeficits, government debt ratios, exchange rates and interest rates. Member States were expected tomake further efforts so as to ensure a smooth transition to Stage Three. For example, they had toamend national laws so as to make them compatible with the Treaty and to make their NCBs fullyindependent before the start of Stage Three. In 1995, three new Member States - Austria, Finland andSweden - joined the European Union.Finally, on 1 January 1999, the European Union reached a new and unprecedented stage of economicintegration. With the launch of the euro, 11 countries gave up their monetary sovereignty andtransferred the task of conducting the single monetary policy to a supranational institution. Thishistoric step marked the culmination of a long period of successful preparatory work, the magnitude ofwhich can hardly be overestimated. As a result of these efforts, the introduction of the euro took placein an environment of price stability that only a few observers would have predicted some years ago.The start of Monetary Union proved to be a formidable undertaking. In spite of huge operationalchallenges, the changeover took place without any incidents affecting the orderly functioning of themonetary system, not least as a result of the successful preparatory work of the EMI and, sincemid-1998, the Eurosystem.The introduction of the euro had important implications for the international capital markets. This wasdue to the fact that a number of the currencies replaced by the euro had played an importantinternational role in the past. It also holds true because the euro has become the currency of aneconomic area which roughly equals the United States in terms of economic size and external trade,and which has the world’s second largest capital market.First experience gained with the euroLet me describe the first experience gained with the euro from the ECB’s point of view. TheEurosystem’s monetary policy strategy provides financial markets and the public with an importantframework on the basis of which monetary policy decisions can be explained in a consistent andpredictable manner. In our view, the monetary policy strategy has passed its first tests successfully.At the core of the strategy is a clear primary objective for price stability. A clear definition for theoverriding objective of maintaining price stability in the euro area contributes to stabilising marketexpectations. The Eurosystem defines price stability as a year-on-year increase of below 2% in theHarmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area. The Eurosystem aims to maintainprice stability in line with this definition over the medium term.Let me briefly outline how the Eurosystem’s monetary policy strategy helps the ECB GoverningCouncil to fulfil its task of maintaining price stability in the euro area. The first pillar of that monetarypolicy strategy assigns a prominent role to money. There is a broad consensus that inflation is actually
3BIS Review 133/1999a monetary phenomenon in the medium term. Therefore, monetary developments provide an importantbenchmark for any monetary policy that is aimed at safeguarding price stability. To emphasise theprominent role assigned to money, the Governing Council of the ECB announced a quantitativereference value for monetary growth in terms of the broad definition of M3 in October 1998. The firstreference value was set at a rate of 4½% per annum. At its last meeting, the Governing Councilreviewed this reference value and concluded that the assumptions underlying its derivation remainvalid. Thus, there was no reason to change the reference value of 4½% M3 growth per annum. TheGoverning Council has decided henceforth to review the reference value on a regular annual basis,with the next review to take place in December 2000.I should like to emphasise in this connection that the reference value is not an annual target. First, it isbased on medium-term assumptions and serves as a guide for developments over the medium term.Second, the ECB is not committed to ensure that M3 grows in line with the reference value at aparticular point in time.The ECB does not focus solely on money. The problem with looking only at money is that, in theshort run, the relationship between money and prices can be distorted by portfolio shifts andinstitutional factors. Short-term developments in money therefore need to be analysed very carefully.Against this background, the Governing Council of the ECB has always communicated to the publicthat it cannot and will not react mechanically to deviations of actual monetary growth from thereference value. In this sense, the concept underlying the Eurosystem’s strategy is different frommonetary targeting in the traditional sense. Monetary policy should always react to all the informationavailable with a view to maintaining price stability in the medium term. For this reason, theEurosystem’s strategy is based on two pillars.The second pillar of the monetary policy strategy is a broadly based assessment of the outlook forprice developments in the euro area as a whole. This assessment encompasses a wide range ofindicator variables, including macroeconomic projections produced both within and outside theEurosystem.Within the stability-oriented monetary policy strategy, the exchange rate is an important variable forthe Eurosystem as it is one of the determinants of the outlook for price stability. If exchange ratedevelopments pose a threat to price stability in the euro area, this threat will be taken into accounttogether with the information on price developments revealed by all other indicators.The chosen strategy is forward-looking in nature and oriented to the medium term. It is sufficientlyflexible to allow for appropriate responses to specific shocks. The monetary policy strategy eschewsmechanistic reactions to any single indicator, including monetary aggregates or inflation forecasts.There have been some suggestions that the ECB should abandon its two-pillar strategy over time. Iclearly do not share this view. I am convinced that our strategy has worked very well and will continueto be appropriate for the euro area. There is broad consensus that the uncertainties surrounding thestart of Stage Three were unprecedented in European history and continue to require special attention.The Eurosystem has a framework which truly reflects the complexity of the economy. It also allowsaccount to be taken of the possibility of a regime shift at the start of Stage Three which could impacton the stability of important economic relationships. It would be impossible for the Eurosystem toconduct a successful monetary policy by mechanistically following a simple rule whereby policydecisions are closely linked to a single indicator.The ECB has committed itself to be open, transparent and accountable. For this reason, the ECBprovides the general public with detailed background information on its monetary policy and theGoverning Council’s interest rate decisions. For example, immediately after the first GoverningCouncil meeting each month, the introductory statement of the President is released. This practice issimilar to the publication of minutes, and has the advantage of presenting the Council’s assessment ofthe economic situation almost instantaneously after the meeting. Each month the ECB publishes abulletin providing additional background information to explain its current assessment of monetary,financial and other economic developments in more detail. Once a year, the ECB releases an annualreport on its activities to the European Community institutions.
BIS Review 133/19994As mentioned earlier, the Governing Council regularly carries out an independent assessment of themonetary, economic and financial conditions prevailing in the euro area as a whole. Thesedeliberations of the Governing Council provide the basis for monetary policy decision-making at theeuro area level. Let me now very briefly recall the most important factors influencing the interest ratedecisions taken by the Eurosystem in the course of 1999.In the first few months of this year, there were increasing indications that the negative effects of thecrises in Asia and Russia on growth and employment in the euro area might be more serious than hadinitially been expected. With the apparent cyclical slowdown in economic growth in the euro area, thebalance of risks to future price stability moved significantly to the downside. This assessment was alsoreflected in the downward revisions to the inflation forecasts of international organisations. At thatpoint in time, growth was slightly above the reference value, but there were several indications - alsoagainst the background of historically low interest rates - that M3 was temporarily being distortedupwards in early 1999 as a result of the changeover to Stage Three of EMU. Thus, in early 1999, it didnot appear that M3 growth revealed upside risks to price stability, in particular as non-monetaryindicators pointed to increased downside risks for future price developments. All in all, the forward-looking and medium-term orientation of the single monetary policy made it necessary for theGoverning Council to take action. With a view to maintaining price stability in the euro area over themedium term, the Governing Council of the ECB thus decided at the beginning of April 1999 toreduce the interest rates on the main refinancing operations by 50 basis points to 2.5%.At around the beginning of the summer, it appeared that prospects for economic growth in the euroarea had improved. During the summer months both pillars of the Eurosystem’s strategy concurred inindicating that the balance of risks to future price stability had gradually been moving towards theupside. Monetary growth had increased considerably in the course of 1999. The three-month averagestood at 5.9% for the period from July to September 1999. Even when the data was adjusted for thesomewhat specific movements of M3 in January and February, we could see that the annualised figurefor M3 growth from March to September was 6.1%. All this took place in a significantly differenteconomic environment than in April. For this reason, the Governing Council had to react. On4 November the Governing Council decided to raise the interest rates on the main refinancingoperations by 50 basis points to 3.0%.The increase in interest rates at that point in time was aimed at helping to counter the upward pressureon future prices and at contributing to keeping inflation expectations safely below 2%. The interestrate decision was thus taken in a forward-looking manner which focused on maintaining price stabilityand would thus contribute to sustaining non-inflationary economic growth in the euro area over themedium term.I think that this comparison between the two decisions to change ECB interest rates in April andNovember is instructive. It shows that we do not react mechanistically to individual indicators, butalways interpret the movements and signals in all of the indicators evident in both pillars inconjunction with each other. As we can see, this is a more reasonable approach than relying on asimple indicator, given that we are living in a complex world.After having discussed our strategy and the rationale behind our monetary policy decisions against thebackground of that strategy, I should like to say a few words about the Eurosystem’s monetary policyinstruments. The single monetary policy of the Eurosystem is based on an operational framework thatis common for all euro area countries. This operational framework turned out to be an effectiveinstrument for steering money market interest rates and for limiting fluctuations in overnight rates.The Eurosystem influences money market conditions mainly through its regular open marketoperations. The weekly main refinancing operations provide the banking system with short-termliquidity and the interest rate on this instrument gives an indication of the Eurosystem’s monetarypolicy stance. In addition, the “standing facilities” effectively limit fluctuations in the money marketinterest rate. Finally, the averaging provisions of the minimum reserve system have contributedtowards smoothing daily fluctuations in the money market.The success of this operational framework can be demonstrated by the fact that the Eurosystem has notyet found it necessary to recourse to any fine-tuning operations. Moreover, since January, active
5BIS Review 133/1999market participants have typically and quickly eliminated cross-country interest rate differentials in themoney market through arbitrage. Overall, developments in short-term money market interest rateshave thus far been very stable and money market rates have, on average, been close to the interestrates at which the ECB has provided liquidity through its weekly main refinancing operations.For an efficient conduct of monetary policy operations, it is essential to have the support of a powerfulpayment system. Since its establishment, TARGET has become one of the largest real-time grosssettlement payment systems in the world. The system has increased the use of real-time grosssettlement in the EU by roughly 20% since the introduction of the euro. According to available datafor September, the system now processes approximately 3.5 million domestic and cross-borderpayments, which have a total value of about EUR 20 trillion, per month. Moreover, cross-borderpayments represent 40% of the value of all TARGET payments.The long future of the euroLet me now try to look ahead towards the “long future of the euro” and the challenges which the ECBand the Eurosystem will have to address. The experience with the short past of the euro justifiesexpectations that we will gradually see further advances towards a broadening of economic andmonetary integration in the future. With the establishment of the Eurosystem, solid foundations for astable currency were laid. Maintaining price stability in the euro area helps to gain credibility and theconfidence of European citizens in the stability of the euro. This will also contribute to the increaseduse of the euro outside the euro area.Expectations of a long future for the euro seem warranted in light of the increasing confidence ofEuropean citizens and international investors in the single currency. The international interest in theeuro is indeed evident, for example, from international new bond issues. According to informationfrom the Bank for International Settlements, the volume of new issues in euro almost doubled in grossterms in the first half of 1999, compared with the same period last year.An important challenge for both monetary policy and economic policies is to maintain non-inflationary growth in the euro area. In the forthcoming years - I am confident - we will see that thecurrent recovery has extended to become a period of price stability contributing to prolongedemployment and output growth. However, there are important conditions to be met to achieve asubstantial and sustained increase in output growth and lower unemployment. First of all, decisivemeasures to address the structural problems in Europe, in particular in the area of labour markets, areneeded. Second, the consolidation of public finances, which has made considerable progress in thepast few years, has to be continued and, where necessary, strengthened.Sound fiscal policies make monetary policy’s task of maintaining price stability easier. In this context,the Stability and Growth Pact is a crucial element. Its aim is to encourage the pursuit of disciplinedand sustainable fiscal policies by both the participating EU Member States and prospective members.In so doing, it can contribute significantly to the establishment of favourable conditions for sustainedeconomic growth and high employment in the medium term.In the coming years, the success of EMU demands that the clear distribution of responsibilitiesbetween the Eurosystem and government authorities, as set out in the Maastricht Treaty, is followed.This clear separation of responsibilities is efficient, transparent and conducive to accountability. Ittakes account of the substantial empirical evidence and practical experience of the fact that monetarypolicy makes its best possible contribution to the achievement of other goals by focusing on theprimary objective of maintaining price stability over the medium term, thereby enhancing thecredibility of both monetary and economic policies in Europe.The high degree of implicit co-ordination between economic policies and the single monetary policywhich can be achieved if policy-makers each focus individually on their overriding objectives supportsthe view that the Eurosystem should not engage in ex ante policy co-ordination which could be falselyinterpreted as negotiations with other policy-makers on its monetary policy stance. By agreeing tocondition monetary policy actions to certain fiscal and structural policies or wage developments, suchco-ordination might hinder the Eurosystem’s prompt response to threats to price stability arising fromother sources. If market expectations were to reflect a belief that the effectiveness and success of the
BIS Review 133/19996single monetary policy would be constrained by any kind of co-ordination, this could threaten themaintenance of price stability.In the course of the next decade, we will also see the accession of a number of new Member States tothe European Union and possibly to the euro area. It is clear that the envisaged extension of the EU toinclude new members and, ultimately, the enlargement of the euro area represent important challengesboth for Member States and for the Eurosystem. Any enlargement of the euro area is subject topolitical decisions, and not automatic. I should like to recall that the Maastricht Treaty provides for aclear and transparent procedure, which lays down the conditions for EU Member States wishing tojoin the euro area. The basic prerequisite is that the convergence criteria must be complied with. Thisshould ensure that Member States provide evidence of sufficient economic convergence with the euroarea before adopting the euro.The introduction of the euro in other countries will require not only compliance with the convergencecriteria, but also further preparatory work in various areas. For example, new members have to ensurethat the harmonised framework in which the single monetary policy operates is fully in place prior totheir participation in the euro area. Statistics need further adaptation so as to comply with theEurosystem’s reporting requirements. Some changes in national legislation are needed to formally laythe foundations for the introduction of the euro. Finally, all procedures that involve the Eurosystemand the prospective member country will have to pass a number of real-time tests in order todemonstrate that the infrastructure is operational.ConclusionsIn summary, the first year of operation of the ECB has been successful and the monetary policystrategy of the ECB has proved to be a valuable tool both in supporting monetary policy decisions andin explaining these decisions to the general public in a transparent manner. As to the time ahead, theECB will do its utmost to maintain price stability in the euro area. In our view, this is the bestcontribution the ECB can make to sustained economic growth in the euro area. Maintaining pricestability in the euro area will contribute to the credibility of the single monetary policy and to thestability of the single currency. It will pave the way for the long future of the euro.
1BIS Review 131/1999Mr Noyer sheds some light on the international role of the euroSpeech presented by Mr Christian Noyer, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, before theMonetary Commission of the European League for Economic Cooperation, held in Kronberg, on26 November 1999.*      *      *IntroductionFirst of all, I should like to thank the Monetary Commission of the European League for EconomicCooperation for inviting me to address such a distinguished audience and to shed some light on trends,advantages and risks, or rather challenges, with respect to the international role of the euro.Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) marks a historic step in the European integration process assovereign states have replaced their national currencies with a common currency and transferred theirmonetary policy competencies to a newly established supranational institution. European integration,in the monetary sphere as well as in a number of other fields, is a process that has been under way forseveral decades now and will continue well into the future.EMU and the single monetary policy in the euro area are completing the single market for goods,services, people and capital in Europe, with a view to enhancing the welfare of citizens within theEuropean Union. Moreover, the introduction of the euro and its prospectively increasing internationalrole are likely to have far-reaching consequences for the world economy and the internationalmonetary system. Against this background, the ECB shares with other policymakers in Europe aparticular responsibility in setting the right conditions for sustainable and non-inflationary growth inthe euro area so as to contribute to the long-term economic welfare of the world economy.Today, I shall first concentrate on a few trends of the euro as an international currency, even thoughavailable statistical evidence only allows preliminary conclusions. Then, I shall discuss the mainfactors that may influence the international dimension of the euro in the future. Finally, I will turn tothe consequences, in terms of advantages and possible challenges, that a greater use of the euro byinternational agents might bring about, both for the euro area itself and in the international context. Asa general remark, it must be emphasised that the Eurosystem is taking a neutral stance regarding theinternational role of its currency. This means that we neither hinder nor actively promote theinternational use of the euro, leaving future developments to be determined primarily by marketforces.1.The euro as an international currencyBy definition, a currency acquires an international dimension to the extent that private economicagents and official institutions use it outside its own jurisdiction. As in the domestic framework, in theinternational context economic agents need an instrument which fulfils the three basic functions ofmoney, namely that of a unit of account, a medium of exchange and a store of value. Therefore, acurrency can be characterised as international if it is used, first, for pricing goods and services ininternational trade and commodity markets; second, as a vehicle for commercial and financialtransactions in the trading of goods or of currencies in the foreign exchange markets; and third, as astore of value for investment and financing purposes. There are even extreme cases, for examplehyperinflation, where domestic economic agents may completely lose confidence in the currencyissued in the jurisdiction in which they operate and resort instead to an international currency toperform the internal functions of money.
BIS Review 131/19992Along the same lines, an international currency can be used as a reference in the official sector forpegging the domestic currency, as a tool for foreign exchange intervention purposes and as aninstrument for holding official reserves.Even though all of the uses I have just mentioned are in part interdependent, this does not necessarilyimply that the internationalisation of the euro will proceed at the same pace in all its differentfunctions. Two main conditions are necessary for a currency to acquire international status: low riskand large size. While the euro has the potential to meet these two conditions, network externalities andeconomies of scale tend to create inertia underpinning the current predominance of the US dollar.These effects, linked to the size factor, are greater for the unit of account and the medium of exchangefunctions of money than for its function as a store of value. Instead, for this function, the risk factoractually encourages diversification and therefore provides scope for the euro to grow more rapidly asan international currency.On the basis of available information, it has turned out that the euro is today the second most widelyused currency internationally, after the US dollar and ahead of the Japanese yen. This is in part areflection of the significant international role already played in the past by some of the euro’s legacycurrencies, primarily the Deutsche Mark. It is also related to the economic and financial weight of theeuro area in the world economy. Euro area GDP amounts to almost EUR5,800 billion, representingover 15% of world GDP once differences in price levels across countries are taken into account. TheUnited States, with a GDP of EUR7,600 billion, account for close to 21% of the world GDP. The GDPof Japan, the third largest economy in the world, is much smaller, at EUR3,400 billion and a share of7% in world GDP. The size of financial markets reflects the same relative positions, even though – inthis case – the fact must be borne in mind that the structure of the financial system of the euro areadiffers from that in the United States. Thus, the stock market capitalisation of the euro area amountedto 63% of GDP at the end of 1998, far below the level prevailing in the United States at 155% of GDP.On the other hand, the higher level of domestic credit, 130% of GDP in the euro area, compared with81% of GDP in the United States, indicates that bank financing is more important in the formereconomic area than in the latter.Until now, international market participants seem to have received the euro quite well after its launchat the beginning of this year, even though it might be too early to come to a meaningful assessment. Inparticular, it is difficult to judge the extent to which one-off factors, such as the postponement ofissues after the launch of the euro or the desire to establish benchmark status, contributed to the strongrise of the euro in international bond financing.However, in the first three quarters of this year, the share of euro-denominated announced issues ofinternational debt securities and money market instruments has been consistently higher than that ofthe euro’s legacy currencies in the same period of 1998, as these shares amounted to 36% and 24%,respectively.The shares of the three key currencies in terms of amounts outstanding are relatively less affected byrecent developments even though the nature of this indicator is less forward-looking. At the end ofSeptember 1999, 46% of all outstanding international short and long-term securities were denominatedin US dollar, 29% in euro and 10% in yen.Data for international banking statistics are consistent with this ranking. At the end of June this year,cross-border bank lending extended by reporting banks from industrialised countries was denominatedas follows: 42% in US dollar, 35% in euro and 10% in yen. These figures, however, are not net ofintra-euro area positions that can no longer be regarded as cross-border transactions.In the foreign exchange markets, the last comprehensive survey on turnovers was carried out by theBank for International Settlements (BIS) in the spring of 1998, i.e. before the introduction of the euro.Available information seems to indicate that, in line with a contraction of foreign exchange marketturnover, trading volumes in euro against the US dollar are lower than former activity involving theeuro’s legacy currencies.Only very limited evidence is available on the use of the euro for international commodity pricing andtrade invoicing. In the past, the euro’s legacy currencies were not as widely used in trade invoicing as
3BIS Review 131/1999the US dollar. In 1992, 28% of world trade was invoiced in the main euro area currencies, comparedwith 48% in US dollar, which was a much larger share than that of the United States’ exports ininternational trade, which amounted to only 16% last year. The US dollar is also predominant in use asa quotation currency and inertia effects will contribute to maintaining its status in the future. However,the size of the euro area financial market and the weight of the euro area in international trade flows,given that 20% of all world exports originated in the euro area in 1998, may bring about over time agreater weight of the European currency in trade invoicing patterns.Turning to the official sector, two pieces of information are worth mentioning.The first is related to the use of the euro as a reference currency in pegging arrangements or in themanagement of the exchange rate by non-euro area countries. Apart from the exchange ratemechanism ERM II, in which Denmark and Greece currently participate, a substantial number ofcountries outside the EU have unilaterally adopted the euro, or one of its legacy currencies, as areference currency in a formal or informal way. Some countries, such as Bosnia-Herzegovina,Bulgaria and Estonia, have established currency boards. Others maintain pegging arrangements to theeuro – as in the case of Cyprus, the Republic of Macedonia and as many as 16 African states, most ofwhich belonging to the CFA zone – or to currency baskets in which the euro plays a predominant role,as in the case of Hungary, Iceland, Poland and Turkey. Some countries, such as the Czech Republic,the Slovak Republic, Slovenia and Romania, have informally linked the exchange rates of theircurrencies to the euro.In addition to its role as a reference currency, the euro is held for reserve management purposes bymonetary authorities outside the euro area. The latest available data published by the IMF in its annualreport provide an indication of the share of the euro in worldwide official reserves at the end of 1998,just before its formal introduction. At that time, of the total worldwide official reserves for which acurrency breakdown is available (SDR928 billion), 17% were held in the euro legacy currencies,compared with a share of 71% for the US dollar and 6% for the yen.2.Factors affecting the future international role of the euroThe international role of the euro is likely to evolve gradually in the future. Even the US dollarrequired a very lengthy process to gain its present status, which took several decades and was fullycompleted only in the 1950s. Growing importance of the euro as an international currency coulddevelop differently as EMU represents a one-off regime shift and as the emergence of a globalfinancial market could speed up the internationalisation of the euro.A first prerequisite for a significant use of the euro by foreign agents is confidence in the stability ofits purchasing power in the long run. This is the primary objective of the Eurosystem. In this respect,the value of the euro is based on domestic price stability and on the medium-term orientation of theEurosystem’s monetary policy.Other factors will also play a role.One important aspect is the possible future enlargement of the euro area. Four EU countries have, fordifferent reasons, not yet adopted the euro. Without elaborating on that, let me simply state that I amconfident that they may join in the coming years. If and when this happens, the economic and financialsize of the euro area would be further enhanced, providing new impetus to the international role of theeuro.A greater challenge is the potential accession of new countries to the European Union. Negotiationsare currently being conducted with six countries. Negotiations with another six candidates will startsoon. When joining the EU, the new Member States will have to comply with all the requirements setout in the acquis communautaire which relate to Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). Therefore,following their accession to the EU, the new Member States will also – in a second step – becomemembers of ERM II and will – in a third step, if and when the Maastricht convergence criteria are met– adopt the euro. The accession process entails that, over time, the exchange rate and monetarypolicies of candidate countries will become increasingly focused on the euro with implications for itsinternational use.
BIS Review 131/19994A second factor relates to the euro area financial market. The acceptance and use of the euro byforeign agents are to a large extent determined by the efficiency and integration of the euro areamoney and capital markets. In this connection, progress has been made, especially with regard to thosesectors of the financial system which are used as the primary channels for the operation andtransmission of the single monetary policy. Thus, thanks to the TARGET system, money markets arenow close to perfect integration, given that the spreads amongst euro area countries are extremely lowand reflect different credit standings of counterparties rather than market segmentation.In clearing, settlement and trading systems for securities, integration is not quite as complete as inmoney markets, but a process is under way to create a euro area-wide financial infrastructure bylinking existing national systems. In government bond markets, segmentation may not be eliminatedcompletely since, as you know, each Member State remains responsible for its own fiscal and publicdebt management policy. Therefore, public bonds in the euro area will continue to be characterised byyield spreads which reflect mainly the differences in the credit standing of sovereign national issuersand in market liquidity conditions.However, the ongoing integration of financial markets in the euro area as well as increasingcompetition amongst intermediaries are likely to bring about greater liquidity, lower transaction costsand the development of a wider array of financial products. As this process develops, the internationaluse of the euro is likely also to benefit from it.I would like to mention a last aspect of the internationalisation process of the euro. This refers to thepossibility that the large size of the euro area as well as its lower trade openness, as compared with theparticipating Member States, might contribute to reducing the vulnerability of its economy andfinancial markets to possible external shocks, making euro area developments less correlated withtrends prevailing abroad. Against this background, euro-denominated assets would provideinternational investors with an opportunity to diversify their portfolios, enhancing the risk-returnprofile thanks to the pooling of not closely correlated assets.The development of the euro as an international currency is not likely to be a steady process. Thepossible increase in the international use of the euro may not be rapid in early years until a criticalthreshold is reached attracting more and more international agents. Besides, the euro is probably goingto develop faster as an international store of value than as an international transaction and pricinginstrument. Furthermore, the reaction of different international investors to the introduction of a newcurrency might develop at different paces. In particular, this might hold true of private vis-à-visofficial investors: the former are usually inclined to pursue more dynamic investment strategies than iscustomary for central banks, whose investment behaviour is more conservative. Therefore, theevolution of the euro as an official reserve currency is not likely to be as rapid as its use by the privatesector, where data on international debt security issues indicate a swift increase in the use of the euroas an investment and financing currency.Let me now briefly turn to the possible impact that the internationalisation of the euro might have inareas of relevance to the Eurosystem.3.Advantages and challenges of the international role of the euroA greater international use of the euro both has advantages and poses possible challenges.Concerning the positive repercussions for the euro area economy and financial markets, I should onlymention that an increased use of the euro by international market participants is bound to add breadthand efficiency to the euro area financial markets. Higher trading volumes imply increased liquidity,which helps to enhance the efficiency of the market in terms of both lower transaction costs and assetprice developments which are better aligned with fundamentals and new information.However, more than a source of favourable developments, I take the internationalisation of the europrimarily as an ex-post sign of the progress made in creating a large and well-functioning financialmarket. As a matter of fact, international agents will increasingly resort to the euro only if thesupporting financial infrastructure and capital markets are sufficiently integrated and efficient so as toprovide easy and beneficial access to non-resident as well as to domestic market participants.
5BIS Review 131/1999On the other hand, there are also challenges linked to an internationalisation of the euro, which have tobe given due attention.First of all, euro assets could increasingly become affected by short-term portfolio shifts on the part ofinternational investors bringing about volatility and swings in corresponding asset prices. This doesnot need to have negative implications for the euro area. For example, capital inflows linked to the roleof the euro as a “safe haven” currency may help sustain asset prices of bonds and equities. However,even such flows of funds can pose risks if their effect goes as far as distorting asset prices. In general,a swift withdrawal of funds by international investors might have an impact on the financial sector ifthis is subject to a sudden and substantial drain of resources, especially for those institutions withpossibly mismatched positions.The internationalisation of the euro may also pose challenges to the Eurosystem’s monetary policy. Agreater external use of the euro might affect the information content of both monetary aggregates andother indicators, which are parts of the so-called second pillar of the Eurosystem’s monetary policystrategy. Concerning the first point, the increase in demand for euro banknotes, at present only in theform of its national denominations, would make the M1 component of M3 more volatile and lessmeaningful for monetary policy purposes. Other components of M3 could also be affected if residentsmove funds held with domestic Monetary Financial Institutions (MFIs) abroad or vice-versa, or if partof the money market instruments included in M3 come to be held by non-residents. Instead, depositsheld with MFIs by non-residents are not computed as part of M3, and thus their trend does not affectmoney growth even though it might alter the relationship between M3 and money demand or the pricelevel. Among the indicators included in the second pillar, the exchange rate is the indicator mostsusceptible to be influenced, even though the international use of the euro might also have an impacton the yield curve and make the conduct of macroeconomic forecasting more complex.Overall, it seems that none of the aforementioned factors will seriously endanger the ability of theEurosystem to conduct a monetary policy geared to price stability. However, they impose on theEurosystem a greater analytical challenge in examining current developments and a need for theavailability of accurate and up-to-date information in the areas concerned. To the extent that theinternational role of the euro contributes to capital market efficiency in the euro area, the operation andtransmission of monetary policy might even be enhanced.For the international monetary system, the introduction of the euro certainly represents one of the mostprofound changes since the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in the early-1970s. In the first place,Western Europe has ceased to be the area of currency instability that it has been at times in the pastand the Eurosystem’s commitment to price stability will contribute to the stability orientation of theeuro area. As regards the process of international cooperation, the emergence of a key player with theresponsibility and the ability to take a more consistent stance at the global level than was previouslythe case is bound to simplify the exchange of views and information at an international level, fostering– whenever possible – the adoption of common initiatives. By reducing the number of key players andby strengthening the awareness of each player to take up their respective responsibilities, the euro will– over time – contribute to facilitating the process of international cooperation.ConclusionsThe euro acquired the status of an international currency from the time of its introduction as a resultboth of the characteristics of some of its legacy currencies and of the large size of the euro areaeconomy and financial markets.How and to what extent the international use of the euro will evolve in the future remains rather moreopen. An increasing international role of the euro in the years to come can certainly be expected, eventhough such a process will take time and will not affect the main international uses of the euro to thesame extent.The internationalisation of the euro will to a large extent depend on the creation of a large, unified andefficient capital market in the euro area. Its possible challenges appear to be manageable, in particularthose with regard to the Eurosystem’s monetary policy.
BIS Review 131/19996From an international perspective, the euro as a stable currency opens up new opportunities forinternational agents, and maintaining price stability in the euro area is also the best contribution theEurosystem can make to global stability.
1BIS Review 131/1999Mr Fazio gives an address on the Italian capitalmarkets and the need for new strategies in EurolandAddress given by Mr Antonio Fazio, Governor of the Bank of Italy, at the Euromoney Conference,held in Rome on 23 November 1999.*      *      *Between 1985 and 1998 the stock of public and private-sector bonds issued in the Group of Tencountries rose from 90% to 130% of their combined GDP; the market value of listed shares rose from30% to 100%. The use of derivatives grew even faster: between 1990 and 1997 the notional value ofthose traded in organized markets rose from 40% to 200% of GDP.The flow of loans granted to non-residents by banks of the countries reporting to the Bank forInternational Settlements amounted to $1,100 billion in 1997, or 5% of the reporting countries’ GDP.The integration of financial markets, the prospects for growth in the emerging countries and thetransformation of the economies in transition have created the conditions for an increase in allocativeefficiency at the global level. The constraint imposed by the scarcity of financial resources forinvestment has been eased, especially in the developing countries.The growing dissociation between the generation and use of savings may nonetheless increase theriskiness of investments. Strategies aimed at maximizing profits in the short run and herding haveadded to the volatility of prices. Large-scale recourse to derivatives, which are extremely useful incontrolling financial risks, has aggravated the adverse effects of speculative behaviour in someinstances.The new context calls for careful assessment of the adequacy of national economic policies and theefficiency of the financial system, as well as careful control of borrowers’ creditworthiness and the useto which they actually put the resources they raise. In recent years intermediaries sometimes persistedin directing large volumes of resources towards countries with serious imbalances. This behaviourgenerated tensions and in the end led to crises.Italy’s financial system is increasingly integrated into the global economy; the adoption of the singleEuropean currency has intensified the process of integration. The return to monetary stability hascreated macroeconomnic conditions conducive to the expansion of the securities market. The size gapwith respect to the other leading industrial countries remains to be closed.BondsThe reduction at the global level in the volume of savings absorbed by public debt issues has freedresources for productive investment and contributed to the decline in interest rates.In Europe, the elimination of exchange risk has lent special vigour to the growth of the market inprivate-sector securities. The volume of corporate bond issues has grown enormously both in nationalmarkets and in the Euromarket. The larger average size of issues and the standardization of theirfeatures have fostered the growth of the secondary market. In 1998, with the approach of the euro,issues denominated in ecus once more became substantial while the share of dollar-denominatedissues declined.In Italy, in the first ten months of 1999 virtually all bond issues were denominated in euros. In Franceand Germany, the euro’s share of corporate bond issues remained somewhat lower, at 86% and 73%respectively. In the same period, the volume of bonds issued in the Euromarket by German, Frenchand Italian residents between January and October this year was considerably larger than that recordedin 1998. This reflects the interest of issuers in gaining visibility in this new segment. The tendency forcompanies to make very large issues was encouraged by investors’ preference for liquid assets.
BIS Review 131/19992The volume of corporate bond issues by Italian firms has also been boosted by the need to financetakeovers of listed firms. The issues of Italian enterprises have mostly been made through financialsubsidiaries.The additional scope provided by the adjustment of the public finances is greater in Italy thanelsewhere. The growth prospects of the private-sector bond market are enhanced by the efficiency ofthe secondary market and the opening of new regulated wholesale and retail markets for private-sectorsecurities. A further contribution to the development of this segment will come as banks increasinglysecuritize their loans.The money market is highly efficient. The possibility of screen-based trading enables the Italianinterbank deposit market to play an important role in Europe.Italy’s screen-based secondary market in government securities, MTS, is one of the most advanced ofits kind. Created to facilitate the management of the public debt, this market has grown withoutinterruption and average daily turnover has risen from Lit300 trillion in 1988 to over Lit19,000 trillionin the first nine months of 1999.MTS bid-ask spreads are extremely narrow, averaging around 4 basis points in 1999. The operationalefficiency of this market and its privatization have been conducive to its international opening: tradinginvolves some 200 Italian and foreign intermediaries, including some with remote access.MTS has served as a model for other European countries’ government securities markets.EquitiesThe capitalization of the Italian stock market rose from 18% of GDP in 1994 to 50% in 1999, asagainst 75% in France and 56% in Germany. The gap compared with the United Kingdom and theUnited States is very large.At the end of 1998 there were 223 listed companies in Italy, the same number as in 1994. Thecomposition of the official list has improved: many of the private-sector companies that have turned tothe market are industrial firms and do not belong to groups that were already present on the stockexchange. In the same period the number of listed domestic companies rose from 423 to 740 inGermany, from 489 to 754 in France, and from 2,070 to 2,399 in the United Kingdom.The development of the Italian stock market has been influenced by the large proportion of small firmsand the still limited propensity of medium-sized and large companies to seek a listing.The rise in share prices since 1994 has been partly due to the fall in nominal and real interest rates.Privatizations have accounted for the greater part of the contribution new listings have made to themarket’s growth.The success of the offerings of state-owned companies’ equity on the market testifies to Italian savers’lively interest in equity investment.With domestic supply still limited, Italian savers’ demand for shares has also given rise to substantialinvestment in foreign securities. In 1998 purchases of foreign shares amounted to around (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:5)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)in 1999 they have increased further, rising to around (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:5)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:3)(cid:5)(cid:8)(cid:3)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:3)(cid:13)(cid:5)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:10)(cid:3)(cid:8)(cid:5)(cid:8)(cid:12)(cid:3)(cid:16)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:15)(cid:17)(cid:3)Savingspooled in investment funds contributed substantially to the outflow of capital.Pension funds continue to be of limited importance in Italy, whereas they play a pre-eminent role inthe countries with more highly developed financial systems. Their equity portfolios are equal to aboutone third of total market capitalization in the United States and the United Kingdom.The growth of the stock market in Italy over the last five years has benefited from legislativeinnovations and tax incentives. Far-reaching measures have improved the organization of the market,considerably increasing the liquidity and transparency of trading. In 1998 the ratio of market turnoverto capitalization was close to 100%.
3BIS Review 131/1999The growth of derivative products contributed to the increase. Last year the Italian market in equityfutures ranked second in Europe in terms of trading volume. The use of derivatives has enhanced theefficiency of spot prices, whose daily volatility has declined compared with the first half of the 1990sand is approaching the levels recorded in more mature markets.Borsa Italiana has reached an agreement permitting its participants access to other European financialcentres; interconnection will enable each market to exploit to the full the benefits of the massiveinvestment that has already been made in technology while maintaining a close relationship withdomestic firms.Foreign investors hold just over 10% of listed Italian shares; they are more active in derivatives, wherethey are involved in one third of all trades.Compared with the leading stock markets, Italy’s includes a smaller proportion of non-financialcompanies. Although they account for more than 90% of the value added at factor cost of the privatesector in Italy, their share of market capitalization was 54% at the end of 1998. Non-financialcompanies account for more than 70% of total market capitalization in Germany, more than 75% inthe United Kingdom and more than 85% in France.By contrast, the propensity of banks to go public is higher in Italy than in other leading countries.Banks account for 27% of the stock market in Italy, compared with values of between 10% and 15%elsewhere.A contribution to increasing the number of listed Italian shares may come from the Euro-NM circuit,reserved for innovative small and medium-sized firms with high growth potential. A few months afterits inauguration it has 330 securities, listed jointly on several European exchanges, and a total marketcapitalization of (cid:18)(cid:19)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:5)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:17)(cid:3)(cid:20)(cid:7)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:21)(cid:3)(cid:22)(cid:10)(cid:21)(cid:6)(cid:5)(cid:21)(cid:8)(cid:21)(cid:3)(cid:23)(cid:7)(cid:5)(cid:8)(cid:12)(cid:24)(cid:3)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:3)(cid:25)(cid:5)(cid:14)(cid:25)(cid:26)(cid:5)(cid:10)(cid:3)(cid:5)(cid:8)(cid:3)(cid:27)(cid:26)(cid:8)(cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:3)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:3)(cid:13)(cid:5)(cid:28)(cid:12)(cid:3)(cid:22)(cid:10)(cid:21)(cid:6)(cid:5)(cid:21)(cid:8)(cid:3)(cid:25)(cid:7)(cid:16)(cid:29)(cid:21)(cid:8)(cid:5)(cid:12)(cid:15)(cid:3)(cid:8)(cid:7)(cid:30)listed account for about 3% of the total capitalization.ConclusionThe global financial market has seen a marked increase in the activity of institutional investors, able todeploy advanced techniques that reduce the costs and risks associated with their investments. Strongercompetition sometimes prompts asset managers to pursue short-term objectives, thereby tending toaccentuate the variance of securities prices around their long-term values.The disappearance of the segmentation caused by exchange risk will foster the creation of aEurope-wide stock market. Financial intermediaries can look forward to an increase in their volumebusiness. Their task is to allocate the flows of savings between countries.In Italy, a substantial increase in the role of pension funds is needed.It is becoming increasingly important to monitor not only the performance of economies but alsosingle sectors and investment projects. Careful selection in the allocation of resources fosters theexpansion of the global economy.Italy is endowed with professional and entrepreneurial expertise, labour and savings allowing it tocompete successfully with other economies in the new and more competitive European and globalenvironment.The many small firms present in the Italian economy can be a strong point, in view of their ability touse new technology and adapt rapidly to changes in external conditions. However, the increase incompetition requires a major expansion in innovative sectors, something that larger companies arebetter able to achieve.The financial system can make a fundamental contribution by making finance available to the mostviable investment projects, helping to keep domestic savings in Italy and attracting resources fromabroad.The restructuring of the credit system under way and the formation of major banking groups willsupport the activity of medium-sized and large firms and their growth. It is these firms, together with
BIS Review 131/19994the multitude of highly flexible and productive small enterprises, that can make a decisive contributionto the achievement of higher levels of investment, to the introduction of advanced technology incompanies’ modus operandi and production processes and to the growth of savings and employment.
BIS Review 130/19991Mr Lee examines issues relating to the changing financial landscapeKeynote address by Mr Lee Hsien Loong, Chairman of the Board of Directors of The MonetaryAuthority of Singapore and Deputy Prime Minister, at the 16th General Meeting of the Asian BankersAssociation, held in Singapore on 26 November 1999.IntroductionThe international financial landscape is changing rapidly. In Asia, economies and financial systemshave undergone a traumatic two years. Weakening economies uncovered flaws in financial institutionsand supervision. Entire financial systems went down, undermined by slack lending practices andinadequate legal frameworks. The financial troubles in turn affected the real sector, sending economiesinto steep decline.Now the crisis is passing. In many countries, macro indicators have stabilised, and growth hasresumed. But it will take years of hard work to clean up the bad loans, recapitalise the banks,strengthen the legal and supervisory framework, change long established cosy relationships, and putlong-term growth on a firmer foundation.While Asia has been preoccupied with reconstruction and recovery, globalisation and technology haveprogressed apace, especially in the US and Europe. Technology is both a critical cause and a catalyst.Financial arenas are becoming more open, new products and services are being invented andmarketed, and regulators everywhere are scrambling to assess the changes and master the flux. Aninternational wave of mergers and acquisitions has swept the industry, as boundaries between financialsectors and products have blurred dramatically. The recent repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act in the USwill allow the creation of “financial super-markets” or one-stop shops that offer banking, securitiesand insurance services, and further push this trend towards consolidation.Developments in bankingIn this brave new world, one fact remains unchanged: the need for countries to have sound, resilientbanking systems, and strong banks. But countries cannot achieve this by closing their markets andexcluding foreign competition, except at a very high price. Instead, they must use competition tostrengthen and upgrade their institutions, so that they can hold their own in an increasingly openenvironment.This is why Singapore has embarked on a five-year bank liberalisation programme, granting foreignbanks new licences and more access to the domestic market, lifting foreign ownership restrictions onlocal banks, and upgrading standards of disclosure and corporate governance of local banks.Corporate governanceStrengthening corporate governance is key to upgrading standards of integrity, professionalism andservice in banks in Asia. Relationships between shareholders, the board of directors, management, andother stakeholders must all be configured in a way that encourages sound and rigorous bankingpractices and strengthens corporate performance. To be an effective instrument of corporategovernance, the board of directors must act independently, and participate actively in shaping thestrategies of the bank. The board should deliberate and decide on issues in the best interests of thebank, its depositors and all its shareholders. Board members must also be able to participate actively instrategic discussions, to facilitate the flow and cross-fertilisation of ideas, and exercise effectiveoversight over the management. Thus in the US, the Federal Reserve Board inspects banks’ boardminutes to determine if all board members are active and contribute to discussions on importantmatters.
BIS Review 130/19992Singapore banks are prudently managed and financially sound. According to the latest Moody’sratings, they were collectively rated the ninth best in the world and best in Asia. But benchmarkedagainst international best practices of corporate governance and disclosure, they still have some way togo. One major step we have taken is to require all local banks to appoint nominating committeeswithin their boards, following common practice in the developed economies. The task of thenominating committees is to ensure that only the most competent and qualified individuals, who cancontribute actively to the bank and discharge their responsibilities in the interests of all shareholders,are appointed to the board and to key management positions.Such appointments are not a one-off exercise, but a continuing requirement. In Singapore politics wehave made self-renewal of leaders a norm. As a result the political leadership belongs to the samegeneration as the population, and stays vigorous, up to date, and in tune with the electorate. Butself-renewal is necessary in every field, including banking. The boards of Singapore banks have donecommendable jobs discharging their responsibilities. But on the whole they have not given enoughattention to self-renewal, to inducting and testing out new talent and getting people who have servedlong and well to make way gracefully for a younger team. In contrast, many international banks have,as a matter of board policy, set age limits and limited the length of tenure of all board members.MAS has discussed this important issue with the local banks. We understand how difficult it is for adirector to give way to a younger replacement, particularly if he has performed well over many yearsand still feels able to fulfil his responsibilities. But unless we overcome this psychological hurdle, wewill be unable to sustain the vitality and drive of the organisation, and the quality of our banks willdecline.The local banks have agreed that self-renewal of their boards should be a priority, and have told MASthat they will start to make some changes soon. MAS looks forward to receiving nominations from thelocal banks for new board appointments, and to working with their boards to strengthen corporategovernance in the local banks.Technological innovation: cheque truncationA second area of focus for banks is technology. Technological innovations have dramatically alteredthe financial landscape. Payment systems, for example, can be improved by technology. Ideally,payment systems should be paperless, and in the long run this will happen. But today’s reality is a longway from that. Even a technology pioneer like the US depends on large volumes of paper cheques.Therefore to apply technology to the payment system, a realistic interim target is to aim for chequetruncation.Cheque truncation means that the physical cheque is scanned at the point of deposit, and thereafter theelectronic image of the cheque, rather than the paper cheque itself, is transmitted to the clearing housefor sorting, and then onwards to the paying banks. In other words, the flow of the physical cheque isfully truncated at the point of deposit.The Singapore Clearing House Association, together with the Association of Banks in Singapore, iscurrently developing a cheque truncation system. This should be much faster and cheaper thanhandling paper cheques.We are also considering a national image archive to centralise the storage of cheques. Theconsolidation of such shared back-end services will yield economies of scale at an institutional level.To the customer, cheque truncation will mean faster processing of cheques deposited, therebyincreasing the customer’s liquidity and reducing settlement risk. The system will be implementednationwide by 2001, making Singapore the first country to implement cheque truncation on such ascale.
BIS Review 130/19993Development of capital marketsBesides the need for strong banks, a second lesson from the Asian crisis is the importance of deep andliquid capital markets. There is now widespread recognition that Asian countries depended too heavilyon bank loans for financing. Domestic banks lent excessively. Foreign banks also went on a lendingbinge in Asia in the years leading up to the crisis in 1997, and just as surely accounted for the bulk ofthe sudden withdrawal of capital in the two years that followed. Had Asia relied more on bond andequity financing, it would have had alternative sources of financial intermediation, and the subsequentcredit crunch in the banking system would have had a smaller impact on the real economy.Bonds and equities offer significant advantages over bank borrowing. They are a means of long-termfinancing and investment to corporates, unlike short-term credit lines which mean funds being pulledout of a company at the first sign of trouble. They facilitate asset-liability management. They mobilisesavings and widen the range of investment alternatives for both institutional and retail investors. Theycreate transparent market-determined assessments of creditworthiness.Singapore believes there is good potential for developing domestic bond markets, and an Asian bondmarket. We have actively promoted the growth of the bond market in Singapore, as one of the centresfor the Asian bond market. Previously, MAS did not allow foreign entities to borrow in Singaporedollars, whether from banks or through bond issues, except to finance economic activities related toSingapore. This was to deter the internationalisation of the S$. But last year we reviewed this policy,and issued new guidelines, a Notice (MAS 757) that made it easier for foreign entities to list S$ sharesand issue S$ bonds, subject to safeguards. For example, the S$ proceeds must be swapped into foreigncurrency if they are to be used outside Singapore.Our approach was a cautious one, for although we wanted to promote the bond market, we maintainedour basic stance of discouraging the internationalisation of S$. But we stated that so long as thestability of the exchange rate was not compromised, the actual implementation of thenon-internationalisation policy would continue to evolve as we gained experience with the new rules,and as our financial sector and capital markets grew and developed. We also committed to review therestrictions after a year.We have now completed the review. The response to our new policy has been encouraging. Since thenew Notice was introduced, there have been 19 S$ bond issues by 16 foreign entities, raising a total ofalmost S$3 billion. The issuers were a good mix of supranationals, financial institutions and corporatesof good credit standing from around the world.The financial institutions have given MAS feedback, proposing changes to the Notice to give theplayers more flexibility and generate more liquidity and depth in the market. We have adopted many,but not all, of their suggestions. We will liberalise guidelines in four key areas.Repo consultation limitThe development of a liquid repo market is critical to the Singapore government securities (SGS) andS$ debt market. An active repo market enables investors and primary dealers to finance their bondinventories and hedge their S$ debt positions. This would facilitate more active trading of SGS and S$bonds and deepen bond market liquidity.Repo transactions with non-residents are presently subject to a S$20 million consultation limit. Bankshave told us that this requirement to consult is a psychological hurdle, even though MAS has assuredthem that the decisions will be liberal and quick.A non-resident borrowing S$ through a repo must first obtain the equivalent amount in SGS, which isa S$ asset. Given that MAS Notice 757 already limits a non-resident to no more than S$5 million ofSingapore dollar credit for such investments, allowing banks to transact S$ repos freely withnon-residents will not lead to a significant net increase in S$ credit facilities to non-residents.MAS has therefore decided to lift the S$20 million consultation limit. Banks in Singapore may now,without prior consultation with MAS, enter into repo transactions in Singapore government securities
BIS Review 130/19994and S$ denominated bonds listed on SES with any party, and for any amount, on condition that there isfull delivery of collateral.OTC interest rate derivativesOTC interest rate products would open more avenues for non-resident investors to manage their S$interest rate risks arising from investing in the S$ debt market. But hitherto MAS has restricted OTCinterest rate derivatives, because they could facilitate speculative volatility in the S$.In September this year, SIMEX introduced the S$ three-month interest rate futures contract. MAS willfollow up by allowing S$ OTC interest rate derivatives, such as interest rate swaps, forward rateagreements, interest rate options and swaptions, to be transacted freely without consultation. Bankswill, however, be required to submit monthly reports on details of interest rate derivative transactionsexceeding S$5 million with counterparties outside Singapore.Credit rating of foreign entities issuing S$ bondsSo far, we have required foreign entities which wish to issue S$ bonds to be of good credit standing.Up till now the lowest credit rating of foreign entities that have tapped the S$ bond market has beensingle A. Debt intermediaries have told us that investors in the S$ market would like to see a widercredit spectrum of S$ bonds. MAS recognises that allowing more diversely rated bond issues wouldincrease investment opportunities for investors with different risk-return appetites, allow portfoliodiversification, and create more investor interest in our debt market.To widen the credit spectrum of foreign entities tapping the Singapore dollar bond market, MAS willallow the following to issue Singapore dollar denominated bonds: a) all rated foreign corporates; b) allsovereigns, rated or unrated; and c) unrated foreign corporates, provided the investor base is restrictedto sophisticated investors.1However, the requirement for the non-resident issuers to convert or swap the S$ proceeds into foreigncurrency for use outside Singapore remains. MAS still does not allow S$ funding of non-residentswhere the proceeds are to be used outside Singapore, or for purposes which do not generate economicvalue to Singapore.S$ equity listingRelated to the bond market is the development of the Asian equities market. Companies willincreasingly turn to the equity market to raise capital or reduce their debt-equity ratios. They willeither seek to list in their home exchange or list abroad, and their shares will often be traded on morethan one exchange. The Singapore stock exchange aims to be one of the centres in the Asian equitiesmarket.Foreign companies seeking to list on SES often want to do so in S$. This enables them to tap the localinvestor base, which contributes significantly to liquidity, and hence to higher stock valuations.However, we have required foreign companies wanting to list in S$ to have at least 20% of theirrevenues, profits, or expenses attributable to Singapore.MAS has now decided to remove this requirement. We will allow all foreign-owned companies to listS$ denominated shares freely on SES, without consultation, subject of course to meeting SES’ listing1Defined in the Companies Act (Cap 50) as an individual whose total net personal assets exceed S$1 million or itsequivalent in foreign currencies or whose income in the preceding 12 months is not less than S$200,000 or its equivalentin foreign currencies; or a corporation whose total net assets exceed S$5 million in value or its equivalent in foreigncurrencies as determined by the last audited balance sheet of the corporation.
BIS Review 130/19995requirements. However, the S$ proceeds from the share issue must be maintained with a bank inSingapore and converted into foreign currency before they can be used outside Singapore.Foreign-owned companies whose shares are currently traded in foreign currencies on SES can convertthe quotation of their stocks into S$. SES will announce details for such conversion shortly.Subsequent share issues by such companies will be subject to the same requirement, i.e. proceeds mustbe converted into foreign currency before being used outside Singapore.This change is in line with the caveat emptor principle. Singaporean investors considering buyingshares in a foreign company not operating in Singapore should learn for themselves what the companyis doing, how successful it is likely to be, and what the risks are, before deciding whether or not toinvest in the company. There is no need to deter them from investing in the company, by making thecompany list in a foreign currency.MAS will be issuing a revised MAS 757 shortly, incorporating these revisions. We hope the changeswill increase international participation in our S$ capital markets and add to their depth and criticalmass. MAS will, of course, continue to review the Notice on an ongoing basis, in line with marketneeds and financial innovation.Year 2000Lastly, it being so close to the end of the year, let me make some remarks on Y2K.Singapore’s financial sector is fully ready for the new millennium. All banks and financial institutionshave taken all necessary steps to achieve Y2K readiness. They have tested all important internalsystems and participated in extensive industry-wide tests, both within the financial sector and withcritical infrastructure providers. MAS has also established a Y2K liquidity scheme for a two-monthperiod, from 29 November 1999 till 28 January 2000, to help meet temporary Y2K-related liquidityneeds of banks and finance companies, in the unlikely event that they are unable to obtain funding inthe market during the crossover.Independent assessments by global industry bodies rate Singapore among the countries best preparedfor the date change. In the nature of the Y2K problem and despite all best efforts, some glitches maystill occur. We therefore have a range of contingency plans ready. MAS and many financialinstitutions in Singapore will set up command centres during the crossover to monitor closely allaspects of operations, and respond promptly to any problems that arise.Singaporeans should rest assured that electronic services such as ATMs, electronic funds transfer andcredit card facilities have been fully tested. All their financial records are backed up daily and are safe.They need not take any special measures in preparation for the New Year, like withdrawing additionalamounts of cash. Their money in the banks will be as safe as it has always been. The Y2Ktechnological issue will not be a major thing in Singapore. We are determined to ensure that Year2000 will be remembered for its celebration of the new millennium, not for disruption due to a simpleprogramming convention inherited from the 1950s.ConclusionBeyond the immediate Y2K issue, it is clear that Asian bankers face many serious challenges. Theyneed to keep abreast of changing developments, and anticipate new trends. They must significantlyimprove their corporate governance. Technological innovations will continue. Policymakers have afull agenda to liberalise prudently, while tightening standards of supervision and enforcement. Asfinancial liberalisation proceeds, new market opportunities will emerge and there will be a demand formore differentiated products and services. Capital markets should grow in Asia, providing analternative means of intermediation for regional economies. If Asian financial systems can do thesethings and respond to new opportunities, they will be a source of strength, and not weakness, to theircountries as the new millennium dawns.
1BIS Review 129/1999Mr Hartmann reflects on recent developmentsin international payment systemsSpeech delivered by Mr Wendelin Hartmann, Member of the Directorate of the Deutsche Bundesbankand Chairman of the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems of the G10 central banks, at theConference of the Belgian Financial Forum celebrating 25 years of the Belgian Automated ClearingHouse - CEC (Concluding session), held at the National Bank of Belgium, Brussels, on23 November 1999.*      *      *Ladies and gentlemen,The Belgium Clearing House CEC (Centre for Exchange and Clearing) is celebrating its25th anniversary this year, and today’s speeches have shown that it can justifiably be called a successstory. The early standardisation and centralisation of retail payments in Belgium offers manyadvantages from the point of view of cost and efficiency and might well act as a model for solving themany different problems in cross-border payments in Europe. As the representative of a central bankof a country with a much less centralised payment settlement, albeit with a high degree ofstandardisation, I am, of course, able to envisage other solutions as well.It is probably no exaggeration to say that today’s conference has fully met its objective. It has given allthose involved in European retail payments - the financial industry as the service provider as well asthe users and regulators - the opportunity of presenting their different standpoints, thus offering aplatform for a very interesting and constructive exchange of views.Considering the current developments in international payments highlighted by preceding speakers Iwould like to conclude that cross-border retail payments - including those in the euro area, inparticular - are still in need of considerable improvement in terms of quality, efficiency and prices.The aim must be a dramatic reduction of the existing marked differences between domestic andcross-border payment services and their complete elimination in the longer term, so that the motto ofthis conference, “one eurozone for retail payments”, can become a reality.EU directive on cross-border paymentsThe fact that the European Parliament and Council directive on cross-border payments has now beenimplemented in almost all the EU member states means that a major step towards greater transparencyand a better service level has already been taken. However, this measure alone will not be sufficient tomeet the requirements of an efficient single market and the expectations of European consumers.Given a single currency and the use of electronic transmission media, the general public naturally doesnot understand why a credit transfer from Brussels to Frankfurt should be several times moreexpensive and take longer than a transfer from Brussels to Antwerp. It was not without reason that theEU Commission and the European Central Bank (ECB), independently of each other, have once againstressed the need for improvements. As far as I can see, there has already been distinct progress in thetime it takes for a transfer between euro countries. But little has happened in terms of pricing. Whatare affected members of the public to think if - as in a recent case - they have to pay a fee of EUR25for a transfer of EUR75 from Germany to Austria? However, I personally obtained some weeks agothe double amount of cash in Austria by drawing on my domestic account - which, of course, alsoinvolved a non-cash transaction - and this “only” cost EUR4 owing to the high degree ofstandardisation. The free negotiation of prices between the customer and the bank certainly representsone of the key areas of free competition, but if the result is out of proportion to the service provided,then - as past experience has shown - new operators or procedures tend to emerge - in Europe possiblyin the form of cross-border cash transports or the increasing use of credit cards - which is unlikely to
BIS Review 129/19992be in the interest of either the banking industry or of consumers. There are important reasons foradjusting the prices of cross-border transfers very rapidly to those of the efficient domestic procedures.What is required in this connection is to work towards further improvements on the technical side.StandardisationThe major importance of standardisation in Europe has therefore, in my view, been rightly highlightedin the report published by the ECB in September of this year. A Europe-wide linking of the nationalpayment systems has not yet been reached. So far, national standards are only compatible for theprovision of cash through automatic teller machines using the ec-card, but not for credit transfers.Owing to the differing standards, foreign payments are mostly still transferred in systems which areseparate from domestic payment systems and are levied with special charges, in some cases withoutthe consent of the originator. A complete conversion towards unseparated processing in each domesticpayment system is not always possible and also quite expensive owing to the many possiblecombinations. A harmonisation in terms of cost, however, requires a very close Europe-widecooperation. Here, the solution is to be found not so much in the development of new (additional)standards as in the general implementation and application of standards such as those alreadydeveloped by the “European Committee for Banking Standards (ECBS)” (the International BankAccount Number (IBAN) and the International Payment Instruction (IPI), for example).The shortcomings of cross-border payments in terms of efficiency and costs become particularlyevident, of course, in the processing of credit transfers within the euro area. After all, the use of thesingle currency means that national boundaries in payment systems should no longer play any role.From 2002, when the national banknotes and coins will be replaced by the new currency, thisdiscrepancy will become even more obvious. Even so, the problem also has a dimension which goesbeyond Europe, since cross-border payments are on a rising tendency worldwide in the wake ofglobalisation. Therefore, at the end of this conference, allow me in my capacity as the chairman of the“Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS)” of the G10 central banks to cast a glancebeyond Europe’s frontiers.Activities of the CPSSThe CPSS is a platform of the G10 central banks for the monitoring and analysis of trends in domesticand cross-border payment and settlement systems and for coordinating their oversight function. Thefocus of the committee’s activities has always been on large-value payment systems. As a result of themajor transactions executed through these systems, the credit and liquidity risks associated with thepayments and the settlement can potentially lead to cross-system problems which jeopardize thestability of the financial system as a whole. Moreover, efficient and secure large-value paymentsystems are indispensable for a functioning money market and hence ultimately also for an efficientimplementation of monetary policy measures. The CPSS has therefore been advocating the reductionof risks in payment and settlement systems for years. Examples of this are the minimum standards forthe design and operation of cross-border and multi-currency netting and settlement schemes, oftencalled the Lamfalussy criteria, and studies on the settlement risk of foreign exchange transactions.Moreover, the committee is currently working on the formulation of “Core principles for systemicallyimportant payment systems” which are intended to contribute to a reduction of risk, not only at theG10 level but also worldwide.Why now does the CPSS also concern itself with questions of retail payment systems where, owing tothe lower transactions, considerations of risk are of minor importance? Well, the central banksperceive their responsibility in this area too and they do so within their general role as overseer inpayments. For that reason, the CPSS has intensified its activities in the area of retail payments inrecent years - and, not least in view of the rapid developments, particularly in the area of newelectronic payment instruments, what is known as “electronic money”.
3BIS Review 129/1999Electronic money“Electronic money” can normally be divided into card money and network money. In the case of cardmoney, electronic value units are being stored on chip cards, which are known as prepaid-cards orelectronic purses. It is a new electronic payment instrument which is mainly designed for retailpayments and is intended to replace cash transactions when purchasing lower-priced goods andservices, for example, from vending machines. Besides this, another form, which is known as networkmoney, has developed. Here, the value units stored on chip cards or hard disks are used to makeelectronic payments via computer networks such as the Internet. Although the development of networkmoney is currently still at an early stage, the increasing importance of the Internet and thus ofelectronic commerce will undoubtedly contribute to a rapid spread of those products in the future.The central banks are affected in two ways by the development of electronic money. First, this newinstrument has the potential to replace cash and may have an impact on the demand for money and itsvelocity of circulation. Implications for monetary policy and seignorage cannot therefore be ruled out.Second, the central banks have the task of maintaining the integrity of payments. They therefore haveto examine the question of the technical security of these new instruments as critically as the reliabilityand financial integrity of the issuers of electronic units of value. The extensive analyses conducted bythe G10 central banks were incorporated into two reports published in August and October 1996,respectively: “Security of electronic money” and “Implications for central banks of the development ofelectronic money”. In contrast to the EMU, where the central banks issued the recommendation thatthe right of issuing electronic money should be restricted to credit institutions, the G10 central banksdid not propose a binding regulatory framework for the time being. But they will - as at the EU level -continue to monitor developments in this area very closely in the future in order to be able to initiateany appropriate measures that are necessary.In the EU, the directive on the taking-up, the pursuit and the prudential supervision of the business ofelectronic money institutions, which was drawn up some time ago, under which e-money institutionsin principle become credit institutions, has unfortunately still not been adopted by the ECOFINCouncil. At the urgent request of the Governing Council of the ECB, the draft forwarded by theCommission to the Council has not been approved, since it would mean that in line with the waiver inArticle 7 issuers of e-money would not fall within the definition of “credit institution” under certainconditions and would therefore be exempted from banking supervision. This would result, forexample, in these issuers of e-money not being subject to minimum reserve requirements or theredeemability requirement, which would, in turn, impede a level playing field among the issuers - inthis instance at the expense of the credit institutions. Moreover, the draft directive does not contain aclear indication that the issuer of e-money has to guarantee the redemption of electronic money in allcases at par value. Owing to the enormous potential of this new form of money, the ECB has to ensurefrom the outset that its monetary policy responsibility will not be jeopardized by developments outsideits sphere of influence. These factors have to be given at least equal weight in considering thepromotion of e-commerce as intended by the EU Commission. In my view, this is also necessary,since correspondingly stricter regulations have already been legislated in a number of EU countries(such as Germany).Comparative study on retail paymentsTo gain a better understanding of the most recent general developments and trends beyond issues ofelectronic money, the CPSS commissioned a working group to study retail payments. The first stepwas a comparative study on retail payments in the G10 countries and Australia, which was publishedin September 1999.1 The report contains a description and analysis of various payment instruments,especially from the point of view of the end-users. Furthermore, a cross-country comparison was made1Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems: “Retail payments in selected countries: a comparative study”; Bank forInternational Settlements, Basel, September 1999.
BIS Review 129/19994on the use of the individual instruments and the relevant expected trends. Finally, it included adescription of technical innovations in electronic retail payments. The outcome of the study shows thatcash transactions continue to play a significant role in all countries studied, but that the use of theindividual payment instruments in non-cash payments varies greatly from one country to another. Inmany European countries and in Japan, the credit transfer is still the most frequently used instrument,whereas Australia, the United States, Canada and a few European countries tend to be “chequecountries”.A survey on the clearing and settlement systems for retail payments is planned as a follow-up. Bothanalyses are ultimately to form the basis for a debate on possible policy objectives of the G10 centralbanks in retail payment systems.Potential forms of participation by the central banksAs already mentioned, the described activities concern the central banks’ role in their oversight ofprivate systems in which they exert an influence on an efficient and secure design of retail payments.This function is normally exercised either in cooperation with the banking industry or as a sovereignfunction based on a legal mandate.The fundamental issues which are examined by the G10 central banks include, first and foremost, thedegree of the central banks’ participation in retail payment systems. This currently varies very widelyamong the central banks of the individual countries. All central banks perform the oversight function,but, beyond this, a number of other, more active forms of participation, are theoretically feasible.For example, central banks can influence the standardisation of retail payments processing at thenational or international level by actively participating in the banking industry’s standardisationcommittees, without setting unilateral standards on their part. The analysis of the situation in Europeshows that in the long run, competition with differing standards is detrimental to all the partiesinvolved, since the interoperability and straight-through processing are impeded, thus giving rise tohigh and avoidable costs. Here, central banks regard themselves as mediators promoting andaccelerating the process of standardisation. The Eurosystem’s central banks have positionedthemselves precisely in this way. They wish to be seen, above all, as a catalyst for improvements incross-border retail payments; it is only if the market participants were not to perform their role thatthey would have to think about a broader operational involvement.A major contribution which the central banks are already making is that of taking on settlement forprivate clearing facilities of the banking industry. At the G10 level, all central banks provide suchsettlement facilities; in other words, the balances derived from the interbank settlement of retailpayments are offset via the respective RTGS systems and/or accounts with the central banks. Thishelps to minimise risks, since private settlement agents always bear a default risk. Nevertheless, thisonly requires a low degree of operational commitment on the part of the central banks, since thesettlement of files containing retail payments may be executed as a sum total in large-value paymenttransactions.Necessity of private initiativesI hope that I have been able to give you an insight into the intentions and various activities of theEuropean and G10 central banks in the field of national and cross-border retail payments. However,we should keep in mind that it is primarily the task of the private sector to eliminate the currentshortcomings in cross-border retail payments, which are rightly criticised in my view. Essentially,what the central banks can do is to draw attention to undesirable developments, urge improvementsand offer their assistance for this. Torn between the consumers’ expectations of convenient and low-cost payment facilities and the banking industry’s interests, the central banks should, in my view,continue to assume mainly a role as mediator and catalyst. Why should the central banks and thebanking industry not be able to master this agenda 2000 together to the benefit of all those involved?At all events, initial successful efforts, such as those in standardisation, are under way. However, they
5BIS Review 129/1999must be implemented at the national level as soon as possible and be reflected very soon and lastinglyin adequate prices for cross-border transfers.
1BIS Review 129/1999Mr Bäckström discusses the Swedish economy in the 21st centurySpeech given by Mr Urban Bäckström, Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank and Chairman of the Boardof Directors and President of the Bank for International Settlements, at the Swedish ShareholdersAssociation, held in Gothenburg on 22 November 1999.*      *      *First a word of thanks for the invitation to Gothenburg to discuss the Swedish economy in the21st century.A week or so ago the Riksbank raised the repo rate from 2.90% to 3.25%. The decision was based onthe assessment of inflation prospects we had presented in the October Inflation Report and ouranalysis of economic statistics that had subsequently become available. By raising the instrumentalrate now, we aim to contribute to the continuation of a favourable economic trend, with stable pricesand sustainable growth. We made the increase somewhat larger than was expected so as to be in aposition to leave the repo rate unchanged for the rest of this year, given that the Swedish economyfollows the path predicted by the Riksbank.Under these circumstances there is no point in dwelling on current monetary policy and its conditions.Instead I shall be considering a couple of matters to do with growth conditions for the Swedisheconomy in the longer run. This has a topical flavour on the threshold of a new millennium, perhapsparticularly so at a time when so much discussion refers to the so-called new economy.Just why should the Riksbank be at all concerned with the debate about the new economy and theconditions for long-term growth? Monetary policy’s concern surely lies in influencing thedevelopment of aggregate demand in order to keep inflation in check.The reason is that fluctuations in the rate of inflation stem mainly from demand’s deviations from thetrend rate of growth. The Riksbank therefore has to form an opinion about the economy’s potentialgrowth rate. We also need to know how the growth trend changes over time. A dilemma here,however, is that the growth path cannot be observed directly.The fundamental factors behind an economy’s trend rate of growth include population changes, thecapital stock, technology and the efficiency of resource utilisation.In the United States, recent innovations in telecommunications and computerisation have contributedto higher gains in productivity. The far-reaching effects that the new information technology is havingon production and distribution processes have improved the conditions for growth.A period of high investment growth is needed if information technology is to generate tangible effects.The new investment transforms the capital stock; new technology replaces outmoded practices and thelabour required for each unit of capital equipment decreases. Unprofitable units or firms are closed andnew facilities are established. Productivity rises in the economy as a whole.High productivity growth makes it possible to maintain business profits and keep price increasesdown. The transformation process generates a positive spiral; the introduction of the new technologyresults in widespread rationalisation and greater efficiency. The resultant increase in the trend rate ofgrowth for a longer or shorter period means that the economy can expand more rapidly than beforewithout boosting inflation.This is the process that is often being referred to today as “the new economy”. I do not find the termparticularly apt but if it can serve as a simple aid to understanding what the new informationtechnology can bring about, I have no objection to using it here.A similar economic transformation is not yet discernible in Sweden nor, for that matter, in othercountries in Europe. So the growth path has not been adjusted upwards as it has in the United States.The rate of investment both in Europe as a whole and in Sweden has been appreciably lower than in
BIS Review 129/19992the United States for the past four to six years. It may be asked why the new technology is beingintroduced so quickly on the other side of the Atlantic and so much more slowly here.First I should say that this is a very knotty question. Economics has no precise methods that tell uswhen a technical breakthrough is likely to show up in higher economic growth. Basically, however,the process is bound up with the growth climate in general. There is no exact definition of the growthclimate but it does include the degree of macroeconomic stability, how the education system performs,the construction of the tax system, the legal framework and so on. So there are numerous factors toconsider.It is also important to realise that adjustments to the new technology do not occur automatically. Thenew facilities will not necessarily be utilised in such a way that the effects suddenly show up ingeneral economic development.A proper transformation presupposes that the right driving forces are in place and that other importantrequirements have already been met. Otherwise the so-called new economy may mean difficultiesrather than opportunities.A lack of adaptability can result instead in the economy being weaker and more susceptible toinflation. In other words, if the global economy faces Sweden with stronger international competitionand demands for change and the necessary renewal of the capital stock and production facilities doesnot happen, our economy will be liable to lag behind.I should like to consider two factors that I believe will be significant for Sweden’s growth path afterthe turn of the millennium, namely wage formation and a functional financial system. Of course thereare other factors of importance for the future growth path, such as the construction of taxes and howthe education system performs. They obviously have to be discussed as well.I have chosen to consider wage formation because wages make up approximately 70% of total costs inthe economy, which makes them a major determinant of the profit level; profits in turn are importantfor the development of investment. The functioning of the financial system has a bearing on thepossibility of financing new investment at a reasonable cost. As I see it, expected corporate profits andaccess to reasonable investment financing are vital for a process of transformation.Wage formationLet us now take a look at a period when wage formation was one factor behind a less successfultransformation of the Swedish economy.When the industrialised economies began to recover after World War Two and internationalcompetition increased, partly because trade barriers were dismantled, it became increasingly necessaryfor Swedish firms to adjust their product range. The requirements resembled those that now seem tolie in the not too distant future.For much of that period the level of Swedish wage costs rose rapidly. This meant that corporateprofitability was under pressure both from the increased international competition and for rising wagecosts.To cope with this pressure, firms tried to cut production costs by means of rationalisation rather thanby investing in new products. With diminishing profits, they lacked the new investment stimulus andthe rapid renewal of the capital stock that the pressure for change called for. During a period oftransformation, rationalisation is not enough; new developments are equally important.At first, most things still went well. The 1960s was a fantastic decade for growth. In time, however,the strategy proved to be defensive and stagnation set in in the 1970s. There are limits to growththrough rationalisation. Without renewal, growth normally slows sooner or later. Compared with othercountries, the trend rate of growth in Sweden did indeed turn downwards.In an attempt to maintain growth in the traditional industries, economic policy responded with a seriesof devaluations. Each devaluation was invariably said to be the final one but the cycle of rising wage
3BIS Review 129/1999costs and a devaluation was still repeated again and again. The aim of compensating for the lack ofchange in Sweden’s corporate sector, which stemmed from the 1960s, simply did not work. Ifanything, the devaluations meant that the problems persisted and were accentuated.With the lack of investment in new products and the dependence on an increasingly outmodedstructure of production, the entire nation’s material standard had to be adjusted. For many years,growth in Sweden was weaker than in the world around us.This example shows how a “new economy” at that time posed problems for the Swedish economyrather than opportunities. The lack of change, because wage formation did not function properly,resulted in an economy that was weaker and more susceptible to inflation. The period clearlyillustrates how globalisation, increased competition and new technology can lead to lower growth andhigher inflation if changes are not made sufficiently quickly. If the economy is under pressure fromstrong competition as well as poorly functioning wage formation, economic renewal may lag behind.It is therefore gratifying that the labour market organisations seem to be increasingly in favour of theinflation target policy. Many representatives of trade unions and employers express a strong ambitionand determination to arrive at wage increases that are commensurate with the macroeconomicsituation. This is all to the good.But the fact remains that even in recent years, the rate of wage increases in Sweden has been higherthan in major competitor countries and also above the macroeconomic potential. Real wage increasesin excess of productivity growth enlarge the wage share and reduce the gross profit share. That is whatis happening now in Sweden. Bit by bit, at least a part of the increased profit margin that resulted fromthe krona’s fall in the autumn of 1992 is being eroded.This is a difference from the United States. There the economy has entered what might be described asa good spiral, where higher productivity increases and comparatively moderate wage increases havegenerated profits that help to drive new investment in advanced technology.In such a process, unduly high wage increases can bring the changes to a halt, as happened in Swedenin the late-1960s and early-1970s. Present economic assessments do not generally suggest that a breakis imminent in the path of Swedish wage formation. So will this have a negative impact on thepropensity of firms to invest in the new technology?The financial systemThis brings me to the significance of the financial system and access for corporate financing in thetransitional phase. Are there differences between Europe and the United States that may have abearing on the pace with which new technology is introduced? And what part does EMU play in thiscontext?One important factor in the process of industrialisation in the late nineteenth century, when Swedenwas transformed from poor country into a wealthy nation with almost the world’s highest growth rate,was the contemporary development of the financial system. Banks were established and financialknow-how grew when interest controls had been abolished. As a result, inventions could be exploitedand investment in the nascent industries could be financed.A mounting body of research findings published in the 1990s indicates that economic growth invarious countries is appreciably affected by how the financial system works: the morehighly-developed the financial system, the greater the stimulus to economic growth. An accessiblebanking system and efficient financial markets contribute to the development of investment andthereby to the economy’s growth trend.One conceivable reason why the US economy is being transformed more rapidly than is the case withSweden and, even more so, the European Community, is the efficiency with which the US financialsystem works. Corporate financing may well be facilitated by the breadth and liquidity of diversefinancial markets.
BIS Review 129/19994With the rapid development of information technology, moreover, a new type of company hasemerged. It differs from the traditional pattern in that its operations involve highly mobile humancapital. The financing of these companies accordingly imposes different requirements in markets forrisk capital and loans.The US markets for risk capital appear to be more highly developed and more focused on thefinancing of high-risk projects than seems to be the case in Europe, where bank loans predominate anda larger proportion of financing goes to reliable, established firms.With the advent of the euro, the financial system in Europe may become more developed and, like itscounterpart across the Atlantic, offer more alternative forms of financing. With a single currency in theeuro area, the capital markets will gradually become more liquid and thereby more efficient. Therewill probably be more corporate financing with bonds and equity, forms of financing that are lesscommon at present in Europe than in the United States. Signs of this are already evident.There is reason to make a deeper analysis of the financial system’s contribution to the changes that areneeded in the Swedish economy. The introduction of a single currency may come to play a moreimportant part in this transformation in that it influences the development of Europe’s financialsystem. This is an argument in the discussion about EMU that I have not encountered hitherto.ConclusionSweden has already come a long way in utilising information technology. In order to reap the fullbenefit of this and go on enjoying the combination of high growth and low inflation, it is essential thatthe right driving forces and conditions are in place. It is important that these matters are discussed,particularly as one cannot expect the economy to transform itself automatically.We have made good progress in recent years by establishing macroeconomic stability, with soundgovernment finances and stable prices. Efficient wage formation and a financial system that functionsproperly are other important pieces. The fact that I have concentrated on these two factors this eveningshould obviously not be taken to imply that they are all that is needed to complete the puzzle.
1BIS Review 128/1999Mr Noyer reports on monetary policy-making in EuropeSpeech presented by Mr Christian Noyer, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, to the SpanishAssociation of Corporate Treasurers (ASSET), held in Barcelona, on 19 November 1999.*      *      *Ladies and gentlemen,It is a pleasure for me to be here in Barcelona today. I should like to thank the organisers of thiscongress very much for giving me the opportunity to speak to you on the subject of “Monetarypolicy-making in Europe”.It is now nearly 11 months since the Eurosystem, consisting of the European Central Bank (ECB) andthe 11 national central banks (NCBs) of those EU Member States that introduced the euro on1 January 1999, assumed its tasks, i.e. deciding and conducting the single European monetary policy.11 months of practical experience is, of course, not long enough for a conclusive stocktaking exercise,but it certainly seems appropriate, at this stage, to review some of the lessons we have learned.Let me start by recalling what, in essence, monetary policy-making in Europe is about.The Maastricht Treaty (formally the Treaty on European Union, which has now become part of theTreaty establishing the European Community) assigns to the single monetary policy the primaryobjective of maintaining price stability in the euro area. In order to achieve this goal successfully, botha high degree of central bank independence and the prohibition of monetary financing by thegovernment are tenets of the monetary policy framework enshrined in the Treaty.There is no doubt concerning the overriding importance attached to the primary objective of pricestability. By safeguarding price stability in the euro area over the medium term, the single monetarypolicy is supposed to make the best possible and most lasting contribution to the achievement of otherCommunity objectives, such as high employment and sustainable non-inflationary growth.Among central bankers and economists, the predominant view is that a long-run trade-off betweeninflation and output growth does not exist. Attempting to use monetary policy to increase realeconomic activity above its sustainable level will, in the long run, simply lead to higher inflation andwill not foster economic growth. Moreover, theoretical considerations as well as empirical evidenceover several decades suggest that high rates of inflation are clearly unhelpful - indeed detrimental - togrowth and employment in the long term. A large number of economic arguments point to the benefitsof price stability for economic growth and employment prospects. Stable prices eliminate or reduceeconomic costs such as those arising from inflation as a result of uncertainty about the outcome ofinvestment decisions, the distortionary effects on the tax system, rising risk premia in long-terminterest rates and reduced allocative efficiency of the relative price mechanism and market systems.Monetary policy must take into account the fact that the horizon for decisions by economic agents israther long-term in nature. By guaranteeing price stability, monetary policy provides an anchor foreconomic decision-making. This clearly supports the efficient functioning of the price mechanism,which is conducive to the best allocation of scarce resources. Price stability is hence a means ofpromoting sustainable economic growth and the creation of employment, and of improvingproductivity levels and living standards.This discussion also sheds light on what is certainly the greatest economic challenge facing the euroarea at present, namely, the need to reduce the current unacceptably high level of unemployment inEurope. In the light of this problem, we have to realise that even in an ideal situation where monetarypolicy is very successful in maintaining price stability, the contribution of monetary policy to reducingunemployment in Europe can only be a limited one. Many empirical studies show that the high
BIS Review 128/19992unemployment rate is mostly the consequence of structural rigidities within the European labour andgoods markets. The European unemployment rate has, indeed, been high or even rising over thebusiness cycles in the past decade. Only structural reforms, preferably of a comprehensive nature, cantherefore tackle the underlying impediments to employment growth.When deciding on monetary policy, the Eurosystem must acknowledge the capabilities and limitationsof monetary policy implied both by general economic principles and by the structure of the euro areaeconomy. This is also reflected in the formulation of the Eurosystem’s monetary policy strategy,which is designed to maintain price stability in the euro area.The strategy was announced by the Governing Council on 13 October 1998. It is designed to fulfil twoimportant functions. First, it structures the monetary policy-making process so that the GoverningCouncil of the ECB is provided with all the information and analysis it requires to take appropriatemonetary policy decisions. Second, the strategy ensures that policy decisions, including the economicrationale on which they are based, can be presented in a clear, coherent and consistent way to thepublic. By providing a stable framework for making and explaining monetary policy decisions, thestrategy bolsters the credibility and effectiveness of the single monetary policy.In designing the monetary policy strategy of the Eurosystem, the Governing Council also had torespect a number of practical issues and difficulties which arose because of the uncertainties createdby the so-called shift of regime associated with the transition to Monetary Union. Where there werepreviously 11 open, generally small economies, there is now one large, relatively closed singlecurrency area. The challenges implied by this transformation in the landscape of monetary policy areprofound.For the time being, relatively little is known about the details of the transmission of monetary policymeasures to the real economy in the euro area. It is possible that the shift of regime has changed thebehaviour of economic agents, and hence, the structure and functioning of the euro area economy.Consequently, together with experts at the NCBs, the ECB has embarked on an intensive programmeof analysis and research on these issues.One obvious impediment in this respect is the limited availability of harmonised statistical data for theeuro area. This is only natural, given that the euro area did not exist as a single currency area beforeJanuary 1999. In the last couple of years the European Monetary Institute (EMI) and the StatisticalOffice of the European Commission (EUROSTAT) together with central banks and statistical officesin EU Member States have put a lot of effort into developing harmonised statistical concepts formonetary and economic indicators. By the beginning of this year, when Stage III of EMU started, a lothad already been achieved in this respect. The quality and availability of statistics on the euro area hasincreased significantly over the past few quarters, particularly in the areas of money and banking andbalance-of-payments statistics, but also across a wide range of economic statistics. This process ofimproving the quality and the availability of statistical data covering the euro area will continue.Against the background I have just described, the Governing Council has selected a monetary policystrategy that embodies a new and distinct approach, which reflects the unique circumstances andinstitutional environments faced by the Eurosystem. The design of a clear, credible and effectivemonetary policy strategy for the Eurosystem required an appreciation of the environment in which theEurosystem operates. This environment imposes certain constraints on monetary policy in the euroarea, which the Eurosystem’s strategy must acknowledge and respect. The stability-oriented monetarypolicy strategy therefore avoids “mechanistic” monetary policy responses to only a few indicators orforecasts. As the environment of monetary policy is complex and the interpretation of the indicatorsdifficult, there is no simple rule for monetary policy.The Eurosystem’s strategy consists of three main elements that were announced a year ago.First, the primary objective of monetary policy has been quantified with the publication of a definitionof price stability, which serves as a guide for inflation expectations and against which the Eurosystemcan be held accountable. Price stability is hence defined as annual increases of below 2% in theHarmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area. This definition illustrates that bothinflation and deflation are regarded as being incompatible with price stability. It was also announced
3BIS Review 128/1999that price stability is to be maintained over the medium term, imparting a forward-looking orientationto the strategy as a whole.Second, in order to maintain price stability according to this definition, money is accorded a prominentrole. Monetary developments are closely monitored and analysed, in particular in relation to aquantitative reference value for monetary growth. In December 1998, the reference value was set at anannual growth rate of 4½% for the broad monetary aggregate M3. In line with the medium-termorientation of the strategy, this reference value was based on assumptions concerning themedium-term developments in prices, real GDP and the velocity of circulation.Third, in parallel with this monetary analysis, a broadly based assessment of the outlook for pricedevelopments in the euro area is being undertaken. This assessment encompasses a wide range ofindicator variables, including macroeconomic projections produced both within and outside theEurosystem.Using the information obtained from this analysis, the Governing Council of the ECB comes to adecision on the level of short-term interest rates that will best serve the maintenance of price stabilityin the euro area as a whole in the future.The decision of 4 November to raise the ECB interest rates demonstrates the forward-lookingcharacter of our strategy. Owing to the lags in the transmission mechanism, our monetary policy couldnot wait until inflation stood at 2% or above. The Eurosystem raised interest rates in order to counterthe upward trend of the balance of risks to future price stability, which was observed during thesummer. This policy move should help to stabilise inflation expectations safely at below 2%. Bymaintaining a favourable outlook for price stability, this decision also contributed to making economicgrowth in the euro area sustainable over the medium term. In fact, a monetary policy that reacts toolate to emerging inflationary pressures runs the risk of being forced to take much stronger measures ata later stage. Eventually, such a policy would only exacerbate cyclical fluctuations without enhancingthe long-term potential of the economy.Let me now turn to a number of criticisms of the Eurosystem’s monetary policy which have beenraised since the strategy was first announced. I should like to address some of these concerns in theremaining part of my presentation.Some observers have argued that the strategy is “asymmetric” and that the Eurosystem will be moreconcerned about inflation than it is about deflation. These assertions are often based on the perceivedlack of a precise lower bound to the definition of price stability, which is contrasted with a clear upperbound of 2%. Critics point out that such asymmetry will impose a drag on the overall performance ofthe euro area economy and risks, under certain circumstances, triggering a deflationary spiral.Let me put it bluntly: I do not share this view. First, I should like to draw your attention to the fact thatthe use of the word “increases” in the definition sets the floor at zero for the lower bound. The absenceof a specific numerical value for the lower bound reflects, in the first place, the uncertainties we faceconcerning the existence and magnitude of the so-called measurement bias in the HICP. This biasarises mainly from changes in spending patterns and quality improvements in those goods and servicesthat are included in the basket used to define a specific price index. Such biases cannot always be fullycorrected in the construction of price indices. The measurement bias typically causes CPIs to overstatethe “true” rate of inflation. Although the HICP is based on a concept that puts considerable emphasison reducing or eliminating the measurement bias, some overstatement cannot be excluded. Second, weneed to keep in mind the fact that the ceiling of 2% leaves sufficient room for small increases in theprice index, thereby minimising the risk of falls in the price index. I should like to emphasise the factthat the Governing Council of the ECB has already demonstrated that it would deem neither inflationnor deflation in the euro area to be consistent with the maintenance of price stability. The two interestrate decisions taken on the basis of the Eurosystem’s strategy in April and November are clearexamples of this commitment.Another criticism of our strategy that is sometimes voiced concerns the “prominent role for money”,reflected, in part, by the announcement of a reference value for M3 growth. Here we can differentiatebetween two camps. Some of these critics argue that M3 growth should not influence monetary policy
BIS Review 128/19994decisions by the Governing Council. However, others criticise the Eurosystem for not basing monetarypolicy decisions almost exclusively on deviations of M3 growth from the reference value, as they areconvinced that money is the best indicator for monetary policy.I reject the criticisms of both camps. Let me explain why. First, I disagree with the view that moneyshould play no or only a small role in the ECB’s strategy. Empirical studies show that M3 for the euroarea has a stable relationship with the price level over the medium term. Such a stable relationshipwith price developments has not been found for any other indicator variable at this place in time.Moreover, there is evidence that monetary aggregates contain useful information for futuremacroeconomic developments. This is the reason why monetary growth is analysed very closely bythe Governing Council.At the same time, I do not think that the ECB should focus uniquely on money. The problem withdoing this is that in the short run, the relationship between money and prices can be distorted byportfolio shifts and institutional factors. Short-term developments in money therefore need to beanalysed very carefully. Against this background, the Governing Council of the ECB has alwayscommunicated to the public that it cannot and will not react mechanically to deviations of actualmonetary growth from the reference value. Let me also point out that the Governing Council has, fromthe very beginning, rejected the idea of being held accountable for failing to keep monetary growthclose to the reference value every year. In this sense, the concept of the Eurosystem’s strategy isdifferent from monetary targeting in the traditional sense. For this reason, the Eurosystem’s strategy isbased on two pillars. Monetary policy should always react to all the information available with a viewto maintaining price stability in the medium term.This is also the answer to those critics who argue that the ECB disregarded high money growth whenit lowered interest rates in April, but put much emphasis on high money growth when it raised interestrates in November. In fact, in both situations we based our decision on both pillars of the strategy andalso assessed the prevailing monetary developments at the time in the light of other informationavailable. When we cut interest rates on 8 April, only two months of monetary data for 1999 wereavailable. At that point in time, the three-month moving average for M3 stood at 5.1%. Let me recallthat we had always emphasised that “substantial or prolonged deviations from the reference valueunder normal circumstances signal risks to price stability in the medium term”. However, the datashowed that M3 growth was only slightly above the reference value then and that there was notevidence as yet of a prolonged deviation. By contrast, there were several indications that M3 wastemporarily distorted upwards in early-1999 as a result of the changeover to Stage Three of Economicand Monetary Union (EMU), also against the background of historically low long-term rates. Thus, atthat point in time it was difficult to see whether M3 growth in early-1999 would reveal upside risks toprice stability. At the same time, the information from the second pillar of our strategy showed cleardownside risks to future price developments in April. The situation was different in November. Here itwas clear that monetary growth had increased considerably over the course of 1999. The three-monthaverage stood at 5.9% for the period from July to September 1999. Even when we corrected the data inaccordance with the somewhat specific movements of M3 in January and February, we could see thatthe annualised figure for M3 growth from March to September was 6.1%. All this took place in asignificantly different economic environment compared with April. I think that this comparisonbetween the two decisions to change ECB interest rates in April and November is very useful. It showsthat we do not react mechanistically to individual indicators, but always interpret the movements andsignals in all of the indicators evident in both pillars in conjunction with each other. As we can see,this is a more reasonable approach than relying on a simple indicator, given that we are living in acomplex world.There is another line of argument which is that the monetary policy of the Eurosystem focuses tooclosely on cyclical developments. This would be inconsistent with the public commitment to amedium-term orientation. This body of opinion often refers to the explanations delivered on theoccasion of the interest rate cut in April 1999. These critics claim that this move was mainly intendedto support employment and growth prospects in the short term.
5BIS Review 128/1999This is, in my view, an unfortunate miscomprehension of the facts and I shall try to be clear on thispoint. Our monetary policy has had, and will continue to have, a forward-looking medium-termorientation, with the maintenance of price stability in the euro area as our focus. As mentioned, inApril 1999 our thorough review of monetary, financial and economic developments revealeddownward risks to price stability stemming basically from the cyclical slowdown that occurred in theaftermath of the financial turmoil in emerging markets during mid-1998. Both the forward-looking andmedium-term orientation of the single monetary policy made it necessary for the Governing Council totake action: interest rates were cut.The focus on the primary objective of price stability driving the decision in April does not exclude thefact that in many cases the policy action required to maintain price stability helps to stabilise realactivity in the short term. Risks to price stability are very often related to cyclical developments andthese policy aims are therefore complementary rather than conflicting. At the same time, I should liketo point out that we must not give the false impression that the short-term impact of necessarymonetary policy actions on real activity will always be favourable. Situations may occur, for examplewhen wage settlements jeopardise price stability, or when there is a short-term trade-off betweenadverse developments in real activity, on the one hand, and deviations from price stability on theother. In this case, it is important that the overriding priority of maintaining price stability is absolutelyclear. Any ambiguity on this point would simply endanger the credibility, and therefore theeffectiveness of monetary policy.Last but not least, I should like to make a few remarks with regard to the most frequently expressedcriticism, namely that the Eurosystem is a secretive institution that does not meet the requiredstandards of transparency and clarity.Key features of the ECB’s communication policy are our Monthly Bulletins and the monthly pressconferences given by the President of the ECB and myself. The press conferences usually directlyfollow the first Governing Council meeting of each month. During these press conferences, thePresident makes an introductory statement summarising the Governing Council’s discussions andconclusions before answering questions from journalists. As the statement is agreed beforehand, insubstance, with all the Governing Council members, it is similar to what other central banks callminutes. I am convinced that informing the public of such a united position in the Governing Councilis more valuable for establishing credibility and reducing uncertainties in the markets than publishingdetails of a Governing Council discussion, which would naturally be difficult to assess for those notpresent at the meeting.Moreover, the press conference provides prompt information in an even-handed way, and it offers theopportunity for immediate two-way communication. As far as I am aware, no other central bankregularly communicates with the public in such a prompt and open manner immediately after itsmonetary policy meetings. We are convinced that this contributes to transparency and thus givesimportant and clear guidance.These press conferences are a tangible expression of the Eurosystem’s commitment to being open,transparent and accountable in its conduct of monetary policy. Obviously, journalists, financialmarkets and the public are still learning about the new monetary policy strategy in the euro area and,over time, the Eurosystem will further improve its communication.In this respect, it has also been argued that we do not release sufficient information about our analysis.More specifically criticism has been expressed to the effect that the Eurosystem is currently notpublishing its inflation forecasts. May I remind you, therefore, that the inflation forecast is not a keyelement of our strategy? An inflation forecast is just one of the many pieces of information which weuse. Its importance should not be exaggerated. Our quantitative definition of price stability is not aninflation target in the same way as those of other central banks, nor are we targeting an inflationforecast. In our view, a single forecast is not a sufficient statistic given the complexity of economicrelationships and the existing uncertainties about the future. We are living in a complex environmentin which policy decisions cannot be simply related to a few or even one information variable. There isalso the risk that we are chasing our own tail. In fact, our monetary policy always aims to respect thedefinition of price stability. The advantage of publishing a forecast would be that it would make one
BIS Review 128/19996more piece of information, which plays a role in the decision-making process, transparent. That beingsaid, the Governing Council will have to reconsider the issue once our macroeconometric models aredeemed to be sufficiently reliable. This may still take some time. Let me now conclude by saying thatI am happy to contribute to a project of such historical dimension and so are my colleagues in the ECBand those at the NCBs belonging to the Eurosystem. Monetary Union has had a successful start andthe monetary policy strategy of the Eurosystem, on the basis of which the Governing Council hastaken and will continue to take its monetary policy decisions, has contributed to this success. At thesame time, we should recognise the fact that monetary policy alone cannot tackle all of the economicchallenges facing the euro area. In particular, it cannot reduce the euro area’s unacceptably high levelof structural unemployment. The main contribution the single monetary policy can make to thewelfare of the people in the euro area will be the maintenance of price stability in the medium term.Although monetary policy-making in Europe is not an easy task, I am confident after the experience ofthe first 11 months that the Eurosystem is both determined to assume this task and is well equipped todo so.
1BIS Review 128/1999Mr Duisenberg explains the thinking of the European Central Bankon the issue of whether markets need guidanceIntroductory statement delivered by Dr Willem F Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank,at the Frankfurt European Banking Congress Session I: “Do markets need guidance?” held inFrankfurt on 19 November 1999.*      *      *Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to explain the thinking of the European CentralBank (ECB) on this important issue.Let me start by summarising my answer to your question: yes, the markets need guidance from theECB. This guidance should mainly focus on reducing uncertainty in the markets. This requires aboveall a clear and credible commitment on the part of the ECB and sound economic analysis. Thus,guidance should be given through a credible monetary policy strategy and a transparent ongoingassessment of euro area developments in line with this strategy. Reducing uncertainty also implies thatin our communication we do not pretend that we know more than we really do. Obviously, ourknowledge of the future course of the euro area economy will always be subject to uncertainties andlimitations. It thus goes without saying that guidance certainly cannot be given in such a way that theECB indicates a path for future ECB interest rates far in advance.This leads me directly to the second part of your question. (“Is any particular mode of guidancepreferable?”) How should the ECB give guidance to the markets? At the heart of the answer to thisquestion is the Eurosystem’s monetary policy strategy.Indeed, this strategy is designed to make both our objective and the monetary policy aimed atachieving this objective credible, transparent and comprehensible, and thus make our decisionspredictable. However, let me be very clear. Being predictable in no way implies that the central bankintends to follow the market. On the contrary, the causality should run in the other direction. Marketsshould be in a position to anticipate monetary policy decisions based on a credible strategy of thecentral bank. This does not exclude that certain monetary policy decisions may sometimes surprise themarkets, but this is not our aim.As was argued in an article in the most recent issue of the ECB Monthly Bulletin, a stability-orientedmonetary policy contributes to reducing certain risk premia in interest rates and thereby to increasingthe efficiency of the allocation of capital, thus enhancing overall welfare. This shows that it is veryimportant to give clear guidance to the markets by conducting a credible monetary policy focused onprice stability.As you know, the strategy selected by the Governing Council of the ECB comprises a quantitativedefinition of price stability, which should contribute to anchoring long-term inflation expectations, aswell as the two so-called pillars. The quantification of the primary objective, combined with thetransparency and the credibility of the Eurosystem, provides the most important guidance to financialmarkets. Our monetary policy should contribute to keeping inflation expectations safely below 2%.This ensures a high degree of likelihood that future price developments will be consistent with thedefinition of price stability.The Governing Council bases its monetary policy discussions on the information revealed by the twopillars of its strategy.The first pillar is a prominent role for money, implying that monetary and credit developments arethoroughly analysed for their information content with regard to future price developments and risks toprice stability. The prominent role for money is signalled by the announcement of a quantitativereference value for monetary growth in terms of M3. I like to emphasise again that the M3 reference
BIS Review 128/19992value is not a monetary target. Monetary policy will not react mechanistically to deviations of M3growth from the reference value.The second pillar is a broadly based assessment of the outlook for price developments. This comprisesanalysis of many individual non-monetary indicators. We also look at macroeconomic forecastsprepared both externally and internally.I know that some analysts in the market would prefer if the Eurosystem had a very simple strategy,where interest rates are changed quasi-automatically in response to a few (or even a single) observablevariable(s). Some would prefer monetary targeting, others favour inflation targeting.I acknowledge that our strategy is complex. However, we have to recognise that we live in a rathercomplex economic world and that there are additional uncertainties related to the changeover to thenew regime of Monetary Union in the euro area. It would therefore be impossible for the Eurosystemto conduct a successful policy by mechanistically following a simple rule whereby policy decisions areclosely linked to a few indicator variables or to a central inflation projection at a particular point intime.Two key features of the ECB’s communication with the public and the markets are our MonthlyBulletins and the monthly press conferences. The latter usually directly follow the first GoverningCouncil meeting of each month. By these means we publicly conduct a detailed review of currentmonetary, financial and other economic developments in the euro area against the background of thestrategy. This aims at illustrating the application of the strategy in practice, guiding marketexpectations. Although the strategy is complex, we generally try to end with an overall assessmentwhich summarises the opinion of the Council on the future situation.The press conference provides prompt information in an even-handed way, and it offers theopportunity for immediate two-way communication. As far as I am aware, no other central bankregularly communicates with the public in such a prompt and open manner immediately after itsmonetary policy meetings. We are convinced that this contributes to reducing uncertainty in themarkets and thus gives important and clear guidance, also with regard to short-term policy moves.In this respect, one should recognise that the ECB is facing a completely new environment. We do notonly have to decide on the single monetary policy for a new monetary area comprising 11 independentcountries, but also to communicate with the public and markets of these 11 countries, which were usedto quite different monetary policy strategies and communication policies in the past.This diversity of monetary history, communication and culture across the euro area obviouslyconstitutes a great challenge for communicating in a comprehensible and transparent way both withthe general public and the markets.Obviously, journalists, financial markets and the public are still in the process of learning the newstrategy of monetary policy in the euro area and, over time, the Eurosystem will further improve itscommunication.Let me finally address the third part of your question: (“does more information necessarily meanbetter guidance?”). I am convinced that it is misleading to assume that more information alwaysmeans better policy and a clearer guidance to the market. What is important is that the informationgiven to the public is clearly structured and understandable, avoids adding uncertainty and is providedin an even-handed way. The Eurosystem’s monetary policy strategy has been designed with these aimsin mind.Moreover, as indicated, a high degree of credibility of monetary policy can make a substantialcontribution to reducing uncertainty in the markets and is thus a key aim of our policy. What is clearlymore important than the amount of information given is that the communication policy, as part of thestrategy, is consistent with the structure of the internal decision-making process. I can assure you thatthis is indeed the case.During the monthly press conferences, I make an introductory statement summarising the GoverningCouncil’s discussions and conclusions before answering questions from journalists. As the statementis agreed, in substance, with all the Council members beforehand, it is similar to what others call
3BIS Review 128/1999minutes. I am convinced that, for the purposes of establishing credibility and reducing uncertainties inthe market, informing the public of such an agreed position on the part of the Governing Council issuperior to publishing details of a Council discussion which are naturally difficult to assess for thosewho are not present at the meeting. Moreover, as mentioned, we should not pretend to know more thanwe do. It is thus important not to try to give guidance when the ECB itself is not sure. I very muchagree that giving too much information is not always helpful. I am convinced that the Eurosystemalready provides timely, high-frequency information of good quality, but, as I have said, trying tofurther improve our communications is an ongoing exercise.
1BIS Review 127/1999Mr Bäckström reviews international financial turbulence in the 1990sSpeech given by Mr Urban Bäckström, Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank and Chairman of the Boardof Directors and President of the Bank for International Settlements, at the Jönköping UniversityContact, Jönköping on 18 November 1999.*      *      *First I want to express my thanks for the invitation to visit the University here in Jönköping and talkabout the turbulence we have experienced over the past decade in both the international economy andin Sweden.What makes this topic particularly interesting is that from time to time the financial unrest, in Swedenas well as elsewhere, has shaped the economic situation in many countries and sometimes also in theworld in general.Early in the 1990s the Nordic countries were beset by severe problems in the financial system. Thesedifficulties were exacerbated by the turbulent situation at that time in Europe’s ERM system. Japanhas had to grapple with a crisis for most of the decade. Mexico encountered problems in themid-1990s, as did countries in Southeast Asia just a few years ago. Last autumn, global financialmarket unrest arose again when Russia chose to suspend payments on a part of government debt.When this was compounded by problems with an American hedge fund, Long Term CapitalManagement, the situation in Western financial markets became critical, fortunately only for a time.This year, it is Brazil that has experienced financial difficulties. In addition to the extensive financialworries of this type, there have been relatively abrupt shifts in interest rates, exchange rates and shareprices.In some instances the financial turbulence has stemmed from inconsistent economic policies, as wellas from notable shortcomings in the supervision of banks and other institutions. It has not infrequentlycoincided with and even been the direct cause of far-reaching macroeconomic adjustments in theeconomies concerned. In Sweden, for instance, GDP fell for three consecutive years, from 1991 to1993, by a total of 6% and unemployment shot up. Other countries have experienced similar and evengreater setbacks. Large loans have been provided by the International Monetary Fund to assist variouscountries.In the light of all this, it is hardly remarkable that in recent years matters to do with the globalfinancial system and how it works have been discussed more intensively throughout the world. So mysubject today is indeed topical. But let me say at once that I will be considering just a couple of theaspects the title of my talk encompasses. Time is obviously a consideration here but a more importantreason is that we do not yet know enough about many of the complex matters in this field.I shall begin with the crisis in Sweden in the early-1990s because it illustrates some underlyingproblems that crises in other countries have had in common. If we can understand the fundamentalmechanisms involved in earlier periods of turbulence, perhaps it will be possible to avoid or mitigatesimilar developments in the future. That naturally leads me on to consider what can be done and therole of the authorities.The crisis in SwedenMany reasons can probably be found to explain why Sweden in the early-1990s was hit by the gravestcrisis since the 1930s. Some of them go back a long way and others probably had more to do withcontemporary developments. Macroeconomic factors played a part and so did more structural matters.Many aspects have been thoroughly penetrated in various studies in recent years. Today I shall beconcentrating on the financial field.
BIS Review 127/19992The deregulation of credit and currency markets in the 1980s was followed by a rapid expansion ofcredit and strong price increases for various types of asset, including shares and real estate. The GDPratio for private sector debt rose in five years from 100% to 150% (Diagram 1). Moreover, in thesecond half of the 1980s asset prices rose in real terms by over 70%.There are a number of reasons why an expansion of credit leads to rising asset prices and vice versa.The value of an asset can be defined as the present value of the future income the asset is expected togenerate. So rising asset prices can be said to mirror expectations of future increases in income, whichin turn strengthens both the propensity and the possibility of borrowing. That implies increaseddemand for credit. On the supply side, rising asset prices increase the availability of credit in thatborrowers are in a better position to pledge collateral. The prospect of rising income and cash flowsalso implies that borrowers will be more able to service and repay debt.As long as this process is based on reasonable assessments of the future, all is well and good.Problems arise when asset prices and the provision of credit both rise unduly, so that the expectationson which they are based become unrealistic. Looking back, this is evidently what happened innumerous cases. The head of the US Federal Reserve has labelled it “irrational exuberance”, a phrasethat is now a byword.A bubble will burst sooner or later. The precipitating factors vary but the event as such is simply amatter of time. The collapse in Sweden began in 1991. Share prices were already declining andproperty prices soon followed suit.The real economy is liable to be affected by falling asset prices, just as it is when asset prices rise.Households perceive a loss of wealth that prompts them to restrain their consumption. Another effectcomes from the interaction of the credit market and the balance sheets of households and firms: whenasset prices and their value as collateral fall, creditors become less willing to provide loans. Inaddition, falling asset prices may make banks generally less inclined to provide credit, so that evenprofitable projects suffer. This can ultimately paralyse the supply of credit and lead to the totalcollapse of the financial system.While Sweden can be said to have avoided a financial crisis in that sense, both the wealth and thebalance-sheet effects probably contributed to the course of the worst economic recession here since the1930s. Demand in general fell, financial saving rose and credit was rapidly repaid. The steep reductionof the loan stock in the first half of the 1990s is evident from Diagram 1.1.

3BIS Review 127/1999However, a severe bank crisis was only one of the factors that hit the Swedish economy. At times inthe early-1990s there was also heavy pressure on the krona. In November 1992 the Riksbank wasfinally obliged to change to a floating exchange rate.One of several causes of the exchange rate turbulence was the short-term external liabilities that hadaccumulated in the late-1980s. In that period, households and firms had borrowed the equivalent ofaround SEK300 billion in foreign currency through the Swedish bank system (Diagram 2). Thatcorresponded to around 20% of GDP. I mentioned earlier that borrowing from banks rose quiteremarkably in the second half of the 1980s; about 20% of this took the form of foreign-currency loans.Much of the borrowing was short-term but the funds were not infrequently used for projects with alonger duration, such as property investment. All went well as long as the loans could be renewed andthe banks were able to borrow the corresponding amounts in the international market.It was not a classic run on the banks, with depositors withdrawing their savings, that triggered thecrisis in the Swedish bank system. It was a lack of international confidence and problems withfinancing in the international market. Growing loan losses made it increasingly difficult for someSwedish banks to obtain the necessary funds abroad. What we saw was a more modern kind of bankrun. That was certainly a major reason why the Swedish bank crisis coincided with an exchange ratecrisis.So what induced Swedish households and firms to borrow in foreign currency? The main explanationis perhaps that interest rates abroad were lower than in Sweden. Borrowing in a foreign currency wasperceived to be cheaper. While some households and firms may have wondered why and found thatthe higher Swedish rates were simply a risk premium to cover the possibility of a future devaluation,the consequences of this analysis were generally ignored (a devaluation would have increased theamount of a loan expressed in Swedish kronor, making the burden of repayment heavier). The fixedexchange rate policy was perceived as credible, at least by these borrowers. They were lulled, or lulledthemselves, into thinking that the exchange risk, even though it was occasioning higher interest ratesthan in the rest of the world, would be absorbed by the Riksbank. That meant they could try to benefitfrom the interest rate differential with impunity. As many of these foreign currency borrowers wereplayers who could not afford loans in Swedish kronor, they had no margin when the liabilities becamemore costly after the krona’s fall and this accentuated the problems.2.

BIS Review 127/19994What lessons can we learn?I have now identified three features of the Swedish crisis: rising asset prices, a strong expansion ofcredit and short-term borrowing in foreign currency. These three factors have in fact preceded almostall the financial crises that have hit various countries in the past decade. This does not apply to lastautumn’s turbulence over the Russian suspension of payments and the LTCM hedge-fund problems. Iam thinking instead of, for example, Mexico, Indonesia, Thailand, South Korea, Malaysia and Brazil.In these cases, inflated asset prices and both domestic and external debt had an important bearing onthe subsequent course of events.One important lesson is that a floating exchange rate with an explicit inflation target makes it easier toavoid a situation with rapidly rising asset prices, an unduly strong expansion of credit and highshort-term borrowing abroad. That does not mean that a fixed, but adjustable, exchange rate is boundto result in problems of this type. Experience from Denmark is a good example.A clear problem in Sweden’s case, however, was that in the 1980s monetary policy could not be usedto counter the tendencies to strong credit growth and rapid asset price increases. Another problem, as Ijust mentioned, was that the fixed exchange rate policy lulled people into a false sense of security andprovided an incentive for short-run borrowing in foreign currency.With a floating exchange rate, the krona’s fluctuations make the exchange risk more evident(Diagram 2). Such a regime may have other drawbacks but it does show potential borrowers thatforeign-currency loans involve a risk. The stock of foreign-currency loans to households and firms isin fact smaller today than it was a decade ago.A point to bear in mind is that the problem in the late-1980s was not the strong asset price rise as suchbut the combination of this and heavy borrowing in Sweden and abroad. The wealth effect tends to besymmetric, in the sense that economic activity is stimulated by rising asset prices to much the sameextent as it is checked when asset prices fall. Neither are wealth effects usually all that great. Problemsarise when they coincide with an expansion of credit. The effects may then be asymmetric in that theyare more extensive when asset prices fall. The balance-sheet effects lead to loan losses and, in moreserious cases, to the suspension of payments. In the worst case there will be a financial crisis.The situation today does not resemble what happened in the second half of the 1980s, as can be seenfrom Diagram 1. Asset prices have indeed risen strongly in recent years but credit has not grown to thesame extent. It seems that at least to date in the present upswing, Swedish banks and their customershave had another approach to the provision of credit and to borrowing.A pause may be called for here to take a look at monetary policy’s attitude in principle to assetmarkets compared with markets for goods and services. The inflation targeting policy that has beenintroduced in Sweden and other countries in the past decade has in many cases had the purpose ofmastering recurrent overheating in product and labour markets. It might be said, somewhatimproperly, that the policy aims to avoid the “bubbles” that have tended to arise in these markets fromtime to time. To date, the inflation targeting policy must be said to have done well on the whole in thisrespect; today, the inflation target seems to function as a credible benchmark, a nominal anchor, forprice and wage formation. That wage formation does not yet seem to have been fully adjusted -unemployment in Sweden remains high - is another matter. It probably has more to do with structuralfactors.For asset markets, however, there is no such clear benchmark. So neither is there anything to preventpsychological factors - irrational exuberance, if you like - from continuing to inflate various assetprices beyond what is reasonable in relation to underlying economic conditions. The path of theAmerican stock exchange in recent years demonstrates that low inflation is often not sufficient toensure a restrained development of asset prices. That this can be seen as something of a dilemma isunderstandable.Does this imply that monetary policy should in fact be used more than hitherto for actively anddirectly countering sizeable price increases in asset markets? There is no obvious answer to thatquestion but the dominant opinion at present is that the answer should be no. This is because centralbanks would find it difficult to identify true bubbles in the development of asset prices and judge the
5BIS Review 127/1999appropriate measures correctly. Still, I would like to leave the door ajar. Situations may arise that arehard to foresee today and where monetary policy may need to play a part. If risks of a new financialcrisis were to mount up in some distant future, a central bank could not stand idly by.The type of monetary policy regime with an explicit inflation target that applies in Sweden and othercountries does, however, provide ways of coming to terms with problems from fluctuating assetprices. For one thing, the regime means that in the event of asset market instability, the monetarystance is adjusted automatically in a stabilising direction. As asset prices affect aggregate demand andthis is an important mechanism for inflation, interest rates will be raised when asset prices move upand vice versa. This can be expected to exert some stabilising effect on asset markets. For anotherthing, macroeconomic stability as such should have a stabilising influence on financial markets.Focus on the provision of creditWhile a credible macroeconomic policy is needed to prevent financial crises, it is probably notsufficient by itself. It is also necessary to oversee and supervise the financial system, which includeshaving appropriate rules for the operations of banks and other credit institutions.In the final analysis, it was the provision of credit that lay at the heart of the events in the 1990s towhich I have referred. Extensive credit risks constituted the problem and it seems that banks madesimilar mistakes time and again. This applies to the generosity of domestic banks in financing assetinvestments of private players, as well as to the propensity of international banks to place foreigncurrency at the disposal of domestic counterparties. Lending to financial institutions tends to be highlyconcentrated and this exacerbates the situation in times of financial turbulence. It may also be askedwhether credit assessments were as thorough as they should have been.What are the reasons for this? One is probably the difficulties for both banks and supervisors injudging the risks in credit commitments. Credit risks are not simple to handle, neither is it easy toobtain a clear picture of different players’ loan portfolios. So genuine difficulties in makingassessments are one explanation. Another is that in certain cases, instead of attempting to assess risksindependently, banks appear to have simply followed the herd.A recurrent theme in the decade’s crises accordingly seems to be the underestimation of credit risks. Itis therefore up to the banks to establish a better credit policy in their institutions. This credit policymust pervade the whole establishment, from individual credit managers up to the more comprehensivestrategies of executives and boardrooms. But that is not sufficient, or rather it probably will not happenunless measures are also taken by the regulatory and supervisory authorities. This is because in theirlending and general behaviour, banks are influenced by their expectations of how authorities will actin the event of a crisis.Role of the authoritiesOversight in Sweden is the responsibility of the Riksbank. We are required by law to “promote a safeand efficient payment system”. The payment system is such a large component of the financial systemthat our role can really be described as being to promote the latter’s general safety and efficiency.Supervision, however, is the function of the Financial Supervisory Authority.What this means is that the Riksbank primarily oversees developments in a system or a market, whilethe Financial Supervisory Authority, besides monitoring the stability of the entire system, focuses onthe situation in each institution. In practice, however, these two roles are difficult to distinguishclearly, so close cooperation between the two authorities is important. It is indeed a hallmark of ourrelationship, from the executive level down to managers and their personnel.Still, the Riksbank is in a position to detect more direct problems at an early stage, since they arelikely to show up in the payment system, for which we are responsible. Our possibilities of affectingthe course of events then lie in talking with bank executives and informing the Financial SupervisoryAuthority. Moreover, our series of Financial Stability Reports can no doubt exert a more continuous
BIS Review 127/19996influence in this respect. In the longer run the Riksbank can also contribute to stability throughinternational cooperation, as well as by participating in Sweden in work on new legislation and thepromotion of structural changes in various systems.I should like to stress the importance of international cooperation between authorities in differentfields, particularly now that problems in one country tend to spread to other countries more quicklythan before. The Riksbank accordingly participates in the work of the Group of Ten, the Bank forInternational Settlements, the International Monetary Fund and so on.The recurrent crises in financial markets clearly show that work on strengthening systems is acontinuous endeavour and that much remains to be done. Banks and other financial institutions haveadmittedly done a great deal to improve risk management, not least as regards loan portfolios. But thepace of developments in the financial sector is so rapid that neither financial institutions norauthorities can rest on their laurels.It should also be realised that the extensive work in progress on reinforcing the financial system doesnot mean that in future the system will be completely immune to problems.Moreover, our knowledge of phenomena of this type is limited. It may be asked whether it will ever bepossible to predict financial crises. The models with leading indicators that are being tested at presenttend to be too blunt. They sound the alarm about things that never happen and are silent about thosethat actually occur.The authorities must therefore focus on doing everything so that banks and other financial systemshave such good systems for risk management that the probability of financial crises is reduced to aminimum. We must also work to mitigate any effects and try to ensure that crises which do occur arenot as extensive and economically costly as those we have experienced in recent years.The objective, in other words, must be to combine the necessary regulation and supervision of themarkets with the benefits that a well developed financial system can confer. The regulation andsupervision of financial firms are necessary for various reasons. But these functions must be carriedout in such a way that they do not throttle the potential that can contribute to greater prosperity in theglobal economy.ConclusionMany countries have deregulated their financial systems in the past two decades. For the first timesince the outbreak of World War One, capital is again more or less free to move across nationalborders. Moreover, major changes in communications and information technology have provided newmethods and instruments for risk management. As a result of all this, today the financial system ismore extensive and globalised than ever before. This holds even though capital flows relative to GDPwere also large at the turn of the nineteenth century. At the time, however, it was other countries thatreceived the flows, which also took a somewhat different form.The rapid pace of financial developments and internationalisation is really a logical consequence ofthe globalised production of goods and services, with the strong growth of cross-border trade in theworld economy. These developments have accentuated the need of new financial solutions for firmsand households. Expanding foreign trade and globalisation of the production of goods and servicescall for the development and internationalisation of the financial system so that the opportunities ofgreater prosperity can be fully utilised. A well-developed financial system is particularly important,moreover, when advances in tele- and data-communications are beginning to have more far-reachingconsequences for production processes.At the same time, the transition to a more global financial system has not been straightforward.Developments have often been so rapid that systems have been “left behind”. But this does not meanthat the problems lie in the deregulated financial system or in capital mobility as such. Turning backthe clock would be difficult but the notion is worth a thought to indicate the consequences that a returnto a highly regulated financial sector would have in terms of growth and employment.
7BIS Review 127/1999Here I have tried instead to show how the system itself, as well as the authorities around the world, areendeavouring in various ways to contribute to greater financial stability at the same time as thepositive characteristics of the new financial system are allowed to contribute to the growth ofprosperity in the world.
1BIS Review 126/1999Mr Bergström elucidates the economic situation in SwedenSpeech by Mr Villy Bergström, Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at the HSB Finance Day,HSB Bank, held in Stockholm on 18 November 1999.*      *      *The prospects for the Swedish economy look better than for a very long time. We might have to goback several decades to find a period with such favourable conditions as those we are nowexperiencing. It is estimated that the Swedish economy will grow by as much as 3.6% this year, andthe Riksbank forecasts that growth will be slightly higher next year. Despite the marked fall inproduction at the beginning of the 1990s, around 13% more is being produced now than at the end ofthe 1980s when overheating was worst. Part of the income from production has been used to pay offour foreign debt, which grew during the 1980s in a way that was unsustainable in the long term. Thishas been reflected in Sweden’s financial balance with other countries, i.e. the current account balance,which has been in surplus for a number of years and is expected to total SEK40 billion this year. Aftera number of years of large deficits, central government finances are now in surplus for the second yearrunning. From having had the second worst central government budget balance in the whole EU at thebeginning of the 1990s, Sweden’s public finances are now among the strongest in the union. Inflationis under 2% and inflation expectations close to target.What is unique in the present economic situation is that almost all economic indicators point in theright direction; we have high growth on a broad front at the same time as inflation expectations arestably low and central government finances in order. An important factor underlying this favourablesituation is that economic policy in recent years has been carried out in a consistent and competentway.Monetary policy with the focus on price stability has played an important role although the favourabledevelopment would not have come about without a responsible fiscal policy. While households andwage earners have borne a large share of the burden by income-reducing cuts in central governmentfinances, this seems to have taken place on the basis of a general insight that sacrifices were necessaryfor the time being.However, unemployment is still high and the frequency of employment low compared with previoussuccessful epochs in Sweden, although there are statistical indications that the situation is improving.Unemployment is falling and approximately 100,000 more are in work than last year. The employmentratio has risen from 72% to 74% of the working-age population.The great challenge for economic policy and for the social partners on the labour market is to continueto act responsibly so that the period of good growth that our country is experiencing is not interruptedprematurely. In this way, the period of growth can probably be extended for several years and theemployment ratio can also increase markedly then.Difficult balance to strike for monetary policyThe Riksbank must strike a balance in monetary policy so that growth is not dampened unnecessarilybut neither becomes so strong that inflation accelerates. The difficulties lie in foreseeing the growth ofdemand and its relation to inflation over a period of a couple of years to come. A change in interestrates actually has an effect with a considerable time lag, its full impact only being felt after a couple ofyears. If changes in interest rates come too late, the consequences will be unnecessarily largefluctuations in growth. However, experience shows that if inflation is allowed to rise, there is a greatrisk that the higher inflation will persist and that inflation expectations will be driven up. Theconsequence of the Riksbank’s “wait-and-see” standpoint would therefore be to imperil the credibilitythat has been laboriously achieved - or even lose it. Considerably greater restraint would then berequired than if inflation had been stopped in time. In order to avoid this, the Riksbank may need to
BIS Review 126/19992increase interest rates before registered inflation shows signs of increasing, which will confront uswith an educational problem. If the Riksbank wishes to safeguard growth, employment, and a high useof resources in other respects, monetary policy must be adapted in time.Low inflation expectationsHowever, as has been said, it is also important not to increase interest rates too early and thus dampengrowth unnecessarily. A difficult question that the Riksbank must take a position on in its assessmentof inflationary pressure is whether the relationship between growth and inflation has changed and, inthis case, which factors have contributed to this. A concept that has been frequently discussed duringthe past year is the “new economy”. Discussion has above all centred on the American economy,which now seems to be at the end of a long period of high growth. It seems as if the USA has skippedan entire business cycle. This was in fact also the case in the 1980s. There was an upswing in 1982 andno downturn occurred before 1990-91. However, it is now speculated whether the new technology, ITinvestments and computerisation have changed transaction costs, management functions andproduction processes so that the growth in productivity has been durably increased and that growth hastherefore been able to increase more quickly without leading to increased inflationary pressure.The hypothesis about the new economy has also been put forward with regard to the Swedisheconomy. However, it will be first in ten years’ time when researchers have long and many series ofdata to analyse that we make any more certain pronouncement about the actual situation.However, we can talk in terms of a radical change in the Swedish economy in one important respectwith regard to the relationship between growth and inflation. Inflation expectations in Sweden seem tohave stabilised around 2%, which indicates that the target for price stability has attained highcredibility. During the 1970s and 1980s, inflation amounted to 8% on average. This means thatwage-earners, landlords, central and local government and entrepreneurs now calculate with quitedifferent nominal price increases than previously in their budgets and their pricing decisions.However, this is not an expression of a new economy but rather indicates a return to the conditionsthat existed in the first two decades after the Second World War.Developments during the Korean War clearly show the importance of low inflation expectations forthe development of the economy. The well-based expectations made it possible to restore the economyto a rate of inflation of 3% a year after inflation had risen to 20%. The return to low inflation couldtake place without any dramatic restraint and without mass unemployment.Comparisons between this year’s wage development and wage development during the previous highinflation period are a strong illustration that high nominal wage increases do not have a positivecorrelation with real wage increases. While real wage increases this year are expected to total around3%, wage earners have periodically experienced reductions in real wages in the period 1975 to 1995and on average only slightly over a half per cent increase. This despite the fact that the nominal wageincreases remained at 3% this year while being as much as 8% during the comparison period. Neithershould we forget the deterioration in living standards that Swedish wage earners and the Swedishpeople experienced compared with other European countries during these years.Sustainable improvements in productivity due to a “new economy”?Developments in IT and biotechnology have taken place very quickly in Sweden. Telecommunicationsand pharmaceuticals are hi-tech products, which are growing quickly in Swedish exports. Exports oftelecommunications products have more than doubled since 1995 and pharmaceuticals have risen by80%. The economy is undergoing a restructuring towards these areas which releases us to some extentfrom the cyclical dependence on pulp, paper, steel and engineering products which are our traditionalexport goods.However, most important perhaps are not developments in these industries per se. Although they aregrowing rapidly, they are still of rather small size. The computing consultancy industry has doubledduring the 1990s but still only accounts for 80,000 employees, or around 2% of employment. The
3BIS Review 126/1999sector “radio, TV and telecommunications products” is approximately the same size. Industry as awhole has recovered from under 18% of GDP in 1993 to 22% in 1998.No, the really important effects of the new technology will probably take place outside the hi-tech andknowledge-intensive industries. Personal computers, mobile telephones, the Internet, and other IT canincrease productivity within broad segments of the Swedish economy. This can affect trade, officework, distribution and storage, manufacturing production, etc. However, it is important to realise thatthe introduction of new technology only takes place during a limited period and that it is probably onlyduring these years that a higher growth in productivity is achieved. When the changes to the new arecarried out, it is probable that productivity will develop more slowly again. This can be compared withthe introduction of electricity and the spread of electrical motors in industry, or the spread of theinternal combustion motor.I would thus like to warn against viewing the future through rose-tinted spectacles. It is true thatproductivity growth has been higher after 1994 than in the preceding 20-year period. An increase from1.4% to 1.9% has been registered. However, the first period included three long downturns and thesecond a broad upswing. We cannot therefore know whether it is only cyclical differences thatunderlie the figures or whether technological changes have also contributed to sustainable strongerproductivity growth.To sum up, I would like to point out that we now have a better relationship between growth andinflation due to inflationary expectations being pushed down. It is possible that technicaldevelopments have also produced productivity improvements that mean that growth for a period canincrease more quickly than previously without inflationary pressure being created. One factor that Ihave not touched on to date is the effects of increased competition through internationalisation anddomestic deregulation. This process too can have contributed to a better relationship between inflationand growth although it is difficult to prove that this is the case. However, I am to say the least doubtfulabout a new economy in the sense of new technology leading to a sustainable increase in productivity.Wage formation - a challengeThe strong upswing the Swedish economy is now undergoing is borne up both by domestic andinternational demand. Private consumption is expanding rapidly, at the same time as export isrecovering and the public sector is beginning to demand labour again. In the present situation, it isconsidered that there are unused resources in the economy, but when growth increases the use ofresources and inflationary pressure will naturally also increase. As has been said, the Riksbank mustassess how strong growth in demand can be permitted without inflationary pressure compellinginterest rate rises. A current theme is the discussion on changes in the relationship between growth andinflation, which I have taken up in general terms. Another very important part in the inflation processis wage formation and I find here that it is justified to give prominence to the risk that evidentimbalances between different categories of wage earners can lead to the positive development we arenow seeing being prematurely interrupted.The collective agreements that have recently been concluded do not give any particularly great causefor concern. Wage increases have been around 3% per year. I have no doubt about the parties’ insightinto the importance of the inflation target for wage formation in general. However, most agreementsexpire next year.It has proven during the autumn that the majority of the teacher training places in the sciences andmathematics are vacant. This is not so strange since a person who can successfully study mathematicsand physics at university can also become a graduate engineer or industrialist scientist. Initial salariesbetween a graduate engineer and a science teacher differ by SEK3-4,000. Salaries for a competentengineer have no ceiling while for a teacher the top salary is not much above SEK20,000. Teachershave not been slow to make use of the scarcity of certain categories of teachers to demand 15% morethan all other groups over a 5-year period, despite there not being a shortage of all categories ofteachers. This has naturally led to protest from the Swedish Trade Union Confederation.
BIS Review 126/19994If this type of imbalance cannot be dealt with by the union organisations and employers without ageneral scramble for pay increases, the Riksbank will be confronted by the unpleasant task ofconstraining the economy in order to prevent excessively high wage increases having an impact oninflation. The low inflation policy may therefore be said to be confronted by a test: the labour marketis improving with falling unemployment and increasing capacity use otherwise. At the same time,there are imbalances in the sense that relative wages do not attract applicants for employment to theareas in the labour market where there are shortages. The challenge is to find a solution within theframework of the scope for pay increases created by the growth in productivity and inflationaryexpectations on a level with the target.Make use of available opportunitiesSweden’s opportunities for regaining some lost ground in the prosperity league are good. Our countryhas a population which has taken to new technology in the field of IT more quickly than in many othercountries; computer use is widespread at workplaces and also homes. According to a SIFO survey, 3.5million Swedes surf the Internet - almost half of the population aged between 12 and 79. No fewerthan 2 million Swedes surf every day. Even more remarkable is the fact that almost 20% of the agegroups between 50 and 80 are active on the Internet. Together with some other countries, Swedentakes the absolutely leading position with regard to the use of IT, computers and mobile telephones.Young new entrepreneurs are starting successful businesses within the new areas alongside giants suchas Ericsson. Pharmaceutical research and biotechnology are other areas where Sweden is well to thefore. Sweden is investing more in research in proportion to GDP than any other country in the world.As the conditions are now very good with regard to the immediate economic trends that I mentioned tobegin with, and as the structural changes in the Swedish business sector towards new advanced fieldsof production are moving quickly, it would be a national misfortune if wage formation were to get outof hand due to the parties not being able to deal with imbalances in relative wages.Consequences for monetary policy?What conclusions can be drawn regarding monetary policy? My intention with today’s speech is not tomake new statements about current monetary policy. The intention is instead to create understandingfor the balances that have to be struck and the risks that must be avoided in order for monetary policyto make a contribution to the positive development of the Swedish economy.The role of the interest rate for demand of goods and services and inflation can be described as followsin a highly simplified way. A real rate of interest, which neither stimulates nor dampens demand, maybe said to be neutral. Demand then increases at the rate of capacity growth and inflation is stable.When capacity in the economy is not fully made use of and unemployment is high, the interest ratemay - on condition that inflation expectations are in line with the target - need to be below its neutralposition in order to stimulate demand so that it increases more quickly than capacity utilisation. In thisway, unemployment can be taken up in production, capacity utilisation increase and inflation beadjusted upwards to the target. In the same way, the interest rate needs to be above its neutral position,when capacity utilisation is full and demand is tending to grow more quickly than the utilisation ofcapacity. The economy then needs to be cooled down to prevent inflation exceeding the target. It is thetask of monetary policy to control short interest rates so that demand pressure is adjusted to capacitygrowth to achieve the inflation target. The growth in capacity in the long-term is determined by otherfactors, however, than monetary policy.The level of the neutral interest rate varies over time. According to some theories on optimality, a veryrough rule of thumb is that the neutral real interest rate in the long term and when the economy is inbalance is near the long-term growth of GDP. In Germany, real short-term interest rates have since1980s been around 3.3% while the corresponding rates in the USA are around 3.5%. While it is notpossible to specify a neutral level for Swedish interest rates, there is no doubt that monetary policyeven after last week’s increase will continue to have an expansive effect on demand.
5BIS Review 126/1999In practice, monetary policy decisions are based on an overall assessment of a number of inflationindicators. The interest rate reductions during the past year from 4.35% in June 1998 to 2.9% in Marchthis year took place with a view to stimulating demand, increase employment and increase capacityutilisation in order in this way to bring inflation up to the goal of 2%. The Riksbank’s most recentinflation report makes the assessment that there are unused resources in the present situation but thatthe available resources will gradually be taken into use during the forecast period. The statisticspublished thereafter give a somewhat fragmented picture but, taken as a whole, do not occasion anychange in the view of growth prospects in the economy.The assessment of the Riksbank is now that inflation in 1 to 2 years will be marginally higher than inthe most recent inflation reports. In the light of this, the Riksbank made the assessment at its meetingon 11 November to conduct monetary policy in a less expansive direction. The repo rate was thereforeincreased by 0.35 percentage points to 3.25%.As has been said, the difficult balance to be struck in the present situation is to adjust the instrumentalrate at a rate that does not interrupt the upswing in capacity utilisation but does it with sufficientforesight to avoid a drastic rise. We do not want to experience “stop-go” policies again. Let us notforget the late 1980s and early 1990s. That period represents a tragic failure for economic policy, afailure that cost Sweden destruction of both physical and human capital.Earlier in my speech, I pointed to the imbalances in wage formation that could lead to inflationaccelerating if they are handled incorrectly. This would make monetary policy tightening necessarythat would risk interrupting growth and structural transformation, because the inflation target ismandatory and will not be given up. The Riksbank has both the instrument and the political mandateto achieve the target of 2%’s inflation. The issue then is not whether the inflation target will be met butthe consequences that achieving the inflation target will have for the rate of growth and employment inthe medium term. The Riksbank is responsible for achieving the inflation target, but responsibility forthe positive development that we can now see in front of us being sustained over a longer period, isshared by everyone in Sweden.
1BIS Review 125/1999Mr Noyer considers some consequences ofglobalisation for policymakers and the conduct of monetary policyIntroductory statement by Mr Christian Noyer, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, at theFifth International Financial and Economic Forum: “Impact of globally liberalised capital markets”,organised by IFW in Vienna on 11 November 1999.*      *      *IntroductionGlobalisation - understood as the internationalisation of political, social and economic affairs - affectsboth policymaking as well as our daily lives. The idea that we live in a “global village” is perhapssuggested by the fact that on our satellite television we can immediately watch events which areunfolding in very distant places. Or perhaps it is a subtler feeling gradually coming into our mindswhile we fill in an e-mail order to buy a new book listed in a far-off country.However, there is ample evidence that the world we live in is not yet the fully globally integratedsystem often portrayed in economics textbooks. For example, the prices of tradable goods in differentcountries expressed in a common currency sometimes converge to a common level rather slowly.Asset portfolios tend to exhibit “home bias”. Thus, in a fundamental sense, it seems that there is“some” globalisation yet to come.Nevertheless, the internationalisation of markets, in particular those in the financial sphere, hasimportant implications for the conduct of monetary policy. As international investors thoroughlyscrutinise national economic and political developments, unexpected changes in the latter, or “news”,may trigger the reassessment of investment strategies. These, in turn, may have an impact on exchangerates, interest rates and equity prices.Against this background it is understandable that it sometimes appears more convenient to blame“foreign speculators” or “global markets” for all kinds of economic and social problems, rather thanacknowledge their domestic origin, which quite often lies in unsustainable domestic economic policiesand a lack of structural reforms.Of course, it goes without saying that financial markets can also be wrong in their assessment of thefundamental determinants of asset prices. International investors can sometimes be influenced by fadsand self-fulfilling beliefs which drive prices away from their fundamental determinants. Asset price“bubbles” can emerge. However, it is very difficult for policymakers to identify such misalignmentsand bubbles. Moreover, increased volatility of financial markets and perceived misalignments areoften related to fundamental factors such as policy failures and to a lack of transparency and clarity inpolicymaking.In the remainder of my presentation I shall focus on monetary policymaking in a global market. Thesubject is naturally too vast to be fully covered in my introductory statement. Thus, I shall focus myattention on two issues which I think are relevant to our discussion today. First, I shall mention someof the consequences of globalisation for policymakers. Second, I shall explain why I think that themonetary policy strategy of the European Central Bank is well designed to face the challengesstemming from globalisation.Some consequences of globalisation for policymakersWith regard to the first issue, let me emphasise that I do not believe that globalisation has eliminatedpolicymakers’ influence over domestic political, social and economic developments, particularly inlarger industrialised countries (or areas). On the contrary, the fact that people and capital can movemore freely and quickly across borders makes the consequences of national policy decisions for the
BIS Review 125/19992respective economies much more immediate and visible. Obviously, this makes national policymakingand its presentation to the public more demanding.Naturally, there is a disciplinary effect which comes from globalisation but this does not necessarilyrun counter to the national interest. The influence of domestic policymakers can be used for good orevil. Globalisation improves the incentives for national politicians to implement good policies, such asstructural reforms, which increase the flexibility of the economy. This is demanded by the Treatyestablishing the European Community, which requires Member States and the ESCB to “act inaccordance with the principles of an open-market economy with free competition”. These policies willcontribute to improved growth and employment perspectives. I believe in the idea that all nations gainfrom trade, including trade in financial assets. Notwithstanding possible imperfections in the financialmarkets, international capital market integration can yield considerable benefits. However, it isimportant to stress that without flexible markets, countries will not be able to reap the full benefits ofglobalisation.Moreover, it is well known that national authorities would face an impossible task if they had toreconcile in a sustained manner the objectives of what has been called the “inconsistent quartet” of(1) free trade, (2) complete international capital mobility, (3) fixed or managed exchange rates and(4) national autonomy in the conduct of monetary policy. The painful lesson to be learned fromeconomic theory and historical experience is that these four elements cannot coexist, and that at leastone will have to give way. This is of course one of the major insights which Robert Mundell, thisyear’s Nobel prize winner, taught us more than 30 years ago.Globalisation also implies that certain types of policy measures become less effective. This refers inparticular to all regulations which can easily be circumvented by the private sector by redirectingbusiness activities to foreign countries or by transferring funds abroad.The Eurosystem took this into account in elaborating its operational framework, which was set up inline with the market principle. For example, there is no facility which explicitly or implicitlysubsidises counterparties. Moreover, the remuneration of reserve requirements eliminates the dangerthat domestic residents will hold deposits outside the euro area in order to avoid the costs related tonon-remuneration.The monetary policy strategy of the Eurosystem and globalisationAs regards the conduct of monetary policy, I think that, in particular in large economies, central bankscontinue to be able to influence liquidity conditions and thus short-term market rates, irrespective ofglobalisation and of whether the currency is widely used outside the currency area concerned (ornational boundaries). Monetary policy - by adjusting short-term interest rates - will therefore still be ina position to maintain price stability in the respective currency area. However, globalisationsometimes makes it more difficult to analyse monetary policy indicators and to investigate andunderstand the transmission mechanism.An important precondition for monetary policy to remain effective in a globalised environment is ahigh degree of credibility. If international markets lose confidence in monetary policy, the negativeimplications for the domestic economy are likely to be significantly larger in an environment ofclosely integrated financial markets. The need to remain credible in a globalised market requires aconvincing strategy and transparent communication. In this respect the Eurosystem is well equipped,as I shall now explain.The primary objective of the Eurosystem is to maintain price stability in the euro area, as laid down inthe Treaty establishing the European Community. To fulfil its mandate, the Governing Council of theEuropean Central Bank has adopted a monetary policy strategy which is neither conventionalmonetary targeting, nor direct inflation targeting, nor a simple mixture of the two. Rather theEurosystem’s monetary policy strategy is new, reflecting the unique circumstances surrounding thebirth of the euro.
3BIS Review 125/1999The adoption of the single monetary policy by 11 European countries marked a significant shift ofregime. Under these circumstances, the uncertainty facing the Eurosystem in respect of the indicatorproperties of monetary, financial and other economic variables for future price developments, and withregard to the reaction of the private sector to monetary policy measures, is greater than has typicallybeen the case in national contexts in the past.Against this background, the Eurosystem explicitly eschews placing reliance solely on a singleindicator or intermediate target for the conduct of monetary policy. The strategy aims to identify thoseeconomic disturbances which threaten price stability and to prompt a monetary policy response whichis appropriate for maintaining price stability taking into account both the prevailing economiccircumstances and the nature of the threat.Given that the Eurosystem’s strategy has been designed in this way, globalisation and the uncertaintiesand changes which it implies will not impair the ability of the Eurosystem to maintain price stability.The Eurosystem’s monetary policy is based on a clear framework which is able to cope with thepossible impact of external developments on the economic situation in the euro area. In particular, oneof the strengths of this strategy is that it allows for all relevant indicators to be taken into account overtime.By assigning overriding priority to the maintenance of price stability, the Eurosystem seeks to avoidadding to uncertainty. In a global market, this orientation provides the world with an invaluable publicgood. However, focusing on domestic price stability will necessitate flexibility in the long run. Thisflexibility includes exchange rate flexibility. As indicated by Mundell’s famous quartet, if three of thefour conditions are fulfilled - free trade, international capital mobility and an independent domesticmonetary policy focusing on the maintenance of price stability - it is not possible to maintain fixedexchange rates.There is widespread agreement that inflation in the medium to long term is a monetary phenomenon.The relationship between money and prices is one of the more strongly stylised facts in economics.There are good reasons to believe that this relationship will remain robust in the face of structuralchanges and globalisation, as it proved to be in the past. In its monetary policy strategy theEurosystem therefore gives a prominent role to money. This is signalled by the announcement of areference value for the growth of a broad monetary aggregate (M3). M3 includes a wide spectrum ofconventional bank deposits, as well as close substitutes for these, such as marketable short-term bankliabilities. Consequently, it is less likely to be affected by portfolio shifts.When devising its strategy, the Eurosystem took into account the fact that the relationship betweenmoney and prices might be affected, in the short term, by the structural changes and behavioural andstatistical uncertainties linked to the shift of regime associated with the move to Stage Three ofEconomic and Monetary Union. Therefore, the concept of a reference value does not mean that theEurosystem will change its policy stance or react in a mechanical way to deviations of M3 growthfrom the reference value. A careful analysis of the reasons behind monetary developments mustalways be carried out before drawing policy conclusions. The prominent role for money implies thatmonetary developments are thoroughly assessed for the information which they provide with regard tothe outlook for price developments. Monetary policy will react in such a way as to address the threatsto price stability revealed by this analysis.In parallel with the analysis of monetary developments, a broadly based assessment of a wide range ofeconomic indicators, including foreign and international developments, will help to inform theGoverning Council of the specific nature of the macroeconomic environment and the disturbances tothe economy on which monetary policy decisions normally depend. A reliance on a single indicatorvariable or intermediate target would not prompt the appropriate response in all circumstances. This isall the more true in view of the increasing role of external developments resulting from globalisationand financial market spillovers.The euro exchange rate plays an important role as it can have an impact on consumer prices, bothdirectly via import prices and indirectly via exports and real activity. However, the strategy eschewsmechanistic reactions to exchange rate movements.
BIS Review 125/19994The emergence of the euro as an international currency with the concomitant reduction in the numberof key players in international monetary relations requires an intensified exchange of information oninternational monetary issues. However, it should be recognised that international monetary policycoordination such as exchange rate targeting or the coordination of the “global policy-mix” couldjeopardise the goal of price stability and endanger the credibility of monetary policy. It could also riskdecreasing accountability and reducing transparency. This would clearly be very undesirable.It seems plausible that in the future further countries will consider anchoring, or decide to anchor, theircurrency either formally or informally to the euro or to a basket of currencies in which the euro wouldbe a major component. Given the prospects of EU enlargement, visible changes are likely to take placein this area in the near future. The sustainability of pegs to the euro will require that these countrieshave a sound banking system, follow credible and sound monetary and fiscal policies and enhance,through structural reforms, the flexibility of their product and labour markets. Normally, the closer theexchange rate link, the more important it is that these preconditions should be fulfilled. This isparticularly the case for currency boards.We are convinced that maintaining price stability in the euro area in a way which is credible,irrespective of the role that the euro plays in third countries, is the best contribution which themonetary policy of the Eurosystem can make to favourable developments in the global economy.ConclusionLet me conclude by saying that globalisation makes the assessment of the economic environment amore intricate task and the transmission mechanism of monetary policy more uncertain. There will bean increased risk of exposure to the spillover effects of economic and financial disturbances, whichwill necessitate closer analysis of economic developments from a worldwide perspective. However,we are convinced that we have a monetary policy strategy which is designed in such a way that it canbe adapted to varying situations and the new challenges arising from globalisation.
1BIS Review 125/1999Mr Macfarlane comments on monetary policy in AustraliaNotes by Mr I J Macfarlane, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, for a talk to AustralianBusiness Economists on 11 November 1999.*      *      *I will say a few words on monetary policy tonight, but they are not intended to be very profound. Thisis partly because I have recently held forth on the subject in the Chris Higgins Lecture. You will alsobe aware that we have made a change to monetary policy, issued an accompanying press release, andalso issued our regular half-yearly report within the past week or so. With so many public statementsin such a short time, we should have got our point of view over to everyone by now. So my commentstonight are not intended to point to any new direction in monetary policy - they are meant only as anelaboration on a couple of points in what we have already said.We have just been through an exercise in which monetary policy was tightened for the first time infive years. History shows that interest rates have to go up as often as they go down, but although weall know this, Australia has had particular difficulty in handling these rises in the past. Not that theproblem has been confined to Australia, many others have had the same experience. Tightenings havetended to be delayed for too long, and when they have finally occurred, they have often been quiteabrupt and accompanied by heated political argument. This was certainly the pattern in the 1970s and1980s, although we made a big step forward in the 1994 tightening as I emphasised in my recentlecture.On this occasion, I would maintain that the tightening was neither delayed nor abrupt, and it certainlytook few people by surprise. But more importantly, the response to it by the economic community andby politicians was extremely civilised. Although some people expressed disagreement, I detected noheat or acrimony in their words. In the political sphere, the comments made by the Government, theOpposition and others showed that we have gone a long way down the path of depoliticising monetarypolicy. This is a very welcome development, and although there were a number of steps along thepath, the most important one was the joint signing of the Statement on the Conduct of Monetary Policyin 1996.Those who disagreed with our decision to tighten tended to point out that there were few signs that theeconomy was overheating, that inflation was not threatening to exceed the target over the forecasthorizon, and that wages growth was not heading up (as in 1994). As a description of the economy, thatassessment was essentially correct, and we have no desire to dispute it. But the implication for policywhich was drawn from this assessment was not, in our view, correct. In our view, it reflected a ratherdated approach to the application of monetary policy.The traditional view is that you only begin to tighten monetary policy when things have become, orclearly will become, overheated or, in other words, out of control. The tightening in thosecircumstances is a sign that something has gone wrong and is, in effect, an admission of policy failure.Hence, the ample scope it provides for criticism, particularly in the political arena. The unusual aspectof the recent tightening is that it occurred before things had become, or were about to become, out ofcontrol. If it is successful, it will mean that they do not get out of control in the foreseeable future.That is what is meant by the term “pre-emptive”.But clearly we could not have just picked any period when the economy was performing well andchosen to tighten monetary policy and claimed it was done in order to be pre-emptive. There had to begood reasons why it was now - in the final quarter of 1999 - that we made this decision. Although wehave explained this in our Semi-Annual Statement, I would like to spell out a couple of aspects of thisin the time remaining tonight.
BIS Review 125/199921.The international aspectAlthough it is only a year ago, most of us have forgotten how gloomy the prospects seemed in thesecond half of 1998. This was the time when the Asian problems had spread via Russia and LatinAmerica to Wall Street itself. If you look back at the press release which accompanied our easing ofmonetary policy in December 1998, you will see it referred to the expectation by official and privateforecasters that 1999 would be a worse year than 1998.As we now know, the world did not turn out that way - 1999 has turned out to be a stronger year than1998, and both official and private forecasters are now expecting 2000 to be stronger again. I do notwish to quibble with this assessment. I merely wish to record that from about the middle of 1999,markets around the world began to recognise that the accommodative stance of monetary policy bymajor central banks that had been so appropriate for 1998 and early 1999 was starting to look lessappropriate as 1999 progressed and strengthened. This reassessment happened first in the UnitedStates and was soon followed in other English-speaking countries and then in Europe.As usual, the markets were quicker off the mark to raise market interest rates than they needed to be,but they were broadly correct. Since mid-year, we have seen the United States, the United Kingdom,Australia and the ECB tighten monetary policy. I suspect there will be a few more countries to comein the not too distant future.2.Domestic eventsJust as the weakness of the world economy did not come to pass, a similar expectation of weakness inAustralia failed to materialise. Real GDP in Australia again grew by over 4% in the 12 months to theJune quarter and will probably still be showing a similar rate in the 12 months to the Septemberquarter. This measure may slip for a time as we drop off some of the high quarterly growth rates fromour calculations, but we think growth will remain robust over the next 12 months.Similarly, the quite lengthy period during which inflation was undershooting our target seems to havecome to an end. The CPI inflation rate would already be a bit over 2% apart from the Government’sreduction in the Health Rebate Levy. Although some of this result has been due to rises in oil prices,measures of underlying or core inflation, which are largely unaffected by oil prices, have also risen byabout 2% over the past 12 months.Thus, the period where the Australian economy was experiencing a contractionary impact from abroadand where the outlook was for weaker growth and sub-2% inflation has now well and truly passed.The monetary policy that was appropriate for that period is no longer appropriate to the newcircumstances that we face. That is the main reason behind the tightening of monetary policy weundertook after our November Board Meeting.This move was what the flexible inflation targeting framework suggests should happen. There is someconfusion, however, on this point and so it is worth spending some time to clarify it. Someinterpretations of the target imply that the Bank is not supposed to contemplate any rise in interestrates until the upper end of the target is threatened. This is equivalent to saying that the mostexpansionary setting reached during the downward phase of the interest rate cycle should bemaintained until such time as a move to a clearly restrictive setting is required, and only then should amove be made. (That virtually guarantees that such moves will be large.) It is as though policy has tooperate only with settings of maximum “go”, and heavy braking.This is a reading of the framework we do not share. There is a range of settings of the instrumentbetween “maximum go” and “heavy braking”. Most of the time we would expect interest rates to be inthat range.Let us look at two possible situations where monetary policy should be changed:• The first is when inflation is above the target. In this situation, the inflation targetingframework would say to raise interest rates to a setting which would bring inflation back tothe target. But once the higher rates had done their job, they should be gradually reduced to
3BIS Review 125/1999more normal levels. This is what happened in 1996. We did not wait until our forecast hadinflation falling below 2% before we started to ease.• The second is when inflation is below the target. In this case, the framework would call for asetting of interest rates which would, over time, allow inflation to go back up to the target.Once it is clear that such a setting had done its job, the framework calls for it to be replacedby one more likely to keep inflation at the target. The framework does not envisage thepolicy setting being maintained until something goes wrong.Now some may object that all this smacks of fine tuning. I agree that we should not delude ourselvesthat the economy can be precisely controlled so that inflation stays within or close to the band, evenwhen there are no external shocks. The point remains, however, that even if the process is not precise,the instrument does not remain at its most extreme setting once that is no longer needed. As theoutlook changes, and as the balance of risks shifts, it is appropriate also for the policy instrument toshift.3.What about the GST?Some people have not been convinced by the arguments I have used above. Some still cannotunderstand why you would tighten unless the economy was overheating, and assume that there mustbe a hidden agenda. Others are keen to play the old game of trying to find a political dimension tomonetary policy. This has led some people to say that the real reason is our fear of the inflationaryeffects of the GST, but that we are too diplomatic to say so. I am sorry to disappoint the proponents ofthis view, but that is not the case.• If the GST was the reason for tightening monetary policy, why have the Fed, the Bank ofEngland and the ECB tightened monetary policy? I am not aware of the forthcomingintroduction of a GST in any of these countries.• Our starting point has always been that the imposition of the GST should not have an effecton wages because wage earners will gain more from the accompanying fall in income taxrates than they will lose from the introduction of the GST. The net effect of the tax changeswill be to increase the disposable income of wage earners by more than the increase in theirexpenditure, as is evidenced by the fact that the package involves a cost to the Budget.• Monetary policy is based on a view that inflation will be within the target immediatelybefore the GST is introduced and that it will be back within the target a year later. This view,in turn, is based on the assumption that there will be no second round effects due to higherwage outcomes as outlined above. If we started to observe behaviour that indicates that thisassumption was not correct, then monetary policy would act upon it. We are not acting atpresent on the expectation that this assumption will be violated - we are acting in theexpectation that it will hold.4.The need for a long expansionWe have made a point of saying that the recent monetary policy tightening is designed to increase thelength of the expansion. Again, this may not be universally accepted, as many people associatetightenings with the end of expansions.Our position may seem the wrong way round to those who have a more traditional view of monetarypolicy, but I want to make a few points of clarification:• First, this is not a new position on our part. We did not wait until we already had the runs onthe board before specifying our aim was to have a long expansion. Before I took up this jobin early September 1996, I was asked by the Parliamentary Committee why you wouldtighten in an expansion, and my reply was as follows:
BIS Review 125/19994“In the long run, if you want to have a good performance on growth and a good performanceon employment, the best thing you can do is to pursue policies that extend the length of therecovery. In the past, we have sometimes had the problem of very strong expansions and abuild-up of very big inflationary pressures followed by sharp contractions. In the sharpcontraction unemployment goes up very quickly. The way that monetary policy cancontribute to a better outcome is not to have a short sharp expansion which generatesinflationary pressures, but to have a long slow one. To have a long slow one, it means thatyou occasionally have to be pre-emptive, at the first signs of things getting out of control youhave to squeeze down.”Please excuse the inelegant phrasing - it was an “off the cuff” reply to a question from aCommittee member. But at least it shows that we have been consistent on this point since atleast mid-1996.• The second point is that if you have a very long expansion, it seems reasonable to me that itwill include a number of phases of monetary policy. It is not as though, in order to get theexpansion, you continuously ease monetary policy and then as soon as you tighten it, itbrings the expansion to an end and you then experience a recession. It seems far more likelynow that a long expansion will include perhaps two or three phases of tightening and easing,as monetary policy seeks to extend the length of the expansion. And, of course, if it is a lowinflation expansion, as it would have to be to in order to be a long one, the tightenings andeasings of monetary policy may then take place over a relatively small range of interest ratesettings.5.Concluding remarksI was going to conclude by saying a few things about communicating with the public, or what is nowknown as transparency. But the more I think about this, the more complicated it gets. So the onethought I will conclude with is this. Sometimes it is possible to be reasonably direct when talking tothe public, as I believe we have been over the past few weeks. That is because we had a clear viewabout what needed to be done. But more often than not, you find yourself in a grey area where there isnot a strong case to do something, where all incoming data have to be evaluated on their merits andpolicy options weighed up. In such situations, you cannot give views about the direction of policy- you cannot say more than you honestly believe - and that will often disappoint people looking for aclear guide to future action.
