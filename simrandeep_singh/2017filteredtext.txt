 i’d like thank matt corder, chris salmon, michael saunders, greg thwaites anthony veal, along colleagues, helpful comment assistance. i reserve particular thank economic advisor alina barnett. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 1 brexit pound speech give ben broadbent, deputy governor monetary policy imperial college, london 23 march 2017 all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 2 2 introduction summary the vote leave eu lead big drop sterling’s exchange rate. one consequence rise import price squeeze households’ real income. we may already see impact squeeze retail spending, real term fell quite sharply around turn year. while it’s hit income households, however, depreciation come boon many exporters. in sterling term good export price rise 12% course last year. this significantly boost exporters’ profitability incentive invest extra capacity. in general, it’s really right – enough least – think impact change exchange rate isolation. asset price volatile short run, sometimes inexplicably so. but time tend move reason. they’re drive deep thing important effect own. to get full picture need take account, partial impact change exchange rate underlie driver well. take sterling’s fall 2008 2009. one plausible explanation financial sector important uk – notably export government’s tax receipt – countries. so economy public finance vulnerable global financial crisis. the depreciation help cushion effect wasn’t enough outweigh them. the downturn le severe elsewhere, notwithstanding sterling’s fall. sterling’s recent decline clearly prompt referendum result. it also seem likely foreign exchange market decide consequence negative. the plausible explanation depreciation that, eye market, leave eu make export hard costly. to help compensate currency need cheaper. there many important difference 2008/09, course. one this: brexit hasn’t happen yet. back sterling’s fall happen alongside cause. on occasion depreciation reflect belief change uk’s future trade arrangements, it’s act economy arrangement time unchanged. the result – high price profit unchanged rule cost – represent something sweet spot exporter business compete imports. how respond one important determination economic growth year. usually, one positive aspect exchange-rate depreciation that, raise profitability, encourage expansion firm tradable sector. with world economy good health time, certainty every incentive today. on occasion response might mute usual, however, it’s clear long sweet spot last. if currency market right uk’s future trade relationship le favourable; it’s pessimistic sterling likely rebound. either all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 3 3 way, future return tradable sector may healthy right now. this may act something deterrent longer-term, sunk-cost investment sector. in follow i’ll begin look sterling economics say reaction referendum result. i’ll say something depreciation work small open economies, particular impact profitability investment tradable sector. there’s short conclude section. sterling’s response eu referendum: exchange-rate economics so let’s begin depreciation proximate cause, outcome referendum. the link two clear long vote itself. in month lead june 23 tight correlation value currency perceive likelihood “remain” vote (chart 1). that’s mpc, condition may 2016 forecast outcome, assume high path exchange rate. it’s also committee suggest might “sharp correction” sterling’s value event leave vote. and event that’s got. on june 23 24 sterling fell dollar two-day period since devaluation 1967. you didn’t need economics make prediction – relationship chart 1 enough. but probably need economics want understand currency react way. while don’t know precisely what’s collective mind chart 1: sterling sensitive expect result well referendum source: bloomberg, thomson reuters datastream, betfair foreign exchange market, view two broad possibilities: brexit expect either weaken domestic demand raise cost exporting. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 4 4 to understand effect remember first real exchange rate is: relative price consumption compare trade partners1. suppose split consumption stuff produce domestically (“non-tradables” like home haircuts) thing also import abroad (“tradables” holiday cars). this distinction important you’d expect price trade good service move reasonably closely across country (i’ll return point later). if so, turn re-express real exchange rate term another relative price, non-traded trade output2: 𝜀≈𝑝𝑁𝑇𝑝𝑇⁄ [1] so thing happen push relative price, whether demand supply side economy, real exchange rate tend move direction. take domestic demand first. the material distinction non-traded tradable output that, whereas first supply domestically, second also produce elsewhere: overall supply “elastic”. new house build domestically locate firms; car make everywhere. so even general increase domestic demand put relatively pressure resource use produce non-tradables global supply limited. a result relative price tend rise domestically lead expansion fall contractions. this illustrate extremely stylise way chart 2. you think appreciation, case, economy’s way temper effect relative demand and, time, encourage resource move they’re needed. if domestic demand strengthens, result rise exchange rate reduce return tradable sector raise non-traded sector, draw investment first second.3 this isn’t theory. we know, example, fiscal expansion tend associate appreciate exchange rate4. more generally real exchange rate tend pro-cyclical. chart 3 plot relationship uk, line – sterling’s real exchange rate domestic demand growth – plot 1 i’m interest real force drive exchange rate. the nominal rate, e = εp*/p, p* p price level home abroad respectively, also depend relative inflation rates. and short run, price sticky, monetary event affect real exchange rates. but time, real exchange rate depend non-monetary things. and particular instance, sterling’s fall essentially nothing difference monetary policy (as measured, instance, shift relative short-term interest rates). note that, judge behaviour forward inflation rates, financial market consider real phenomenon: five year ahead, expect value ep/p* around 16% low start 2016. 2 this ratio divide ratio trade partners. obviously every domestic shock describe here, exchange rate affect symmetrically, opposite direction phenomenon rest world. 3 the ease happen determine slope supply curve chart 2 4. in limit, resource move seamlessly costlessly sectors, supply curve flat. but reallocation could take long time. empirically, cyclical horizons, correlation exchange rate demand disturbance clear. 4 arguably, recent appreciation u dollar owe something expectation incoming administration loosen fiscal policy. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 5 5 four-year move averages. the graph also illustrate quite weak currency moment (the green dot right-hand side) give recent robustness domestic demand growth (the blue dot). among thing framework important implication link exchange rate “imbalances”. the uk periodically experience episode exchange rate strong, external balance deteriorate and, production side economy, trade sector get “crowded out”. one often hear “consequence” “over-valued exchange rate”, arbitrary, unexplainable thing. chart 2: strong domestic demand tend push exchange rate chart 3: uk data bear source: ons thomson reuters datastream but situation exchange rate symptom cause: underlie driver relatively strong growth domestic demand5. and it’s jointly push value currency trade deficit6. indeed i think help explain explain sterling appreciate strongly 2012 (and last year): relative respective incomes, domestic demand grow much strongly uk among main trade partner continental europe. there’s limit duration financial deficits, aggregate well individual level. it always unlikely uk could finance 5%-of-gdp current account deficit indefinitely market would presumably anticipate closure point, partly via weak growth domestic demand. but one possibility, regard sterling’s recent behaviour, foreign exchange market belief leave eu hasten correction imbalances. if, long lasts, finance deficit 5 the word “relatively” important – matter behaviour domestic demand compare countries. if demand weaken country home country’s exchange rate still appreciate even nothing happen domestic save rates. [more global imbalances] 6 for thorough treatment relationship imbalance exchange rate – specifically chain causation run former latter – see obstfeld rogoff (2000), obstfeld rogoff (2007). all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 6 6 rely “the kindness strangers” (as governor describe it) perhaps foreign exchange market think strange le generous uk outside eu. international capital market might require high premium sterling finance. if so, would slow growth domestic demand much earlier, accelerate rebalancing economy depress fair value exchange rate7. while possible principle, i’m convince main explanation sterling’s reaction referendum result. the currency remain weak even face robust consumption growth since date. and foreign exchange market anticipate high cost finance sterling borrower brexit you’d probably see expectation financial market – steep yield curve, perhaps, high premia uk banks’ fund markets. that hasn’t really happened. chart 4: weak productivity tradable sector depress exchange rate chart 5: support cross-country evidence source: penn world table a likely channel, mind, involve expect supply. go back relationship [1] imagine something happen push cost produce sell tradable goods. perhaps productivity sector grow le rapidly (relative trade partners)8. or perhaps tariff and/or non-tariff barrier impose international trade. either way, relative cost produce sell tradable output go must relative price (chart 49). in effect, currency fall help absorb costs. in spread throughout economy: even non-traded sector work long buy quantum imports. 7 sometimes point express term “sustainable” current account deficit amount thing. 8 cost inversely relate productivity. 9 note contraction tradable productivity, denominator snt/st curve, shift right. pnt /pt ynt /yt dnt /dt snt /st all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 7 7 there ample empirical evidence channel data. chart 5, example, cross-country plot relative price level (the real exchange rate) per-capita income. the latter determine whole-economy productivity. but much variation aggregate productivity, across country well time, tradable sector specifically. so correlation reasonably persuasive evidence link tradables productivity exchange rates10. and it’s quite possible lie behind sterling’s reaction referendum. foreign exchange market may believe exit eu way raise cost export – either directly, via erection barrier one sort another, depress inward investment productivity tradable sector (relative countries). what weak currency meantime? some exchange-rate economics i emphasise point i’m muse implicit belief foreign exchange market. the specific question market think long-term consequence leave eu warrant low sterling exchange rate. for part mpc particular expectation forthcoming negotiations. the currency market could turn pessimistic. two thing clear, however. first, market misjudge risk – uk emerge open economy today, – one imago exchange rate re-appreciate, else equal. i’ll come back significance point late on. second, weak exchange rate act economy whose trade relationship time quite unchanged. a yet brexit do nothing directly affect uk’s openness brexit hasn’t happened. the mpc always keen caution treat change asset price independent, “exogenous” event, without consider underlie cause. this case bite special, however: instance cause yet occur. we’ve reaction asset price well ahead event. in sense it’s independent usual. and what’s strike economist usually view independent depreciation exchange rate expansionary rather contractionary. yes, dent real household income therefore consumer spending. but usual view negative effect compensated, indeed outweighed, positive effect area spending, net export investment. with additional tailwind strengthen world economy might expect forecaster predict fast economic growth follow sterling’s decline. yet opposite true: 2% 2016 (in year q4), consensus forecast uk gdp growth slow 1.2% year. 10 in economics impact exchange rate variation tradable versus non-tradable productivity know “balassa-samuelson” effect (samuelson (1964); survey evidence see egert et al (2006)). all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 8 8 i want ask is. why forecaster think negative effect sterling’s fall predominate – impediment might positive effects? to it’s worth take close look depreciation actually work. the view one often hear make uk output cheap foreign currency terms, encourage extra demand overseas. i’m sure that’s quite right. i say early economist often make approximation price tradable good service country (measured common currency). this make intuitive sense think area like commodities. for example, would expect sterling’s fall reduce dollar price north sea oil euro price uk-produced wheat. those determine largely global markets. what happen instead price go sterling terms. and response net export volume come largely rise price directly boost profitability uk-based production. whether we’re talk firm export compete imports, encourage business expand. in word it’s matter supply demand. chart 6 give stylise description. in competitive market demand curve face individual firm (and relatively small country) essentially flat. domestic event don’t much effect global price. when currency falls, push price profit outward-facing firms, response export volume depend slope supply curve: extent firm tradable sector capacity raise output and, insufficient, willingness invest more? chart 6: for small open economy tradable demand highly elastic chart 7: depreciation push sterling price good export well import source: ons thomson reuters datastream. * exclude oil erratics. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 9 9 now commodity may extreme case. they’re essentially homogenous – one country’s output much like another’s. but even non-commodity good market find similar pattern. the uk relatively small, account 3% international good trade (even include oil). many uk firm significant extent “price takers” international markets. and see chart 7 close correlation sterling price uk’s (non-oil) good export exchange rate. the reaction bite le one-for-one general le mark import prices. that’s true recent period well: price non-oil good export rise 12% course last year, line imports. admittedly, behaviour sterling price service export rather different. they’re stable face exchange-rate movement (chart 8), imply depreciation indeed reduce foreign currency terms. i think understandable. service le homogenous good there’s room non-price competition. the uk large presence area, account 7% global service trade total, 12% business financial service specifically. those wholesale service relatively specialised. chart 8: sterling price service export stable equally, many reasons, evidence suggest service export volume much le sensitive cross-country variation price good markets. indeed it’s relative insensitivity variation persist length time. at rate, main point positive effect currency depreciation depend least much response domestic firm foreign buyers. if firm tradable sector plenty spare capacity you’d expect net export volume rise significantly; capacity constraint start bind you’d expect great investment; general, give degree spare capacity bind vary across firms, you’d expect see both. source: ons thomson reuters datastream i think see past – directions. the data limited. detail sectoral number profit investment exist early 1990s 2014. but period least cover two significant move currency, even financial crisis: big drop sterling fell european exchange rate system (erm) 1992, exchange rate remain relatively low years; equally large re-appreciation 1997 1998. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 10 10 a happens, i think swing trace back demand-side influence i discuss last section. subdue domestic consumption, public well private, supressed exchange rate year sterling exit erm; much strong growth, associate part revival house market, help push back late decade (you see broad movement back chart 3). and define “tradable” part economy sector above-average trade shares, “non-tradables” rest, behave broadly might expect. aggregate profit recover strongly early 1990s, tend early stage economic recoveries. but, thank jump sterling price output, rise mark firm expose international trade (chart 9). there plenty slack economy (chart 10 us balance capacity use bcc surveys). within tradable sector particular allow mark rise net export volumes. in three year erm exit uk’s trade balance improve close 2% gdp. furthermore, despite spare capacity, business investment begin accelerate – tradable sector whose spend grow fast (chart 11). chart 9: profit tradable sector boost depreciation early 90s, hit late appreciation chart 10: unlike early 1990s, limit spare capacity, include tradable sector source: ons bank england calculation source: bcc bank england calculation all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 11 11 chart 11: investment tradable sector also sensitive exchange rate chart 12: business investment growth weak 2016 source: ons bank england calculation source: ons, cbi, bcc cips these trend go reverse sterling’s re-appreciation late decade. if subdue domestic consumption allow economy “rebalance” 1992-97 period, opposite occur follow years. strong domestic demand growth “crowded out” tradable sector help push sterling’s exchange rate. this lead fall prices, profit investment tradable sector. what today? sadly don’t detail information anything like real-time basis. indeed little data kind, even aggregate level, tell u profit investment behave since last summer. but here’s take know:  first, it’s likely profitability improve significantly tradable sector economy. we know non-financial corporate profit aggregate rise 10% year q3. we know export price rise strongly last year, much fast domestic-facing firms11. at rough guess, relative non-traded sector, push rate return trade sector 2-3 percentage points12.  second – sharp contrast early 1990s – limit spare capacity economy, include tradable sector (chart 10 again). one would certainly expect net export volume improve year. but one would also expect great share response depreciation, compare early 1990s, come via strong investment, le 11 while export price rise 12% year 2016q4, gross output price across economy whole, exclude government sector, rise around 4½% (by gross i mean include cost imports). with export worth around one quarter gross output, would imply output-price inflation rest economy le 2%. 12 high price boost profits, disproportionately so, give operational gearing. on hand export firm also pay imports, rely others. to work overall impact profit need net extra cost imports. we’ve do pass rise export import price uk’s input:output table use definition tradables non-tradables before. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 12 12 high output tradable sector. there le room raise output incentive add capacity.  third, despite incentives, growth overall business investment uk relatively weak last year. early official estimate say shrink slightly year q4, around 1%. (this compare positive growth 2% euro area.) and although estimate particularly prone revision, various survey indicator also subside 2016 (chart 12). this last point critical one. the world economy look good do time. against backdrop, give exist capacity constraints, fall sterling provide powerful incentive invest uk’s tradable sector. all else equal, would make sense exist exporter expand; domestic-facing firm think enter new markets; multinationals shift production uk. yet caution would also understandable. all else equal. while much stake, no-one sure eventual outcome brexit negotiations. the evidence suggest investment le responsive commercial incentive great degree uncertainty future returns13. nor matter uncertainty: it’s unlikely propitious condition last forever. either currency market right consequence brexit, case uk’s trade relationship become le favourable; it’s wrong, case sterling likely recover. yet even normal times, currency move generally endure quite multinationals decide shift production one location another14. so straightforward decisions. put simply, firm tradable sector, think enter it, weigh boost current rate return additional risk premium currently require investments. the question whether first big enough compensate second. summary conclusion the adjective “post-brexit” bandy around quite bite days. the term’s bite previous. a good description uk’s current economic circumstance “post-referendum” “pre-brexit”. the result something sweet spot exporters. sterling fell sharply referendum and, despite strength consumption since then, remain close record lows. the likely explanation foreign exchange market belief that, actually occur, leave eu raise cost 13 bloom et al (2007); impact uncertainty sunk-cost investment decision see dixit pindyck (1994); handly limao (2013) consider specific case uncertainty tariffs. 14 for example goldberg (2007). all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 13 13 uk’s tradable sector. whether occur explicit tariffs, non-tariff barrier low productivity growth, currency would need weak compensation. but uk’s trade rule time unchanged. the result cost ease export unchanged return significantly higher. with world economy look good time circumstance tradable sector could hardly propitious. one would expect firm open part economy use spare capacity and, normal course events, invest significantly capacity well. over long run, reallocation resource positive impact exchange-rate depreciation rely upon. it’s possible, course, brexit won’t bad foreign exchange market appear believe. if government succeed negotiate “new, comprehensive, bold ambitious free trade agreement15” eu, open trade non-european countries, uk’s overall degree openness may worsen could improve. if so, else equal, currency time rebound. but make longer-term investment tradable sector somewhat tricky decision. either currency market pessimistic, case sterling’s depreciation likely reverse time. or it’s not, case cost export eventually go up. bar source exchange rate weakness, sharp rise household save rate (which would implication economy), sweet spot unlikely last indefinitely. so investment shorter-term payoff make commercial sense, especially already run capacity constraints, uncertainty involve longer-term decision could temper usually positive response business spend depreciation exchange rate. indeed they’re probably already somewhat. in late forecast mpc expect caution persist. that’s why, central projection february inflation report, growth slow slightly year, 2.0% end last year 1.7% 2017q4. though plenty variable consider, negative effect depreciation consumption (via import price household income) expect marginally outweigh positive effect part demand. if implicitly consensus forecast seem attach weight brexit-related caution. my guess financial market well. despite high profitability, business investment project stagnate fall year even accelerate significantly develop economies. the negative effect consumption clearly predominate growth aggregate demand project slow reasonably sharply, 1.2% end year. 15 this prime minister’s phrase speech 17 january. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 14 14 yet clearly risk both. if business share view financial markets, particular foreign exchange market, risk around eu exit could persuade cut investment year. if side consumer – who, we’ve note before, appear take uncertainty much stride – respond today’s favourable condition caution longer-term future instead

the importance financial condition theconduct monetary policyremarks mr william c dudley, president chief executive officer federal reservebank new york, university south florida sarasota-manatee, sarasota, florida, 30march 2017.* * *it pleasure today. i would like thank university south florida forsponsoring conference. a always, i say today reflect view notnecessarily federal open market committee (fomc) federal reservesystem. one aspect today’s event dedication financial laboratory help student learn aboutfinancial markets, i think great value. knowledge financial market operate isan important aspect financial economic literacy, lead great financial securityover time. for example, one important lesson promise return aninvestment offer extraordinarily high, investment either risky orfraudulent. when investing, important remember seem good true,it likely is!today, i want take opportunity talk importance financial market ininfluencing economic outlook and, turn, u.s. monetary policy. this subject near anddear heart. nearly 20 year ago—when i work private sector—mycolleagues i introduce index financial conditions. i believe long-standingfocus financial condition has, time, help become good economic forecaster. and, i please economist analyst increasingly incorporate financial condition intotheir assessment economic outlook.as i argue, financial condition unite state play important role influencingeconomic conditions. because movement financial market major factor influencingbroader financial conditions, necessary understand financial market developmentscan affect economic outlook and, therefore, appropriate set monetary policy. but,this story get complicated, set monetary policy, turn, affect marketdevelopments financial conditions. this two-way feedback important feature theinteraction financial condition monetary policy.to begin, let clear mean “financial conditions.” focus unitedstates, financial condition broadly summarize five key measures: short- long-term treasury rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange value dollar, equity prices. although many measure price also include one’s assessment, i thinkthese five essential.in conduct monetary policy, fomc target either specificcomponents financial condition financial condition broadly. we care aboutfinancial condition themselves, instead affect economic activity andultimately ability achieve statutory objective federal reserve—maximumemployment price stability. let provide examples. a decline mortgage ratescan lift demand owner-occupied house support construction activity. a rise equityprices boost household wealth, one factor underpin consumer spending. theforeign exchange value dollar affect relative competitiveness importer andexporters, which, turn, influence country’s trade performance. narrow credit spreadscan reduce cost capital business help support great business investment.123 1 / 6bis central bankers' speech in sum, financial condition affect households’ firms’ save investment plans, and,therefore, play key role influence economic activity economic outlook. this whythe evaluation financial condition crucial conduct monetary policy.the fomc traditionally implement monetary policy adjust federal fund rate—theshort-term interest rate pay bank borrow reserve financial institutions. however, economic decision directly depend federal fund rate. rather, change inthe federal fund rate affect economy impact interest rates, which,consequently, influence broad financial conditions. if financial condition move predictablywith policy rate, would need fomc focus financial conditions. in world, adjust level federal fund rate, fomc could fully confidentthat could generate appropriate financial condition necessary support achievement offull employment price stability.in fact, response financial condition change short-term interest rate rigid andpredictable. instead, shall see shortly, linkage federal fund rate andfinancial condition change time, influence whole host factors. recent evidence suggest even relation short-term long-term rate hasshifted substantially past 15 years. moreover, times, observe case inwhich financial condition move direction monetary policy stance. letme highlight two recent divergence indicate need keep separate eye theevolution financial conditions. the first occur mid-2000s. in june 2004, fomc decide begin raise federalfunds rate target order remove policy accommodation. it raise target 25-basis-pointincrements 17 consecutive meetings, push rate start point 1.0 percentto peak 5.25 percent. despite tighten monetary policy two years, financialconditions fail tighten similar manner. this see look behavior ofwell-known measure financial condition period (exhibit 1). the rise short-termrates offset decline long-term yields, rise equity price narrow creditspreads. in contrast, time financial condition tighten even fomcreduced short-term interest rates. for example, consider happen heart thefinancial crisis. even fomc low federal fund rate fall 2008—eventuallyhitting effective low bind december—credit spread widen sharply, household andbusiness loan underwrite standard tighten sharply, liquidity many financial market driedup, u.s. stock market plummeted. financial condition tighten despite aggressiveeasing monetary policy period.there many explanation relationship federal fund rate financialconditions variable. without exhaustive, let highlight three. first, animal spirit infinancial market wax wane, push asset value manner morethan offset effect movement short-term interest rates. the movement manyfinancial market follow last year’s presidential election notable example thisphenomenon. second, domestic financial condition influence happen abroad. ifthe monetary policy major u.s. trade partner become easy relative policy unitedstates, could lead dollar appreciation would weigh u.s. trade performance, allelse equal. third, financial instability stress cause risk-averse investor increasetheir demand safe assets. this push risk premia credit spreads, push downstock prices—which offset impact easy monetary policy. divergence short-term interest rate financial condition often appear largerand persistent unite state advance economies. there areseveral reason this. first, u.s. financial system depend le bank system to4 2 / 6bis central bankers' speech intermediate financial flow countries. the share credit supply bankingsector fluctuate around 50 percent unite states, much low euroarea, japan unite kingdom (exhibit 2). second, contrast countries,u.s. residential house finance mainly 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, rather than—as isthe case countries—adjustable-rate mortgage rate much closelytrack central banks’ short-term interest rate targets. third, equity market play muchmore important role unite state elsewhere. the total market capitalization theu.s. equity market considerably high euro area japan (exhibit 3).because evolution financial condition diverge path federal fund rate,financial condition need carefully consider conduct monetary policy. however, iwant reiterate care financial condition themselves, rather theirinfluence economic activity. accordingly, care much longer-termmovements financial condition higher-frequency, transitory movements. that isbecause behavior firm household influence much financialconditions evolve time, rather happen particular moment.to emphasize point, let give two contrast examples—one financial conditionsmoved sharply persistently, another financial condition move systematicallyover long time period. we see long-lived movement largestinfluence economic outlook. for first example, consider u.s. equity market 1987. the s&p 500 index begin theyear 242, shoot peak 337 august (an increase almost 40 percent) andplummeted trough 225 october (a fall 33 percent). when stock market fell morethan 20 percent october 19th—which come know “black monday”—many fearedthat decline would lead recession. after all, crash largest-ever one-daypercentage decline u.s. stock market. but, recession occurred. importantly,households sustain spend despite sharp decline household wealth. thishappened, part, household spend yet respond much sharp run-upin stock price early year, consumer spend turn relatively insensitive tothe market’s sharp reversal. in addition, damage sharp stock market decline wasmitigated federal reserve’s commitment “to serve source liquidity support theeconomic financial system.”a contrast example sharp appreciation dollar begin 1978 reach apeak march 1985. the persistent strength dollar significant negative consequencefor u.s. trade performance. our trade deficit widen sharply 1985 1986, whichcontributed sharp slowdown u.s. manufacture production growth—and milderslowdown gdp growth—over period. this lead important question: when fomc take change financialconditions consideration conduct monetary policy? i don’t think simpleanswer. financial condition matter influence economic outlook, many otherfactors. it true monitor financial condition help improve effectiveness thepolicy decision-making process. however, i hope clear previous examples, thereis mechanical link policy rate financial condition monetary policymakerscan systematically rely upon set policy.another key question one focus assess financial conditions. again, idon’t think simple answer, significance particular aspect change infinancial condition depend economic circumstance environment. in early- tomid-2000s, combination loose mortgage underwrite practice home equitywithdrawal major financial factor contribute economic expansion. thesubsequent house crash exacerbate sharp reversal mortgage lending5 3 / 6bis central bankers' speech standard home equity withdrawal, together contribute severity greatrecession. today, factor seem le important lend practice housingmarket much stable recent years.the importance complexity financial condition also underscore need caution infollowing mechanical monetary policy rule. for example, well-known rule—thetaylor rule—does explicitly take financial condition account term monetarypolicy prescription. in rule, federal fund rate depend deviation outputfrom potential inflation federal reserve’s 2 percent objective, level ofthe real short-term interest rate consistent neutral stance monetary policy. because theinteractions shift financial condition economic outlook—as well asbetween financial condition federal fund rate—the absence financial condition inthis rule cause perform poorly guide monetary policy.as case point, consider 1999 variant taylor rule indicate appropriatemonetary policy set september 2008, prior failure lehman brothers. in thebluebook document federal reserve board staff prepare september 2008fomc meeting, 1999 taylor rule call federal fund rate set 3.5 percent thefourth quarter 2008, well 2 percent set time meeting. the standard1993 taylor rule—which put great weight inflation—called even high federalfunds rate target 4.1 percent. give rapid deterioration financial conditions, instead offollowing prescription rules, fomc cut federal fund rate rapidly thenext three months, push federal fund rate range 0 quarter 1 percentby year-end.consistent episode, rule often perform poorly time economicenvironment outlook rapidly changing. this one important reason i supportproposals would require federal reserve explain congress whenever federalfunds rate target deviate particular prescriptive monetary policy rule. a federalreserve chair yellen explain recent speech, plethora rule tochoose from, follow monetary policy rule perfunctory manner would likely lead toinappropriate monetary policy times—especially economic turn point theoutlook change rapidly. also, require federal reserve chair explain frequently fomc deviate froma particular rule would unduly impinge ability fomc conduct monetary policy amanner insulate short-term political considerations. of course, congress right tohear federal reserve conduct u.s. monetary policy. there alreadyseveral opportunities, include regular testimony semiannual monetary policy reports. ifcongress desires, communication could become frequent enhanced. but, mypoint exchange trigger deviation mechanical rule. and,of course, i feel especially true rule account financialconditions. now i expound upon importance financial conditions, i would like discusstheir implication current stance u.s. monetary policy. a i see it, numberof factor behind fomc’s decision march take another step gradually removingaccommodation raise federal fund rate target 25 basis point range threequarters percent 1 percent. most importantly, economy continue grow modestly sustainable long-termpace. this lead continued, sturdy monthly job gain gradual diminution amountof slack u.s. labor market. forward-looking indicator foreshadow continuation thistrend. for example, household business confidence increase markedly pastfew months. 6 4 / 6bis central bankers' speech the economic outlook abroad also appear brightened. growth pick europe.commodity price risen, reduce pressure emerge market economy aremajor commodity exporters. there still significant uncertainty risk abroad, overall,these risk seem significantly low year ago. inflation move close 2 percent longer-run objective. headline inflation year-over-year basis move past month sharp decline energy price inlate 2015 early 2016 fall calculation. core inflation—which ignore themore volatile movement energy food prices—also move slightly higher. over the12 month january 2017, core personal consumption expenditure deflator risenat 1.75 percent, 1.6 percent year earlier. thus, i become confidentthat inflation stabilize around fomc’s objective medium term. while still considerable uncertainty fiscal policy potential contribution toeconomic activity, seem likely shift time stimulative setting. consequently, appear risk economic growth inflation mediumto long term may shift gradually upside. even late increase, federal fund rate target range three quarter percent to1 percent still unusually low nominal inflation-adjusted terms. while fomcparticipants judge equilibrium short-term real interest rate consistent neutralmonetary policy low—perhaps range 0 1 percent—this still currentinflation-adjusted federal fund rate. in circumstances, seem appropriate scale backmonetary policy accommodation gradually order reduce risk economyoverheating, avoid significant inflation overshoot medium term. finally, prior march fomc meeting, financial condition generally ease rather thanbecoming tighter, even fomc raise policy rate december market participantsincreasingly expect policy tighten come year. between december andmarch fomc meetings, u.s. equity price rise 4 percent, credit spreads, asthose high-yield bonds, narrowed. long-term yield trade-weighted dollar littlechanged period.william mcchesney martin, ninth chair fomc, famously opine federalreserve “in position chaperone order punch bowl remove whenthe party really warm up.” i don’t think remove punch bowl, yet. we’re justadding bite fruit juice. before i conclude, let make comment federal reserve’s balance sheet. asyou undoubtedly aware, federal reserve dramatically expand size balancesheet follow financial crisis provide accommodation support economywhen short-term interest rate constrain effective low bound. currently, weare reinvesting mature treasury security agency mortgage-backed securitiesrepayments keep size balance sheet generally stable. we say plan tocontinue policy reinvestment well along process normalize levelof federal fund rate. a fomc raise federal fund rate three times, thisprocess seem proceed smoothly far, prompt renew interest balancesheet reinvestment policy.the anticipation actual announcement fomc change reinvestment policy islikely push longer-term interest rate tighten financial condition somewhat, theearlier purchase push long-term interest rates. to extent difficult judge. presumably, financial condition would tighten end reinvestments earlierand abruptly. this suggest good course may taper reinvestments gradually andpredictably. 5 / 6bis central bankers' speech in addition, change reinvestment policy likely tighten financial conditions, willhave take account interest rate decisions. my view reduce federalreserve’s balance sheet raise short-term interest rate two different, yet related, waysof remove monetary policy accommodation. therefore, i would expect that, begin toend reinvestment, consider implication appropriate short-term interestrate trajectory.in conclusion, financial condition important. they matter enormously monetary policybecause movement often diverge trajectory short-term rates, becausethey affect economic activity economic outlook. while essential account forfinancial condition appropriately conduct monetary policy, also important tooverreact every short-term wiggle financial markets. in addition, important rememberthat policy goal level financial condition per se, achievement thefederal reserve’s dual mandate objectives. sometimes, consistent easingfinancial conditions, times, consistent tight financial conditions. at alltimes, focus achieve objective maximum sustainable employment andprice stability, thereby support

well-known bank, disappoint harvest, mere rumors. in response, depositor investor would seek return funds, would force financial institution sell asset quickly generate necessary cash (figure 6). that liquidation could lead bank cut credit force borrower repay debt sooner expected. simply put, monetary system meet country’s needs. it system crisis, boil repeatedly, harm country. central bank design part help financial system meet occasional liquidity strains. when demand liquidity rise, central bank respond increase supply money thus add liquidity system. central bank particularly important role

importance, i glad work alongside strive achieve it. benoît cœuré: set standard granular dataopening remark mr benoît cœuré, member executive board european centralbank, third ofr-ecb-bank england workshop “setting global standard forgranular data: share challenge”, frankfurt main, 28 march 2017.* * *it great pleasure welcome joint workshop “setting global standardsfor granular data”, organise u office financial research (ofr), bank ofengland ecb.the event subtitle “sharing challenge”. this mere rhetoric.it rather reflect strong belief data standardisation require well-coordinated effort byauthorities – key end-users data – industry. only party work closelytogether sure effort channel right direction desire andactual outcome sync.in remark today, i first give short overview authority industry needhigh-quality granular data data base global standards. i focus myremarks area progress achieve discus challenge stillface. and i try sum lesson learn along way.why need (high-quality) data?let start obvious: data crucial policymakers.every day countless decision make base analysis data. some areimportant, le so.but truth without reliable data policymakers would “flying blind”.this challenge particularly early day euro area lack aggregatedstandardised data, tailor new currency union, make difficult policymakers drawthe correct lessons. the effort undertake past two decade fill gap aretruly tremendous.and although still pocket part economic financial landscape welack data, challenge clearly shifted: focus today manage high volume dataand produce high-quality granular data. in words, refine data have,expand micro-dimension need make reliable, timely easierto access.the need high-quality granular data particularly acute financial sector.authorities – include central bank – need high-quality financial data granular andaggregate level perform several functions, including: conduct monetary policy,assessing systemic risks, supervise banks, perform market surveillance enforce andconducting resolution activities.the private sector need high-quality data: regulatory report obligations, forexample, underpin risk management operational efficiency – ultimately – tosupport successful decision-making.and need high-quality data end borders. 1 / 5bis central bankers' speech the interconnectedness financial market establish obvious need improveour global ability collect, aggregate, disseminate share data. this prerequisite fordeveloping coherent view global financial system emerge vulnerability bedealt promptly effectively. good data essential global systemic risk assessmentand global financial stability.standards granular data therefore agree implement global level –the international dimension conference therefore coincidence. it rather reflectionof experience global standardisation result large efficiency gain user andproviders data.and it’s much efficiency. often external observer question appropriatenessof policy decision trust underlie data. global standard fostertrust across border remove one important source uncertainty.there thus share interest promote efficient production process datathrough use globally accept open standard apply relevant stakeholders.but set global standard course enough. coordinate consistent implementationof agree standard equally important determinant success – management anddissemination data.what progress make challenge face?now, currently stand term set implement standards?as well aware, number ongoing international initiative aim improvingthe information framework policy decision based.i would like focus two set initiatives, aim make financial transactionseasier track transparent: launch legal entity identifier (lei) theongoing reform improve transparency over-the counter (otc) derivative markets.leithe lei initiative, might know, date back november 2011, g20 leaderssupported establishment global legal entity identifier would uniquely identify party tofinancial transactions. the financial stability board (fsb) help coordinate work within theregulatory community governance framework global lei system. it therebycomplemented private sector effort develop technical solution, via internationalorganization standardization (iso).the fruit important initiative clearly visible: thank efficient public/privatecollaboration, lei live use. and also extended. about 470,000 lei hadbeen issue end-2016. and jurisdiction host large share derivativesactivity already require counterparties reportable derivative transaction leis.the benefit adopt lei financial stability clear. for example, use lei inregulatory report facilitate consistent identification report entity theircounterparties. lei also put regulator position effectively evaluate assesscounterparty exposure financial risks.leis also serve industry number important ways: instance, help bank tomanage risk, identify customers, counter money launder finance ofterrorism (aml/cft).indeed, july 2016 report correspondent banking, committee payment 2 / 5bis central bankers' speech market infrastructure (cpmi) recommend use lei bank involve incorrespondent bank additional information payment message ensureunambiguous identification party payment transaction help alleviate thecosts associate comply aml/cft regulations.as i mention earlier, lei framework still improved. this year, implementation theso-called relationship data important milestone.relationship data provide additional reference data direct ultimate parent(s) oflegal entities, give user consolidate information group level legalentity level. such information essential risk aggregation bank supervision andsecurities regulation.relationship data also important analysis interconnectedness within financialsystem. today, still extremely difficult time-consuming carry interconnectednessstudies cross-border context – remain legal impediment dataaccess, also data easily comparable absence commonly usedidentifiers relationship information counterparties.more therefore remain do transform lei rich tool policy analysis, e.g.by also include sector classification part information set characterise legalentity.and although improve richness lei important, arguably even important tosponsor widespread use lei across jurisdictions. in respect, eu settinga good example, represent around 60% lei issue far, severalregulations reference lei stipulate use. other jurisdiction make moreuse lei, possibly mandatory adoption new regulations.transparency otc derivative marketslet turn derivative market.g20 leader agree 2009 otc derivative contract report traderepositories part commitment reform otc derivative markets. the aim andremains improve transparency, mitigate systemic risk prevent market abuse.today, rule trade report (tr) place jurisdiction and, worldwide, than90% trade report trade repositories. trade report therefore increase thetransparency otc derivative market authority access tr data. and hasenhanced authorities’ ability identify monitor systemic risk.but despite progress, significant challenge remain authority able compileand fully use tr data regulatory supervisory mandates. these challenge includelegal barrier access data, lack data format harmonisation data quality issues.important effort way area increase use tr data.i would like spend word one challenges: data harmonisation.the cpmi international organization security commission (iosco) set agroup take charge develop global guidance harmonise key otc derivative dataelements. this move follow publication fsb’s aggregation feasibility study inseptember 2014, describe step take data report across trs canbe aggregate authority obtain comprehensive view otc derivative marketand activity.12 3 / 5bis central bankers' speech the report note critical aggregation option work standardisation andharmonisation important data element completed, particular adoption thelei worldwide establishment unique transaction identifier (uti) unique productidentifier (upi).the cpmi iosco recently publish technical guidance harmonisation theuti, plan upi within next couple months.the uti, uniquely identify transaction, essential avoid double-counting undunder-counting transaction aggregate data. the uti structure base leiof generate entity, thus ensure uniqueness issue uti allow aplurality generate entities.the upi – meanwhile – allow flexible aggregation different type derivative product bygrouping various reference data elements, important specific analysis.consistent global dimension i mention begin remarks, cpmi-iosco guidance refer international standards, particular iso, applicable, order toensure international standardisation process adapt standard needed. and thecpmi iosco also harmonise definition format wide range criticaldata element come months.of course, work highly relevant global otc derivative data aggregation effort, andfor achieve outcome initially expect tr reporting. yet, could also serve purposesadditional regulatory one by, example, simplify pre- post-trade processesperformed market participant financial market infrastructures.additionally, industry could easily leverage upi include granular information onproducts, need confirmation, risk management purposes. of course, globallyharmonised data great interest global market players, would onerule jurisdiction operate.the harmonisation approach follow cpmi iosco intend flexible andscalable accommodate evolution markets, new product traded,regulatory regime message standards. some jurisdiction eu haveintroduced data harmonisation context trade report – mifid ii example – tosupport pre- post-trade transparency. this reflect fact harmonise datamay use different regulatory context approach simplify datamanagement authority industry.consistent implementation standard priority. the fsb set aworking group charge governance uti upi, work close collaborationwith cpmi iosco, implementation achieve swiftly consistently aspossible across jurisdictions. the fsb start publically consult governancearrangements global uti. in case upi, governance arrangement might involvesome public/private interaction collaboration, see lei.full implementation also require remove legal barriers. in 2015, fsb trade report peerreview highlight need fsb jurisdiction remove legal barrier report otcderivatives transaction trs legal framework place permit domesticand foreign authorities’ access data hold domestic tr 2018. authority announce lastyear plan remove barriers. progress area vital want theharmonisation effort bear fruit authority able compile make full use trdata regulatory and/or supervisory mandates.3 4 / 5bis central bankers' speech conclusionlet conclude.the benefit data harmonisation standardisation clear: help authority bettermonitor risk give private sector basis deep understand financialmarkets, sound decision-making, increase process efficiency industry participants.a lot done, lot remain done.for example, three year since start emir data reporting, user producerscontinue face challenges. these challenge include data quality aspect miss ormisreported values, double-reporting regime multiplicity trs well lack ofstandardisation harmonisation across trade repository counterparties. other issuesrelate report framework. for example, although derivative contracts, asswaptions, two maturity dates, single field maturity date.while work ongoing address specific issues, close, timely effective interactionbetween user drafter statistical regulation continue important.in view, public/private collaboration remain best approach data harmonisationbecause authority financial industry alike interest achieve efficiency andquality. the use international standards, exist introduced, likewise agood approach. this particularly case view achieve worldwide recognition andadoption.for example, private sector mechanism, iso prove effective, thank toits strong governance consultation process, involve jurisdictions. such mechanismcould one possible answer challenge maintain standardise data elements,provided authority strongly continuously involved.and, finally, still many implementation gap fill intend benefit dataharmonisation reform fully achieved. a i say earlier, appropriate governancearrangements key identifier need set up. commitment authority removelegal barrier report access data cross-border basis need bestrengthened. and effort set efficient mechanism share aggregate dataglobally need support time.this long journey.

depend primarily exploit natural resources.to accomplish this, need three things: foreign investment, immigration access toforeign markets. of course, open world also mean canada would affectedby global events, include policy countries, occasionally cause u toquestion commitment openness. but time, evidence lead clear conclusion:canada fare good open.today, i want illustrate look six episode history talk ourwillingness open trade, investment people ebb flow years. our economic storythe economic benefit international trade understand 200 years. buttrade go throughout history, include north

impose hightariffs exports. in contrast, strong tie britain, policy preferential 1 / 7bis central bankers' speech tariffs—very low tax levy imports—on good colonies.tariffs serve dual purpose 19th century. until first world war, government reliedon tariff revenue. but second purpose tariff protection ofdomestic business foreign competition. over years, tension develop thosewho seek high tariff provide protection import competition advocatedlower tariff open markets. in canada, tension often regional component, withconsumers outside protect industry resent pay high prices. this tension

market restrict high tariffs,canada need railway ever move good people long distances, east–west rather north–south.it exaggeration say without railways, would dominion. in theeast, construction intercolonial railway condition nova scotia newbrunswick join confederation first place. in west, amid american dream ofnorthern expansion, canadian government need railroad assert sovereignty theprairies. and entice colony british columbia join confederation promise atranscontinental railway. when completed, canada would railway run sea sea.the nation, economy, would work without them.however, build railway all-canadian route vast canadian shield would betremendously difficult expensive. to get done, canada turn foreigninvestment help fund construction. over first 20 years, canada routinely runningcurrent account deficit 7 10 per cent gross domestic product (gdp),financed foreign borrowing. this problem, course, borrow beingused increase economy’s capacity.to complete railroad, government turn group include donald smith—alsoknown lord strathcona—and cousin george stephen, president bank montrealand, happens, ancestor mine. (stephen mother’s family name.) just therewould dominion without railroad, also fair say would railroad withoutthe effort skill early entrepreneur financier help attract foreign capitaland channel

fulfills.the canadian pacific railway (cpr) complete 1885, open west flow ofgoods people. this link may necessary growth, would prove insufficienton own. the world grip victorian depression, generation-long economicslump follow financial crisis 1873. look back period, wonder thecpr complete difficult times. even though thousand immigrant continuedto arrive canada year, great number people leave canada unitedstates, economic condition seem better.in difficult circumstances, canadian government turn insular. weak revenue andconcerns future manufacture lead raise tariffs. by 1890, average

assert itself. the government launch whatbecame know imperial preference, allow tariff rebate good britishorigin. and time, canada point way toward openness negotiate low tariffsthrough “most-favoured-nation” agreement several countries. today, concept of“most-favoured-nation” heart global trade system. 3 / 7bis central bankers' speech so, tariff start trend downward globally, market

happen again. at 1944 international conference bretton woods,canadian economist future bank canada governor, louis rasminsky, lead thedrafting many document also credit break deadlock thebritish american delegations. canada would benefit greatly international pushtoward openness.a consensus emerge wisdom open trade system, three year brettonwoods saw general agreement tariff trade (gatt). over next 50 years,successive round gatt talk lead low low tariffs, roughly 22 per centaverage see war 4 per cent follow uruguay round 1990s, 4 / 7bis central bankers' speech reduce cost consumer everywhere.here canada, government co-operated u government invest almost half abillion dollar st. lawrence seaway, invest another billion dollar build thetrans-canada highway. to get idea figure would today, multiply byroughly 10. the pattern import capital resumed, bank industry, along thebank canada, facilitate development domestic financial markets. these market wouldprovide link global financial market help attract channel foreign capital.during 1950s 1960s, large number people immigrate canada, hascontinued case, less, today. simple arithmetic show importantimmigration canada. take away force international migration sinceconfederation, canada would around 10 million people, 36 million today.with right ingredient place, canada enjoy year sustained, strong economicgrowth post-war period. it surprise canada’s famouseconomists make mark time. i think nobel laureate robert mundell,whose work british economist marcus fleming lead great understand smallopen economy canada’s function, flexible exchange rate keyingredient success, especially economy reliant foreign capital flows. other canadianeconomists gain prominence around time include john kenneth galbraith, hisinternational work insight economic cycle financial bubbles, jacob viner andharry johnson, pioneer work international trade.with industrialization continue post-war period, canada’s economic tie theunited state strengthened. the 1965 auto pact create single, tightly link market forautomobiles part two countries. this give canadian producer theopportunity develop economy scale ability specialize production. over theagreement’s first 40 years, auto production canada roughly tripled, employment theindustry doubled.the next step strengthen tie canada–us free trade agreement (fta) in1988, expand five year late include mexico north american free tradeagreement (nafta). a case early attempt reciprocity, agreementswould come easily. many canadian resist continental free trade, fear job losses, thepossible loss health care system, general loss canadian economic evenpolitical sovereignty. none concern come pass, although heightenedcompetition result job loss sectors. but loss offset bygains areas, consumer continue benefit low price increasedpurchasing power tariff eliminated.beyond fta nafta, canada keep pursue opportunity openness.canada continue push reduce barrier world trade organization—which succeed gatt framework—and agreement individual countriesor trade blocs.lessons storyso say lesson story, apply today? now, iknow i greatly oversimplify matter take account host otherfactors canada’s development. but i find correlation economic progress andopenness striking. when trade barrier falling, people come shoresand investment rising, canadian prosper. we saw confederation, theearly 1900s second world war. the flip side respond tough economictimes turn inward rarely succeeds. we saw confederation greatdepression. the bottom line history openness economic progress go hand 5 / 7bis central bankers' speech hand.it intuitive country like canada would want open access foreign markets. indeed, givenour abundance natural resources, need export market pay import andthe investment require development. similarly, hard see beenbolstered grow population include immigrant bring skills, labour anddemand. canada unique this.it le intuitive see point direction. historically, alwaysbeen resistance within canada low tariff expose business foreigncompetition. but experience show fear openness misplaced.protectionism promote growth cost steep. first foremost, high tariffsand trade barrier make thing expensive people limit choices, whilelower tariff make thing cheap increase choice. specific company might benefit fromprotectionism, impose cost everyone else. conversely, gain free tradeare spread throughout economy.beyond this, exposure competition important driver innovation. throughcompetition, company expose new technologies, adapt theirown use. and high productivity lead sustain employment rise live standards. sothere compel reason canada continue push open markets, hereand abroad.similarly, compel reason keep border open immigration. last month,statistics canada issue report project le 30 years, canada rely entirelyon immigration keep population growing. along productivity, need continue labourforce growth keep economic potential expanding.there also compel reason ensure canada remain open foreign capital flows.because vast geography relatively small population, always majorinfrastructure needs. historically, domestic save base large enough tofinance infrastructure projects, need foreign capital.a final, relate point: quick romp history illustrate importance dreamersand visionaries, leader turn difficult odds win-win outcomes. in short, success isnot guaranteed, key ingredient must entrepreneurial capitalize upon:open markets, immigration foreign investment.conclusionallow conclude. canada’s development owe much people vision ittakes build great nation, willingness take risk achieve goal. our historyshows take world raise nation, nation build work best environment ofopenness trade, people investment. canada prosper look outward beingengaged, bilaterally multilaterally.it hard remember time global stress see recent years.the quest progress high productivity disrupt people’s lives. automation meantthat worker specific industry bear cost change difficult andconcentrated way, expect continue.but remember similar disruption before, turn inward hasnever answer. rather, commit openness always right choice. whatis crucial deploy benefit open assist need helpadjusting global forces. fail invite doubt put everyone’s progress risk. 6 / 7bis central bankers'

would like thank jam powell help prepare speech. 7 / 7bis central bankers' speech 1 iemed forum the mediterranean economy change world lesson learn economic financial instability: scenario envisage? the role central bank present. monetary policy exchange rate mediterranean country address dr mario vella governor central bank malta barcelona, 24 february 2017 dear governor linde, dear fellow governors, lady gentlemen, thank invitation participate forum monetary exchange rate policy mediterranean countries. the central bank malta mediterranean central bank, pursue monetary policy regime similar follow many mediterranean central bank today, well member eurosystem. since january 2008, malta adopt euro, central bank malta integral part eurosystem. this comprise european central bank national central bank eu member state adopt euro currency. for us, therefore, monetary exchange rate policy euro area whole. the primary objective monetary policy euro area price stability.1 the govern council define price stability average annual rate inflation below, close to, 2% medium term. this focus price stability base knowledge money neutral long run, mean affect nominal variables, price level exchange rate, real variables, income employment. it also reflect historical experience many countries, clearly show inflation ultimately monetary phenomenon. the existence single currency, euro, entail single exchange rate. this internal external implications. from internal perspective, single exchange rate mean euro shield member country exchange rate volatility them. indeed, desire eliminate volatility one main drive force behind creation euro itself. prior existence 1 see european central bank (2011) the monetary policy ecb. 2 euro, exchange rate arrangement europe subject risk destabilise currency crises. this instability see incompatible existence single market integrate european economy.2 from external perspective, like major currencies, euro freely float currency. the external value euro determine interaction demand supply foreign exchange market. of course, exchange rate remain important indicator govern council, far exchange rate movement affect development economic activity inflation. at time, monetary policy stance ecb, fully orient towards price stability objective, influence exchange rate. from theoretical viewpoint, one argue member country euro area choose go beyond fix exchange rate adopt single currency. the adoption euro imply irreversible abolition national currency and, hence, national exchange rate themselves. this choice involve trade-off. on one hand, single currency, seen, eliminate volatility exchange rate within monetary union. the euro, freely-floating currency, help protect economy member country external shocks. the single currency also facilitate trade them, deepen economic integration. however, elimination national currency imply market signal regard domestic economic imbalance lost, allow imbalance build up. more importantly, absence national currency also imply valuable tool stabilise economy short term face asymmetric shock long available. the sovereign debt crisis euro area bring home implications, positive negative, membership single currency area. it remain firm opinion, however, gain outweigh losses. it also firm opinion great effort need make reduce eventually eliminate internal imbalance within monetary union order protect sustainability. i would like turn briefly experience central bank malta deal policy issue almost 50 year existence. malta extremely small, open economy, highly dependent international trade prosperity. the bank’s monetary policy objective initially set promotion “the orderly balance development malta rise level employment income consistent maintenance monetary stability malta external value currency”. in practice, among multiple objectives, bank give priority maintain stability external value maltese lira (or pound initially known). an exchange rate peg see necessary support foreign trade inward investment abroad. moreover, give malta’s 2 for account euro area’s exchange rate policy first decade existence, see lorenzo bini smaghi, “the euro area’s exchange rate policy experience international monetary co-ordination crisis”. speech deliver 6 april 2009 brussels. 3 dependence import good satisfy domestic consumer demand, peg also see prerequisite safeguard domestic purchase power.3 throughout existence, therefore, bank’s monetary policy orientation always focus fix exchange rate nominal policy anchor. when bank found 1968, malta form part sterling area, reflect past british colony strong tie unite kingdom. when bretton wood system collapse 1972, maltese monetary authority decide break exclusive link pound sterling peg lira trade-weighted basket currencies. during 1980s composition basket revise several occasion until, 1989, number component currency reduce three, ecu - replace several european currency - pound sterling u dollar. in 2002, weight euro raise 70%, dollar pound set 20% 10%, respectively. follow malta’s accession european union, may 2004, authority resolve move swiftly adopt euro. a year later, maltese lira enter exchange rate mechanism mark ii (erm ii) unilateral commitment maltese authority maintain value unchanged central parity rate. this central parity rate become conversion rate maltese lira euro malta adopt single currency begin 2008. in effect, malta move currency union pound sterling membership euro area, period characterise basically fix exchange rate between. maintain exchange rate peg long time span hard, though change composition currency basket allow flexibility. throughout period, lira devalue once, 1992, wake turbulence see europe, saw pound sterling eject exchange rate mechanism (erm) devaluation italian lira among others. otherwise, bank’s determination maintain peg never wavered. we never blinked. the ability maintain peg may partly due restriction trade stringent control capital movements, least early decades. by mid-1990s, however, trade financial market liberalisation mean factor become le le important. instead, major reform 1994 bring full independence central bank gradual liberalisation interest rate amid increase recognition that, absence capital controls, monetary policy actively orient towards maintain peg. throughout, lira buttress healthy stock external reserves. the central bank malta legally bind maintain reserve equivalent least 60% monetary base, 3 for review malta’s monetary exchange rate policy years, see anton caruana galizia (1989) “malta’s exchange rate policy since breakdown bretton wood system” central bank malta quarterly review, june 1989 aaron g grech (2003) “the framework monetary policy malta”. mpra paper no 33464. 4 practice ratio normally exceed 100%. a capital control eased, interest rate policy increasingly set eye spread vis-à-vis interest rate offer basket currency (and, later, euro). more profoundly, maintain exchange rate peg require discipline domestic wage price set safeguard malta’s external competitiveness. despite element wage indexation, labour market fairly flexible, relatively low coverage collective bargain private sector wage negotiation handle level individual firm. broadly speaking, fiscal discipline also maintained. the government debt gdp ratio remain 60% late 1990s, peak around 72% 2004, 60% threshold again. this discipline help establish credibility exchange rate peg, become embed decision-making process across economy. for reason, bank never adopt policy option would entail great exchange rate flexibility, even become possible, instance erm ii. subsequently, internal discipline also serve good stead euro adoption, which, see before, entail loss exchange rate interest rate policy tool. despite several shock hit euro area since 2008, maltese economy perform well. malta take full advantage opportunity offer eu accession euro adoption diversify economic base, economy drive mainly export-oriented manufacture industry one characterise increase importance export-oriented services. it also engage structural reform increase competition key market encourage labour market participation. malta enjoy rapid growth, full employment moderate inflation. the late economic forecast european commission, winter 2017, show malta’s economy expect remain sustain positive trajectory. accord commission: “malta’s economic growth settle exceptional level 2014 2015 forecast remain well eu average. unemployment set remain record low productivity gain contain unit labour cost preserve competitiveness.” malta’s real gdp growth estimate remain robust. for 2017 2018, maltese economy estimate expand rate 3.7%. this place malta amongst top performer eu. during 2017, gdp euro area eu expect grow rate 1.6% 1.8% respectively. for 2018 growth euro area expect increase 1.8% whilst average growth eu remain previous year (1.8%). malta’s historical low unemployment rate envisage maintain come period. the ec forecast show 2017 2018, malta’s unemployment rate 4.9%, extremely low compare euro area eu. during 2017, expect unemployment euro area eu 9.6% 8.1% respectively. for 2018, 5 unemployment euro area expect go 9.1% whilst eu also decline 7.8%. malta’s general government deficit percentage gdp also expect continue positive trajectory embark previous years. it expect narrow 0.6% 2017 remain level 2018. this figure also compare favourably average deficit ratio project euro area19 (2017 2018: -1.4%) eu (2017:= -1.7% 2018= -1.6%). for first time many years, malta’s gross government debt gdp expect fall 60% threshold. in fact, 2017 debt ratio expect 58.0% decline even 2018 (55.6%). in view, main lesson learn half century experience flexible exchange rate policy may afford leeway short term, allow economy withstand economic shocks, substitute structural reform achieve great flexibility product labour markets. this especially case small open economies. in economy internal market far small firm enjoy sufficient economy scale enable competitive internationally. moreover, economy wield little market power global economy. ultimately, reality rigid labour product market unsound fiscal policy always catch up. exchange rate adjustment alone unable restore improve live standards. therefore, fix exchange rate policy provide incentive prudent fiscal behaviour well policy promote productivity competitiveness. these policy crucial avoid large current account deficits, depletion foreign exchange reserves, currency depreciation. depreciation increase inflation deter investment market-oriented reform product labour market policy remain absent fiscal discipline missing. diversification economy’s production base market target insulate economy shock effectively exchange rate flexibility. in conclusion, i hope i show central bank malta journey monetary exchange rate policy base currency peg – arrangement common many mediterranean central bank today – membership single currency area. i contend manage transition successfully. at time, cannot afford lose focus internal discipline external competitiveness serve u well last five decades. the former exchange rate peg policy, well current membership euro area, end themselves, mean ensure economic well-being citizens. peter praet: the economic situation euro area theimplications monetary

digitalisationintroductory address dr andreas dombret, member executive board deutschebundesbank, baden-baden entrepreneur talks, baden baden, 22 march 2017.* * *1. introductionladies gentlemenmr hollejohn cryani’m sure you’re curious today i am. we will, all, talk nothingless innovation financial industry – subject which, definition, cannot beboring. innovation basically boil introduction something new. but thereis it? edward de bono, think progress world transport, describe keyelement innovation follow words. "removing fault stage-coach mayproduce perfect stage-coach, unlikely produce first motor car."whenever talk innovation, it’s not, then, question perfect habitual mode ofthought action harness inspiration think laterally. i trust variedprogramme today serve stimulate latter.i would like kick today’s event pose three question greatly occupy merecently capacity bank supervisor.1. why innovation financial industry become hot topic now, times?2. what mean, exactly, talk innovation bank business?3. can bank even innovative? 2. innovation: now, times?let’s start first question: innovation financial industry – now, times? iwould like begin say question inappropriate one. after all, could saythat, give lesson learn financial crisis, interest urgebanks churn one innovation another. someone often quote regard ispaul volcker, say industry’s "single important" contribution last 25years automatic tell machines.let quite clear point. innovation smoke mirror arenot i come speak today. i talk innovation offer newsolutions, exactly bank sector need host question isfacing.at first glance, germany’s bank sector would appear fare quite well: country’sbanks save bank manage keep earn steady recently, haverigorously build capital buffers. yet outlook profitability gloomy, amultitude reason this. there two particular factor i would like single because1 1 / 5bis central bankers' speech shine harsh light need done.the first concern interest business: secret low-interest-rate environment issqueezing margin deteriorate outlook earnings. but say that, rise interestrates panacea either. contrary often assumed, bring relief initially,but exacerbate interest rate risk, particularly case germany. institution willneed provide this.the second reason profitability weak is, course – i won’t shy away –regulation. regulatory standard make far tight response financial crisis, settingthe bar high banks. that right move, important move – i think willagree stable financial system everyone’s interest. but also right say tighterregulation take toll many banks. these shift framework condition makingthemselves felt banks, course.time again, institution raise two point effort pin blame theirwoes monetary policy regulation. but "we’d good without you" mindset nohelp anyone. albert einstein even say "insanity thing andover expect different results". because there’s get around fact therules game bank changed. there little gain come allhelpless – everyone adapt new environment. actionable area include differentpricing models, cost reduction also consolidation.but innovation actionable area, too. and give huge splash make digitalisation inrecent years, field garner great deal attention. if nothing else, wave ofdigitalisation unleash strong sense optimism future – fintechs burst withfresh idea business models, customer keen adopt digital banking, and, least, thenecessary technical capability broadband internet, especially, certainly see tothat. the centuries-old bank business see emergence kind virgin territory – aplace where, sudden, lateral think count perfect mathematicalmodels isn’t necessarily one best strategy earn money more. innovation, then,is boom bank business moment, two reason that: first, thegloomy prospect many traditional business fields; second, challenge andopportunities present digitalisation. 3. what innovation (not) mean?what exactly innovation mean age digital bank? the digitalisation thefinancial sector would become hyped-up topic, existence ofthree visionary, time, ominous scenarios: i talk disruption, revolutionand infinite freedom digital banking.let talk scenario one one.the first scenario was, still is, disruption. disruption mean fear fintechs, andespecially tech giant well, might offer far innovative financial service far cheaply,which would quickly transform overpower rival traditional institutions.that entirely far-fetched scenario – take exchange trading, example, much ofwhich leave trade floor quite time ago. what instead find frankfurt atother exchange vast space fill high-performance computers. this example showsus come high frequency trading, machine make ever great inroad intothe service sector. decision preserve floor trader beingmade algorithms. the chief difference algorithm make mind millisecond 2 / 5bis central bankers' speech – is, around clock – communicate worldwide. their main cost factor theelectric bill.but far, disruption affect individual component bank business. a yet,not single technological innovation manage fully replicate economic function abank save bank. and even already instances, online payments,where well-established institution fell far behind pace development within relativelyshort space time, often case innovation beset know "curseof first mover". that is, first player come bright idea frequently foundersbecause idea market-ready. silicon valley’s tech giants, hand, often buyup ideas, make success. so time market everything.i don’t see widespread disruption happen today foreseeable future. right now, day-to-day relation fintechs bank germany best describe relationshipstatus "it’s complicated." we currently see almost every model conceivable thebusiness world, traditional fintech takeover white label bank idea bankas digital ecosystem. while fintechs start quite feisty towards establishedinstitutions, see diverse coexistence base competition, cooperation andexpanding service offering.the second scenario one i dub “revolution". that another scenario notmaterialised far. digitalisation, seemed, hold prospect create alternative totoday’s financial system would le error-prone closely align whatcustomers really want. that fintechs present counterpoint traditionalinstitutions, dress hoodies rather suit tie, claim “small, no-frillsoutfits” rather “too big fail". but sense new dawn break customer-centric culture alone really make huge difference? doe image fintechs ofthemselves really justify supervise le strictly?perceived difference never bear supervisory authorities, trueto day. it concrete evidence safety reliability counts. news glitch andfailures, combine isolate case fraud fintechs around world, go show thataccidents misconduct cannot eliminate technology fresh appearancealone.from prudential vantage point, then, little gain construct artificialdistinction innovative start-ups establish institution long run thesame business model. that also regulator supervisor eye abusiness’s actual business model. if you’re engage bank business, say – is, takein deposit grant loan – you’re go treat bank supervisors. you’ll need alicence expect satisfy supervisory standards. whether bank appear asmartphone screen well-established institution number branch neitherhere there. the reason apply business activity financial servicesinstitutions payment institutions. so fintech germany remain exempt fromsupervision, simply business model contain nothing which, today’sperspective, present risk need supervise us. the notion “same business,same risk, rules” therefore remain guide principle supervisors.let briefly touch upon third digitalisation scenario i mention earlier: desire forinfinite freedom financial services, too. a trendsetter year ago regard bitcoin– virtual currency, make entirely bite byte manage control anexternal authority. could underlie idea, use computer program make humaninteraction manipulation-proof trustworthy, work across entire financial community?i would initially like state i regard technical innovation – best-known areblockchain distribute ledger – highly sophisticated. if combine correctly, 3 / 5bis central bankers' speech make impossible anyone forge transaction, contract document, transactionscan settle matter seconds. in regard, blockchain attractive abusiness factor. it replace, part, onerous administrative procedure external controlmechanisms.but, initial excitement dissipated, one thing become clear: nothingdeveloping exist outside current financial system unregulated area. ofcourse, people can, will, use “blockchains". but, token, people financialsystem future also rely security afford legal system. financialquestions often existential, mean possible resolve every conflict aruling issue computer program. there thus doubt technology submitto law. for banks, mean permit use blockchain technology long asthis technology line legal framework bank’s management will takeresponsibility risk applications.ladies gentlemen, remark make one thing clear regard question of“what innovation digital bank industry?": extreme scenario digitalisation havelargely converge towards middle. these days, company concern aboutreinventing wheel instead many thing practically, quickly and, particular,more cost-effectively. the question long “bank fintech?” program interfacesand calculate costs. it long race become “most digital” bank save bankbut create innovative – therefore convince – overall package. 4. can bank innovative?let come third question i ask introductory remarks: "can bank beinnovative?" in recent times, credit institution exactly distinguish ashotbeds innovation – least relative fintechs. though bank have, meantime, initiatedtheir innovation – now, fintechs prove driver digitalisation.that said: individual idea talk about, bank’s overall package. and isle inspiration more, all, perspiration. innovation thus manageable. it isnot job, bank supervisor, dictate institution evolve. we are,and shall remain, neutral innovation: job merely ensure bank save banksare able shoulder risk specific business themselves. but supervisor are, ofcourse, monitor developments. in process, identify three aspect areimportant make innovation success.first: innovation presuppose openness new idea developments. a not-inconsiderableshare change date take place peoples’ heads. many senior bank executive first hadto learn take digitalisation new competitive situation seriously put themselvestime place customers. i’m say bank executive startlearning understand program language memorise network plans. however, theyshould generally able understand language digitalisation.second: innovation presuppose ability justice complexity. banks’ cyber defencesare good example. credit institution certainly particularly popular target attackbecause reward huge. give mount threats, institution state highalert.but high alert enough. for cyber defence mean trivial matter. inthe middle ages, relatively easy defend castles: build moat fortresses. and itwas mostly clear direction enemy – often enemy – would advance. thereality it different matter altogether: enemy unknown almost never come 4 / 5bis central bankers' speech open. in cases, professional hacker hide month end within company’sfortress walls. and even company detect system breach, mean aminute assailant drive system – requires, cases, top-of-the-line criminology techniques. it security must therefore akin immune systemthan fortress. and well imagine good antivirus scanner firewall arefar enough protect immune system sufficiently.for bank’s immune system healthy, suitable corporate structures. putsimply: governance good. our supervisor therefore order institution teardown responsibility “firewall", one will assume responsibility manyinterlinked aspect cyber risk. in addition, “human” factor take account aweak link it cyber risk.therefore, it security aspect directly factor new project aninstitution embarks. by way, go financial service start-ups. despite theirreputation state-of-the-art it knowledge, absence comprehensivesecurity management, easily fall prey danger internet.i still owe third point: innovation often matter individual institution. in thepatchwork quilt bank germany, “one-size-fits-all” solution: everyinstitution, large small, rural urban, special-purpose finance vehicle universal bank,has find go way. 5. conclusionladies gentlemen, briefly sum content remarks:can bank sit current situation use strategy successful past? i amconvinced answer is: no.what type innovation call here? in view, digitalisation reward thosewho “reinvent wheel” generally competent do.can bank innovative? yes; least, enough start point actionableareas. for possible “sit out” digitalisation. to put clearly, word ofgraham horton: "innovation compulsory, neither survival."thank attention.british physician, cognitive researcher author (born 1933).1 5 / 5bis central bankers' speech

current mood, still see opportunity step towardsintegration?yes, work deepen single market facilitate free trade. for example, ifthe eu harmonise performance vacuum cleaners, market rightacross europe, addition factor energy efficiency. but people see as“brussels” want impose diktat, almost kind “harassment”. harmonisation cutsthe cost products, would otherwise adjust separately nationalmarket. so talk deep eu, great harmonisation few barrier totrade, inevitably expense member states’ freedom decide. but inareas national even regional institution good suit establish right rules,then principle subsidiarity apply great extent. it’s integration asa value per se, integration that’s appropriate necessary. i think thenecessary consensus point.now euro area wriggle way crisis, thing improvingeconomically.things get good economic situation still vary lot. germany, hasweathered crisis well low level government debt household debt, avery good position. but country severely hit still serious challenges.the good news recovery firm country euro area andexpanding sectors. consumer business confidence rising, despite allthe political uncertainties. that’s encouraging. after year crisis progress madeand people trust it.is upturn result ecb’s low interest rate policy?in 2009 big recession post-war era, sharp increase inunemployment. since low four

sovereign debt crisis result cause thecountries fall recession 2011 2012. the ecb’s monetary policy itsintervention play decisive stabilise role. it avert depression.if intervention, would happened?to give example: ecb give spanish bank liquidity assistance 2012,when lot money withdrawn, capital control would result creditor fromother euro area country would find difficult gain access assets. people haveforgotten dangerous situation time. many unaware ecb andgovernments act carefully considered, reasonable way prevent worseoutcome. the european institution prepare crisis, whydecisions also quite chaotic outset. but end, also thank creation theeuropean stability mechanism (esm), collapse single market prevented. 2 / 4bis central bankers' speech and yet, ecb’s role remain controversial expansionary monetary policyheavily criticised.the ecb play lead role, least fact capable act atany time crisis. the decision never simple much discussionabout right course follow. but ecb always aware responsibility andmanaged craft monetary policy support member govern council. thispaid crisis. but success double-edged: ecb torepeatedly take new tasks, bank supervision. but also hold responsiblefor problem see especially influential european institution takeaction. this case even reality responsible.but face challenge find way expansionary monetarypolicy. this include increase interest rates, happen us. be thefed’s step signal ecb?we clear mandate relate euro area. and watch developmentsclosely take action. so far, say economic situation improving.that give u confidence, upward trend hence normalisation inflation stillvery dependent monetary policy stimulus. while inflation temporarily close desiredtarget, base large extent short-term fluctuation energy prices. the underlyinginflation trend still noticeably weak, monitor order fulfil mandate asustainable way.inflation germany 2%. shouldn’t take account low interestrate policy, serious cost german savers, bring end?we indeed aware criticism – way exist country – wetake seriously. of course, interest rate could high germany’s economy someother country well, alone. but aren’t – single currency.therefore, ecb commit conduct monetary policy euro area whole,and sometimes require everyone patient. a always, whommonetary policy loose, others would specifically like see support. but let’snot forget time monetary union, fluctuate exchange rates, whichbrought lot instability. that costly economy germany’s. today, byway monetary policy, contribute continue existence, stability andfunctioning single market. that’s really important member state majorexporters. and that’s even relevant time free trade call questioninternationally.but low interest rate policy create market distortions, see germany’shousing market. aren’t danger looming?the price increase see context. they precede unusually long periodof stagnate house price germany. this change last seven years. and thequestion arise whether overheating. that may case mostpopular cities, overall clear sign that. a dangerously speculative, destabilisingoverheating would, moreover, occur price rise increasingly andexcessively finance credit. one would see strongly grow home loans, whichis case. and get point, would first place task ofmonetary policy react, primary commitment price stability. but othermeans available national government supervisory authority curb overheating, shoulda worst-case scenario arise. for instance, tighten rule lend via fiscal policy.the uk’s exit eu lie ahead. could brexit endanger financial stability ofthe euro area? 3 / 4bis central bankers' speech no, i don’t think brexit pose risk financial stability. first, thoroughly controlledexit and, second, learn crisis handle dangerous situations. one mustalways concern stability abrupt event immediateimpact. but uk’s expect exit precisely case. we time toorganise break relate adjustment. and purely organisational perspective theadjustment bring regulator supervisory authority enormous amount ofwork. what concern massive cost withdrawal cause eu27 and,above all, uk.but could also winners. frankfurt could become eu’s large financialcentre. do agree?frankfurt friendly place, multinational, well-organised convenient. the city offer goodworking environment. i value that, private sector bankers. but doubt couldsay madrid, dublin, paris european cities. in view, matter issomething different: financial centre euro area hope play prominent role,then best chance context fully fledge europeanbanking union. and there’s point hop distant future. we need strongand complete bank union within next four five years.what’s need complete it?we need clear road map, show want four five years’ time. brexit isregrettable harmful, also opportunity bank union. have strong andreliable regulatory framework single supervisory body strict fair bigcompetitive advantage bank sector – create trust sustainable kind, thebankers’ important “currency”.how optimistic bank union complete nextfinancial crisis?banks much good capitalise crisis. furthermore, supervisoryauthorities also learn respond quickly avert risk financial market stability. abankruptcy like lehman brother 2008 much le likely nowadays. the bank protectthemselves well make good provisions.what mean bank withdraw european market andfocusing domestic market? that there’s european bank system all?i also concern that, monetary union need cross-border bankswhich subject common supervisory resolution rules. when common bankingsupervision, also need burden-sharing case something go wrong. we don’t atthe moment. we indeed common supervision, something start keel over, theindividual state still step in. we won’t bank union real risk share

grow prosper. but also badly hurt it; saw thefinancial crisis. that’s bank need cautious. in practical term requires, amongother things, sound risk management.and set scene short statement today. the topic risk management. i beginwith smaller, rather bank-specific, risk management topic end bigissues.sound risk management depend good data. it also depend firm-wide risk aggregationand reporting. those take decision must picture.but they? well, crisis learn decision-makers often not. it systems, dataarchitecture relate process mark.against backdrop, assess bank aggregate data report risks. the

different standard authorise them.in response, launch project call trim. that stand “targeted review internalmodels”. it aim ensure two things: first, play field level; second, internalmodels produce

attention. 2 / 2bis central bankers' speech "quantitative qualitative monetary ease yield curve control": after half year since it introduction speech reuters newsmaker event tokyo bank japan march 24, 2017 haruhiko kuroda governor bank japan 1 introduction i would like express sincere gratitude opportunity today explain bank's monetary policy. half year pass since bank introduce "quantitative qualitative monetary ease (qqe) yield curve control" september 2016. this new framework work smoothly. today, look back development global economy global financial market since 2015, i would like explain background think behind adoption new policy framework, follow introduction negative interest rate. then, i would like talk current situation outlook japan's economy, well bank's stance monetary policy go forward. i. the background adoption "qqe yield curve control" think behind it a. turbulence global financial market introduction negative interest rate turbulence global financial market let look back development global financial market since summer 2015. investors' risk sentiment start worsen background slowdown emerge economies, include china, uncertainty regard economies. in particular, turn 2016, global financial market rapidly become destabilize due heighten concern regard emerge economies, trigger significant decline shanghai stock price (chart 1). the decline commodity prices, include crude oil prices, exacerbate situation. under circumstances, pessimistic view outlook global economy prevailed, "secular stagnation" hypothesis. major economy face common policy challenge address low growth, well low inflation low interest rates, topic hotly debate international forum group twenty (g-20) finance minister central bank governor meeting. naturally, headwind global economy significant negative impact japan's economy well. in financial markets, yen appreciate stock price declined. on inflation front, year-on-year rate change consumer price index (cpi) 2 exclude fresh food turn negative 2016 first time three years, due effect decline crude oil price since summer 2014. inflation expectation -- play key role achieve price stability target 2 percent -- weakened, reflect headwind global economy i mention earlier, remain le flat amid significant decline crude oil price (chart 2). the introduction negative interest rate it effect it background bank introduce "qqe negative interest rate" january 2016 order address strong headwind achieve price stability target 2 percent. to reduce real interest rate amid weaken inflation expectations, nominal interest rate need low further. the negative interest rate aim additional reduction level short- long-term interest rate push short end yield curve, combination purchase japanese government bond (jgbs). the introduction negative interest rate produce significant effect term low nominal interest rates. specifically, jgb yield decline considerably across entire yield curve (chart 3). a consequence, lend rate well issuance rate cp corporate bond also decline clearly. the lend attitude financial institution become positive. there doubt negative interest rate make financial condition accommodative, support firms' households' economic activity japan headwind global economy. at time, however, become necessary take account impact negative interest rate function financial intermediation broad sense yield curve head toward flatten expected. specifically, banks' basic business model consist raise short-term fund invest long-term assets, little room decline interest rate deposits, main fund tools. this mean flatten yield curve low level reduce spread deposit lend rates, thereby squeeze banks' profits. if profit squeeze long period time, would affect financial soundness cumulatively exert adverse effect 3 function financial intermediation. in addition, excessive decline level interest rate long super-long maturity low rate return insurance pension product might negative impact economic activity lead deterioration people's sentiment. b. think behind "qqe yield curve control" base recognition, bank conduct september 2016 comprehensive assessment development economic activity price well policy effect since introduction qqe. in light find assessment, introduce "qqe yield curve control" mean enhance strengthen previous policy frameworks. the new framework consist two component (chart 4). the first inflation-overshooting commitment. specifically, commitment bank continue expand monetary base year-on-year rate increase observe cpi exceed 2 percent stay level stable manner. the key point commitment base observe cpi, outlook. the price stability target need achieve average business cycle. thus, naturally assume would phase observe cpi exceed 2 percent. consider take time monetary policy impact economic activity prices, exceptional central bank make strong commitment base observe cpi. since global financial crisis, federal reserve unite state central bank introduce "forward guidance," central bank provide information future course monetary policy. it common central bank design forward guidance base forecast. however, japan, observe cpi 2 percent long period, order raise inflation expectation around 2 percent anchor firmly level, essential public actually experience inflation 2 percent time thereby perception take hold among price good service tend go every year around 2 percent. with mind, bank commit continue large-scale monetary expansion situation achieve unique inflation-overshooting commitment. 4 the second component new policy framework yield curve control. under framework, bank set level short- long-term interest rate operate target guideline market operations, instead amount increase monetary base amount jgb purchase previous frameworks. it facilitate formation yield curve consider appropriate maintain momentum toward achieve price stability target 2 percent, take account development economic activity price well financial conditions. in current guideline market operations, bank set short-term policy interest rate minus 0.1 percent target level 10-year jgb yield around 0 percent. yield curve control design enable bank conduct monetary policy flexible manner, depend situation, compare previous framework amount jgb purchase fixed. for example, impact unit amount bank's jgb purchase long-term yield vary depend economic inflation condition well state jgb market. in previous framework set amount jgb purchase operate target, yield curve could deviate either upward downward one bank deem appropriate. in contrast, yield curve control -- set specific target level 10-year jgb yield -- enable bank conduct jgb purchase flexible effective manner achieve target, make policy framework sustainable. it often argue bank's jgb purchase approach limit. my response argument follows. first all, bank conduct jgb purchase smoothly far, i think face difficulty near future. even jgbs purchase bank become scarce point future supply-demand condition jgb market tighten, impact unit amount jgb purchase long-term yield accordingly become significant, else equal. put differently, bank degree effect low interest rate small amount jgb purchases. in financial markets, argue bank difficulty jgb purchase future lose control long-term interest rate eventually. that happen. in fact, yield curve control design highly sustainable. 5 ii. improvement global economy current situation outlook japan's economy a. current business condition outlook next, i would like talk development global economy since second half last year, well current situation outlook japan's economy price amid global economic developments. up around last autumn, financial market dominate pessimistic view regard outlook global economy. with benefit hindsight, appear global economy hit bottom first half last year. since middle last year, various economic indicator improved, salient feature improvement manufacture activity international trade become clear advance emerge economy (chart 5). the global economy since outbreak global financial crisis characterize label "slow trade," phenomenon trade volume remain sluggish relative economic growth rate, trend appear changing. in addition, follow presidential election unite states, business sentiment -- especially among u.s. firm -- greatly increased, reflect expectation growth rate accelerate basis proactive economic policy new administration. a result, growth momentum global economy steadily gather pace (chart 6). amid favorable development global economy, improvement observe japan's economy well. one pick-up export production become evident. against backdrop strong global it-related demand progress inventory capital stock adjustment emerge economies, range item export increase steadily widen growth export gradually become sustained. production pick well, reflect moderate increase domestic overseas demand well progress inventory adjustments. under circumstances, corporate profit improve business fix investment moderate increase trend. 6 another private consumption pick up. despite steady improvement employment income situation, drop unemployment rate 3 percent moderate wage growth, private consumption show relatively weak development first half last year. this likely due mainly impact consumer sentiment negative wealth effect result decline stock prices. in recent months, consumer sentiment improve steadily, partly due recovery stock prices, consumption activity index (cai), bank compile combine various sale supply-side statistics, pick since last summer (chart 7). japan's economy firmly make step toward recovery. go forward, virtuous cycle income spend maintain corporate household sectors, economy likely continue grow pace potential. b. the current situation outlook price next, i would like turn inflation. a mention earlier, partly result decline crude oil prices, year-on-year rate change cpi exclude fresh food negative territory 2016, recently 0.1 percent. however, look year-on-year rate change cpi exclude fresh food energy, around minus 0.5 percent introduction qqe, turn positive autumn 2013 remain three year since then. this first time occur since japan's economy fell deflation late 1990s. japan long deflation, commonly define sustain decline general price (chart 8). that said, even term cpi exclude fresh food energy, rate increase price slow since begin last year, stagnant recent months. this perhaps firm refrain revise price upward response lackluster private consumption mention earlier, yen's appreciation last year affect price consumer durable good items. a result, recent price development somewhat sluggish, believe momentum toward achieve price stability target 2 percent maintain year-on-year rate change cpi exclude fresh food likely increase toward 2 7 percent. let mention three channel high inflation go forward. first, improvement output gap, see tighten labor market conditions, lead increase inflation rate mainly wage increases. second, energy price start push cpi, downward pressure past yen appreciation gradually abate. third, developments, bank's strong commitment achieve price stability target 2 percent, lead high medium- long-term inflation expectation among public. let elaborate factors. the tighten labor market condition exert upward pressure wages. a i mention repeatedly, bank aim moderate rise cpi inflation accompany rise corporate profit wages. recently, private consumption pick amid steady improvement employment income situation. if situation continues, firm expect proactive price set again. meanwhile, contribution energy price year-on-year rate change cpi, minus 1 percentage point, shrink gradually currently le neutral. go forward, assume crude oil price remain roughly flat, indicate price future markets, contribution turn slightly positive fiscal 2017. it noted, however, temporary fall fiscal 2018. the bank intend achieve 2 percent target simply depend rise energy prices. in order achieve 2 percent price stability target sustainable manner, necessary actual increase price lead high medium- long-term inflation expectation adaptive formation mechanism, result increase underlie trend inflation rate. iii. the bank's stance monetary policy go forward lastly, i would like explain bank's stance monetary policy go forward. a i explain earlier, yield curve control facilitate formation yield curve deem appropriate maintain momentum toward achieve price stability target 2 percent, take account development economic activity price well 8 financial conditions. the bank continue conduct monetary policy base principle. let elaborate point. in assess development economic activity prices, bank take account outlook development risk factor present outlook economic activity price (outlook report). regard financial conditions, take consideration effect prevail interest rate environment function financial intermediation. base framework, current situation explain follows. with regard economic price developments, still long way go achieve price stability target 2 percent, although improvement observed. a describe january 2017 outlook report, momentum toward achieve 2 percent target maintain yet sufficiently firm. a risk factors, risk economic activity price skew downside, development medium- long-term inflation expectation warrant particular attention. accord policy board members' forecast price present outlook report, high private-sector economists, time year-on-year rate change cpi reach 2 percent likely around fiscal 2018. take element account, reason reduce level monetary accommodation moment term economic price developments. in regard, let add bank's monetary policy design achieve price stability target 2 percent, respond situation japan's economy. the bank raise target level long-term interest rate rise rate countries. next, let make assessment current situation term financial conditions, effect function financial intermediation. there need raise interest rates, either term short-term policy interest rate target level long-term interest rates. the investment environment insurance pension product become favorable super-long-term interest rate increase compare september 2016 (chart 9). bank maintain positive lend attitude, although yield short- medium-term zone -- affect banks' profit large extent -- 9 remain negative spread deposit lend rate decline trend (chart 10). the amount outstanding bank lend increase annual rate around 2.5 percent 3.0 percent. these development show function financial intermediation support economic activity impaired. nevertheless, effect low interest rate function financial intermediation would cumulative passage time. the bank continue examine effect keep close communication financial institutions. let summarize assessment. from three aspect -- economy, prices, financial condition -- obvious bank maintain current yield curve thereby make improvement global economy, view achieve price stability target 2 percent early possible time. i would like add one thing point. the guideline market operation decide monetary policy meet line think i explained. the conduct market operation include jgb purchase determine practically implement guideline smooth manner. a result, factor amount jgb purchase individual auction may vary depend financial market conditions. however, implication monetary policy go forward. conclusion since introduction qqe april 2013, bank review framework monetary ease several times, response change environment. however, absolutely change commitment achieve price stability target 2 percent early possible time. i believe "qqe yield curve control," consist "inflation-overshooting commitment" "yield curve control," best possible framework devise present, give situation japan -- formation mechanism inflation expectations, transmission channel monetary easing, condition financial system. under framework, bank realize maximum effect monetary easing. thank much attention.

provide best appropriate guidance could give,given sometimes wide range feedback received, particularly small number ofissues controversial market. the obvious example ‘lastlook’. this issue generate considerable passionate discussion. i would expect thatdiscussion continue release code may code might evolve afunction discussion. i would like make point market participant think wouldbe preferable code go further, welcome go path theiroperations. on hand, would desirable converse occur, namely formarket participants’ practice fall short principle describe code. that said, ithink good outcome

thecode’s aim help move fx market good place.i illustrate couple area address first phase code,which already public domain. in first phase, topic cover market waslooking guidance sooner rather late potentially adverse effect 2 / 5bis central bankers' speech market functioning.one example around information sharing, many market participant havehighlighted unsure information convey counterparties

prescriptive code is, easy get around. rule easy arbitrage thanprinciples. if it’s expressly prohibit explicitly discouraged, must okay seem tobe historical experience. moreover, prescriptive precise code, theless people think doing. if it’s principles-based le prescriptive then,as i said, market participant think whether action consistentwith principle code.so, work industry produce principles-based code rather set ofprescriptive regulatory standards. it impose legal regulatory obligation marketparticipants, supplant exist regulatory standard expectations. but expectthe principle

officer, prudential regulation authority london business school 20 march 2017 all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 2 2 good morning. the uk world-leading insurance sector provide wide range vital service real economy society. it promote growth employment, prove mettle turbulent time country proud it. a necessary precondition success world-class insurance supervision. that aim deliver pra. like insurers, job forward-looking prudent risk. where differ private firm motivate solely public interest. the recent debate insurance regulation – timely important – must seem like cacophony acronyms, statistics, model assumptions. but strip back you’ll see essential, irreducible human core all. some old vulnerable society invest life save long-term annuity contracts. by pool transfer many kind risk – cyber marine – insurer provide cover essential economic activity. and protect critical illness personal accident, insurer commit need most. so talk promote insurers’ safety soundness, protect policyholders, mind. the pra squeeze much short life since begin supervise insurance company 2013, least enormous undertake implement solvency ii, knit insurance supervision wide bank, obvious connection area like monetary analysis. and today, bank england’s independent evaluation office publish think pra objective unique insurance, contribute protection policyholders. all make ideal time refresh approach insurance supervision. i begin take stock insurance regulation. these rule standard apply across board, recently subject ongoing lively debate. now solvency ii applied, take forward? from i would like explore approach insurance supervision – day-to-day business understanding, assess challenge 4691 firm responsible for. in particular, pra think policyholder protection? 1 this consolidate view insurance group – approximately 600 insurance entities, include solo part groups. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 3 3 and point this? our aim maintain resilient insurance sector pas risk back policyholder crystallise. solvency ii: stocktake for uninitiated, solvency ii new regulatory regime insurance company across eu, introduce 1 january 2016 year wrangling. there lively debate new regime work uk. it seem almost every day specialist press contain new opinion piece industry insider consultant solvency ii constrain business turn bad feared. there also important review treasury select committee, i give evidence recently. and occasionally others outside magic circle insurance enthusiast (of i count one) take pass interest. inevitably, subject complex solvency ii, wide range opinions. and i think degree constructive tension regulator regulate firm sign healthy properly function relationship. but debate pay consider sides. so insurance industry think solvency ii? unsurprisingly, range views. lord turnbull, former board member prudential, unequivocal comment solvency ii “an absolutely dreadful piece legislation”. others, particularly work general insurance, sanguine - instance john parry lloyd’s london tell tsc “in term solvency ii…damaging competitiveness return capital, no, see that”. write submission industry tsc generally reveal two themes. first, consume sizeable piece new regulation, industry desire whatsoever sit back regulatory table consume another, radically different, meal. by reckoning, one submission tsc call fundamental change regime. and second, pra do reasonable job steer everyone across implementation line, view part industry over-zealous places. i’ll comment theme turn. solvency ii indigestion i much agree another big meal stage would unwise. however, i acknowledge size variety solvency ii meal leave u face degree indigestion. when face live market condition commercial realities, aspect regime find wanting. so i agree industry commentator nobody’s best interest – firms, policyholder regulator – make wholesale changes. but mean cannot make series tweak improvement overall system, way digestif. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 4 4 for example, considerable criticism risk margin - new feature solvency ii aim allow uncertainty liability valuation - i agree current design implementation achieve intend goals. the concept risk margin sensible one, current implementation solvency ii flawed. because root cause problem bake european legislation, need fix source, actively constructively engage european colleague design sensible solution. some firm would like u ‘break glass’ implement unilateral quick fix uk. but i think would mistake stage, least short-term mechanism available firm mitigate impact business write introduction solvency ii, namely transitional measure technical provisions, tmtps. we allow firm apply qualify use measure. and data report u firm indicate tmtp benefit across life industry inception solvency ii almost entirely offset aggregate risk margin. i also reiterate point i’ve make previously, consider whether firm position pay dividends, one main quantitative yardstick use capital level benefit transitionals2. in words, regard transitionals create high quality capital. give substantial benefit arise tmtps, important firm pra level remain appropriate time. and mechanism ensure that, whereby firm may apply recalculation follow material change risk profile, every two years. our goal maintenance tmtps straightforward possible onerous involved. the pra recently close consultation3 proposal process expect issue supervisory statement subject late 2017. another industry complaint quantity data firm must report, compress timetable so. it plain fact volume report data high previous regime regulatory return due pra quickly. i view thing significant improvement, enable good delivery pra’s objective policyholder protection firm safety soundness. to frank, situation sometimes face regulator past, firm unable quickly tell u asset exposures, solvency review sometimes occur 18 month arrears, unacceptable, particularly give fast pace serious economic financial crisis develop modern interconnect world. however, i keep open mind whether strike right balance – may case low burden, turn new report doesn’t deliver supervisory benefit commensurate cost. we also investigate potential publication select statistic provide overview market participants. 2

http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/pra/pages/publications/cp/2016/cp4716.aspx all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 5 5 on 16 november 2016, bank publish first edition new quarterly statistical release uk bank sector4. we consider potential issue something similar uk insurance sector, derive data insurer submit us. we plan engage industry soon discus format content would use interest, first release potentially autumn. a third topic rumble discontent relate easy insurer find invest illiquid assets, receive appropriate regulatory recognition. in view, two quite separate issue play here. the first certain ‘clunkiness’ design solvency ii match adjustment (ma), feature regime give insurer capital benefit match asset cashflows liability cashflows. the rule write assumption insurer generally match annuity simple securities, liquid corporate sovereign bonds. this assumption broadly true rule agree several year ago, recently insurer increasingly turn attention class investment that, generally speaking, appropriate characteristic meet long-term insurance liabilities. but type investment often fail meet certain rather prescriptive rules. some industry argue flexibility ignore element rules. i don’t think right. the directive quite clear cashflows ma-eligible asset must “fixed”, “predictable” flexible term. now, job unpick law. but apply sensibly. and i think plenty evidence doing, whether approach certain asset (for instance allow pair variable cashflow asset derivatives, restructure asset like equity release mortgages) fact allow infrastructure asset sector like healthcare, social house telecom infrastructure achieve ma-eligibility. now, give completely free hand i would probably make modest design change ma, perhaps slightly great flexibility around definition “fixity” great allowance unexpected credit defaults. but i contend implement regime today intelligently, appropriate recognition asset liability match lead £59bn reduction capital requirement industry. but ma design reason pra sometimes pause firm discus new investment opportunity us. by nature, illiquid bespeak loan require specific skill term structuring, valuation ongoing risk management. in particular, experience teach u risk firm face make loan relate skilfully firm manage impairment process. these traditional area expertise uk insurer and, view, firm must clear high bar order demonstrate adequate system control place manage type risk exposures. we recently consult topic5 look forward engagement industry. a final word subject, ask insurer directly impediment invest infrastructure assets, number one problem raise lack suitable investment opportunities, regulatory framework. perhaps polite seem that, face 4

available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 6 6 cold reality take risks, insurer often simply conclude yield available insufficient compensation risk incurred. an over-zealous approach pra? i turn general theme tsc submission – whether pra implement solvency ii over-zealously. or put another way, ‘gold–plated’ directive? you unsurprised hear i say not. a i say earlier, natural tension regulator firms, objective may consistent different. but rather ask take word trust, let provide practical example attempt explain act way have. first, consider challenge association british insurer (abi) make write evidence tsc6, senior insurance manager regime (simr) introduce “extensively ‘gold plates’ pillar 3 requirement solvency ii”. the simr design ensure individual accountability senior manager director insurer conduct, oversee business conduct key individual report them, ongoing safety soundness firm protection policyholders. a such, key tool pra us deliver objectives. the simr consistent provision bank england financial service act 2016. so whilst abi correct assertion simr require solvency ii directive, consequence uk legislative choice simply invention pra. second, thorny topic approval solvency ii and, particular, internal model approvals. the industry quite right point overhead gain model approval considerable. in cases, weight rather page length would appropriate measure application size. but remember firm approve internal model effect set regulatory capital requirements. once grant model approval, pra limit ability adjust firm’s solvency capital requirement. and colleague david rule previously commented7 “even act good faith, business pressure may create risk model change generate low capital requirement favour time, therefore solvency standard might deteriorate”. in design approach, also mindful fsa’s experience approve internal model bank basel ii, promise future improvement tend materialise. it therefore come surprise no-one approach model approval diligently, sceptically rigorously. third, relate model approvals, issue pra’s internal view model calibration. we previously comment use quantitative indicators8, qis, i think worth repeat indicator pass/ fail standards. in particular, standard model approval firm must meet test standard lay solvency ii directive, basis 6

indication sort calibration level would expect see standard portfolios. model fall outside qi range (both below) attract increase scrutiny. take example qi corporate bonds. we feel hard argue model calibrate level credit spread increase saw recently 2008-2009 meet one-in-200-year standard require directive. and set qi accordingly. but model credit risk complex business, subject nuance considerable expert judgement. indeed, reasonable, knowledgeable expert might perfectly well disagree key assumptions. for reasons, actually approve internal model credit component meet qis, firm question demonstrate exposure atypical hence warrant non-standard calibration, provide off-setting conservatism aspect model. pra’s approach insurance supervision i’d like turn broad think mean pra supervise insurance companies. i’ve previously spoken9 history insurance regulation uk won’t re-hash here, since i’ve yet reach age acceptable simply repeat myself. happily, accord longevity qi i plenty time track. but i would like provide insight pra operate way does. the uk insurance industry fourth large world. it employ 300,000 people uk, provide cover nearly 27 million households10, £2.4 trillion11 assets. it therefore unsurprising parliament give pra general objective deliver safety soundness insurers, well banks. but insurer only, parliament also give u additional insurance objective – equal weight general objective – contribute secure appropriate degree policyholder protection. now sound like rather mouthful, fortunately bank’s independent evaluation office (ieo) today publish thorough evaluation pra’s approach insurance objective. the bank set ieo 2014 help court evaluate bank’s performance. early last year, court ask ieo consider whether enough right sort thing deliver insurance objective. the ieo’s report include number interest findings, i welcome find consistent observation time executive director insurance supervision. in particular, ieo find lot activity go pursuit policyholder protection. this come surprise me. the pra’s insurance supervisors, actuary professional 9

www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 8 8 experience strong public-service ethos. they strongly motivate protect insurance policyholders, human motivation safety soundness. however, ieo find could explain mean “policyholder protection”. some straightforward, ensure staff clear legal analysis understand pra act, confirm response ieo’s report improve analysis train required. but ieo also raise deep question much protection pra seek deliver, sort policyholders, confidence. and deep question i intend consider briefly remainder comment today. insurer subject know “twin peaks” regulation uk. in addition supervision u pra, financial conduct authority also supervise insurers. and ieo report make clear that, context secure policyholder protection, fca primary role. the key word pra’s objective “contribute”. we act prudential concerns, whereas fca act wide matter fairness. to give example: pra might intervene prevent insurer sell new policy inadequate financial resources, would fca consider whether policy contain unfair term conditions. in circumstance split responsibility clear, need sure sufficiently explicit limit pra’s role respect area with-profits business, corporate restructure firm close new business go run-off. another important consideration u whether pra seek protect policyholder equally. the insurer supervise receive £260bn gross write premium 2016. some might say pra act though “all policyholder equal, equal others”. but view need obfuscate manner quite clear regulatory standard set solvency ii uniform, supervision attempt cover policyholder equally. it view entirely appropriate direct resource towards policyholder suffer great financial hardship policy pay promised, great asymmetry information company customer, face high possibility unable replace cover lost. for example, five million household life insurance two million personal pensions. some old vulnerable people society reliant upon income provide insurer long-term annuity contracts, invest life savings. while fscs play vital role, financial harm cause failure insurer space would considerable quite right pra devote significant resource supervision sector, low appetite firm unable honour promises. in contrast, range insurance contract consequence firm failure le severe, hence limit resource spread around pra’s supervisory approach somewhat le intense. for example, various class property insurance, mobile phone, argument could make pra restrict low level supervision. our resourcing all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 9 9 model already work extent way, ieo challenge u think deeply question. another interest area insurance buy commercial corporate customers. in cases, information asymmetry buyer seller lower, sometimes reversed, contract typically renewable annually, mean low concern customer lock long-term policies. in circumstance buyer often choose cover provider base third-party measure financial strength (such opinion rat agency insurance brokers), case make need regulator reduced. indeed, many london market make point (somewhat le subtly!). but anyone excitedly hear confirmation pra long regulate certain type insurer, remember statutory objective contribute protect policyholder stripes. so debate ‘how’, ‘whether’. in fact, pra’s resourcing model already work focus resource area concern. we categorise regulate firm accord size potential harm customer would suffer fail. the majority firm regulate assign low category, reflect low level risk pose objectives. firm high category receive supervisory specialist resources, decision firm approve senior level within pra’s decision –making framework. the ieo challenge u look system so. our executive director insurance supervision, david rule, take forward discussion issue prudential regulation committee. we revise approach insurance supervision document explain change decide make. in course need fully factor third objective, facilitate effective competition – also recently review ieo12. although secondary objective, give high priority pra also quite rightly topic treasury select committee take strong interest. our competition work span bank insurance, much public debate former. we have, however, pursue objective assiduously insurance side – pick example step take facilitate competition:  create proportionate regime 40% firm regulate cover solvency ii;  give around 85% solvency ii firm uk opportunity avoid around 70% quarterly report burden would otherwise face;  work hmt, hmrc london market introduce new structure insurance-linked securities; 12 http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/about/documents/ieo/evaluation0316.pdf all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 10 10  authorise 19 new insurance company lloyd’s manage agent first three year pra’s existence. conclusion financial regulation supervision sometimes dry business. and insurance particular, arcane aspect regulatory framework rapidly turn everyone except u industry. i therefore spend time look individual policyholder cases, remind go frontline. one particular make powerful impression me. a young man get touch insurance company claim critical illness cover. the reason claim 4-year old son brain cancer. the cancer difficult place, best-case outcome forthcoming operation grim. the worst-case grim all. the father call claim policy order help cover ancillary cost family nh take forward procedure. the company right thing, enough money right thing. i others expose case wholly anonymised way, data protection reasons. despite i never meet many people wept. this policyholder protection really about. it’s risk margin, view ultimate, match adjustment corporate bond spreads. it’s make sure insurance company help disaster strikes. that’s take part job seriously. speech by: loi m bakani cmg, governor, bank png at uncdf 50th anniversary 19 january 2017 lady gentlemen, pleasure address momentous occasion mark uncdf’s 50th anniversary. the bank papua

central bank communication low interest rateenvironmentspeech mr benoît cœuré, member executive board european central bank, atan event organise bruegel, brussels, 31 march 2017.* * *it great pleasure today bruegel, think tank always theforefront policy debate europe, i grateful opportunity contribute thediscussion forum.today, i would like share think central bank communication lowinterest rate environment. in particular, i discuss, draw ecb’s experience, thecommunication challenge central bank face rate negative isuncertainty reaction function policymakers. i conclude remark thecurrent policy debate.let start general note, however.the relationship central bank outside world evolve years. from astarting point near-complete secrecy, central bank come way usingcommunication explicitly tool monetary policy. especially financial crisis, thecommunication effort central bank around world expanded.there good reason this. to fulfil mandates, central bank inject largeamounts monetary stimulus, also make use novel instruments. the monetary policyresponse unprecedented scale scope. this certainly add furtherimpetus central banks’ drive accountability transparency – something theecb always take seriously. early week, event organise transparencyinternational, also brussels, i explain detail ecb go fulfil itsaccountability transparency duties.today, i discus institutional factors. rather, i focus onthe functional dimension behind increase importance communication central banks.this functional dimension derive relationship monetary authority andfinancial markets.central bank communication tool monetary policyin today’s economy, transmission monetary impulse start asset prices. atransparent policy framework greatly enhance ability steer financial condition and,hence, ultimately ensure effective transmission monetary policy pursuit pricestability objective.the relationship central banks’ policy communication financial market conditionsreceived even great attention central bank approach interest rate level thatwere generally judge offer limit room manoeuvre.i argue vicinity effective low bind policy interest rates, communicationbecomes even important, similarity communication awayfrom low bound, also peculiar challenges.i say monetary policy transmit mainly asset prices. since financialmarkets exist price future cash flows, inherently forward-looking. this meansmonetary policy work largely affect expectation future policy interest rate – true123 1 / 10bis central bankers' speech at, away from, effective low bound.away low bound, monetary policy steer expectation mainly send signalsthrough current level central bank interest rate communicate centralbank’s assessment macroeconomic outlook.at low bound, ability central bank ease stance monetary policy wayis constrained. instead, central bank must increasingly rely influence expectation directly.this communicate likely path future policy rate – providingforward guidance.in words, low bind put premium clear communication itrepresents unusual circumstance require central bank explain carefully, alsobecause elevate importance communication monetary policy toolbox.indeed, frictionless capital markets, effective low bind forward guidance would bethe way ease monetary policy stance. in setup, central bank asset purchaseswould ineffective: whether asset hold balance sheet public private sectorwould affect term premia and, hence, long-term interest rates.of course know capital market frictionless. this open important role forcentral bank intervene asset market via outright purchase act termpremium. so, forward guidance one tool, one, central bank resort inconditions space change policy-makers’ traditional instrument – short-termpolicy rate – constrained.the ecb’s forward guidancebut let focus work forward guidance look case ecb. i willstart general remark explain current forward guidance framework.for forward guidance credible, ultimately anchor central bank’smandate. any pronouncement make likely path policy instrument isinevitably base current information convey assessment economy ismost likely head policy-relevant horizon. this type forward guidance sometimestermed “delphic” , because, like oracle delphi, basically consist forecast, thiscase forecast central bank economy likely evolve.but forward guidance also intend clarify reaction function. the reaction functionmaps economic environment instrument space. to put simply, relate whatwe think happen happens. to continue greek mythologytheme, mean also “odyssean” element forward guidance: like odysseustying ship’s mast order resist song sirens, conveysa commitment react specific way contingency might arise.an extreme form odyssean forward guidance, i discus today i believethat consistent mandate, would consist commit unconditional interestpath, irrespective contingencies.this far theory goes.in practice, apply distinction delphic odyssean guidance theecb’s rate forward guidance, say “expect interest rate remain present orlower level extend period time …”, convey assessment seeinflation likely evolve policy-relevant horizon intend map thisoutlook level key policy rates.4567 2 / 10bis central bankers' speech you easily see rate forward guidance entail two key components:a structural component correspond reaction function – monetary policy strategy– firmly anchor primary mandate. in today’s world, central bank makeuse different instruments, reaction function also include map desiredmonetary policy stance instruments, policy rate asset purchases. think it,ideally, finely tune machine constantly fee assessment likely futurepath inflation, variable component, evolve result incomingdata stream.the two component – structural variable one – also apply forwardguidance asset purchase programme (app), contain three main elements:first, clear delphic communication expect volume purchase horizon,currently “until december 2017 …”.second, odyssean element state contingency clarify govern council’sreaction function see “a sustain adjustment path inflation consistentwith inflation aim.”and third, since last december additional odyssean clarification express ourpreparedness increase size and/or duration app certain conditions, i.e. “ifthe outlook become le favourable, financial condition become inconsistent withfurther progress towards sustain adjustment path inflation …”.taken together, ecb’s current forward guidance encompass carefully expound seriesof expectation involve key policy rate asset purchases.indeed, guidance policy rate link app timeline, govern council’sexpectation remain present low level “well past horizon netasset purchases.” the logic behind guidance, simple terms, may bebeneficial retain full control expect path future short-term policy rates, whileallowing gradual decompression term premium see solid progresstowards sustain adjustment path inflation.at rate, forward guidance, rate app, credible, need keepour policy expectation well align evolve assessment balance risk theoutlook inflation – delphic part forward guidance. we would pay high pricein term credibility fail adapt forward guidance change ourviews outlook.i come back point late let note, now, gradual adjustment ourguidance could ultimately quite costly. indeed, central bank market may movedtowards jeremy stein co-author call “gradualist” equilibrium.this situation central bank make gradual change policy tool andcommunication order upset market. in environment, change thecentral bank’s policy inclination major effect asset prices. the reason thatmarkets come expect initial central bank move – matter incremental – befollowed many similar move direction.this effect likely great condition exceptionally large amount ofmonetary stimulus place. it make expectation announcement change themonetary policy stance much important markets.the ecb’s experience forward guidance: success challengeswith mind, experience forward guidance?8 3 / 10bis central bankers' speech it early draw definitive conclusion – all, still low bind environment.but evidence forward guidance successful – followingrespects.first, stabilise influence certain market price reflect expectation ourpolicy instrument important chain transmission. we evidence thesensitivity forward rate macroeconomic news decline time (very first)forward guidance announcement july 2013, sensitivity remain low thanhistorical regularity ever since. in words, market trust assessment economyand imply path policy rates.second, state domestic policy likely differ elsewhere, forwardguidance insulate euro area financial condition external shock would haveresulted unwarranted tighten facilitate nominal exchange rate adjustmentsconsistent different monetary conditions, reflect different circumstances.third, source additional monetary policy accommodation time theroom cut key policy rate limited.let explain last point detail, refer back forward guidance app.the impact asset purchase market price likely depend critically thesepurchases communicate market. the fact choose communicate, part ofour forward guidance, beginning, expectation intend horizon apppurchases likely key determinant success programme. thereason provide guidance horizon help market form accurateexpectations likely amount purchase – conditional price stability outlook –thereby reduce uncertainty hence term/risk premia.this confirm recent research: flank communication likely size,announcements purchase programme find lead much great decline instock market uncertainty compare announcement omit size indication.this first element app guidance reinforce second element – state-contingent leg forward guidance. by establish intimate link price stabilityobjective, make clear expect volume could well large take long forinflation converge back level close 2%.in practice, mean clarify reaction function way, market able tobetter anticipate actions, thereby enhance effectiveness policy frontloading therequired accommodation. this always gentle ride i explain minute ithink fair say state-contingent leg app forward guidance support andcontinues support important price discovery function markets.overall, therefore, combination time state-contingent forward guidance beenhighly instrumental support powerful portfolio rebalancing effect compression ofterm premia, turn lead broad-based ease financial conditions.i think evidence speak itself.euro area bank lend rate firm fall 80 basis point since startedpurchasing cover bond october 2014, step succeed shortly afterwards bypurchases asset-backed security (abs) government securities. ecb analysis attributesa significant portion fall work asset purchase programme.and effective forward guidance implementation app may also help to91011 4 / 10bis central bankers' speech reinforce forward guidance rate – channel famously label “signalling” channel. theargument go large-scale bond purchase would perceive market preventingpolicy-makers raise rate quickly, would cause loss central banks’ balancesheet. in words, central bank purchase asset “put money mouth is”.at time, i deny communication policy intention been, remains,challenging cannot always sure forward guidance works.much challenge arise course fact communication one-way streetas i allude before. there interaction central bank communication financialmarkets create well-known risk financial condition would become de-anchored.paul samuelson famously compare central banker read much movementsin bond market monkey “discovers reflection mirror think bylooking reaction monkey – include surprise – get newinformation”.let explain give two concrete examples.the first one refer decision december 2015, announce substantialpackage policy measures, include six-month extension app, 10 basis point cut inthe deposit facility rate (dfr) reinvestment principal payment maturingbonds. to give idea size, additional purchase alone, include thereinvestment, amount almost €700 billion bond expect extract themarket – appreciable amount stimulus.yet, market pay little heed bond yield tighten measurably day. we observe ahawkish revision expectation trajectory ecb policy rate increaseduncertainty reaction function. market intelligence follow decision suggest thatthe absence clear forward guidance possibility cut dfr lead asharp repricing eonia forward market.this suggest two things: first, introduction negative rates, powerful easingeffect monetary policy stance, create uncertainty low prepare togo key interest rates.second, perceive communication low bind strong signal. recall thatmarkets day undertake repricing, although govern council, everyintroductory statement, keep implicit reference initial rate forward guidance july2013, namely expect rate remain present low levels.incidentally, experience square recent find literature. researcher theecb show central bank communication lead different interpretation marketparticipants – case willingness cut dfr likely low bound– tend look financial market price find peer interpret thesame statement. this make likely react exogenous disturbances, inturn increase uncertainty.at face value, would call self-standing forward guidance low bound. but iexplained remark yale last year, great uncertainty estimate theso-called “economic” low bound, level reduction rate would morelikely lead tighten rather ease stance.would credible central bank provide guidance sketchy, probably time-varying, estimates? my answer would no, least say much moreconfidence low bind might be.12131415 5 / 10bis central bankers' speech but respect know, communication clear possible, particularwhen uncertainty non-standard measure considerable.this bring next observation: market’s reception decision last december toextend intend horizon app purchase december 2017, reduce monthlypurchases €80 billion €60 billion.it fear reduction pace purchase – despite long purchase horizon –could cause instability financial markets, similar so-called “taper tantrum”episode u 2013.these risk ingrain market survey suggest market almostunanimous believe ecb would continue purchase €80 billion per month, alsobeyond march 2017.with benefit hindsight, fear prove unfounded. the december 2016 policyannouncement meet broad approval market participants, thereby safeguard thecontinued support recovery euro area accommodative financingconditions.i see two potential train think could square benign market response thesignals survey fed’s experience: success december 2016 decision inpreserving favourable market condition could attribute additional “easing bias”attached app i mention earlier; line think would availablemarket survey paint bias mislead picture true investor expectations.which line think likely close reality?in view, equally relevant. the decision communicate stand ready toincrease size and/or duration programme certain condition assure investorsthat change reaction function. rather, reduction pace purchaseswas mere reflection diminish deflationary tail risk – delphic signal embed inclearer odyssean forward guidance, wish.but additional ease bias, however important may be, unlikely explain whole story.one reason market participant voice concern ability increase themonthly pace purchase give scarcity bond available market theconstraints purchase programme. others doubt willingness step purchasesonce more.both concern seem cast doubt credibility part forward guidance –wrongly, view, consider prove track record decisive action face adverseshocks threaten jeopardise achievement price stability objective.but take doubt seriously, mean market might discount morestrongly possibility abrupt end app post-march 2017 availablesurveys might suggest – view would seem corroborate, least face value,the argument put forward hyun shin.he argue think market homogenous entity coherentset belief expectations. rather, marketplace diverse, price give pointin time aggregate many different – indeed oppose – opinions. investor stridentviews – is, high degree conviction – may large influence pricingin short term. it market participant will make strongestcommitment, term size position take, term leverage.1617 6 / 10bis central bankers' speech you see i’m get at. perhaps overall benign market response december2016 announcement may frustrate expect outright taper decision,perhaps doubt willingness ability continue purchasing.this suggest expectation glean market survey may imperfect reflection of“true” market expectations. of course, may also clear enough ourcommunication – investor misunderstand forward guidance reaction function,which different doubt willingness act. to extent, toomany disparate voices, risk miscommunication – danger cacophony, alanblinder put – mitigate put discipline communication monetarypolicy committee – govern council case ecb. in fact, case fordisciplined communication even strong low bound.all say ignore investor think expect. market intelligence isan important input analysis financial market developments. it rather mean thesuccessful sequence policymaking – particular presence unconventional policymeasures – (i) clear reaction function, include expect monetarypolicy stance would map different policy instruments, (ii) disclose frequently ourassessment state economy likely evolution, (iii) act accordingly.in so, central bank lead market minimise risk lead them. andby foster markets’ understand reaction function, reduce market volatility andsupport effectiveness predictability monetary policy actions.conclusions outlookwith experience challenge mind, allow think current state ofour forward guidance – i conclude.as know, early month govern council decide leave forward guidanceunchanged. thus, maintain “easing biases” – one purchase oneon key interest rates, i.e. mean rate could go lower.the euro area economy undoubtedly make great deal progress. the recovery beensteadily broadening, firming, may even gain momentum since thebeginning year. in fact, may see full potential policy measure unfolding.that course raise question whether time come communicate change inour policy expectations.as i say earlier, forward guidance framework consist two key components: structuraland variable one. change structural part option would leave market astate uncertainty, risk excess volatility even de-stabilisation financialconditions.but variable component guidance demand we: (i) regularly re-assess themedium-term price stability outlook, (ii) run assessment reaction function, and(iii) decide whether policy expectation horizon pace asset purchaseprogrammes, level policy rate (“present lower”) expectedendurance (“well past …”) need adjustment.should conclude adjustment needed, hesitate adapt ourcommunication. after all, abandon intimate link policy expectation ourassessment progress towards sustain adjustment path inflation would riskcreating false impression change reaction function – dangerous pathtowards time-inconsistency.1819 7 / 10bis central bankers' speech of course, decide change policy expectation back improvingeconomic landscape, mean would low interest rate increase thepace purchase state world. it mean – give current outlook – itseems increasingly le likely so.in similar way, decision change policy expectation prejudice policysteps. there automatic implication policy tools. it natural potential changein expectation first withstand test time.ultimately, also choice sequence policy instrument outcome regularassessment medium-term price stability outlook, reflect state-dependent nature ofour expectation horizon policy instrument likely maintained.and here, let clear.the late incoming data shift balance risk growth towards neutral territory inmy view. but time, measure underlie inflation euro area remain subduedand project path inflation still remain highly conditional policy stance. in line withour forward guidance app, clearly suggest current expectation intendedhorizon purchases, encapsulate introductory statement, sequencingof policy instruments, remain valid today.thank attention.referencesaltavilla, c., g. carboni r. motto (2015), “asset purchase programme financialmarkets: lesson euro area”, ecb work paper series no 1864.blattner, t. m. joyce (2016),

university new haven bank japan march 28, 2017 1 introduction first all, i thank senior fellow stephen roach give opportunity talk esteem audience yale. i understand teach macroeconomic policy issues, focus lesson japan learn deflation. the bank japan frontrunner combat deflation. a one board members, i hope remark today help stimulate academic discussion. deflation prevail almost quarter century japan. to overcome deflation, theory practice introduce tested, policy effect examined. a result, range knowledge wisdom acquired. the bank, part, conduct comprehensive assessment quantitative qualitative monetary ease -- qqe short -- september last year, learn important lessons. among these, i today focus issue regard long-term inflation expectations. this key factor overcome deflation. i admit conceive expectation somewhat elusive task, worth discussing. i. lesson japan a. determinant long-term inflation expectation japan's experience refute premise monetary policy long-term inflation expectation determine central bank (chart 1).1 this monetary policy effect asymmetric central bank decrease long-term inflation expectation toward target raise toward target. in words, long-term inflation expectation -- norm price -- de-anchored, central bank's ability influence inflation constrain significantly due zero interest rate bound. those academia might feel somewhat troublesome. in fact, however, central bank re-anchors long-term inflation 1 in statement longer-run goal monetary policy strategy (adopted effective january 24, 2012; amend effective january 26, 2016), federal reserve indicate "the inflation rate long run primarily determine monetary policy, hence committee ability specify longer-run goal inflation." see board governor federal reserve system (2016). 2 expectation toward target, limit monetary policy game town. what needed, addition continue powerful monetary easing, raise potential growth rate, roughly equal natural rate interest. this achieve structural policy include labor market reform.2 academic discussion seriously need point. this japan country learn lesson deflation. namely, simultaneous decline potential growth rate long-term inflation expectation observe many country since late global financial crisis (chart 2). b. negative effect excessively low long-term inflation expectation let elaborate. the fundamental lesson learn central bank allow long-term inflation expectation decline excessively low levels. central bank low excessively high long-term inflation expectation credibility earn past achievements. the fight inflation easy strategy simple compare combat deflation. there premise economic theory hold true fight inflation; namely, long-term inflation expectation determine inflation target set central banks. by contrast, inflation target basis economic model set central bank lose credibility due excessively low inflation. for example, decline potential growth rate long-term inflation expectation occur simultaneously japan. however, academic side economics yet provide answer whether possible raise excessively low long-term inflation expectation monetary policy. this present unique situation japan -- i touch late -- long-term inflation expectation virtually 0 percent potential growth rate slightly 0 percent, zero nominal interest rate bind usual economic transactions. 2 the original "three-arrows" strategy abe administration positive implication fiscal monetary policy combine would support structural policies. 3 in reality, even large-scale unconventional monetary policy, mechanism friedman's quantity theory money new keynesian model jump expectation operate insufficiently far. in term re-anchoring long-term inflation expectations, glass half full half empty. if potential growth rate long-term inflation expectation decline current low levels, monetary policy would effective. next, i discus long-term inflation expectation follow aspects: (1) formation mechanism; (2) reason low expectation japan; (3) relationship japan's financial crisis; (4) relationship labor market reform. ii. issue regard long-term inflation expectation a. formation mechanism in economics theory, long-term inflation expectation irrelevant potential growth rate. however, i doubt hold true reality, light happen japan. rather, i think long-term inflation expectation potential growth rate correlation, although may strong (chart 3). long-term inflation expectation decline sharply japan, financial crisis late 1990s. economic fundamental already weak crisis negative interaction demand supply conditions; specifically, (1) negative financial accelerator demand side due dire asset price deflation, (2) impairment financial intermediary function, well distortion economic resource allocation cause bubble economy supply side. the financial crisis trigger weaken economic fundamental (chart 4). in situation, pessimism future lead decline people's expectation medium- long-term growth, potential growth rate remain low long period time. a result, people's perception price become excessively conservative. in words, long-term inflation expectation turn downward. 4 b. reason low expectation japan next, let u take look development survey-based measure expect long-term inflation japan. a survey-based rate mark sharp decline period financial crisis late 1990s, level around 1 percent. since then, even throughout period global financial crisis european sovereign debt crisis, le unchanged around 1 percent (chart 5). however, i somewhat doubtful figure.3 i believe persuasive say long-term inflation expectation japan actually decline around 0 percent, follow four reasons.4 first, frequency micro-level price change suggest mode value remain zero. in words, year-on-year rate increase price sample item concentrate 0 percent. therefore, people likely consider zero inflation steady constant state. it helpful see comparison u.s. situation (chart 6).5 second, administer price excessively sticky (chart 7).6,7 for example, start subway fare tokyo unchanged 20 year since 1995 -- disregard effect consumption tax hikes. 3 market-based measure long-term inflation expectation -- 5-year, 5-year forward inflation swap rate -- le credibility survey-based one japan, due lack market liquidity depth, therefore represent useful reference. 4 on point, seem intuitively unlikely many survey economist project inflation rate remain 0 percent next 5-10 years. on hand, might disparity perception price economist household firms, i.e., long-term inflation expectation household firm might low economists. 5 see watanabe watanabe (2016). 6 in reality, amid prolong economic stagnation japan, mechanism establish firmly rise cost administer price compensate fiscal deficit reflect increase political pressure avoid rise administer prices. such process suggest decline long-term inflation expectations, norm prices. 7 see shintani, kurachi, nishioka (2016). 5 third, rate increase wage result wage negotiation labor management continue 0 percent long time. even recent resumption base pay increases, rate le 1 percent (chart 8).8 fourth, japan's deflation equilibrium cannot theoretically explain basis 1 percent long-term inflation expectation (chart 9). i elaborate fourth point. let u assume zero nominal interest rate bound. even case, long long-term inflation expectation meaningfully positive, real interest rate fall natural rate interest, around 0 percent, make real interest rate negative. in case, monetary policy effective, japan's economy able get deflation equilibrium. this suggest that, long-term inflation expectation least around 1 percent, monetary policy effective. c. relationship japan's financial crisis look back, japan's financial crisis late 1990s settle promptly ample liquidity provision capital injection, large-scale credit crunch could avoided, thus subsequent path japan's economy might different. this widely share lesson put good use time global financial crisis afterwards. i note important address private sector's solvency problem provision massive scale liquidity credit enhancement mean swift capital injection. in japan, bailout financial institution taxpayers' money experience strong backlash public. it take considerable amount time public fund actually inject financial institutions. in aftermath financial crisis, injection public fund carry several times. however, actually take several year concern stability financial system subside (chart 10). 8 it also say resumption base pay increase abe administration might prove long-term inflation expectation start rise 0 percent. 6 it introduction zero interest rate policy 1999 introduction quantitative monetary ease 2001 market's liquidity concern alleviate bank's provision ample fund (charts 11-1 11-2).9 quantitative monetary ease pioneer attempt increase predictability monetary policy. it conduct low market interest rate virtually 0 percent provision ample fund surpass require reserve introduce forward guidance. nevertheless, i feel bank could address liquidity concern late 1990s much early stage. in regard, i somewhat understand toward criticism bank's monetary ease insufficient time, result financial crisis prolong economy fell deflationary trap.10 i also note bank pay particular attention negative feedback loop asset price deflation real economy. it pay due attention mild deflation long period. in fact, bank repeatedly explain deflation mild economy fall deflationary spiral, unlike time great depression 1930s.11 it true bank's provision ample fund government's capital injection help avoid deflationary spiral, although somewhat delayed. long-term inflation expectation declining, much attention pay bank academia potential effect monetary policy. 9 in response japan's financial crisis 1990s, bank expand balance sheet conduct funds-supplying funds-absorbing operation -- i.e., actively provide fund money market time absorb excess reserve sell bills. however, mean bank provide excess reserve allow decline market interest rate 0 percent. after all, concept quantitative ease time. 10 another significant lesson excessive monetary ease financial crisis source huge economic bubble. in unite state well, large-scale monetary ease burst it bubble subsequent moderate tighten measure pace become source house bubble, lead global financial crisis. 11 see bank japan (2006). 7 with hindsight, bank least clarify firm determination allow decline long-term inflation expectations, do federal reserve global financial crisis european central bank sovereign debt crisis. d. relationship labor market reform in view, measure raise long-term inflation expectation already decline low level, important structural policies, particularly labor market reform. if long-term inflation expectation kind relevance potential growth rate, necessary raise time. to end, one important measure labor market reform. if reform lead rise labor productivity labor force participation rate, potential growth rate increase longer-term perspective firms' expect rate return households' permanent income also increase. this strengthen monetary ease effect inflation rate increase. then, adaptive formation mechanism inflation expectations, unique japan, bring positive influence long-term inflation expectations. in japan, labor market practice could constraint raise long-term inflation expectations. therefore, labor market reform actively pursued. give increase sense labor shortage cause population decline, ideal time take step forward labor market reform. i next focus three possible reform measures. first, flexible adjustment mechanism implement japan's labor market. let elaborate point. the way people form expectation could affect labor market adjustment make period recession -- i.e., whether quantity adjustment term headcount price adjustment term wages. for example, u.s. labor market, quantity adjustment mainly make form layoffs. japan's labor market mostly make price adjustment layoff tend avoid (chart 12). 8 let add thing wage adjustment japan. in face past shocks, include oil crisis early 1970s 1980s, japan's labor union practice prioritize job security regular worker accept management's proposal set low wages. under coordination labor management, restrain wage increase regular worker effective control inflation. afterwards, base pay regular worker significantly shift downward follow japan's financial crisis, become sticky low levels. since then, non-regular worker act buff wage adjustment outside protection labor unions. a illustrated, japanese-style employment wage practice prioritize job security regular worker restrain wage increase may influence long-term inflation expectation shift downward. if case, solution implement dynamic u.s.-style employment practice allow compensation regular worker reflect risk premiums. i note that, japan's labor market, job mobility social safety net necessarily sufficient. in situation, u.s.-style employment system unlikely socially acceptable. in fact, difficult reach consensus labor management, thus progress labor market reform moderate. i believe key success labor market reform implement dynamic u.s.-style employment practice modify fit japan's circumstances. for example, important gain understand labor union establish social safety net lead economic growth. one option build framework employment reemployment assistance coordination government, labor, management. second, forward-looking wage negotiation system established. let elaborate point. in japan's wage negotiations, observe rate increase consumer price index (cpi) previous year use benchmark determine rate increase wage follow year (chart 13). for reason, even decline cpi attribute external factors, include decline crude oil prices, low inflation rate tend refer wage negotiations. that said, price decline 9 positive factor corporate profit improvement term trade macroeconomic level.12 in view, necessary replace exist practice refer observe cpi past negotiate wage increase one year adaptive manner. instead, necessary implement practice negotiate wage increase several year forward-looking manner share outlook path price change several years, medium long term.13 third, change practice apply result labor-management wage negotiation large manufacturer industries. in japan, result wage negotiation large manufacturer -- especially automobile, steel, major manufacturer -- tend use benchmark negotiation industries, include non-manufacturing. therefore, even term trade macroeconomic level improve due yen's appreciation, high yen cause major manufacturer low profit depress rate wage increases, rate non-manufacturers also tend depress accordingly. in japan, share manufacture gross output le 20 percent. therefore, suitable time use wage major manufacturer benchmark wage negotiation industries. i believe wage increase reflect individual firms' profit forward-looking inflation expectation use basis. iii. addendum: recent discussion fiscal policy measure the role fiscal policy measure regain attention japan recently, follow insufficient increase expectation even large-scale unconventional monetary 12 the bank conduct quantitative analysis point. see appendix 4, bank japan (2016). 13 the japanese government also recognize importance forward-looking wage negotiations. at council realization work style reform, prime minister abe ask business community wage increase take inflation expectation consideration. 10 policy. "helicopter money" fiscal theory price level (ftpl) example (chart 14). the issue common whether additional fiscal expenditure exert positive effect way people form positive expectation sustainable manner. household act rationally ricardian equivalence assumes. meanwhile, also plausible assume concern possible tax hike increase social security tax burden provide reason cautious outlook. these argument might give rise idea desirable permanent fiscal policy expansion without accompany future tax hike. even government debt assume finance future inflation trigger fiscal expansion, empirical research relate theoretical model still insufficient. therefore, model cannot apply actual policy formulation, use basis macroeconomic forecast formulation. economic policy implement base critical decision take account gain loss various economic entities. this difficult obtain consent stakeholder base economic model consider future inflation inevitable cannot predict occur. let also note actual policy management cannot help prudent. the reason policy authority strongly recognize various constraints. in fact, macroeconomic policy manage various constraint -- term legal, accounting, practical affairs, well need parliamentary consent. conclude remark i close note lesson learn 4-year experience since introduction qqe. once long-term inflation expectation decline, easy raise them, even large-scale unconventional monetary policy. give monetary policy limit effects, vital make steady efforts, labor market reform i discuss earlier, order change conservative inflation expectation 11 deeply root people's mindsets. in particular, i consider important produce change wage determination mechanism. in process wage determination, desire inflation target set central bank basis medium- long-term path inflation. for purpose, central banks' inflation target gain sufficient credibility public. to end, necessary see achievement prove monetary policy able change inflation trend. it easy regain credibility. a frontrunner combat deflation, however, bank japan continue endeavor so, always deliberate accomplish monetary policy. thank you. 12 bibliography bank japan.

galhau: the future finance industry -between austerity innovationspeech mr françois villeroy de galhau, governor bank france, süddeutschezeitung finance day 2017, frankfurt main, 22 march 2017.* * *i grateful marine dujardin banque de france acpr staff assistance inpreparing remarks.it great pleasure today i’d like thank sincerely invite me.i frankfurt commit european friend germany; justbecause i travel least fortnight meet ecb govern council! ona personal level, i french root saarland. my family live sincethe end 18th century porcelain manufacture company villeroy & boch part ofthe german “mittelstand”.but today, discus future finance industry, i’m go talk capacity amember govern council president french supervisory authority (the acpr,which i’m sure know). first i would first say word eurosystem’smonetary policy late decisions. then i’ll share think respondto current challenge face finance industry. this side issue central bankers,as charge financial stability well price stability. moreover, robust andprofitable financial sector one prerequisite proper transmission monetarypolicy.1. where stand euro area respect monetary policy?i fully aware heat debate germany surround monetary policy.a debate fully legitimate, let u try keep rational, avoid get emotional. “mehrlicht!” (more light!) allow quote goethe’s last words. this exactly i would liketo today: shed light reason progress.as know, ecb shape accord model bundesbank, i believethat eurosystem’s collective monetary policy much align german valuesthat i fully share admire: independence, respect treaties, price stability long-term approach. a price stability mission entrust u european treaties, wehave duty make primary focus. price stability mean inflation rate close to, butbelow, 2% medium-term. this definition since 2003, definitionthat central bank develop country share – jean-claude trichet rightly termsas “a great convergence". so inflation target euro area nothing new specific;and present monetary policy uncontrolled latin flight fancy.in practice, euro area experience remarkable period price stability crisis. butas 2013, inflation drop well 2% mark. our mandate mean react inorder bring inflation back healthy level economies. and clearly progressingtowards objectives. our monetary policy works; measure put place since2014 already successful.first, [slide 2] ward mortal danger deflation, inflation graduallyrecovering euro area. headline inflation peak 2% last month, –0.2% april2016. the sharp – partly temporary – uptick begin year mainly due therebound energy food prices, underlie inflation remain 1% (and 1.2% 1 / 9bis central bankers' speech germany). however underlie inflation expect rise gradually 1.8% 2019. we arereasonably confident headline underlie inflation converge, close targetin 2019; convergence, often stressed, key element forecasts, asit crucial mid-term sustainability​ inflation path.second, accommodative monetary policy ensure favourable financial conditions:lending firm household continue grow euro area, although reasonablepace – +2.3% firm +2.2% household january 2017 – borrow cost havesignificantly declined. third, [slide 3] economic recovery firm broadening.fortunately, appear worldwide trend: g20 communiquéin baden-baden last week start word “we meet time global economicrecovery progressing", also stress significant risk uncertainty remain.euro area monetary policy play part recovery, late ecb staffprojections foresee high gdp growth region, 1.8% 2017. the euro areaunemployment rate drop 9.6% january year, low level since 2009. and therecovery also broaden across euro area countries, include france: despite sometemporary political uncertainty generate upcoming elections, france’s economic outlookis improving. the country also inactive past year come toreforms: pension reformed, corporate charge cut considerably, andlabour law make flexible. like you, i would like france pick pace ofreform; i say frequently country. but shall regard french neighbour as“unreformable”. these reform crucial, monetary policy obviously theonly game town, le le progressively close output gap.now, question come mind, especially germany, is: give progress,should stop pursue accommodative monetary policy? at stage, answer clearlyno. without monetary stimulus, recovery inflation would yet self-sustained ordurable throughout euro area. that maintain accommodative stancewhile adapt intensity. regard intensity, decide cut monthly assetpurchases €20bn – €80bn €60bn – start next month.we deem necessary launch new series target longer-term refinancingoperations (tltros) last one today. and – include mario draghi –clearly stress limit negative interest rates. let add following: i often read comment describe debate within governingcouncil “predetermined” one, hawk one side dive other. idon’t think accurate: monetary policy decisions, i believe matter take apragmatic approach, base thorough assessment present economic environment inthe euro area specific structure finance channels.this forward guidance one, base current information. but weclearly give financial economic sector visibility monthly purchasevolume whole 2017.2. what challenge face finance industry tackle them?a healthy financial sector key robust economic recovery. i’d like remind thesignificant progress make area since financial crisis. we shouldn’t judgethe european financial sector basis difficult cases, “trailing rear”.on average, sector far resilient crisis. this result ofconsiderable work carry strengthen regulation harmonise supervision euroarea, notably bank union significant step forward. it also come theindustry’s remarkable efforts: european bank much strong position adecade ago, term capital, liquidity risk-taking. regard capital instance, 2 / 9bis central bankers' speech common equity tier 1 ratio significant euro area bank group rise le 7%in 2008 14% today. overall, bank le risky, investor takeinto account progress reduce expect rate return: banks’ cost equity shouldgo down.however, solvency improved, still one challenge face europeanbanks: profitability [slide 4]. the average return equity vary significantly across country –and france rank among solid euro area – average hasstagnated around 5%. this situation raise three questions, three possible factors: lowrates, non-performing loan digital transformation.the first factor, one frequently mentioned, although sometimes excess, thelow interest rate environment. insurer pension fund high level fix rateguarantees may suffer. a banks, net margin squeeze low interestrates flatten yield curve. however question need examine allangles [slide 5]. monetary policy also offset effects: lend volume pick upagain; bank book significant capital gains; cost risk fall borrowersolvency improved; cost fund include market ecb finance becomecheaper. all all, overall impact non-standard monetary policy measure bankprofitability expect modest period 2014–17. furthermore, nominal interest ratesare slightly rise since turn point august 2016, nominal rate one –not real one – matter bank profitability, well slope yield curve.the second factor put pressure profitability level non-performing loan [slide6]. this widespread issue: average npl ratio 5.4% european union ofseptember 2016, many countries, include france germany, 4%. but isa challenge seriously affect specific bank certain countries, mainly italy portugal.so challenge manageable, need actually managed: quick better.recent initiative italian authority step right direction, active involvementof european supervisory authorities.third factor: digital transformation. it true digitalisation disrupt traditionalcustomer relationship models. but also create opportunities: instance, diverse andaccessible financial services, complete customer satisfaction, great valorisation data.yet, order succeed digital transition, financial company need first place innovationat heart strategic management; second examine way transform theirbusiness models, mainly retail. obviously difficult choice need make bythe company themselves. the strategic way forward regulators, beuniform. that said, let share think you.on income side, response could twofold: diversify range service – bothproprietary via partnership – offer customers; adjust exist pricingpolicies, few flat-rate price price use. on cost side, digitaltransition involve prepare shift job skills, enhance dialogue socialpartners. moreover, call major it investment aim provide service remainaligned customer needs, reduce structural cost improve regulatory compliance. itsystems need – far simple – secure provide strongprotection cyber-risks, time flexible open interconnectivity. our duty regulator revolution obviously discourage innovation, ensure alevel play field fintechs – take account lifecycle accord “proportionalityprinciple” – still tomorrow big data platforms, gafas theirequivalents. this level play field apply capital liquidity requirements, forprudential supervision well data protection: play game, obeythe rules. 3 / 9bis central bankers' speech in addition adjustment business models, cross-border bank consolidation euro areawould also help tackle efficiency issue. the bank union provide justification andthe framework financial integration – still lag far behind american market thisrespect. cross-border consolidation sound safe basis would make bank good ableto diversify risk across euro area, channel save effectively towardsinvestments across borders.as regulators, obviously part play help finance industry adapt.we strive reduce uncertainty much possible.one source uncertainty today regulatory framework. nearly ten year crisis, ourpriority must stabilise rules. the main element basel iii package alreadybeen approve 2010–11 largely enter force. but still ongoingdiscussions regard measurement risk bank balance sheets. the objective, youknow, reduce unwarranted variability result bank across jurisdictions.and german g20 reiterate last week, completion reform must result a“significant increase overall capital requirements”. we yet reach agreement.thanks mobilisation european partners, avoid bad agreement.for come month then, objective reach good one.another source uncertainty brexit. with article 50 triggered, obviously cannotprejudge outcome future negotiations. but essential bear one principle mind:in single market, cannot separate access rules. in financial service particular,you hardly expect european passport don’t accept single market’s rules.let u clear: sadden brexit, one decide aso-called “clean brexit". but case, cherry-picking, “europe ala carte”, “rosinenpickerei”.it nearly ten year since global financial economic crisis. we come salong way, still challenge ahead u ten year come. yet challengesfor financial industry gradually change nature: could shift adapt theregulatory monetary policy environment reflect new business model strategies. in thisregard, expect strengthen economic recovery hopefully make pathsmoother. austerity – rigour – remain necessary, innovation game changer.thank attention. 4 / 9bis central

central bankers' speech benoît cœuré: independence accountability changingworldintroductory remark mr benoît cœuré, member executive board europeancentral bank, transparency international eu event "two side coin?independence accountability european central bank", brussels, 28 march 2017.* * *general considerationsthank invitation today’s event. i look forward discussion panelrepresenting wide range stakeholder views.the ecb fully share value underpin transparency international’s work, asintegrity accountability. at time many people express doubt publicinstitutions, clear principle vital legitimacy. and convincedthat great responsibility integration euro area level, much need tostrengthen economic monetary union, go hand hand great democraticaccountability.so transparency international’s work regard eu’s economic governance certainlyuseful. this ecb facilitate project invite researcher series ofmeetings senior staff. we offer opportunity comment draft report.but study recommendation entirely own transparency international, weexclusively provide factual observation abstain comment substance.before offer observation four chapter report – independence,transparency, accountability integrity – i would like make two preliminary, generalremarks:first, answer question raise title report: yes, ecbindependence accountability two side coin. the ecb give ademocratic mandate. independence ensure ecb act line itsmandate. accountability, hand, ensure ecb act line itsmandate. this measure ex post outcome – ecb indeed takedecisive action preserve price stability crisis – rely ex ante astrong accountability framework.second, ecb quite unique eu institutional context. i understand thattransparency international publish similar report european investment bankand european stability mechanism. there important difference threebodies – regard mandate purpose, also term theirinstitutional setup, governance structures, fund and, context importantly,accountability. of course, eu institution (like european parliament theeuropean commission). but also central bank and, 2014, bankingsupervisor. these specific task require dedicate governance framework consider socrucial eu legislator lay eu treaty and, regard bankingsupervision, regulation establish single supervisory mechanism (ssm).in remark i cover aspect report briefly.independencein european union, principle central bank independence quasi-constitutionalbasis. article 108 treaty establish european community state that: “neither the123 1 / 5bis central bankers' speech ecb, national central bank … shall seek take instruction community institutionsor bodies, government member state body”.looking debate around independence, also take place outside eu, itbecomes clear safeguard independence require series legalprovisions.it require explanation independence important central bank. a guardian ofprice stability euro area, ecb create foundation healthy stable europeaneconomy. independence essential respect, protect ecb temptationby government seek change monetary policy favour short-term economic gain overprice stability, pander private interest groups.it equally important correct misperceptions, stakeholder responsibility inthis respect. the ecb communicate clear condition accept credit institution ascounterparts, quality collateral, emergency liquidity assistance extend nationalcentral bank interfere monetary policy, accept security assetpurchase programme, etc. these condition transparent equal counterparties inthe euro area. therefore, ecb aim political buy in, merely clarify theconditions govern monetary policy euro area countries, need toensure stay within mandate and, thus, safeguard independence.as ecb’s current role macroeconomic adjustment programmes, enshrinedin legal framework ecb alter. we believe financial issue wherethe ecb’s advice particular relevance. if political willingness change theframework, would happy engage and, base experience, help clarify best tosupport institution safeguard independence.accountabilityindependence mean arbitrariness. the ecb give democratic mandate. it heldaccountable act line mandate, democratically legally.from democratic perspective, ecb accountable policy representation ofeu citizens. a describe report, ecb’s president participate quarterly hear ofthe committee economic monetary affair european parliament. a mep tremosai balcells know well, “dialogues de sourds”. the meps shy away fromasking critical questions. a president emphasise september 2016 hearing, ecbtakes exchange seriously.in addition regular quarterly hearings, executive board colleague i also participatein hear committee explain ecb’s reason decision specific topics.just last year, i visit european parliament twice discus proposal euro areabudgetary capacity ecb’s involvement greece.in ten days’ time ecb, every year, publish annual report thevice-president present european parliament. late year, president willalso attend plenary debate it, precede parliament adopt official positionon activities.this european parliament resolution important contribution work, summarisesthe view representative european people action policies, also thefields independence, transparency, accountability integrity. we take europeanparliament’s comment suggestion seriously.i could continue example show health relationship the456 2 / 5bis central bankers' speech european parliament ecb: govern council decision adopt principle thatincrease transparency develop ecb regulation european statistics, ecb’sreadiness discus question work engage basel committee, coursewithin confine impose confidentiality requirements. and i could mention separateaccountability channel foresee establishment ecb bank supervision, base onthe interinstitutional agreement (2013/694/eu) european parliament ecb.last week, chair ecb supervisory board european parliament presentthe ecb annual report supervisory activity 2016.of course, i leave mep tremosa balcells express parliament’s judgement therobustness accountability framework towards parliament. from ecb’sperspective, accountability framework define treaty work well, beenadapted challenge face recent year expand interaction whereand necessary.transparencytransparency crucial ecb’s work attache great importance communicatingeffectively public. transparency help people understand ecb’s monetary policy,and good public understanding, turn, make ecb’s monetary policy credible andeffective.against background, communication financial market participant deserve particularattention. i see double-edged sword. clear communication financial marketsenhances implementation transmission monetary policy, hand mayrisk central bank capture private interests, worse, disclose privilege information.and even perception risk would harmful.please allow present examples.the european central bank make significant progress matter transparency goodgovernance. this note european ombudsman, commend ecb foradopting “guiding principle external communication member executive board”and “encourage[d] lead field aspect good governance”. the ombudsman moregenerally acknowledged, present annual report 2015 europeanparliament, ecb “boosted transparency”.the guide principle provide concrete practical expression rule thatare already bind executive board members. they enshrine ecb’s approach toensuring financial market-sensitive information disclose select group avoidinggiving impression event organiser “prestige advantage” allow benefitfinancially perception exclusive contact member executive board.the guide principle also advise executive board member include, matter ofprinciple, ecb staff member bilateral meetings. these principle also beensubscribed chair ecb’s supervisory board ecb representativesto supervisory board.in addition, member govern council (including executive board members)observe “quiet period” monetary policy meetings. this mean avoid makingcomments attend meet could influence expectation monetary policydecisions seven day schedule meet issue. this also coversmeetings media, market participant outside party interest inmonetary policy matters.as probably know, executive board member – include – well chair ofthe supervisory board publish diary since november 2015. i find the7 3 / 5bis central bankers' speech diary provide comprehensive overview interaction external parties; theycover professional meet private public sector (at national andinternational level). no eu institution – include via transparency register – centralbank provide extensive information term transparency.the ecb also establish high-level forum institutional investor dialogue thebanking industry dialogue collect relevant market intelligence stakeholder atransparent way. these forum underpin publish charter set theparticipation rules; agenda meet summary also published. this make theecb’s interaction term gather information stakeholder highly transparent thepublic.since january 2015 ecb also publish regular account governingcouncil’s monetary policy discussions. they contain overview financial market, economicand monetary developments, follow summary discussion, unattributed form,on economic monetary analysis monetary policy stance. in so, aimto provide rationale behind monetary policy decision enable anyone interest toread govern council’s assessment economy within short period time thediscussion take place.integrityhowever, independence, accountability transparency enough flankedby robust integrity system. or mario draghi put address staff: strong businessculture complement strong ethical culture.an enhance ecb ethic framework applicable staff member become effective injanuary 2015, dedicate compliance governance office establish toimplement new framework, among tasks. mandatory ethic train staffmembers enhance strong ethical culture. moreover, high-level ethicscommittee establish advise govern council, executive board supervisoryboard member conduct matters.in view ecb’s ethic framework probably strict eu institution centralbank. all staff member – include executive board member – need provide list theirbank account power attorney confer third parties, facilitate regularcompliance check private financial transaction external auditor.while convince robustness ethic framework, framework must, ofcourse, regularly review international best practice. the review ourwhistleblowing regime one example regard.concluding remarkslet conclude. while certainly strive constantly improvements, i believe onehas admit ecb make tremendous effort indeed make significant progress instrengthening accountability, boost transparency enhance integritymechanisms good governance.the ecb is, always been, open balance dialogue stakeholders, include thegeneral public, strive keep date fast-evolving communication practices, suchas q&a session

australia, fx week(australia) 2017 conference, sydney, 28 march 2017.* * *today i go talk fx global code. the code track release twomonths’ time 25 may. this culmination two years’ effort, involve considerable inputfrom sizeable number foreign exchange market participants, public private. today iwill reiterate motivation work code, beinterested it, update process outline wayforward.as i hope know, phase 1 code launch may last year newyork. the code pretty easy find. it available via bank international settlements(bis) website website number foreign exchange committee (fxcs), includingthe australian foreign exchange committee (afxc) website. the text complete code willbe available place 25 may, follow public release.why work go on? a i state before, foreign exchange (fx) industry beensuffering lack trust functioning. this lack trust evident betweenparticipants market and, least importantly, public market. themarket need move toward favourable desirable location, allow participant tohave much great confidence market function appropriately.a well-functioning fx market much interest market participants. this clearlyincludes central banks, role market participant also exchangerate important channel monetary policy transmission. in globalise world, foreignexchange market one vital part financial plumbing.the code set global principle good practice fx market provide common setof guidance market, include area degree uncertainty whatsort practice acceptable, not. this help restore confidence andpromote effective function wholesale fx market.to end, one guide principle underpin work code promotea robust, fair, liquid, open transparent market. a diverse set buyer sellers, supportedby resilient infrastructure, able confidently effectively transact competitiveprices reflect available market information manner conform acceptablestandards behaviour.the work develop code commence two year ago, may 2015, bi governorscommissioned work group market committee bi (which i chair earlyjanuary year) facilitate establishment single global code conduct thewholesale fx market come mechanism promote great adherence thecode. our group comprise representative central bank major fx centres. mycolleague matt boge rba contribute enormous time effort project.this work also much public sector–private sector partnership. we ably andvigorously support work group market participants, chair david puth, ceoof cls. david’s group contain people around world buy side, includingcorporates asset managers, sell side, along trade platforms, ecns non-bank participants, draw various fxcs beyond. hugh killen westpac hasbeen representative australia david’s group. all part market been123 1 / 5bis central bankers' speech involve draft code make sure perspective hear appropriatelyreflected.there two important point worth highlighting: first, it’s single code whole industryand second, it’s global code.on first point, code supplant exist code present fxmarket, include aci model code use australia. the aci recently confirm itsintention utilise fx global code make prerequisite member commit toadherence fx global code.importantly, code cover wholesale fx industry. this code sellside. it sell side, buy side, non-bank participant platforms; breadthis across globe across whole structure industry.hence code relevant conference. the way relevant willdepend engagement market. on buy side also help give youguidance reasonably expect counterparty transact fxbusiness. what mean practice step different market participant take aligntheir activity principle code necessarily reflect size, complexity, typeand extent engagement fx market.as i mention earlier, first phase code release may 2016. it cover areassuch ethics, information sharing, aspect execution confirmation settlement. thesecond phase cover aspect execution include e-trading platforms, primebrokerage, well governance, risk management compliance.we provide market participant number opportunity comment code,in addition receive direct input market participant group lead david puth. overthe past months, draft full text code distribute marketparticipants review, principally various fxcs, also industryassociations ensure perspective appropriately reflect code. through thisprocess, quite thousand comment received.in view, text code provide best appropriate guidance could give,given sometimes wide range feedback received, particularly small number ofissues controversial market. the obvious example ‘last look’.this issue generate considerable passionate discussion. i would expect discussion tocontinue release code may code might evolve function thatdiscussion. i would like make point market participant think would preferablefor code go further, welcome go path operations. onthe hand, would desirable converse occur, namely marketparticipants practice fall short principle describe code.that said, i think good outcome process able distil point ofcontention small number (not insignificant) issues. outside small number ofcontentious areas, feedback reflective widely hold consensus. market participantshave recognise code’s aim help move fx market good place.i illustrate couple area address first phase code,which already public domain. one example around information sharing, wheremany market participant highlight unsure information convey tocounterparties market participants. while clear (or least be) thatdisclosing detail client’s order book counterparty acceptable, marketparticipants note much le clarity around level aggregation, say, isnecessary order convey market colour appropriately.4 2 / 5bis central bankers' speech a result, appear market participant conservative sharinginformation, implication effective function market. this isnotwithstanding guidance provide area global preamble put globalfxcs, march 2015. the global code take material global preamble flesh itout bite more, include example is, isn’t, appropriate communication,and why.similarly, diverse opinion around appropriate behaviour term oforder handling. there public instance inappropriate behaviour aroundorder handle come light recent years. the market seek great guidance asto principle followed, include different standard may apply dependingon whether intermediary function principal agent.this one area adequately cover pre-existing code various fxcshad endorse fx market. it area provide sought-after guidance.but write procedure manual order handling. rather articulatingprinciples need take account. individual firm may take principle andreflect procedure manual. our aim articulate principle providemarket participant framework think handle stop-loss orders.the emphasis much word ‘think’. the global code provide theanswers questions, help ask right questions.adherence codealongside draft code, also devote considerable time effort thinkingabout ensure widespread adoption code market participants. clearly, hasbeen issue various exist code place number marketsover many years. it evident ignore occasion, wilfully otherwise.one central aim draft code principles-based rather rules-based. there number reason but, me, important reason themore prescriptive code is, easy get around. rule easy arbitrage thanprinciples. moreover, prescriptive precise code, le people willthink doing. if it’s principles-based le prescriptive then, i said,market participant think whether action consistent theprinciples code.so, work industry produce principles-based code rather set ofprescriptive regulatory standards. it impose legal regulatory obligation marketparticipants, supplant exist regulatory standard expectations. but expectthe principle code understand adopt across entire fx market.our approach adherence number dimensions. we lay overall approach toadherence code new york may last year. we provide comprehensivedescription suite mechanism support adherence alongside release codein may.one critical dimension market-based adherence mechanisms. an important element ofdiscipline come market work closely market participantson this. the adherence voluntary code come firm judge theirinterest take practical step ensure code embed practices. suchpractical step would include train staff put appropriate policy andprocedures.we provide draft statement commitment firm publicly demonstrate theiradherence code. one reason public demonstration firm likely to56 3 / 5bis central bankers' speech adhere code believe peer too. that is, important sourceof pressure adhere come market participants. without blame forwhat occurred, scrutiny counterparties fx transaction beingexecuted may help reduce incidence severity market abuse thatoccurred past. one reason lack scrutiny fx transaction weresometimes regard ancillary core business, notwithstanding potential impact onreturns. this attitude seem decline, though still persists.ultimately success code promote integrity restore confidence thewholesale fx market lie hand participants.another aspect market-based adherence come fxcs. the global fxcs issue ajoint statement support launch code new york well state intentionto make adherence code likely requirement fxc membership. in australia, acommitment adhere code requirement membership afxc. thatwould ensure code embed core fx market, also important itextends beyond that, is, least, awareness across marketparticipants.a second dimension adherence bi central bank signal commitmentby announce follow code, expect theircounterparties too. to end, rba long transact fx market withthose don’t commit adhere code.a third dimension adherence talk regulator various jurisdiction asto might use code monitor market conduct. in australia, securitiesregulator, asic, supportive development code consider itmight utilise code market surveillance. in recent enforceable undertake againstsome local market participants, asic refer explicitly code. asic ‘encouragesmarket participant adhere high standard market practice, include set theglobal code’. in uk, financial conduct authority (fca) consider mightincorporate code senior manager regime there.given provide full text code market may, aperiod time market participant adjust practice necessary line withthe principle code. hopefully much time require this. this period oftime might potentially short six months, twelve month vastmajority market participants. how much effort might require part depend thenature extent engagement fx market. in draft code, alwayskept principle

interest rate bound. an institutional set-up design fight inflation react unprecedented situation characterise absence inflationary pressures. in view, design feature – asymmetric response deviation ecb’s target – ought reviewed. on fiscal front, compliance exist governance framework fall far short original expectations. initiative strengthen rule relate institutional framework, establishment national fiscal council european fiscal board helpful. but probably insufficient. 3 it contention resolve problem relate fiscal governance euro area solely adjust rule strengthen institutional set-up. the five president’s report move direction single fiscal policy, euro area wide budget large enough contain in-built automatic stabilise mechanism allow transfer resource region euro area relatively well region hit adverse shocks. but abide exist rule weak, seem even le appetite integration lines. on another view, one could recognise event show fiscal policy remain vital shock absorber national level that, therefore, may necessary increase, rather reduce, flexibility conduct fiscal policy. give objective common fiscal policy common treasury remain politically unrealisable, one need explore interim solution which, without create risk moral hazard, introduce element solidarity emu member go beyond bail-outs austerity. in end longevity monetary union member move different economic tempo sometimes even different directions. another aspect emu governance strengthen economic part emu. this require structural reform aim enhance potential growth, reduce structural unemployment increase national economies’ resistance shocks. while many euro area country undertake wave reform crisis, today, across much area reform stalled. this uniform picture. malta enjoy robust economic growth despite regional headwinds, largely result reform implement recent year stimulate development new area economic activity increase labour participation. malta also take full advantage membership eu adoption single currency. resilience shock also build deep economic integration. indeed, five presidents’ report argues, financial integration help share risk across emu member countries. the completion bank union, strengthen european bank sector, key objective regard. in area, success far partial. the single supervisory mechanism involve ecb via supervisory board national supervisory authority running, follow comprehensive health check euro area banks. the single resolution mechanism also operational fund accord plan. a regard third pillar bank union, european deposit insurance scheme (edis), negotiation still way. we believe edis increase confidence bank across euro area. in sum, still far complete step envisage first phase five presidents’ roadmap. achieve maintain responsible fiscal policy national euro area level still 4 seem beyond grasp certain element bank union place, need done. overall, timetable ambitious. we must also realistic admit integration run headwind popular discontent integration liberalisation. we need, therefore open doing, fully engage citizen build case strong emu enjoy broad popular consensus rather impose above. open speech m

relationship, require staff code conduct. for question whether “get it”, do. we know honest mistake also serious mistake – one compound fact charlotte hogg oversee development new code. we clear upfront must consequence bank. our minimum response would obviously would expect see firm supervise. let’s absolutely clear baseline. in analogous situation private sector, expect:  evidence firm take matter seriously;  proportionate consequence individual, include form disciplinary warn possibly impact remuneration;  a wide review lesson learn evidence systemic problem. 9 see page 16,

bank england governor cannot receive one, waive salary increase year.  court reassign coo responsibilities.  court reconfigured report line internal structure order improve governance, compliance disciplinary processes, include reassign smr responsibility implement code.  and, basis one incident, independent director court initiate widespread review draw expertise independent evaluation office, internal audit national audit office. it result make public. in words, consistent high standards, bank plan tough response would expect private sector, one that, judgement, still proportionate honest mistake freely transparently admitted. the treasury select committee (tsc) reach judgement, turn trigger charlotte hogg’s decision resign.12 i fully respect tsc’s judgement decision. i want speak this, continue debate right wrong case, instead highlight lesson bank industry might draw it. in particular, i want dispel urban myth develop around events. while prudential regulation authority (pra) impose financial penalty suspension smr, run regulate entity disproportionate “one strike out” regime honest mistake. neither explicitly implicitly. not i governor, ceo pra, head fca. not supervisor pra. the smr clear responsibilities, proportionate consequences, develop culture openness accountability. proportionate mean take account severity incident, track record individual firm, well firm’s wide response. an honest mistake freely admit firm take prompt remedial action fire offence. and here’s point: must let recent event inadvertently tighten perceive standard industry could

london school economics 20 march 2017 all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 2 2 by common assent, economist agree much. i lose count number joke economist whose punchline end “and still couldn’t reach conclusion”. that harry s truman, president unite states, famously yearn one-handed economist. whether critique fair, issue i discus tonight one economist agree: productivity matters. at point, customary wheel following, rather over-used, paul krugman quote: “productivity isn’t everything, long run almost everything.” despite over-use, quote one important virtue, something take lightly post-fact, post-truth world: empirically verifiable appear factually accurate. let illustrate simple example. since 1850 uk live standards, measure gdp per head, rise roughly 20-fold, huge gain. how much gain attribute high productivity? well, productivity flat-lined period, uk live standard would doubled. or, put differently, absence productivity growth, uk live standard would order magnitude low today, stick late-victorian levels. a refine way reach conclusion decompose growth contribution input production process – labour capital – contribution improvement efficiency input use – so-called total factor productivity (tfp). chart 1 uk since industrial revolution. this suggest movement tfp account lion’s share growth variation live standard since least mid-18th century. say productivity matter say understand determinants. the past year serve underscore partial economists’ understand productivity remains. a one illustration, chart 2 plot successive forecast bank england uk productivity growth since 2008, chart 3 show imf forecast productivity across advance economy period. these chart point string material serially-correlated forecast error recent years. productivity growth consistently underperform relative expectations, since least global financial crisis. this tale productivity disappointment, forecast performance, extensively debate analyse recent years. some call “productivity puzzle”.1 with year passes, new turn point productivity fail materialise, mystery deepened. this lead conjecture world may enter new epoch sub-par productivity growth, era secular stagnation.2 various possible cause stagnation posited, include adverse demographic trend diminish rate innovation.3 the secular stagnation hypothesis strike gloomy implication future growth live standards. 1 for example, barnett et al (2014), bryson et al (2014) weale (2014) 2 for example, gordon (2014) summer (2013). 3 gordon (2014). all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 3 3 it striking, too, starkness contrast second topical hypothesis. this posit may cusp second machine age fourth industrial revolution, era secular innovation.4 this might arise rise robots, artificial intelligence, big data, internet thing like. because impact future live standards, winner secular struggle – stagnation versus innovation – carry enormous societal implications. a second issue, every bite topical important, concern distribution gain live standards. specifically, mount concern number year rise level within-country inequality across number countries.5 candidate explanation widen dispersion fortune include fail educational system, impact technology globalisation, anti-competitive practice weakness corporate governance.6 both great debate – innovation versus stagnation, widen dispersion income opportunity across society – causative link productivity. a household’s income depend largely wage wage depend, turn, productivity company household work. so fall productivity growth among firms, widen dispersion productivity across firms, could theory contribute stagnant household income widen dispersion incomes. to clear front, i simple explanation, much le oven-ready solution, productivity puzzles. my aim modest – draw together available data productivity shed light puzzles. specifically, i look historical data uk, international data cross-section country sectoral firm-specific data uk companies. this empirical evidence suggest long tail country company low, slow productivity growth. these productivity laggard unable keep-up, much le catch-up, frontier country companies.7 at time, upper tail company country maintain high rise level productivity. these productivity leader pull ever-further away low tail. or, put differently, rate technological diffusion leader laggard slowed, perhaps even stalled, recently. this empirical pattern shed light two great macro-economic debates. it help explain might see co-existence secular innovation (among leaders) stagnation (among laggards). it help account fall productivity growth rate – namely, slow rate diffusion new innovation long low tail companies. and help explain widen dispersion households’ incomes, mirror-image widen productivity difference across firms. 4 for example, brynjolfsson mcafee (2011, 2014). 5 for example, piketty (2014), milanovic (2016). 6 stiglitz (2016). 7 this key theme recent work oecd, example andrew et al (2015). all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 4 4 this empirical prognosis also help devise policy measure tackle productivity problems. even marginal improvement productivity among long tail low-productivity company – or, equivalently, speed rate technological diffusion company – could make significant inroad productivity puzzle. i discus possible policy end. explain productivity puzzle before dive data, helpful set candidate explanation use explain productivity puzzle, uk internationally. these hypothesis include: (a) mismeasurement there fairly widespread perception productivity puzzle may, least part, statistical mirage. it certainly seem likely official statistic underestimate economic activity some, perhaps significant, degree potential productivity gains.8 for example, recent review conclude productivity growth uk might under-estimated around 0.5 percentage point per year, result failure fully capture element digital economy.9 that said, study also find mismeasurement alone unlikely account majority productivity puzzle, whether uk internationally.10 many mismeasurement problem already exist long productivity start slowing. these problem would need increase dramatically – probably unrealistically – explain fully productivity slowdown. consistent that, slowdown productivity appear largely unrelated penetration information technology across sector countries.11 (b) crisis-related scar there plenty evidence suggest financial crisis permanent, certainly persistent, scar effect output productivity economies.12 this time’s crisis, large least generation, unlikely buck historical trend. there several channel financial crisis might permanently damage corporate sector productivity. first, collapse credit availability likely constrict finance new exist company hence constrain investment plans. it may hit particularly hard young companies, without access alternative source finance, productivity growth often fastest. empirical evidence 8 for example, feldstein (2016), baily montalbano (2016). 9 bean (2016) discus potential mechanism underestimation gdp. 10 syverson (2016), byrne et al (2016). 11 syverson (2016). 12 for example, reinhart rogoff (2009), oulton sebastiá-barriel (2013). all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 5 5 crisis suggest channel potent, uk internationally.13 a credit condition ease recently, however, become le compel explanation persist productivity problems. a second financial channel crisis may affect firms’ investment asset prices. specifically, many small firm reliant property collateral back loans. a fall property price tighten collateral constraint credit conditions. recent bank england research suggest may potent crisis propagation channel small business crisis.14 a asset price recovered, however, channel cannot explain persist productivity puzzle. a third channel crisis might slow productivity hind resource reallocation firm across sectors.15 flow capital labour company one key channel technology idea diffused.16 since crisis, rate labour market churn company low dispersion rate return across sector high.17 both consistent low rate factor reallocation contribute low productivity. (c) forbearance monetary policy some contend productivity may hold back action authorities, particular regulatory forbearance accommodative monetary policies. by support low-productivity company would otherwise failed, policy action may prevent “creative destruction” firms.18 certainly, level company liquidation firm exit remain low many country since financial crisis, probably low would expect give path gdp. a number study consider evidence impact regulatory monetary policy firm death productivity.19 for instance, arrowsmith et al (2013) examine prevalence bank forbearance across small medium-sized enterprise (sme) sector, find effect small. the study find potentially large impact monetary policy company failure productivity.20 that said, important note employment also high result loose monetary policy, potentially small crisis-related scar effect labour markets. 13 chodorow-reich (2014), greenstone ma (2012) edgerton (2012) us, amiti weinstein (2013) japan, paravisini et al

behind productivity growth past two century may continue pace future.21 one argument current wave innovation, ground ict, potential past innovations.22 a second ict revolution already quite mature future progress likely slower.23 a third that, world population expect peak century, might pace innovation.24 these argument contentious subject lively debate.25 some argue ict revolution already great impact productivity steam engine.26 others argue ict revolution still infancy vast potential disruptive innovation.27 and third contend many emerge technology potential revolutionise economy, robotics, artificial intelligence, big data human genome.28 (e) diffusion dynamic an alternative way account slow productivity growth arises, slow rate innovation, slow rate diffusion innovation company countries.29 for example, recent empirical work oecd highlight possibility technological diffusion engine slowed, even stalled, recent period, widen dispersion fortune company operate technological frontier operate inside frontier.30 there number possible explanation phenomenon. stifle competition certain sector certain product may prevent trickle-down innovation.31 for example, restriction patent intellectual property (ip) might restrict new entrant retard replication. a relate hypothesis that, today’s globalise markets, network economy scale scope potent, generate natural monopoly single small set player dominate market share.32 a third hypothesis emergence long tail non-frontier companies, fail keep pace innovation, result management failings. for example, nicholas bloom john van reenen show weakness management process practice go long way towards explain long 21 gordon (2012) cowen (2011). 22 gordon (2012). 23 decker et al (2016) argue fall entrepreneurship high tech sector recent decades. 24 gordon (2014). jones romer (2010). 25 see tuuli batten (2015) summary debate. 26 craft (2004). 27 brynjolfsson mcafee (2011). 28 mokyr (2014a 2014b) baily et al

productivity manufacture companies.33 these poor practice pronounce sector competition weak family-owned firm management control rest eldest son. the data present not, main, allow direct empirical test compete hypotheses. many hypothesis are, case, complementary explanations. the data do, however, lend great weight some, le other, explanation account productivity puzzle. historical productivity trend let start place uk’s recent productivity performance broad historical context. that useful determine unusual recent period sub-par productivity performance really is. since industrial revolution, gdp per caput uk rise almost without interruption, annual average rate 1.2% per year. in lockstep, near-monotonic rise uk productivity. uk tfp growth since 1750 average 0.8% per year. since industrial revolution, gdp per caput double roughly every 65 year productivity roughly every 85 years. the implication live standard profound. each generation has, since industrial revolution, around 25% good parents. this story secular improvement live standards. it also story secular innovation, two typically go hand hand. at least recent centuries, secular stagnation live standard innovation simply fit historical facts. this not, however, whole story. for longer-term perspective, chart 4 show estimate uk tfp back 1 ad, alongside gdp per head. the measurement problem gdp productivity probably acute now. nonetheless, “hockey-stick” profile gdp tfp striking, right similarity. over long haul, gdp tfp move lockstep. for many century prior industrial revolution, productivity gdp growth uk average around 0.01% per year. each generation around 0.3% good parent – scarcely noticeable improvement. secular stagnation live standard innovation persist many centuries. history suggest secular innovation secular stagnation have, different times, norm. although productivity growth pick since industrial revolution, still subject significant twist turns. chart 5 plot uk labour market productivity since 1760, decompose contribution additional capital per worker (“capital deepening”) tfp. both fluctuate significantly make substantial contribution uk productivity growth time. 33 bloom van reenen (2007). all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 8 8 chart 6 look closely historical evolution uk tfp growth. trend tfp far constant, decadal span productivity average little zero others average close 2%. the latter episode typically associate period rapid technological change, three industrial revolution mid-18th, mid-19th mid-20th centuries. in case, significant lag arrival new technology impact productivity. rate technological diffusion relatively slow sedate. this typically felt reflect time take new technology find widespread use become general purpose technology (gpts).34 after first industrial revolution, take around 70-100 year technological diffusion occur, gpts emerge tfp live standard rise.35 subsequent industrial revolution also see lag emergence new technology impact productivity. but evidence diffusion lag may shortened. comin mestieri (2014) estimate diffusion lag industrial revolution late 19th 20th century 20-30 years, roughly third first industrial revolution. this may reflect increase flow labour, capital, idea information firms, regions, sector countries. table 1 look average rate uk tfp growth past 2000 years. it tell tale long wave productivity stagnation innovation. the historical data reject either hypothesis. table 1 also put historical perspective uk’s recent productivity slowdown. for past decade, average productivity growth negative. this unusual, unique, historically. you would go right back 18th century see similarly lengthy period stagnant productivity. global productivity trend if uk productivity pattern unusual relative past, unusual relative countries? to ass that, i draw panel around 116 countries, advance emerging, go back 1950, use data penn world tables.36 chart 7 plot average tfp growth across whole sample countries, chart 8 separately advance emerge economies. several interest feature emerge. first, slowdown productivity growth clearly global phenomenon, uk-specific one. from 1950 1970, median global productivity growth average 1.9% per year. since 1980, average 0.3% per year. whatever drive productivity puzzle, global rather local roots. 34 helpman et al (1998). 35 comin mestieri (2014). 36 feenstra et al (2015). all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 9 9 second, global productivity slowdown clearly recent phenomenon. it appear start many advance country 1970s.37 certainly, productivity puzzle something emerge since global financial crisis, though seem crisis amplify pre-existing trends. explanation productivity puzzle base crisis-related scar likely be, best, partial. third, productivity slowdown experience advance emerge economies. the slowdown median productivity growth 1970s among advance emerge market economy around 1¾ percentage point (chart 8). indeed, look country-specific trends, strike generalise productivity slowdown (chart 9). fourth, one way understand global productivity slowdown come decompose change rate innovation among country operate productivity frontier change rate diffusion frontier non-frontier countries. growth theory would predict that, time, technological diffusion lead catch-up frontier non-frontier countries.38 and great distance frontier, fast rate catch-up likely be. so explain 1¾ percentage point slowdown global productivity growth since 1970s – slow innovation frontier slow diffusion periphery? if frontier country take unite states, slow innovation account small fraction global slowing, least u 20% weight world gdp. in words, lion’s share slow global productivity result slow diffusion innovation frontier non-frontier countries. to illustrate that, chart 10 plot distribution level productivity across country set sample periods, productivity measure relative frontier country (the unite states) index one. compare distribution 1950s 1970s, clear rightward shift. cross-country productivity convergence catch-up underway, classical growth model would suggest. in recent decades, however, pattern changed. compare 1970s 1990s, small leftward shift probability mass. and period since global financial crisis, leftward shift distribution widen range. today, non-frontier country far technological frontier 1950s. another way illustrate point look difference productivity frontier periphery country time (chart 11). in decade immediately follow second world war, classical growth model operate effectively, catch-up productivity underway fast rate among emerge market country furthest travel frontier. 37 gordon (2014). 38 barro sala-i-martin (1992) rodrik (2011). all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 10 10 since 1980s, however, convergence process appear stalled, perhaps even go reverse, advance emerge economies. the gap frontier fail close and, particular emerge market countries, widened. classical growth dynamic appear reason stop operating, gap frontier widen great distance it. it possible quantify slow convergence use similar approach use measure output convergence cross-country growth literature.39 specifically, country’s productivity growth link convergence parameter productivity gap frontier country. this parameter estimate econometrically track time.40 chart 12 show time-series convergence coefficient estimate use roll regression. in 1980s, coefficient average 0.8. that say, every 10 per cent productivity gap relative frontier country resulted, average, productivity growth 0.8 percentage point high frontier country. by 2000, convergence coefficient roughly halved. by end sample, coefficient statistically insignificant zero. convergence slow stalled. one key determinant international technology transfer find cross-border flow good services, people money capital.41 while wax wan historically, tend rise rapidly since middle 20th century. other thing equal, would expect increase speed diffusion innovation across country period. in practice, opposite appear occurred. take face value, pattern strike puzzling. not sit oddly classical growth theory. they also odds evidence history, rate technological diffusion rise rather fall time, secular trend international flow factor production. at time would expect fire cylinders, technological diffusion engine globally misfiring. this add productivity puzzle. sectoral productivity trend some insight puzzle come look productivity data granular detail.42 we start consider sectoral pattern productivity among uk companies. sectoral shift economy could plausibly account fall productivity growth. there secular shift time away manufacture towards services, employment share 39 rodrik (2011). 40 base follow equation: 𝑃𝑖𝑡−𝑃𝑓𝑡= 𝑎𝑖+ 𝑏𝑖∗ 𝐺𝐴𝑃𝑖 𝑃𝑖𝑡 growth tfp country year t, pft growth tfp frontier country (us) year t, gapi gap level tfp country u percentage, ai constant capture average pace convergence bi capture much speed convergence depend tfp gap. 41 for example, hoekman et al (2004), stoyanov zubanov (2012) newman et al (2015). 42 see mccafferty (2014) discussion productivity sectoral perspective. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 11 11 manufacture fall 17% 7% since 1990. because productivity growth manufacture high services, shift could plausibly account fall aggregate productivity growth. even correct compositional effect, however, slowdown uk productivity growth remains. chart 13 look evolution different uk sectors’ productivity, table 2 look contribution various sector uk productivity growth decade either side global financial crisis. pre-crisis, strong rise measure productivity manufacturing, information communication financial services, experience annual growth 4%. but growth confine sectors, virtually sector make positive contribution productivity growth. in period since crisis, pre-crisis trend change dramatically. virtually every sector see productivity flat-line. the contribution sector productivity growth fall tightly bunch around zero (table 2).43 whatever cause uk productivity growth fall, do generalised, cross-sector basis. it sometimes assert that, without collapse financial service output associate financial crisis, uk’s productivity performance would hold up. it certainly true financial sector productivity probably over-stated run-up crisis.44 nonetheless, subsequent sharp fall financial service productivity plainly whole story. of 1.7 percentage point fall uk’s productivity growth since 2008, le third account financial service (table 2). one sectoral story could account generalise slow reduce rate factor reallocation sectors.45 consistent hypothesis, dispersion productivity across industry increase significantly last 40 years. and variance sectoral productivity gaps, relative pre-crisis trends, also increase sharply crisis (chart 14). nonetheless, pickup dispersion productivity across sector dwarf increase productivity dispersion within sector (chart 15). this suggest obstacle movement resource within economy important within sector across them. with mind, firm-by-firm data turn. firm-level productivity trend a granular lens still come look firm-by-firm productivity data. the oecd recently undertake extensive analysis use company-level data ass global productivity patterns.46 we draw two datasets uk prospectively shed light firm-level trends. 43 see billet schneider (2016) interactive tool examine sectoral productivity trends. 44 haldane et al (2010). 45 bank england (2016), barnett et al (2014). all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 12 12 the first base uk office national statistic (ons) annual business survey employment surveys.47 the ons combine survey form annual respondent database (ardx). the sample cover around 40,000 company per year, account around 80% uk gdp. the data cover period 2002 2014. this survey stratify match uk population company broadly representative aggregate uk trends. the second bureau van dijk (bvd) fame database, compile uk company accounts. whereas large firm require submit full annual accounts, exemption small firms. so sample smaller, around 20,000 firm per year, bias towards large firms. however, contain detail data firm-level characteristic useful explore determinant productivity. these data enable u examine distribution productivity across firms. chart 16a plot distribution 2014, base ons data.48 it wide elongated, long, thin upper tail high-productivity firm short, fat low tail low-productivity firms. this shape mean modal productivity among uk company around 50% low mean productivity.49 one interest question distribution evolve time. chart 17 look different percentile firm-level productivity distribution time, level term index 2002=100. there widen dispersion distribution productivity across company time. in particular, strike widen divergence frontier firm (say, 99th percentile firms) long tail non-frontier companies. if define frontier firm top 5% firm productivity performance, line oecd, clear widen blue water frontier laggard company (chart 18). in arithmetic terms, non-frontier company largely explain flat-lining productivity recent year (chart 19). these dynamic cast secular innovation versus stagnation debate interest light. the distribution uk companies’ productivity suggest force operating, albeit different point distribution – innovation upper tail, stagnation low one. widen productivity dispersion mean secular innovation stagnation complementary, competing, hypotheses. for relatively small cohort frontier companies, secular innovation clearly evident, high rapidly-rising level productivity. for example, around 1% uk firm see average productivity growth around 6% per year. this pose serious challenge notion stall innovation 46 for example, andrew et al (2015). 47 this work contain statistical data ons crown copyright. the use ons statistical data work imply endorsement ons relation interpretation analysis statistical data. this work us research datasets may exactly reproduce national statistic aggregates. 48 the bvd data deliver similarly-shaped distribution. 49 other author find long tail low-productivity company uk include bloom van reenen (2007). all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 13 13 key driver productivity slowdown. at time, large cohort non-frontier company secular stagnation evident, low flat-lining level productivity. for example, around one-third uk company see rise productivity throughout century. this long tail. a second implication results, consistent cross-country evidence, rate technological diffusion frontier non-frontier company appear slowed. it stall diffusion, rather stifle innovation, account uk’s productivity puzzle. these pattern unique uk. they share number country internationally. that lead oecd conclude technological diffusion engine among company appear broken.50 a comparison uk advance country suggest degree dispersion productivity performance large uk, dispersion widen uk, countries. the dispersion service sector productivity 50% high uk advance economy (chart 20a). it also widen materially uk. even world long lengthen tail low-productivity companies, uk strike outlier. one potential explanation long tail uk company elsewhere poor management practices. use database develop bloom van reenen (2007), plot normalise distribution management skill subset uk firms.51 this suggest (a lack of) management quality plausible candidate explanation uk’s long tail companies, bloom van reenen find (chart 21). look quantitatively, statistically significant link quality firms’ management process practice productivity. and effect large. a one standard deviation improvement quality management raise productivity by, average, around 10%. this suggest potentially high return policy improve quality management within companies. decompose distribution we go uncover characteristic company upper low tails. might simply reflect sharp regional difference productivity, frontier company cluster region laggard others? might simply reflect sectors, manufacturing, generate high level productivity sit frontier others, services, occupy low tail? chart 22a 22f look different cut data accord to: (a) uk region company based; (b) sector company operates; (c) whether company export overseas; (d) whether company foreign-owned; (e) whether company introduce new product process precede three years; (f) size firm; (g) company’s leverage. 50 andrew et al (2015). 51 with thank john van reenen make data available us. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 14 14 begin regional picture, well-known sharp difference average productivity across uk regions.52 for example, uk’s high productivity region (london) around 75% productive low (the north east). nonetheless, look regional distribution productivity, similarity strike difference (chart 22a). every region long, thin upper tail frontier company short, fat low tail laggard firms. it true, matter arithmetic, upper tail frontier company somewhat larger, low tail laggard shorter, london in, say, north east. but key point every region plenty type firm. regional difference main factor explain uk’s long tail firm tail long uk elsewhere. second, true, large, move region sectors. there reasonably mark difference average level productivity across sector. for example, manufacture average around 35% productive construction. nonetheless, difference dwarf variation within sector (chart 22b). each long, thin upper tail short, fat low tail. whatever drive slow rate technological diffusion, sector-specific technology it. third, look external-facing profile firms, begin uncover important difference (chart 22c d). firm export systematically high level productivity domestically-oriented firms, average around third. the true, even dramatically, foreign-owned firms. their average productivity twice domestically-oriented firms. this altogether surprising. firm export likely expose global competition many integrate global supply chains. this increase incentive boost efficiency match international best practices.53 the self-same force likely play among foreign-owned firms. the productivity benefit external-facing firm bring underscore importance openness trade foreign direct investment generate rise productivity live standard time. we quantify benefit look detail relationship firms’ productivity export share (chart 23). there positive statistically-significant relationship. every 10 percentage point increase company’s export share turnover is, average, associate 3% increase productivity. while causation could operate either direction, illustrate productivity benefit corporate sector open trade expose external competition innovation. chart 22e classify firm accord spend new product processes. the difference especially surprising, average productivity around 20% high among firm invest new 52 for example, haldane (2016). 53 newman et al (2015). all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 15 15 product processes. nonetheless striking, perhaps surprising, difference larger. clearly, explain productivity difference across companies. firm size appear matter somewhat productivity (chart 22f). for example, small firm (with few 50 employees) picture nuanced one. in general, average level productivity materially low large firms, average around 7% lower. there is, particular, large low tail small company low, even negative, level productivity. nonetheless, small company inhabit high-productivity, upper tail. moreover, small company tend exhibit fast rate productivity growth large firms, even low base. table 3 look average productivity growth rate among firm different size. small firm high average growth rates, great dispersion growth rates, large ones. finally, come companies’ leverage, picture also nuanced one.54 high leverage characteristic firm two distinct productivity profile (chart 22g). very low-productivity firm tend high leverage profits, repayment capacity investment low. but high leverage also characterise high-productivity firms, whose profits, borrow investment high. these pattern provide explanation damage impact crisis productivity growth. the absence credit may affect disproportionately high leverage, high productivity company operate upper tail. the distribution debt also important gauge impact monetary policy regulatory forbearance may low tail companies, i turn. the role monetary policy these distributional data enable u look closely low tail company potentially protect failure since global financial crisis regulatory forbearance accommodative monetary policies. chart 16b plot low tail three dates, pre-crisis (2002), mid-crisis (2008) post-crisis (2014). unsurprisingly, crisis fatten low tail. since crisis, however, tail shrink again. the tail low-productivity company today is, anything, small pre-crisis. on face it, easy square (regulatory monetary) policy significantly damage impact aggregate productivity keep alive large tail low-productivity companies. however, distribution cannot identify role monetary policy play influence companies’ fortunes. to gauge that, need undertake counter-factual exercise. specifically, 54 bahaj, foulis, gal pinter (2016). all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 16 16 consider simple scenario bank rate hold 4.25% rather 0.25%. what impact would companies’ solvency hence aggregate productivity? with data debts, interest payment profits, simulate interest cover ratio company sample – say, profit interest divide interest pay (chart 24). and make assumption level interest cover ratio company force default, simulate different interest rate path might affect solvency firm hence aggregate productivity. for purpose experiment, assume default threshold interest cover ratio one. that say, assume company cannot cover interest payment profit fails. different assumption clearly possible. the effect high interest rate shift distribution companies’ interest cover ratio left, number lie solvency threshold. in simulation, extra 10% company go bankrupt. this would translate immediate loss around 1½ million job – significant macro-economic cost. nonetheless, also prospectively productivity benefits. the scale benefit depend productivity characteristic firm go bust specifically level debt. a chart 25 shows, u-shaped relationship firms’ productivity debt, high-productivity (“gazelles”) low-productivity (“zombie”) company high debt ratios. high interest rate hit type company net effect productivity empirical question. if assume firm solvency threshold, firm go bust zombie gazelle – creative destruction destructive destruction (chart 24c). nonetheless, positive impact high interest rate aggregate productivity significantly temper bankruptcy high-leverage, high-productivity companies. the overall effect high interest rate simulation boost level productivity around 1 2% relative baseline. this significant productivity gain. at time, account majority productivity shortfall since crisis. moreover, come hefty employment cost. should monetary policymakers sacrifice 1 ½ million job sake extra 1 2% productivity? hand heart, i tell one would knowingly do so. of course, experiment illustrative base number simplify assumptions. for example, assume adverse effect output firm go bust nonetheless find cashflows squeezed. this would tend raise output employment cost high interest rate make term trade productivity improvement le favourable still. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 17 17 act opposite direction, gazelle firm may able borrow avoid bankruptcy event high interest rate – solvency threshold might high zombie companies. if assume instead lowest-productivity firm go bust, boost productivity around 3% (chart 24d). this material, would still need weigh significant output employment cost. the dispersion productivity wage a final use distributional data put analyse whether rise dispersion productivity among firm mirror rise dispersion wage among households. have productivity difference contributor rise income inequalities? this subject number recent empirical studies, tend find productivity significant factor.55 a useful start point distribution wage across panel firm (chart 26). there evidence widen dispersion wage across company time. the pattern broadly mirror productivity, wage among top 1% company rising, except immediately financial crisis. at time, pay largely stagnate among many three-quarters firm distribution. by itself, tell u closely firm-level pay productivity correlate contribution productivity may play widen dispersion wages.56 while establish literature aggregate relationship productivity wages, relationship firms’ productivity average pay level le certain. nevertheless, look distribution pay productivity, three point stand (chart 27). first, labour productivity explain around 60% variation average pay across firms, control firm characteristics. on average, firm 1% high productivity 0.2% high pay. and firm 1 percentage point fast productivity growth 0.5 percentage point fast wage growth (table 4). productivity dispersion across company important, mean only, driver wage dispersion across households. second, distribution pay materially narrow productivity. the reason significant part firm-specific variation productivity absorb firm profit reflect prices. the reason firms’ profit price absorb significant part firm-specific variation productivity. many worker productive tail firm underpay relative average productivity, result frontier firm make large profit share. the opposite case end productivity distribution. 55 for example, furman orszag (2016) 56 there time series evidence suggest strong historical relationship aggregate productivity real wages. for example, castle hendry, blundell et al (2013) disney et al (2013). all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 18 18 this analysis focus difference pay across firms. but pay within firms?57 we examine track difference average pay company pay high pay director. chart 28 plot median across firm series time, chart 29 compare variance series well gap average pay high pay director. since 1998, variance average pay director pay increase across firms, although fall notably since financial crisis. the median gap average pay director pay follow similar pattern. although data far perfect suggest that, within-firm pay differential account increase dispersion pay across households, across-firm variation make large contribution. tackle productivity puzzle there shortage public policy idea recent year boost productivity growth. report imf oecd suggest measure range increase infrastructure spend improve education train programmes.58 early year, uk government issue green paper set various pillar support productivity.59 and, recently, lse growth commission produce second report measure boost uk productivity.60 in generic terms, policy measure fall three categories. first, measure support companies, irrespective sector, region characteristic. for example, last year’s autumn statement provide additional financial support uk infrastructure spending, budget couple week ago uk government announce plan increase support technical skills. second, measure support technological innovation – creation growth frontier firms. one potentially important micro-economic measure support innovation great recognition importance companies’ intangible assets, intellectual property (ip). these constitute increase fraction companies’ total assets, measure value consistent coherent way tangible asset plant machinery. this real cost company concerned. it mean asset often value fully investor lenders. this raise cost capital firm sub-optimally high level – market failure. remedy market failure, ensure intangible asset consistently coherently valued, important company grow reach full potential.61 57 for example, song et al (2015) find virtually rise earn dispersion worker account increase dispersion across average wage pay different firms. 58 andrew et al (2015) dabla-norris et al (2015). 59 hm government (2013). 60 aghion et al (2017). 61 big innovation centre (2017b). all speech

important proposal re-purposing uk company support long-term investment productivity.62 the government recently initiate patient capital review explore best support finance innovative company scale-up.63 a third category policy measure focus fortunes, innovative frontier companies, long tail low-productivity non-frontier firms. these company tend focus somewhat le historically. indeed, large number disparate characteristic may one reason case. yet give scale, return modest improvement firm could dramatic. a think experiment, imagine productivity growth second, third fourth quartile distribution uk firms’ productivity could boost match productivity quartile above. that sound ambitious achievable. arithmetically, would deliver boost aggregate uk productivity around 13%, take uk within 90-95% german french level productivity respectively. the policy question effect improvements. one idea offer real potential come productivity commission chair sir charlie mayfield.64 this start assumption long tail companies, many unaware fact. for reason car-owners believe above-average drivers, company might well believe above-average level productivity. in fact, know company below-average level productivity large fraction see productivity improvement several decades. the mayfield commission aim create app enable company measure productivity benchmark company operate similar sector regions. by shin light companies’ relative performance, aim would serve catalyst remedial action company management. indeed, aim provide firm mean benchmarking themselves, tool improve performance along identify areas. these online tool would mechanism speeding-up process technological diffusion long tail. one practical way pair companies, frontier non-frontier, enable share best practices. this effectively mentor scheme firms, like already common among individuals. what would frontier companies? a productive supply chain clearly interests. the public sector could also play useful nudge role procurement practices. 62 big innovation centre (2017a). 63 hm treasury department business (2017). 64 mayfield (2016). all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 20 20 a ambitious idea still, i consider philip bond, develop virtual environment would enable company simulate change business process practices. these platform already use many frontier firm ass impact new technology process business. these tool created, tailor companies’ circumstances, relatively low cost. this make potentially cost-effective way facilitate diffusion long tail. policy measure valuable boost live standard narrow dispersion income across households. a by-product, also potentially offer benefit monetary policymakers. structural measure boost investment tend raise interest rate economy equilibrate investment opportunity save plans. this sometimes know colloquially r*. policy boost r* mean give interest rate likely impart great stimulus. or, put differently, mean level demand economy achieve high interest rate. and “pivot” mix policies, somewhat le contribution monetary policy structural policies, would probably desirable. not least, could help mitigate

c dudley, president chief executive officer federal reservebank new york, bank standard board, london, unite kingdom, 21 march 2017.* * *thank kind welcome.i grateful bank standard board organize meeting. for several years, thefederal reserve bank new york bank standard board work toimprove culture within financial service industry world’s two important financialcenters. i would like especially thank sir richard lambert, dame colette bowe, alisoncottrell, member team—all travel several time new york toattend meet conference issue culture. i please theopportunity reciprocate join today london. a always, i say reflectsmy view necessarily federal open market committee federalreserve system.this morning, i would like highlight three issue critical improve culture within thefinancial service industry:first, define clarify purpose, clear goal necessary one assessperformance;second, measurement firm industry performing; andthird, whether incentive encourage behavior consistent goal one wish toachieve. i conclude offer think good culture critical success infinancial services. let u start purpose prerequisite two. baroness onora o’neill,a member bank standard board, keynote speaker new york fed’s thirdculture conference, hold october 2016. her message audience senior banker andregulators challenge think purpose organizations. namely, areyou for?i believe question “what for” litmus test firm confront withchallenges. let give one example, salz review 2013. employee theeight division barclays ask state core values. three eight division didnot rank “customer service” core value. two division retail lines—uk retailbanks barclays credit card. the third firm’s african subsidiary, alsooffered retail bank services.my intent pick barclays. indeed, firm commend firstcommissioning publish salz review—sir david walker set example ofleadership candor transparency. instead, purpose make point: if youcannot answer question “what for,” answer make sense light ofyour business, time re-examine purpose. for bank, statement purpose emphasize sustainable success, short-runprofit. this many important role bank play economy. they arecritical intermediary saver borrowers; provide essential infrastructure; theysupport well-functioning financial markets; act custodian wealth. thesefunctions require long-term commitment. they erratic ephemeral. the123 1 / 4bis central bankers' speech economy need steady supply competent, honest, reliable bank service order tofunction. that bank emphasize long term short term.after purpose come measurement. in context culture, however, calculate particularmetrics le important goal measurement. the first goal ass howyou compare set do. in words, fulfil yourpurpose? the second goal ass stack peers. in ways,measurement provide critical benchmarking, without firm industry cannotassess whether make progress. since begin work culture, colleague i recognize thatmeasurement indispensable improve bank culture. we alone view. at new york fed’s first conference cultural reform, october 2014, sir david walkerencouraged bank leader measure behavior within firm order promoteaccountability. pursue theme, several panelist address use measurement acorporate governance tool. they argue standardize metric could help quantify thejudgment behavior individual employees, make behavioral component annualperformance review objective. the information could also aid firm’s seniorleaders assess effectiveness communication firm conduct itsbusiness. for part, i encourage industry collaborate common culture survey thatcould serve benchmark behavior. i also agree sir david measurement andaccountability decoupled.last week, bsb publish result industry-wide benchmarking survey culture. this critical step forward industry’s effort get good data firm oncultural issues, identify area improvement, demonstrate public commitment toimprovement. several facet bsb’s report strike particularly significant. first, addition create benchmarking survey—which generate approximately 28,000responses—the bsb conduct focus group junior employee interview seniorleaders add depth survey result indicated. that represent significantinvestment time bsb participate qualitative review. thatcommitment essential understand context mean response withinindividual firms.second, survey ask respondent agree disagree number statements. those statement direct cut core cultural issue banking. some thestandouts, view, included:“i believe senior leader organization mean say.”“in organization encourage follow spirit rule (what mean, notjust words).”“i see people organization turn blind eye inappropriate behavior.”“if i raise concern way work, i would worry negativeconsequences me.”third, result suggest respondent pull punches. nearly 30 percentanswered would worry negative consequence raise concern atwork. that shows, perhaps finding, still long way go increating culture long-term success banking. in addition, approximately one quarter ofemployees affirmatively agree organization put customer center ofbusiness decisions. that also concern want industry sustainable thelong term.45 2 / 4bis central bankers' speech i encourage read bsb’s report, haven’t already. and let emphasize thereport intend cudgel assign blame. rather, i see it, report give theindustry opportunity improve benchmark. again, i want acknowledge bsb’scontribution thank work.now burden shift bsb you, industry. what results? we want see progress culture behavior. how you—both within firm andcollectively—move needle culture behavior next years? i suggest want next year’s result good year’s, might start byfocusing incentives. a i argue before, incentive shape behavior, behavior drive culture. if want aculture support long-term business strategy, need align incentive thebehaviors sustain business long haul.incentives—compensation promotion, particular—are powerful tool communicatingthe conduct culture desire firm. of course, culture firm shouldvary. but, culture every bank share common theme: stewardship—a word thatimplies professional care, exercise year year benefit firm itsstakeholders. a commitment long term must core banking. incentive within afirm support goal, undermine it.my emphasis incentive new, bear repeating. bad incentive keycontributing factor financial crisis. in unite states, financial crisis inquirycommission conclude “compensation systems—designed environment cheapmoney, intense competition, light regulation—too often reward quick deal, short-term gain—without proper consideration long-term consequences.” this theme apply alllevels bank organizations. one notable example mortgage brokers, paidbased volume loan generated, quality.the financial crisis come head fall 2008. fast forward eight year fall of2016. well fargo’s chairman ceo resign regulator uncover appear tobe widespread fraud retail bank. compensation, again, seem center ofa scandal. neighborhood banker pay base volume new account opened,apparently utter disregard whether customer want even know them. and, like mortgage broke early 2000s, appear job security depend almostexclusively meet targets, regardless target met. there seriousmismatch value well fargo espouse incentive well fargoemployed.investigations happen well fargo continuing, i wait drawingmore definitive conclusions. for now, though, sufficient note powerful role—for goodor bad—that incentive play organization. i understand make progress onculture difficult. but, want next round metric look good last, use apowerful lever—use incentives. today’s discussions—here mansion house late bank england—are evidencethat issue culture important private public sector alike. we keepworking this. the public sector must continue shine spotlight issue, theindustry must continue demonstrate take responsibility culture. and, culturecannot subject receive attention bad conduct occur recentpast. i convince good ethical culture reflect firm’s strategy, decision-making processes, product also economic best interest, number reasons:6789 3 / 4bis central bankers' speech good culture mean few incident misconduct, lead low internal monitoringcosts.good culture mean employee speak problem get early attention tendto stay small. small problem lead le reputational harm damage franchisevalue. and, habit speak lead good exchange ideas—a hallmark ofsuccessful organizations.good culture mean great credibility prosecutor regulators—and few andlower fines. good culture help attract retain good talent. this create virtuous circle higherperformance great innovation, le pressure cut ethical corner generate thereturns necessary stay business. good culture build strong organizational story source pride bepassed along generation employees. it also attractive clients.good culture help rebuild public trust finance, could, turn, lead lowerburden impose regulation time. regulation compliance expensivesubstitutes good stewardship.good culture is, short, necessary condition long-term success individual firms. therefore, member industry must good steward seek make progresson reform culture near term. thank kind attention, thank bank standard board invitingme speak lord mayor hosting. i would happy answer questions.sarah bell, stephanie chaly, jam hennessy,

governor 3/4 in first session conference, address implication present situation global economy central bank and, specifically, central bank mediterranean region manage monetary exchange rate policy present context. before give floor distinguish speaker let say word global economic policy environment implication monetary exchange rate policies. the late data tend confirm global recovery firming, include core advance economies, even rate growth continue rather modest. inflation also come back. in context, prolong period ultra-expansionary monetary policy go back global financial crisis, witness seem begin shift policy mix advance economies, least us, shift towards normalization monetary policy somewhat expansionary fiscal policy. but change policy mix point end far relax financial condition global level; this, turn, may adverse collateral consequences, mainly domain financial stability, advance emerge market economies, especially change take place slowly enough. indeed, mere expectation shift policy mix one important driver behind recent increase bond yield mature economy appreciation u dollar. in way, highly accommodative monetary policy major advance economy generate major challenge policymakers emerge market economies, exit policy important repercussions, previous episode market volatility confirm. in context, seem relevant address issue central bank mediterranean region cope potential spillover policy change advance economies, take account different monetary exchange rate strategy follow. many country south mediterranean shore historically rely stable exchange rate nominal anchor monetary policy, although move move towards flexible exchange rate regime inflation target frameworks, advice international financial institutions. while specific recommendation regard choice exchange rate strategy country need weigh pro con peg versus exchange rate flexibility, must aware limitation domestic policy deal spillover external policy events. these clear case country fix exchange rate which, depend openness capital accounts, accept monetary policy stance reference country. but country flexible exchange rate shield either. although disentangle monetary condition allow depreciation exchange rate, would side effect inflation. and likely swing capital flow implication financial stability, emerge market economy repeatedly experienced. indeed, force tighten monetary condition procyclical way counter inflationary pressures, use buff international 4/4 reserve implement macro-prudential capital control measure order preserve financial stability. in case, tight dollar fund conditions, particular, challenge emerge market economy high level dollar denominate debt. this argue traditional “trilemma” international finance (i.e., financially integrate world impossible time free capital mobility, fix exchange rate independent monetary policy) transform “dilemma” existence call “global financial cycle”, whereby independent monetary policy pursue domestic policy objective (controlling inflation promote growth) possible capital account managed. in conditions, sound fundamental use traditional macroeconomic (fiscal monetary) policy may enough; authority may eventually need also resort macroprudential capital flow management instrument smooth financial cycle capital flows. finally, another reflection recent experience go central bank core advance economies: importance good internalize global spillover monetary policy decisions. while possible coordinate monetary policies, give mandate central banks, consider effect decision rest world decision making, spillover potential raise financial instability problem countries, spillback effect hit back economies. without ado, honour u today three

elvira nabiullina: review russia's economic financialdevelopments 2016speech m elvira nabiullina, governor bank russia, plenary session thestate duma russian federation, moscow, 9 june 2017.* * *dear vyacheslav volodin, deputy state duma!the central bank guide action strategic objectives. i want note across thecountry, every employee bank russia know are. they basis onwhich key performance indicator employee formulated.these objective are:price stability;financial market sustainability;availability financial product service household businesses;development national payment system;development technology support innovation financial market.these objective follow directly function central bank, define theconstitution law. yesterday, i take another look speech i give duma fouryears ago. yes, course, life make adjustments. no one back 2013 expect suchnegative external factors, sanctions, drop oil prices. so task ensuringfinancial stability come forefront activities. but deal problem, wehave try lose sight strategically important activity assign fouryears ago, must continue work towards completion these.as regard monetary policy, bank russia set task reduce inflation thelevel time 7% 3-4%. but, see, also note rate decline mustbe dictate economic situation. therefore, due external shocks, achieve targettook long expected. however already close target level.the second objective term monetary policy set four year ago toincrease flexibility exchange rate. we move float exchange rate andconsider right decision, negative experience exportingcountries switch float exchange rate prove u need done.within bank sector, set task strengthen supervision andwithdrawing market weak players. unfortunately, accumulate problem thebanking sector turn serious assume four year ago. and thissituation aggravate crisis. the process clean bank sector isnot yet complete and, accord estimates, take another 2-3 years. strengtheningsupervision require u restructure internal organisation significantly – process arecurrently undergoing.four year ago decide establish mega-regulator. we hand responsibility theregulation supervision across sector financial market, number 20 thousandsupervised units. and, bank sector, consistently focus riddingthe market unscrupulous players, introduce new standard regulation order toensure sustainability financial institution increase businesses’ individuals’confidence financial market. 1 / 3bis central bankers' speech then set task develop national payment system. this become morepressing connection sanctions, and, i mentioned, manage achieve thistask ahead schedule, even 2016.further progress towards strategic task constitute main objective comingfive years.in sphere monetary policy, task ensure stable low rate inflation: want notjust achieve level 4% one time, one two months, deliver stable level lowinflation.this also lead low interest rates, long loans, give business individualsthe ability make long-term plan – rubles, specifically, rather foreign currency. all thisultimately contribute economic growth.the key task bank sector, i mentioned, complete process clean itup, improve quality supervision, increase proactivity early stage andtransitioning consult oversight, wherein help conscientious financial market participantsto fix problems, still time so.we understand task strengthen enhance financial stability bankscannot single-handedly manage bank russia alone. it important place moreresponsibility misconduct owner manager credit organisation themselves, toensure irreversibility punishment crimes.qualitative change store bank industry – include transition three-tierbanking system, comprise systemically important banks, bank universal licences, andbanks basic licences. this radical change bank system, need toimplement care near future. the three main task set us, arecurrently resolving, are: good manage risk, protect right depositor andcreditors; promote availability credit, include credit small businesses; ensurefair competition, wherein bank type able work earn within niche themarket.another press task implementation new resolution mechanism. we hope willbe place autumn, ready use it. this allow u reduce costand speed resolution mechanism, order make rehabilitate bank attractiveto investors.in bank sector, well financial sector overall, challenge lie inrehabilitating clean up, also create condition development. this cometo fore course next five years.creating condition development involves: introduce system individual pension capital –essentially voluntary system individuals; develop non-bank finance bondmarket; develop capital market – essence, create long-term money country. atthe moment don’t long-term money, must everything wecan create it.further development payment system involve smooth transfer salary ofpublic sector employee social payment card system call “mir". to make thistransfer smooth orderly task near future. we also aim expand theacceptance mir card outside russia. we already begin plan arrangementswith country front.finally, i return topic financial technology development – i also speak 2 / 3bis central bankers' speech previously. the development financial technology large part determine specificactions take u come years. this involve active joint effort withbusinesses. legislative support also important here, particularly term remoteauthentication, make new technology digital technology possible. this impliesa transition electronic document workflow financial market. here indeed abacklog, need cross new system order reduce cost financialsector ultimately reduce cost credit. this also result cheap loans.we carry test market new technologies, distribute ledgertechnology base blockchain technology, already begin process orderto implement regulation new technology rationally, protect market risks.at begin speech i mention strategic objective bank russia. theseare key priorities. you may notice task set four year ago andthose year 2016, i speak today, well challenge thefuture, all, course, relate other. we consider important respect theprinciples continuity, consistency predictability. we doubt respond withflexibility give situation. the situation volatile, lot uncertainty world.we react accordance challenge present us. but consistency ofour policy, i think, important. the preservation trust vital development, well tofinancial markets. this key category – trust financial market trust monetarypolicy influential factor term economic growth. we view policy aspart overall economic policy aim create condition sustainable long-termeconomic growth country.thank much! 3 / 3bis central bankers' speech the view express necessarily bank england monetary policy committee. i would like

public private sector often work partnership. the decline uk textile industry mid-20th century mirror bradford’s fortunes. like many industrial cities, bradford go wrench transition still bear scars. but retreat tide seems, decisively, turned. i delight see civic commercial investment begin return bradford past years. those scar start heal. of course, plenty still leave part city still among poor

people, broad range views, possible. event past twelve month – indeed, event past twelve day – illustrate important policymakers so. to listen often speak; try good understand issue people tell u matter them, rather issue tell ought matter them; close gap “us” “them”. with fortune economy uncertain, value grassroots intelligence never greater. so uk economy critical juncture? overall, picture reasonably reassure one. the uk economy grow 17 consecutive quarters. output increase around 2% past year, little historic trend rate. employment uk high rate since 1973. unemployment currently low since 1975. confidence among business consumer remain solid. and inflation, 2% target three years, bounce back sharply recently. nonetheless, uk economy clearly face number important challenges. consumer price inflation (cpi), 2.9%, currently well government’s inflation target 2%. it likely move target course year, probably reach 3%. meanwhile, growth uk slow fairly sharply since end last year, high price squeeze households’ purchase power shops. activity uk economy remain long-run potential. and, course, full effect brexit felt. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 3 3 face uncertainties, key issue policymakers bank’s monetary policy committee (mpc) best navigate risk trade-off currently exist wage jobs, activity inflation. these risk genuinely two-sided. keep monetary policy loose long, support job activity, might run unnecessary risk inflation target. but tighten monetary policy soon quickly, curb inflationary pressures, might run unnecessary risk output jobs. give lag operates, monetary policy judgement depend inflation output today, expect path period ahead. for example, current uk inflation boost significantly, temporarily, price pressure arise sterling’s depreciation last year. once effect abate, path inflation depend evolution domestic costs. the behaviour wages, development job market generally, crucial determine evolution. that case, i wish begin discuss factor affect wage growth, recent past future, include arise structural shift nature work. i turn implication recent development economy monetary policy period ahead. work wage wage surprisingly weak much period since global financial crisis. chart 1 plot successive bank england forecast wage growth since 2012. wage growth uk persistently disappoint downside, average around 1 ¼ percentage point one year ahead. part explanation lie weak uk productivity, key determinant firms’ ability pay workers. this, too, persistently disappoint downside, mean error around 1 percentage point one year ahead. nonetheless, clear wage weak explain either slow productivity growth factor typically affect wages, include degree slack labour market. this see look unexplained component bank’s wage equation (chart 2). these residual predominantly negative recent years. that despite on-going refinement bank’s judgement labour market, wage come short expectations. this weakness wage surprise come backdrop boom job market uk. employment increase around 2.5 million people since 2011. unemployment uk fall peak 8.5% 2011 almost 4.5% currently. it also fall significantly every region uk. here yorkshire, unemployment fall 10% around 5% past years, low level since 1970s. historically, reasonably strong stable relationship unemployment wage growth – so-called phillips curve. a unemployment fall recently, phillips curve relationship would lead u expect wage growth pick up. that, plainly, happened. over recent years, all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 4 4 phillips curve relationship anything strong stable (chart 3). and flatness phillips curve find number country (chart 4). there many potential cause weak wage puzzle recent years.1 some likely short-lived, impact low actual expect level inflation globally. others likely longer-lived, impact financial crisis slack labour market workers’ willingness move job search pay rise. a third set factor structural nature. for example, evidence technology globalisation may weaken bargain power workers, lead secular fall share income go worker several countries.2 another set longer-term factor arise change nature work shift relationship employer employees. one shift, operate number decades, decrease incidence unionisation collective bargain workforce. other, recent, shift include increase incidence self-employment, flexible part-time work zero-hours contracts. these shift nature quality work become topical recently. the uk government commission independent review, chair matthew taylor, look impact.3 these change work customs, contract practice give variety descriptions. some call “casualisation” work, job become le structure informal.4 others call “gig” economy, work become le four-cornered task-oriented.5 other still associate change heighten “insecurity” job market, implication households’ income spending.6 all description recognise shift affect quality work economy, even quantity reach level see many decades.7 because cause consequence shift work practice many varied, single description perfect. survey suggest that, people, move great self-employment part-time work welcome development, increase degree control flexibility work lives. for others, shift le lifestyle choice necessity, increase degree uncertainty concern income jobs. gigging fun some. but everyone want roadie come world work. perhaps neutral, le catchy, description trend needed. in term economic impact, trend effect make work “divisible” past. the fall unionisation make worker divisible level profession, sector firm. wage bargain 1 see, example, abel et al (2016). 2 imf (2017). 3 see www.gov.uk/government/groups/employment-practices-in-the-modern-economy 4 solow (2015). 5 for example, hook (2015). 6 hudson-sharp runge (2017). 7 chapman (2017). also see oecd (2017) discussion ‘job quality’. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 5 5 le likely collective, likely idiosyncratic, days. similarly, rise self-employment part-time work make work divisible level individual worker. people likely day pay task hour. in short, shift mean work worker may become diffuse, granular, divisible past. this increase “divisibility” job work potentially raise number important issues, economic social, relationship employee employer, many tackle taylor review. i want explore one dimension - extent may influence wage-setting economy. in particular, worth explore whether change may contributed, way, weak wage puzzle experience recent years. and, so, give trend likely persist, whether carry implication durability wage weakness too. why, principle, might change affect wage behaviour? one story “divide conquer”. there power numbers. a workforce easily divide past may find easily conquered. in words, world divisible work may reduce workers’ wage-bargaining power. another story flexible work practice may induce previously inactive people back work. with people will enter employment, upward pressure wage may dampen even labour demand pick give high rate labour market participation economy. in either case, downstream consequence would similar: weak wage growth past, give level unemployment demand economy. that theory. what empirical evidence support stories? the change nature work let start outline fact change nature work divisibility labour. at level profession sector, one clear diagnostic come change pattern unionisation. in 1990, around 38% employee great britain belong trade union. that membership rate steadily decline time, extend broad trend apparent since least mid-1970s. in 2016, membership trade union stand 23% (chart 5). today, around 6 million employee member trade unions, le half peak around 13 million late-1970s. that fall union membership rate broadly based. it apply male females, although fall membership great among male rate fall 35% 1995 21% today. it occur public private sectors, although public sector employee remain around four time likely union members. and true across age groups, although rate union membership tend low among young cohorts, rate among 16-24 age cohort 8% compare 30% age 50 over. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 6 6 the fact unionisation rate fall within age cohort time, low among young, suggest downward trend rate unionisation may still distance travel. for example, unionisation rate continue decline average rate past decade, likely fall around 10% employees, 3 million people, within generation. a recent labour market trend increase importance self-employment. in 1980, self-employed account le 8% workforce. in 2016, stand historic high around 15%, around 4 ¼ million people (chart 6). the increase self-employment occur within age cohort, although pick-up great among old. in 1990, 30% self-employed hire workers. today, share around 16%, self-employed work independently.8 a decrease unionisation, seem unlikely trend reverse. a old worker likely self-employed, age population generate increases. a rough ready-reckoner, incidence self-employment age group remain constant, age population would generate extra 100,000 self-employed people next decade. if number self-employment keep increase rate past, increase could much substantial, perhaps much extra 1 million people next decade. a recent phenomenon labour market – one attract particular attention – “zero hours” contract. a recently 2010, 0.6% employment zero hour contracts, around 170,000 people. by 2016, increase almost 3% employees, almost 1 million worker (chart 7). it unclear much measure increase zero hour contract genuine trend, rather reflect increase awareness reporting. but rate expansion continued, share employee zero-hours contract would reach around 7% within decade. trend temporary part-time work le striking, go direction. between 1997 2008, temporary work decline share employment. but since 2008 increased. there currently around 200,000 temporary worker financial crisis. prior crisis, around 25% employment work part-time. since crisis, share increase around 26%, around 8 ½ million workers. if take together self-employment, part-time temporary work zero-hours contracts, share workforce probably rise around 43%, around 13 ½ million workers.9 the correspond figure back 2000 would around 39% workforce, around 10 ½ million workers. this majority, significant rise minority workers. 8 for example, blanchflower machin (2017). 9 there need caution simply sum category probably overlap, generate double-counting. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 7 7 these trend self-employment, temporary part-time employment base survey data. those broad trend corroborate look data job vacancy rather employment.10 by search word “self-employed”, “flexible hours” “contractor” publish job ads, track trend demand job characteristics. this suggest three job classifier maintain increase share vacancy since 2008 (chart 8). on face it, trend – le union membership, self-employment, zero hour contracts, part-time temporary work – might suggest work become fluid insecure. but cautious jump conclusion. over past three years, mark increase share temporary worker report want permanent job. and since 2012, share part-time worker report want full-time job also upward trajectory. whether trend employment voluntary involuntary, good news bad, opportunity threat, may still carry implication wage-setting. that true even (rising) minority worker affect changes. the marginal worker much likely past self-employed, work flexibly part union. and, economics employer tell us, marginal worker whose pay matter determine wage pressure economy large. implication wage so evidence tell u potential effect change pattern work wages? one source empirical research wage behaviour. this literature best-developed area unionisation. it suggest clear wage premium associate trade union membership, even take account difference workers’ skills, sector regions.11 there number possible reason wage premium, include great bargain power union membership confers. there also wide range estimate scale wage premium. these appear vary widely across different countries, region sectors. nonetheless, estimate aggregate wage premium uk typically centre range 10-15%.12 there evidence wage premium may shrink time, perhaps reflect diminish union membership increase competition labour market.13 and also evidence decrease unionisation may make wage-setting disperse localised.14 10 this base data reed around 15 million advertise job vacancy 2008 2016. there various possible reason ‘self-employment’ include within job vacancy description. these may include reduce national insurance contribution increase flexibility work hours. 11 lewis (1986). 12 bryson (2014). 13 bryson (2014). 14 gregg et al (2014). all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 8 8 give number unionise worker fall time, wage premium unionisation direct, “batting average”, effect wage growth few worker benefit premium. for example, wage premium 15%, shift union membership since 2000 would subtract around 1 per cent wage period, le 6 basis point average annual wage growth. this effect modest but, mind, likely low bound. for example, take account broad spill effect unionise wage wage workers. there evidence self-employment, flexible work zero-hours contract also affect wages, control difference occupation locations. for example, self-employment find associate wage discount workers, perhaps region 15%.15 the reason give discount include fact worker may will accept low wage return increase control flexibility come self-employment.16 there may also problem record accurately income self-employment. for worker temporary contracts, also evidence wage discount, perhaps around 5-6%.17 for agency workers, wage discount smaller, perhaps around 2 ½%. for zero hour contract workers, large around 7%. if take trend self-employment, temporary zero-hours contract worker since 2000, would expect collectively directly subtract wage around 0.6 per cent, around 4 basis point annual wage growth.18 again, although estimate modest probably understate true effect, give ignore behavioural effect trends. wage way shift nature work may affect labour market behaviour. a unionisation, shift may also widen dispersion wage rate within give sector occupation, le collective-bargaining localise rate pay. vacancy data lend support hypothesis. chart 9 10 plot distribution offer wage rate different occupations, compare job vacancy contain term “self-employment” “flexible hours” not. these vacancy data probably capture particular segment self-employed flexible work population, differentiate pay typical self-employed worker. indeed, ‘self-employed’ vacancy advertise firm invite applicant become self-employed hire them. nonetheless, “violin” plot offer wage distribution play interest tune. the distribution offer wage rate far wide vacancy associate self-employment flexible hour without, within give occupation. there far le evidence “going-rate” job associate self-employed flexible working. this sound intuitively plausible. 15 infer bradley (2016), use mean pay self-employed compare employees. 16 hamilton (2000). 17 gardiner (2016). 18 because self-employed worker include statistical measure average weekly earnings, self-employed effect would show arithmetically wage measure. but still likely general equilibrium effect wage-setting economy earn salary. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 9 9 a final piece evidence, albeit indirect, come historical data. the move towards great self-employment le unionisation is, respects, shift back future nature work. prior industrial revolution, indeed year it, worker self-employed work small businesses. there unions. hour flexible, depend work need collect crops, milk cow put bread table. work artisanal, task-based, divisible. while read-across work pattern 21st century far exact, parallels. that case, one question wage- price-setting behaviour operate early period “divisible” labour markets. be today’s wage pattern evident then? the data wage output early century partial imperfect, nonetheless tell interest story. chart 11 plot uk phillips curve three periods: 1500-1700 (pre-industrial revolution); 1860-1950 (post-industrial revolution); 1950-1977 1977 date (post-war period). in case, wage inflation measure y-axis estimate output gap x-axis. in post-war period, phillips curve conform type. since 1950, clearly positive slope (less slack economy associate high wage inflation) intercept positive (reflecting positive trend inflation). the phillips curve cover period either side industrial revolution interesting. they share one important similarly one important difference. the similarity associate average inflation rate around zero. this consistent price level broadly stable periods. the strike difference slope phillips curve. the post-industrial revolution phillips curve conventional upward slope, similar operate 1950. high growth low unemployment associate high rate wage price inflation. the pre-industrial revolution phillips curve altogether different; flat pancake. indeed, bear close resemblance phillips curve operated, uk globally, since 2008. there many potential explanation flatness pre-industrial revolution phillips curve, include noisy data. and similarity present-day phillips curve may purely coincidental. nonetheless, pattern least consistent shift work practices, towards divisible, idiosyncratic workforce, contribute flat phillips curve relationship. none evidence definitive decisive. take together, however, least suggestive recent trend nature work may bear wage-setting behaviour general weak wage puzzle particular. shift work pattern seem unlikely, themselves, prime-mover weak wages. but probably contributor past and, significantly, likely continue future trends, seem likely, perpetuate. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 10 10 the case hold fire let turn monetary policy. clearly, wage key factor judge inflation pressure economy monetary policy stance. continue pattern since crisis, recent wage growth been, again, surprisingly weak. despite unemployment fall low level, employment rise high level, generation, whole-economy wage growth fail pick-up. indeed, wage growth recent month appears, anything, falling. at start year, bank england agents’ annual wage survey suggest pay settlement would slow 2.7% last year 2.2% this. at time, healthy scepticism within bank findings. in event, agents’ survey may, anything, understate slowdown. annual growth average weekly earn peak 2.8% november 2016. it currently stand 2.1%. exclude bonuses, stand 1.7%. data pay settlement suggest weak profile may persist. private sector wage settlement currently run around 2.0%, 3% year ago. these recent trend wages, alongside fall unemployment, reinforce impression exceptionally weak relationship wage employment, pancake-like phillips curve. indeed, testimony flatness phillips curve wage growth similar level today unemployment recent peak back 2011. the bank’s may inflation report projection assume wage growth pick around 3 ¾% next three years. give unemployment project broadly flat period, tight labour market exert increase upward pressure pay growth wage profile realised. alternatively, whatever factor drag pay growth dissipate. of course, wage determinant underlie inflation pressures. that bank monitor range around 13 indicator domestically-generated inflation. each imperfections, share aim filter temporary influence underlie inflation.19 chart 12 show summary measure indicator domestically-generated inflation, base common volatility across indicators.20 two feature stand out. first, clear evidence slow build underlie inflation pressure uk economy since around 2015, slack absorbed. since then, domestically generate inflation rise around 0.5 percentage points. but, second, nominal build slow, despite rapid fall unemployment. underlie inflation estimate around level 2013. that leaf around 0.7 percentage point 19 while strip extent, measure completely immune external factors, change exchange rate commodity prices. 20 technically speaking, first principal component bank’s range domestically-generated inflation measures. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 11 11 level consistent hit inflation target.21 if rise similar rate past years, slack erode sharply, underlie inflation would still take another three year reach target-consistent levels. a past rate erosion slack unlikely replicate next three years, suggest could downside risk hit inflation target, unless phillips curve reassert nominal momentum economy pick period ahead. more generally, relatively low slow rate nominal build economy recent past provide one reason caution consider tighten uk’s monetary stance, inflation target hit sustainable basis. a second factor play direction brexit. the bank already make allowance effect brexit economy publish projection output inflation since referendum. one effect change uk’s future trade arrangement likely, time, drag trade volume (exports imports), activity productivity economy.22 necessarily, give previous episode type, impact uncertain. they also base set assumption brexit process ultimate end-state, may may realise practice. for instance, underlie brexit effect assumption process smooth orderly one. this strong assumption. a number market participant external commentator believe risk brexit may neither smooth orderly. if so, could prompt discontinuous response consumer companies. for example, begin build precautionary savings, would affect growth significantly adversely. there could “brexit break” economy.23 this discontinuity risk difficult dismiss. indeed, risk sharp, brexit-induced, slowdown seem key factor hold sterling yield curve current low levels, accord market participants. on view, sharp slow uk growth first quarter year could harbinger thing come. and already sign sharp slowdown big-ticket discretionary purchase consumers, include houses, car household goods. if persisted, could justify monetary policymakers stay hand. it would imprudent add fuel contractionary fire early interest rate rise. a final factor which, least principle, could use justify continue accommodative monetary policy stance level sterling yield curve. this remarkably flat become flat course year, despite medium-term growth expectation revise upwards. only one rise uk interest 21 base average different indicators’ deviation estimate “inflation target-consistent” rates. these estimate target-consistent rate may appropriate benchmark current juncture mix domestically- externally-generated inflation consistent overall inflation target change time. for example, trade integration china global economy 2000s drag core good inflation prior crisis may repeat itself. 22 bank england (2016). 23 a “brexit break” could also associate material depreciation sterling, put upward pressure inflation. in case, appropriate reaction monetary policy would ambiguous, possible tightening, rather loosening, may warranted. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 12 12 rate fully price late-2019. forward rate reach 1% 2023 and, remarkably, never reach 2%. give expectations, rise interest rate immediate period ahead would come surprise financial market and, perhaps less extent, consumer businesses. because people dislike nasty surprises, increase chance outsized response spend asset prices, perhaps even one catalyse “brexit break”. this risk which, even remote, easily dismissed. take together, factor – real, nominal, financial - make case maintain mpc’s current, accommodative, monetary policy stance. and, recently, factor weigh heavily frame view appropriate monetary policy stance. the case tighten one key good policymaking regular critical self-examination arguments. this devil’s advocacy help expose soft spot policy judgement, especially time data risk around economy may altering. those data risk have, view, alter materially past nine month so, number reasons. first, world outlook materially bright time, perhaps time since global financial crisis. this year’s spring meet imf saw first upgrade world growth forecast six years. a forecast error tend serially correlate – forecasters’ model tend smooth bump miss turn point - possible upgrade world growth could lie ahead. one reason believe strong world growth may prove resilient appear broad base recent past, compositionally regionally. at compositional level, early-stage sign global growth may rebalancing away consumption towards investment. since crisis, global business investment structurally weak, grow around 2 percentage point pre-crisis average. meanwhile, growth world trade undershoot world growth past 2 years, 5-year period opposite true. there sign pattern reversing. investment us, euro area china appear pick up. so world trade. global supply chain appear widen deepening, global trade capital good order rise (chart 13). it possible great optimism world demand may encourage business put fortress balance sheet work. if so, could herald begin end protract post-crisis super-cycle weak investment. at regional level, global recovery appear broad base across world. most region world see growth upgrade past six months. currently, country represent around 80% all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 13 13 global output expect grow above-trend, mean global output gap shrinking. the simultaneity uptick regional growth give great momentum, give increase importance day cross-border spillovers, trade finance, integrate global supply chains. a second reason great resilience world growth since start year reduce political policy uncertainty. for anyone live uk’s political undulation past weeks, consume daily diet world news, blog tweets, may sound like odd statement. but, view round, political policy risk number country ease significantly since start year. at start year, widespread medium market concern change economic, trade foreign policy us. by large, bad fear fail materialise. at start year, fear populist surge europe. these risk fail crystallise, first netherlands, recently france probably germany late year. this suggest geo-political risk disappeared, merely important risk fail come pass. alongside upgrade growth, fall political risk seem contribute rise global asset price fall global risk premia. equity price u euro area increase around 8% since start year. the vix, measure uncertainty financial markets, fall level see since 2007 (chart 14). media-based measure uncertainty remain elevated. but measure political news, plenty, rather political uncertainty. and latter, rather blogs, tweet news feeds, matter people make decision spending. third, world economy gather pace resilience, sign downside risk global inflation also eased. in middle last year, balance inflation risk major region seem skew downside. financial market expectation inflation 5-to-10 year ahead historic average u (by around 80 basis points), uk (40 basis points) euro-area (40 basis points). fear deflation were, quite stalk planet, make nuisance number countries. since july last year, inflation expectation rise around 40bp uk around 25bps u euro-area (chart 15). the downside skew inflation expectation appear dissipated. and among market participants. the shift inflation narrative among public every bite striking. google search word “deflation” low level several years, particularly elevate 2015. search word “reflation” rise fourfold compare first quarter year last (chart 16). hope reflation displace fear deflation popular narrative global inflationary trends. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 14 14 this shift inflation expectation important implication monetary policy. one concern below-target inflation negative shock demand could dislodge inflation expectations, require stimulus time zero low bind interest rate potentially make le effective. this asymmetry risk justify hold interest rate low longer, “risk management” grounds.24 with inflation expectation adjust upwards, need monetary policy insurance low nine month ago. fourth, close home, bad post-referendum fear uk growth fail materialise. growth resilient expected. the bank’s inflation report forecast uk growth 2017 revise percentage point since last august. smooth bumps, survey activity confidence, among consumer businesses, scarcely budged. although little weak last year, survey continue point solid, around-trend, growth. what clearly change recently composition uk growth. consumer spend slowed, perhaps sharply, sign business investment pick (chart 17). survey also suggest strengthen outlook exports. with balance sheet strong, cost capital low demand product – particularly overseas – buoyant, uk company may emerge duvet, put balance sheet work. if so, even aggregate growth somewhat slower, make good balance resilient growth. none suggest risk brexit break disappeared. there still enough straw wind believe sharp slowdown expect possible, consumers’ spend houses, car household good slow sharply. and might take much squeeze consumer demand induce company return duvets. but consistent evidence, far least, discontinuity risk increase significantly year. a nominal pressures, sign stirring. consumer price inflation, 2.9% may, exceed market expectations, measure core inflation. sterling fall 3% since may inflation report, largely result political events. mechanically, fall would add around 0.2% level gdp around 0.2 percentage point inflation two three year horizon. inflation already expect lie bank’s target, rising, year three horizon may inflation report. fifth, despite positives, sterling yield curve overall tend fairly unresponsive, data news mpc communications. estimate responsiveness uk yield curve macro-economic news longer-term average throughout much past 18 month 24 see evans (2011), example. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 15 15 (chart 18). perhaps lesson u experience, interest rate responsive data news fomc communications, policy actions, rather words, matter. sixth finally, tighten policy need put context. the first 25 basis point rise uk interest rate 10 year seem like momentous step. but would still leave monetary policy highly accommodative historical metric. a 25 basis point rise would remove proportion – accord gdp ready-reckoners, around quarter – incremental stimulus mpc provide last august. in words, 25 basis point tighten would still leave uk monetary policy stance significantly accommodative year ago. conclusion so leave balance arguments? have weigh evidence, i think balance risk associate tighten “too early”, one hand, “too late”, other, swing materially towards latter past six nine months. the risk tighten “too early” shrink growth and, less extent, inflation show great resilience expected. and policy tighten “too late”, could result much steep path rate rise late on, contrary mpc’s collective expectation bank rate would increase ‘at gradual pace limit extent’.25 a balance point risk shift past 9 months, leave judge partial withdrawal additional policy insurance mpc put place last year would prudent relatively soon, provide data come broadly expect period ahead. certainly, i think tighten likely need well ahead current market expectations. how soon “relatively soon”? i consider case rate rise mpc’s june meeting. i felt strong grind hold back late year, two reasons. first, despite upwards pressure inflation, still sign high wage growth. and despite robust surveys, still chance sharp expect slow economy. both reason monetary policy rush fences. nor need so, give slow build nominal pressure economy. second, election. this throw dust-cloud uncertainty. financial markets-wise, manifest weak exchange rate. it unclear twist turn lie ahead, potentially important implication asset price and, least potentially, confidence among business consumers. i think add twist turn monetary policy would, environment, especially helpful build confidence, least dust-cloud start settle. 25 monetary policy committee (2017). all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 16 16 provide data still track, i think begin process withdraw incremental stimulus provide last august would prudent move second half year. a mpc begin process normalise monetary policy, sign economy begin normalise. far cause concern, start process withdraw monetary policy insurance serve signal mpc’s confidence uk economy’s resilience inflation return sustainably 2% target. the city bradford normalising, long period painful adjustment. it show real resilience indomitable spirit lean years. there reason optimism city’s future, civic

issue internal models. the measure currently discussion would reduce latitude calculate risk parameter limit unjustified variability risk-weighted assets, denominator capital ratios. difference among country emerge capital requirement measure internal models. this issue le important italian banks, far make limit use models. however, essential reach agreement matter ensure level play field foreign banks, make broad use internal model long time. by take step develop internal models, even within consortium subject verification supervisory authorities, italian bank system could align main european country issue. the target review internal model (trim) project recently launch single supervisory mechanism (ssm) ass compliance significant banks’ internal model ensure uniform supervisory practices. the review cover model credit risk well market counterparty risk. over 100 assessment schedule 2017, bank italy staff actively involved. the goal swiftly eliminate deviation regulations; 3 misalignment practice set trim guide assess late stage.1 italian bank must plan advance adjustment risk measurement systems, anticipate potential consequence capital. they already make significant progress, much remain done. a second important issue ensure effective supervision level play field european level removal uncertainty valuation bank assets. the asset liability record banks’ balance sheet level 2 (l2) level 3 (l3) instrument play key role, evaluation particularly complex. their value directly inferable market price must estimate use complicate techniques. couple difficulty distinguish l2 l3 contracts, lead bank make valuation whose goal keep capital requirement account regulatory arbitrage. classify contract l2 instead l3 several advantages. first, possible outset book profit equal entire difference actual transaction price fair value estimate internal model (known day-1 profit). second, limit ‘stigma’ associate hold large amount l3 instruments, analyst regard highly risky assets. because high degree complexity low level standardization, l2 l3 instrument illiquid; quick sale would likely entail substantial discount fair value. when high risk embed financial instrument emerge unite state 2008, value l2 asset decrease 15 per cent l3 asset 21 per cent, trough 31 per cent 57 per cent respectively.2 if properly account valuations, illiquidity could give rise

cancel out. since establishment ssm tackle resolutely issue loan valuation, especially non-performing loans, npls. opaque, illiquid difficult evaluate, l2 l3 instrument many way similar npls, although require much low capital charges. especially stress scenario, decrease price instrument could systemic repercussions. it therefore crucial enhance supervision account prudential treatment l2 l3

credit quality worsens. the new standard force bank improve allocation assessment loan adopt new criterion measure credit risk calculate loan loss provisions. to make impact banks’ supervisory capital gradual, european commission propose five-year transition period. the method procedures, however, effect begin next year. supervisory authorities, europe italy, closely monitor adjustment process,

when fully phase in, rule make crisis management easier, short term increase cost factor depend choice − still debate − regard calibration requirement nature eligible liabilities. the fund instrument

since 2011 36 special administration procedures. in 17 case possible find market-based solution, process lead start compulsory administrative liquidation. these case involve small bank account combine

plethora authority institution − national european − independent other, non-aligned objective effective coordination place them. this extend time necessary solution make decision-making process inefficient transparent, real risk confuse responsibility actor involved. recent experience show problem mitigate long concrete market solutions. the new rule far interpret way deny recourse tool use past manage problematic company case without cause disruption. in practice, make crisis management complicated. in particular, preventive intervention deposit guarantee fund allow today, consider equivalent state aid; regard italian government lodge appeal european court justice. furthermore, excessively stringent limit establish use public funds, even advantageous financially follow full

approval state budget 2017, i shall begin review current macroeconomic set outlook spanish economy. i shall analyse main aspect state budget year, accord draft law approve government 31 march, update stability programme period 2017-2020, submit council minister european commission 29 april. the external environment spanish economy the current international economic set characterise increase uncertainty, chiefly outcome political change past year unite state unite kingdom. however, appear exert significant influence, far, real economy, financial markets. both continue perform favourably and, despite rise final month 2016, interest rate hold still-moderate level terms. the main exception climate relative stability oil prices, highly volatile recent months. recent economic development euro area show firm recovery, progressively extend sector countries. euro area inflation stand may 1.4%, several month high volatility, result – among thing – oscillation energy prices. in medium term, projection publish march ecb, update release week, suggest continuation recovery activity inflation across euro area. performance outlook spanish economy the spanish economy grow 0.8% 2017 q1 late indicator show rate expansion remain high april may. the increase activity q1 continue underpin domestic demand, acceleration investment equipment construction, government consumption, offset ease record household consumption. the external sector highly dynamic, export import growth slightly increase positive contribution growth. for 2017 whole, consensus among analyst suggest gdp growth clearly outpace average euro area. next week, banco de españa publish new projection spanish economy and, basis late indicators, cannot rule growth estimate year somewhat high anticipate month ago, stand even 3%. the prolongation spanish economy’s current growth phase come month essentially base strong pace expansion national demand, although external sector continue – see since 2016 – maintain positive contribution. in particular, buoyant employment favourable condition access credit boost household consumption pick-up spend residential investment equipment. 4/8 in medium term, foreseeably gradual convergence towards moderate growth rates, result disappearance certain factor contribute boost activity. such factor decline oil prices, moderation finance costs, support ecb’s monetary policy, expansionary fiscal policy stance two-year period 2015-2016. a euro area whole, since late last year year-on-year rate change cpi highly volatile; stand may 1.9%, outcome – early state – energy price fluctuation and, also, effect easter holiday week april, give 2016 easter fell march. these temporary factor progressively peter come months, although average rate year expect stand around 2%. in 2018 2019, absence shocks, rate increase cpi might settle reference. the main risk factor vulnerability the scenario i outline also pose risk economy. firstly, improve international set affect high global uncertainty, result recent proposal curb trade, migratory movement policy coordination. in respect, mention make potentially adverse impact brexit negotiations, give highly significant trade financial tie spain uk. secondly, rise u long-term interest rate late 2016, partly reflect certain change expect stance economic policies, already impact european markets. while premature conclude start normalisation monetary conditions, recall normalisation come if, expected, recovery advance economy take root. within spain, level public debt certain segment household firm sector remain high levels, thereby generate high dependency finance abroad. this source vulnerability, particular future tighten monetary financial condition international markets. finally, broad time perspective, sizeable structural component unemployment rate, population age low productivity main constraint sustain growth economy. budgetary policy 2017 before go specify broad outline budgetary policy 2017, allow remind state social security budget provide partial picture general government activity. in country decentralise spain, 40% public spend local regional government, essential take broad perspective. since speech parliamentary budget committee 25 april, government publish (at end april) update stability programme period 2017-2020. this document offer overview budget central government agency along regional local governments. moreover, stability programme, adopt 5/8 broad time horizon, provide medium-term plan, important correct public finance imbalances. the macroeconomic projection accompany stability programme, update include draft budget 2017, involve extension current economic recovery 2020, albeit gdp growth gradually slow 3.2% rate record 2015 2016. specifically, real gdp project grow 2.7%, 2.5%, 2.4% 2.4% 2017, 2018, 2019 2020, respectively, price project recover, nominal gdp growth would stand, average, slightly 4% throughout period. these projection thus incorporate path slow economic growth, also present forecast banco de españa. however, mentioned, real gdp may behave positively short term stability programme. a regard budget, path project overall general government deficit line requirement stability growth pact: decline 3.1% gdp 2017, 2.2% 2018 1.3% gdp 2019. in 2020 budget deficit 0.5% gdp projected. this path reduction spain’s budget deficit need achieve excessive deficit situation (a deficit 3% gdp) end 2018. public debt, accord stability programme, expect fall gradually, reach 92.5% gdp 2020. in current environment high economic growth low general government finance costs, budget consolidation require achieve deficit target period 2017-2020 (as measure change primary structural balance) relatively small. the stability programme include stability objective 2017 – sub-heading public expenditure – approve parliament december last year extend 2020; then, budget balance project level general government, except social security system, would still record deficit 0.5% gdp. central government, currently large deficit, responsible make bulk project adjustment. with regard composition adjustment, accord stability programme public deficit path project period 2017-2020 achieve mainly control total primary public expenditure, i.e. without include public debt interest payments. specifically, projection fulfilled, weight primary public expenditure gdp reduce 3 pp period, 36.6% 2020. at time, government revenue expect grow moderately, 0.9 pp gdp programme’s horizon, 2020. on expenditure side, government project moderate growth wage bill, basically reflect 1% rise remuneration public-sector employee approve 2017 impact save arise reform approve previous years. at time, stability programme assume downward trend spend unemployment continue, line favourable labour market developments; application adjustment factor pension continue hold pension spending, positive inflation environment; current spend good service continue firmly control come years. 6/8 a public investment, stability programme project increase general government investment 10% 2017. however, deduct effect certain defence-related payment outstanding previous years, well possible spend arise liability associate legal proceed relate insolvency toll motorways, item project grow moderately year next years. under plans, therefore, downward trend public investment proportion gdp, already last decade, would continue. interest payment expect continue decline result expect favourable development finance conditions, although moderate rate last two years. the increase revenue include stability programme base mainly measure approve december last year royal decree-law 3/2016. notable among amendment corporate income tax broaden tax base, increase duty alcoholic drink tobacco products, increase 3% maximum social contribution base 8% increase minimum wage. notwithstanding positive impact measures, achievement government’s medium-term revenue target subject uncertainty, revenue need perform favourably relative activity would historical relationship two variable remain unchanged. a result, performance revenue impact spend plan announce public-sector employment need monitor next years, that, event deviation projections, action take time avoid risk failure achieve deficit commitments. the importance budgetary consolidation finally, seem necessary stress importance complete budgetary consolidation process. the current environment high growth low interest rate favourable one reduce structural budget deficit public debt level line main euro area economies, opportunity wasted. the cost finance public debt (which still stand 100% gdp) would reduce would scope fiscal policy respond possible adverse scenarios. moreover, consolidation essential address challenge age population pose spend health, dependency and, all, pensions. in respect, magnitude adjustment need achieve sound public finance spain still significant. hence need comply domestic european budgetary framework requirements. follow strengthen recent years, mean budget deficit (defined total structural terms) public debt must progressively reduced, also so-called spend rule must observed. the spend rule especially important case government entity already achieve budget balance. 7/8 under rule, neither budget actual spend government entity exceed spanish economy’s nominal potential growth rate. since government revenue elasticity respect nominal gdp approximately one, spend rule involve link growth government revenues. spend growth may exceed reference rate increase revenue recurrent nature; likewise, legal change involve permanent loss revenue automatically lead downward revision spend threshold. one advantage rule increase government revenue normal trend must saved, upswing prior last crisis, significant extraordinary revenue increase associate real estate boom recorded. also, link spend economy’s potential rather actual growth, exclude definition non-discretionary spend unemployment benefits, public spend grow slowly gdp revenue economic upswings (when actual gdp and, therefore, revenue grow potential rate), recession opposite occur. thus, spend rule require general government accumulate budgetary save economic upswings may use downswings, allow behaviour public finance discipline automatic stabiliser function time. obviously, start point structural budget deficit, return budget balance require spend grow slowly nominal growth else discretionary increase revenues, balance achieved. evidence suggest application rule type upswing prior last crisis would substantially curb public spend permit year, allow generation significant room manoeuvre would limit deterioration public finance crisis. finally, press ahead various pending reform would raise economy’s growth potential – effect employment productivity – one basic determinant reduction public debt. these reform include, regulatory area, revision regulation hind market entry new firm limit growth; labour market, reform reduce degree duality improve employment prospect long-term unemployed; need increase efficiency legal system education system promote accumulation technological capital, among others. accordingly, delay implementation or, bad still, hypothetical reversal reform already introduce since start crisis, would significantly worsen prospect economic growth would make fiscal consolidation still need costly. conclusion let conclude recall challenge

reduce scope fiscal policy play countercyclical role adverse economic situations, particularly necessary valuable lever monetary union. also, need resort constantly financial market refinance substantial level debt current deficit increase vulnerability economy potentially adverse reaction investor sentiment, see recent years. face challenge minimise risk require complete fiscal

forum “confidence connectivity gms” speech dr. veerathai santiprabhob, governor bank thailand bangkok, june 1, 2017 excellencies, distinguish speakers, lady gentlemen. a good morning all. let first thank mr. tony shale, ceo euromoney asia, organize conference invite join year. it always great pleasure speak gm investment forum. let also extend warm welcome travel abroad. *** lady gentlemen, establish way back 1992, gm mark quarter century milestone year. to me, gm today like promise 25-year-old graduate prestigious university, full energy potential, way make mark career. the gm dynamic region, link richness great mekong river, abundant endowment opportunity await explored. last year, i express confidence future gms, result synergy connectivity harness years. today, i would like reiterate importance regional connectivity, prospect trade investment opportunity gm improve positive global economic outlook. i three key message gm connectivity share today would like invite part excite journey: let’s think young vibrant graduate i mentioned, much potential opportunity explore. she broaden skill horizon gain experience professional network time. she unavoidably face challenge along way. but support peers, together technological advancement, able stay course success. this similar vibrant gms. first: the gm region full opportunities. this owe geography, complementarity connectivity among member regions; second: gms’s endowment opportunity expand enhance financial connectivity, technology innovation; third: despite many challenges, policymakers private-sector partner make difference gm region. *** 2 1. why i say gm region opportunities? over past 25 years, integration within gm deepened, integrate diverse group member physical, trade, investment well people-to-people connectivity. even remarkable recent growth momentum gms. since 1992, ppp-adjusted gdp gm expand almost seven-fold $455 billion around $3 trillion, make it, aggregate, eighth large economy world, size british economy.1 intra-regional trade also increase 90-fold since inception.2 intra-regional investment growth also impressive. more specifically, last year, gm agree prioritize 100 infrastructure investment technical assistance project worth $32 billion next 3 years, include laem chabang-bangkok-dawei corridor myanmar thailand, vientiane-boten railway project laos.3 these remarkable development result continue efforts, within outside region, strengthen physical, trade, investment connectivity. while gms’s growth prospect promising, strength gm depend ability remain competitive. despite gms’s young population, grow middle class, increase urbanization, rich natural resources, cannot rest endowment past achievements. rather, find new way unlock potential gms. while physical infrastructure connectivity see much progress, i believe financial integration need complement infrastructure, trade, investment connectivity. this lead second topic. *** 2. how harness opportunity great financial connectivity? let introduce three potential benefit financial connectivity: (1) low costs, (2) broad coverage, (3) modern choices. on costs: cost cross-border financial transaction still relatively high gms. this especially true low value transaction cross-border remittances, fee high 13% value fund transferred.4 these high cost impede remittance also bilateral trade investment. we therefore need work solution promote competition innovations, make service affordable. while complete solution cross-border transfer yet emerge, significant progress make respect payment solution within gm country. in vietnam, onepay allow customer make financial transaction e-commerce websites, well deposit fund bank account without visit physical bank branch. wing cambodia, bcel lao wave money myanmar provide instant money payment transfer mobile phone recipient bank accounts. in thailand, promptpay modern, fast payment system provide free transfer service transaction 5,000 baht (or 150 u dollars), one cheap rate world. promptpay allow individual business transfer money bank e-wallets use mobile phone citizen id numbers. the thai government also us promptpay deliver electronic welfare payment individuals, 1 adb world bank statistics, 2015 2 adb, 2015: $5 billion 1992 $444 billion 2015 3 great mekong subregion regional investment framework implementation plan 2020, 2016 4 world bank remittance prices, 2017 3 view minimize costs, risk fraud well financial leakage. give promptpay’s open architecture, hope system soon integrate daily life thai public. up now, payment platform mostly use domestic transactions. what need connect platform facilitate large cross-border financial activity gms. have efficient cross-border payment platform gm yield tremendous benefit economic activity region, especially border trade. i believe take long solution cross-border payment become widespread. a now, partnership thai telecommunication company myanmar business offer cross-border remittance solution allow send money directly recipients, include rural area myanmar. in thailand, cooperation thai bank chinese fintech firm soon launch low-cost baht-yuan cross-currency remittance platform base blockchain technology. these initiative promise project low cost financial transaction, enhance close financial connectivity economic integration gm region. *** on coverage financial services: at present, financial service gm mainly provide local players. the increase cross-border trade investment call broaden cross-border players. a result, bank thailand, together central bank region work towards establish cross-border bank network so-called qualify asean bank qab framework, facilitate qualify bank asean increase presence another country. the expansion bank presence framework help increase coverage service efficiency need economic integration. the bank thailand process negotiate bilateral qab framework myanmar, indonesia, malaysia philippines. turn capital market, thailand also play proactive role connect capital market gm allow foreign entity – government private – raise fund thailand. last year, lao pdr launch 11-billion-baht issue (or $300 million) baht-denominated bonds, well-received investors. in addition, thailand allow firm gm list thai stock exchange view provide global investor wide coverage investment products. therefore, offer firm gm wide coverage fund raising. *** on choice financial services: in june 2014, world bank’s global findex estimate three-quarters adult clmv country still access financial services5. there room improvement fortunate live era technological advancement wonder mankind. financial service providers, old new, capitalize modern technology provide new – perhaps unimaginable – product services. these technology allow business by-pass traditional stage financial market developments, especially paper-based rely brick-and-mortar infrastructure. let cite example i find encouraging. in thailand, offshoot tmb bank, call me tmb, bank rely physical 5 world bank global findex 2014, measure number bank account 4 branches. vietnam similar model call timo bank. business conduct online, make full use digital payment technology. these bank pas reduce cost consumer form good offers, high deposit interest rate good services. a technology provide choices, room provide alternative ease regulations. take, example, local currency usage trade settlement direct investment subregion. the bank thailand currently work central bank region relax regulation use local currency cross-border trade investment. amid volatile global financial markets, offer business option choose currency trade settlements. exporter importer able reduce foreign exchange conversion cost good manage foreign exchange risk use local currency settlement. the local currency framework thailand conclude malaysia operational since 2016. we discuss similar framework indonesia, implement end year. we also bilateral swap agreement local currency china facilitate use renminbi thai baht bilateral trade investment. we hope similar framework soon expand gm countries. *** lady gentlemen, 3. let turn third message – challenge role policymakers support businesses. while gm first initiate policymakers, drive mostly businesses. in order support business development, policymakers need set proper incentives, governance structure regulatory framework foster close market linkage. i see two way address this. first, individual country must ensure rule regulation sufficiently flexible support innovative regional connectivity technologies. to provide regulatory flexibility support fintech thailand, allow innovative fintech product offer pre-tested so-called “regulatory sandbox”, design safe space business test innovative products, service business model delivery mechanisms. this arrangement make easy firm test products, regulator develop necessary regulatory requirement product launch public. second, light diverse financial system gms, domestic regulation policy need converge create integrate market. take payment systems, instance. currently, different system among country mean payment connectivity seamless. in words, “promptpay” speak “wave” “wave” speak “wings”. adhere harmonize standard ensure system able link within interoperable environment help overcome challenge. a result, i encourage gm policymakers cooperate diverse aspect bank businesses. at end day, make financial transaction within subregion much easier. *** 5 lady gentlemen, in current vuca world, rapid technological changes, we, policymakers central bankers, would need adapt ensure smooth transition new business-driven paradigm. we therefore welcome want seize opportunity gms. a solid platform road, ports, power grids, tourism infrastructure already exist gms. go forward, time envision gm integrate dimension too, particularly finance. this i view financial connectivity important element next chapter gms. a i mentioned, i see gm fresh graduate. at 25 year old, great future awaiting. let u walk her, help unlock potential, lend necessary support ensure success prosperity. i thank euromoney organize conference. i wish productive engage session today. thank you. stanley fischer: house financial stabilityspeech mr stanley fischer, vice chair board governor federal reservesystem, dnb (netherlands bank) - riksbank (sveriges riksbank) macroprudentialconference series, amsterdam, netherlands, 20 june 2017.* * *i grateful elizabeth klee, andreas lehnert, mary tian, alexandros vardoulakis thefederal reserve board assistance. view express presentation ownand necessarily federal reserve board federal open marketcommittee. it often say real estate center almost every financial crisis. that quiteaccurate, financial crisis can, do, occur without real estate crisis. but true thatthere strong link financial crisis difficulty real estate sector. in theirresearch financial crises, carmen reinhart ken rogoff document six majorhistorical episode bank crisis advance economy since 1970s allassociated house bust. plus, drop house price bust often big followingcredit-fueled house booms, recession associate house bust two threetimes severe recessions. and, perhaps significantly, real estate atthe center recent crisis.in addition role financial stability, instability, house also sector draw andfaces heavy government intervention, even economy generally rely marketmechanisms. come financial crisis, many jurisdiction undergo housingfinance reforms, enact policy prevent next crisis. today i would like focus onwhere stand role house real estate financial crises, weshould situation. we shall discus primarily situation unite states,and much less extent, countries.housing governmentwhy government involve house markets? house basic human need, andpolitically importantand rightly so. use once-popular term, house merit goodit beproduced private sector, benefit society deem many great enough thatgovernments strive make widely available. a such, course time, governmentshave support homebuilding country also encourage homeownership.governments involve house myriad ways. one way incentive forhomeownership. in many countries, include unite states, taxpayer deduct interestpaid home mortgages, various initiative state local authority support lower-income homebuyers. france germany create government-subsidized home-purchasesavings accounts. and canada allow early withdrawal government-provided retirementpension fund home purchases.andas knowgovernments also involve house finance. they guarantee credit toconsumers house agency u.s. federal house administration thecanada mortgage house corporation. the canadian government also guaranteesmortgages banks’ books. and various point time, jurisdiction explicitly implicitlybackstopped various intermediary critical mortgage market.government intervention unite state also address problem fundamentalilliquidity mortgages. go back 100 years, great depression, u.s. mortgagesystem rely small institution local deposit base lend markets. in face of123456 1 / 8bis central bankers' speech widespread run start great depression, bank hold large portfolio illiquidhome loan close, exacerbate contraction. in response, congress establishedhousing agency part new deal facilitate house market liquidity provide wayfor bank mutually insure sell mortgages.in time, house agencies, augment post-world war ii effort increasehomeownership, grow become familiar government-sponsored enterprises, gses:fannie, freddie, federal home loan bank (fhlbs). the g buy mortgage fromboth bank nonbank mortgage originators, turn, g bundle loan andsecuritized them; mortgage-backed security sell investors. the resultingdeep securitized market support mortgage liquidity lead broad homeownership.costs mortgage creditwhile benefit society homeownership could suggest case governmentinvolvement securitization measure expand mortgage credit availability, thesebenefits without costs. a rapid increase mortgage credit, especially isaccompanied rise house prices, threaten resilience financial system.one particularly problematic policy government guarantee mortgage-related assets. pre-crisis, u.s. agency mortgage-backed security (mbs) view investor animplicit government guarantee, despite gses’ representation contrary. because ofthe perceive guarantee, investor fully internalize consequence defaults, sorisk mispriced agency mb market. this mispricing notable, attributablenot improve liquidity, also implicit government guarantees. take together,the government guarantee result low mortgage rate likely boost mortgagecredit extend rise house price run-up crisis.another factor boost credit availability house price appreciation crisis wasextensive securitization. in unite states, securitization public privateentities weaken house finance system contribute lax lend standards, renderingthe mid-2000 house price bust severe. although cause somewhat obscure, itdoes seem securitization weaken link mortgage loan lender,resulting risk sufficiently calculate internalize institution along theintermediation chain. for example, even without government involvement, spain, securitizationgrew rapidly early 2000s account 45 percent mortgage loan 2007. observer suggest spain’s broad securitization practice lead lax lend standard andfinancial instability.yet, irish experience suggests, house finance system vulnerable even notrely securitization. although securitization ireland amount 10 percent ofoutstanding mortgage 2007, lax lend standard light regulatory oversight contribute tothe house boom bust ireland.macroprudential policiesto summarize, murky government guarantees, lax lend terms, securitization someof key factor make house crisis severe. since then, damp house price-credit cycle lead house crisis, country worldwide work create orexpand exist macroprudential policy would, principle, limit credit growth rateof house price appreciation.most macroprudential policy focus borrowers. loan-to-value (ltv) debt-to-income (dti)ratio limit aim prevent borrower take excessive debt. the limit also beadjusted response condition house markets; example, financial policy789101112131415 2 / 8bis central bankers' speech committee bank england authority tighten ltv dti limit threat tofinancial stability emerge u.k. house market. strict ltv dti limit find somemeasure success. one study conduct across 119 country 2000 2013 suggeststhat low ltv limit lead slow credit growth. in addition, evidence range studiessuggests decrease ltv ratio lead slow rate house priceappreciation. however, research suggest effectiveness ltv limit isnot significant somewhat temporary.other macroprudential policy focus lenders. first foremost, tighten bank capitalregulation enhance loss-absorbing capacity, strengthen financial system resilience. inaddition, bank capital requirement mortgage increase house price rise may beused lean mortgage credit growth house price appreciation. these policy areintended make bank mortgage lend expensive, lead borrower reduce theirdemand credit, tend push house price down. estimate effect suchchanges vary widely: after consideration range estimate literature, increaseof 50 percentage point risk weight mortgage would result house price decreasefrom low 0.6 percent high 4.0 percent. these policy effective ifborrowers fairly sensitive rise interest rate migration intermediation outsidethe bank sector nonbanks limited.of course, regulatory reform countries, macroprudential policiesare still beingimplemented, analysis currently way monitor effects. so far, researchsuggests macroprudential tighten associate slow bank credit growth, slowerhousing credit growth, le house price appreciation. borrower, lender, securitization-focused macroprudential policy likely useful strengthen financial stability.loan modification crisiseven though macroprudential policy reduce incidence severity house relatedcrises, may still occur. when house price drop, household mortgage may findthemselves underwater, amount loan excess home’s current price. asatif mian amir sufi point out, deterioration household balance sheet leadto substantial drop consumption employment. extensive mortgage foreclosures—thatis, undertake legal process evict borrower repossess house sellingthe house—as response household distress exacerbate downturn imposingsubstantial dead-weight cost and, property sold, cause house price fall further.modifying loan rather foreclose them, include measure reduce theprincipal balance loan change loan terms, allow borrower stay theirhomes. in addition, substantially reduce dead-weight cost foreclosure.yet countries, institutional legal friction impede desire mortgage modificationsduring recent crisis. and many cases, government step solve problem. forexample, u.s. mortgage loan securitized private-label mb rely theservicers loan perform modification. however, operational legal procedure forservicers limited, and, result, foreclosure, rather modification, wascommonly use early stage crisis. in 2008, new u.s. government policy wereintroduced address lack modifications. these policy help three ways. first, theystandardized protocol modification, provide servicers private-label security somesense common practice. second, provide financial incentive servicers modifyingloans. third, establish key criterion judge whether modification sustainable ornot, particularly limit mortgage payment percentage household income. this lastpolicy ensure borrower could actually repay modify loans, promptedlenders agree readily modification policy first place.16171819202122 3 / 8bis central bankers' speech ireland spain also aim restructure nonperforming loans. again, government involvementwas necessary push initiative forward. in ireland, mortgage arrears continue toaccumulate introduction mortgage arrears resolution target scheme 2013,and spain, 10 percent mortgage restructure 2014, follow governmentinitiatives protect vulnerable households. public initiative promote socially desirablemortgage modification time crisis tend accompany explicit public fund supporteven though government guarantee may absent normal times.what done? what need done?with recent crisis fresh mind, number country take step strengthen theresilience house finance systems. many egregious practice emergedduring lend boom unite statessuch no- low-documentation loan ornegatively amortize mortgageshave severely limited. other jurisdiction takingactions well. canadian authority withdraw government insurance back non-amortizinglines credit secure homes. the unite state european union require issuer ofsecurities retain credit risk good align incentive among participants(although unite states, mb issue fannie freddie currently exempt thisrequirement). and post-crisis, many country actively pursue macroprudentialpolicies, particularly target house sector. new zealand, norway, denmarkinstituted tight ltv limit guideline area overheat house markets.globally, introduction new capital liquidity regulation increase resilience ofthe bank system.but memory fade. fannie, freddie, federal house administration thedominant provider mortgage funding, fhlbs expand balance sheetsnotably. house price high rise several countries, perhaps result ofextended period low interest rates.what do move ahead?first, macroprudential policy help reduce incidence severity house crises.while policy focus cost mortgage credit, others attempt directly restricthouseholds’ ability borrow. each policy merit work respectiveadvantages important.second, government involvement promote social benefit homeownership, thosebenefits come cost, directly, example beneficial tax treatment ofhomeownership, indirectly government assumption risk. to extent,government support, present, explicit rather implicit, cost shouldbe balance benefits, include great liquidity house finance engenderedthrough uniform, guarantee instrument.third, capital regime take possibility severe stress seriously important calmmarkets restart normal process intermediation crisis materialize. a well-capitalized bank system necessary condition stability bank-based financial systemsas well large nonbank sectors. this necessity point importance havingresilient bank system also stress test system scenario sharpdeclines house prices.fourth, rule expectation mortgage modification foreclosure clear andworkable. past experience suggest lender borrower benefit substantially fromavoiding costly foreclosures. housing-sector reform consider police

information guide decision matter workingand private lives. obviously, age internet, public could obtain much thisinformation themselves, example website public agency privatecompanies, people would time consuming. for member thepublic, much practical obtain economic data want media.that mean journalist must report data accurately, manner easilyaccessible understandable, also, necessary, explain actually means; theymust able put data relevant context. obviously possible thejournalists good grasp economic concepts, relevance presentedin statistical form. on part, endeavour provide soundbites key message inselected local dialects; i would like commend local language medium support ourcause translate interpret policy matter benefit rural communityand “bottom pyramid”.the second type service require economic business journalism good analysis ofrelevant issues; journalist need go beyond report fact explain happen andwhy. this essential public acquire understanding, however rudimentary, theeconomic issue affect life economic policy. economic analysis muchmore demand term specialist expertise journalist reporting. journalist whospecialise economic analysis require good academic train

central bank reign inflation; result self-fulfilling episode wherefirms adjust prices, lead high actual inflation. naturally, mean mediais critical component policy transmission mechanism efficient

sannucci, deputy governor bank italy rome, june 19 2017 good morning lady gentlemen, on behalf governor visco, i please welcome bank italy rome. it indeed honour today bank italy host distinguish representative world bank institution involve important memorandum understand (mou). a part legal mandate, bank italy currently promote technical cooperation central bank institution emerge countries. through staff train activity consultancy, bank aim help improve institutional capacity beneficiary institutions, establish relationship strengthen reciprocal ties. moreover, bank italy’s representative numerous international organization institutions, world bank, cooperate various ways, ultimate purpose promote international financial stability smooth function payment system. the partnership launch today thus integral part general context. the cooperation world bank bank italy field statistic bear today. in october 2015 another mou two institution enter into. on occasion, several area collaboration point out: improve availability, quality cost-effectiveness data production inform policy make low middle income countries; engage research subject common interest; promote harmonization household surveys; engage entities, research institution local academia, give additional support abovementioned activities. in framework, institution co-founded center development data (c4d2) rome, work past 2 years. let share personal satisfaction contribute launch project organize wide knowledgeable team institution significantly improve statistical data welfare analysis develop country country too. contribute achievement world free poverty ultimate goal economist bear responsibility. to end, economic growth, although necessary, may sufficient condition everyone make progress. nowadays great concern possible effect technical progress globalization inequality. both develop develop countries, political institution must constantly monitor different segment population ensure one leave behind promote share prosperity. in perspective, sample survey acquire strategic role. cooperation field arise awareness macroeconomic data enough economic analysis. it essential look distribution phenomenon averages, particular deal household welfare inequality. microdata derive household survey powerful descriptive tool; employ complex statistical analysis study variable different individual’s occupational status, social environment personal value relate consumption 1 save behaviour. general model thus adapt new scenario measure refer estimate subgroups. throughout history, bank italy active producer statistics, particular household survey data. in june 1947 governor luigi einaudi, work constituent assembly member, advocate need collect information standard live italian citizens. by 1950s, bank italy already work doxa, private company, conduct survey household finances. in early sixties, bank italy conduct several pilot survey income, consumption save italian household 1966 first official survey conducted. since then, bank italy interview almost 200,000 household call survey household income wealth (shiw), collect biannual data several aspect economic behaviour. shiw data often use bank italy carry structure research project main economic themes, like save consumption behaviour, age pension systems, distribution wealth, measure well-being financial vulnerability. moreover, availability database contain large amount information italian household enable policy measure evaluated, thereby contribute inform public debate. thank free availability anonymous microdata, survey data also widely use academic research. a recent bibliography scientific work time use survey data include 800 article 450 author end 2016. this improve accountability bank enrich economic debate. over years, bank italy’s statistician explore methodological issue shiw detail, focus potential pitfalls. while standard methodological report allow analysis standard error always attach survey report, specific study carry various topics, like unit non-response, measurement errors, under- report micro-macro reconciliation. this long experience teach u sample survey adoption best practice collection survey data significantly increase reliability estimates. moreover, move towards standard widespread, comparison also positively affect change, add value statistical source. for number year bank italy promote project aim harmonize shiw data obtain surveys, luxembourg income study luxembourg wealth study. in recent year survey become part eurosystem's household finance consumption survey (hfcs), coordinate european central bank. the hfc include harmonize survey household income wealth 18 euro-area countries, well poland hungary. the network participant prove valuable forum exchange experience conduct survey foster adoption uniform best practices. we hope expertise acquire technical grind useful present project. 2 in fact, present time, survey data always share common standard regard sampling, coverage, definition variable valuation estimation method standard statistic like national account do. this particularly true develop countries, often face peculiar difficulty conduct sample surveys, due lack population lists, logistic problem territories, on. improve availability reliable data production valuable ingredient promote evidence-based policy making; why, although costly exercise, crucial low middle-income country invest field. the cooperation start today initially focus train objective improve quality coherence international train statistical capacity build microdata, support train activity field base low middle-income countries. in particular, project implement train program statistical capacity build household surveys, week-long train course workshops, hold bank italy’s premises, train session various statistical train centre africa. by adopt train trainer (tot) approach, project exploit multiplier effect, spread ability deal sample survey beyond participant reach large number low middle income countries. a le important aim project build network include expert many develop develop countries. the exchange experience beneficial improve statistical capacity household survey foster convergence towards common standards. let conclude word luigi einaudi often quote succeed governor bank italy. all policymakers, institution base modus operandi principle ‘conoscere per deliberare’ (know, decide).1 it express need policy base knowledge data, derive microsimulation model estimation analyse alternative scenario policy measures.2 einaudi would certainly approve effort make pursue current project. he would also appreciate presence number important italian institution today. it important bank italy alone endeavour. cooperation italian ministry foreign affair international cooperation, italian agency development cooperation, italian national institute statistic italian national institute health mean foster dialogue among different discipline recognize multidimensional nature human well-being, measurement aim household surveys. yet also testify commitment lead italian public institution work together strengthen cooperation develop countries. 1 l. einaudi, prediche inutili, opere di luigi einaudi, volume ii, einaudi, turin, 1964 (first edition 1956). 2 see example ando

part panel crawford australian leadership forum.the central issue is: future growth global australian economy comefrom?there four point i would like make.1. for while, growth come cyclical upswing global economy.over 2017, global economy improved. it story one two countries,but one broad based. after nearly decade, heal process financialcrisis well advanced, although still plenty scar tissue. the chinese economyhas continue grow, although fault lines. and europe, fewyears since underlie problem last erupted. globally, monetary policy remainsaccommodative, lot financial system repair fiscal policy longercontractionary. this helping.so good position time. to clear, nottalking boom still plenty risk there. but globally thing arebetter. animal spirit miss quite might start tocome back.2. at point, cyclical upswing run course. beyond that, much depend upondemographics technology. here reason pessimism optimism.many develop economies, well china korea, face big demographic challenges.populations stagnant declining. they also ageing. old society want save,rather invest, especially few people tomorrow aretoday. and old society likely risk averse. so major issue.on technology, i optimistic. there great advance make science: inthe material sciences, power generation storage, genetics health sciences,and compute artificial intelligence. it hard sure play out, butadvances area open possibility u imagine. they cantransform economy form basis new wave global investment higherliving standards. we can’t sure though: time tell. but clear lesson history isthat advance technology form backbone upon high live standard built.an obvious question create seize opportunity technology offers.there audience good inform this. i do, though,find hard escape conclusion start point must heavy investment inhuman capital creation culture promote innovation.a relate challenge deal distributional effect technological progress. thesheer scale global market mean potential gain innovator tap intothese market huge. at time, new technology globalisation createsome losers. at moment, society struggle deal tension. wehave strong interest work manage better. if don’t this, 1 / 2bis central bankers' speech technological progress globalisation could come see bad things, goodthings are. that would surely harm prospect long-run global growth.3. in australia, likely growth next couple year bite strong ithas recently.the pick-up global economy help us. the return mine investment morenormal level almost complete. monetary policy continue provide support survey-based measure business condition improve noticeably. employment growth hasalso strengthen recent months. these positive developments.we do, though, continue face headwinds. household gradually come gripswith slow growth real incomes. growth wage unusually low, average hoursworked decline nature employment changing. so recalibrationof expectation go on. many household also come grip high debt levelsand, large cities, high house prices. we need watch issue carefully.4. australia’s longer-term prospect remain positive, need keep work keep themthat way.over past couple week much discussion australia’s record run of26 year without technical recession. this significant achievement. we donebetter country long period. but case incline celebratetoo much, remember 26 year three period risingunemployment. our strong population growth also flat headline growth figures.as thing currently stand, look likely average growth per caput income thenext quarter century low past quarter century. we should,though, capable strong growth see past years. but wecan’t take granted. it important sharp focus reform canmake real difference live standards. if don’t this, fall behind. thepositive news shortage good idea here. the not-so-positive news isthat shortage good idea successfully navigate political process.as search reform make difference, need aware thedrivers growth economy changing. natural resource remain main exportearner, australian increasingly employ service industries. right across thespectrum, competitive advantage increasingly build technology managementcapability. this trend go go away need capitalise it. there nomagic solution. but, i say before, central ingredient lie investment humancapital. if grow strongly future, growth build much onthe quality idea quality natural resources.thank i look forward participate panel. 2 / 2bis central bankers' speech remark on the chilean economy mario marcel1/ governor, central bank chile april

board director bank international settlements, bundesbankpolicy symposium "frontiers central bank - past, present future", frankfurt main,14 june 2017.* * *1. introductionladies gentlemeni bid warm welcome today bundesbank policy symposium entitle "frontiersin central bank – past, present future".conferences like one fee knowledge experience participants. and that’swhy i’m proud many high-ranking academic policymakers accept ourinvitation today. let therefore extend cordial thank panellist andmoderators involve event. i particularly indebted otmar issing, willmake conclude remark end today’s proceedings.but karl popper point out, matter knowledgeable are: find whetherour idea sound, need people try on. that’s reason today’ssymposium, i would like thank organiser symposium and,especially, emanuel mönch team, arrange programme.ladies gentlemen, i’m quite sure i’m tell nothing new i say (modern) centralbanking consequence crises.the federal reserve prominent example. it establish 1913 answer tofinancial panics. when, 19th century, bank deposit begin emerge alongsidebanknotes, financial soundness become issue central banks. bank operate afractional reserve system susceptible bank run. that function centralbank lender last resort gain importance – development describe inparticularly lucid term british journalist, businessman, essayist walter bagehot hisbook "lombard street".financial panic bank run recur feature time, particularly thesecond half 19th century early year 20th century – unitedkingdom also unite state countries. the sole original purpose fed,then, preserve financial stability.according robert latham owen, one author federal reserve act, feed wasestablished "provide mean periodic panic shake american republicand enormous injury shall stopped."today, however, know place primary focus financial stability turn beproblematic. when speculative lend balloon late 1920s, fed, pursuit itsmandate, tighten monetary condition situation inflation rate already slightlynegative.while feed could stop asset price soaring, interest rate move contribute aneconomic downturn. this disconnect throw sharp relief mispricing asset markets.the crash october 1929 follow wave bank failures.12 1 / 7bis central bankers' speech have see impact great depression, central bank increasingly shift focustowards macroeconomic objectives: price stability – case feed – employment.financial stability, contrast, drop monetary policymakers’ radar.the deutsche bundesbank another example role crisis play definition ofa central bank’s mandate. when bank establish exactly 60 year ago, abroad understand primary objective "maintain stability thecurrency". after german population suffer loss save twice first halfof 20th century – early 1920s due hyperinflation, second world wardue suppress inflation cause wartime economy ensue currencyreform – hold price stability high store. and widely appreciate societythat bundesbank interpret mandate mean maintain price stability.the oil crisis 1970s 80 event shape central banking. it wasduring time merit politically independent central bank like bundesbank andthe swiss national bank come sharp focus. they able disconnect economiesfrom worldwide inflation train pursue policy aim squarely preservingprice stability. a consequence, institutional design form basis globalconsensus monetary policy – consensus still place today:1. central bank primarily aim maintain price stability, say, consumer pricestability.2. central bank independent governments.3. the credibility central banks’ commitment low, slightly positive inflation – byanchoring inflation expectation – key ability deliver price stability objective.this consensus shape statute many central banks, least europeancentral bank, agree upon 1991.but view fundamentally challenge crisis struck.central bank around world intervene massive scale: interest rate slash all-time lows, unprecedented non-standard measure roll out. this keep withthe then-reigning consensus: monetary policy cannot use effectively deflate bubble,but clean afterwards bubble bursts. a consensus call questionafter crisis.in euro area, financial economic crisis evolve sovereign debt crisis in2010, monetary policymakers repeatedly come pressure prevent crisis fromescalating. sometimes go limit mandate. 2. benefit boundary unconventional monetary policiescentral bank world react classic bagehot fashion financial crisiserupted. a soon mistrust private money market player begin take hold thespread risk premium secure unsecured money market transactionsskyrocketed, volume money market transaction fell number participant inmonetary policy operation soared.the govern council ecb react swiftly decisively switch refinancingoperations tender full allotment. a long bank able pledge adequatecollateral, receive unlimited amount liquidity eurosystem. in practice, this34 2 / 7bis central bankers' speech allow bypass strain interbank market. the govern council also offeredadditional longer-term refinance operations, include three-year refinance operation atthe end 2011 begin 2012 particular.this way, eurosystem take much money market's role intermediary. in sodoing, make sure monetary policy impulse would still find way real economy.and lend freely, help dispel concern banks’ liquidity thus prevent run.by provide oxygen economy, central bank able offer vital support. but longterm, oxygen supply substitute healthy heart. quite opposite, fact: tank ofoxygen take place exercise healthy diet, might prolong condition isadministered long.hence, abundant injection central bank money use bridge temporaryliquidity shortfall but, extremis, keep insolvent bank long-term life support, matterscould get tricky.the central bank safeguard bank risk promise central bankfunding even dubious situations, incentive take excessiverisks, course. raghuram rajan jean tirole, amongst others, convincingly arguedthat implicit promise central bank step low interest rate injectingliquidity bank default whet banks' appetite risk.this also show select appropriate strategy liquidity provision something abalancing act. be restrictive grant liquidity cause spark turn fire.granting liquidity liberally, hand, prop institution without sustainablebusiness models, may also mean water use extinguish fire end causingmore damage fire itself. this relevant hard determine ex antewhether institution illiquid insolvent.by token, another unconventional policy come risk attached, too. i talkingabout large-scale purchase sovereign debt deploy many centralbanks response crisis.by buy large quantity sovereign bonds, central bank able push long-terminterest rates. this provide additional monetary policy stimulus, cost potentiallybecoming sovereign’s large creditor. in currency union like european one, singlemonetary policy national economic fiscal policies, sovereign bond purchase blur thoseall-important boundary monetary fiscal policy.at end day, lead political pressure exert eurosystem tomaintain accommodative monetary policy long appropriate pricestability standpoint. after all, context asset purchases, change monetary policyimpact directly governments' fund cost interest rate moves. and arenaturally also problematic view discipline effect capital market ongovernment finances. this risk euro area particular, risk differentiation betweenthe different country significantly reduced. 3. the hot potato policy interventionstill, risk-reward profile sovereign bond purchase certainly differ depend theinstitutional set-up policy area question. a central bank buy federal bond drivedown long-term risk-free interest rate view speed inflation different kettleof fish one act lender last resort governments. and bring issue56 3 / 7bis central bankers' speech debate today’s second panel: "who will act? pass hot potato policyintervention."economists like paul de grauwe argue monetary policymakers channel innerbagehot come sovereign debt.in view, sovereign actually solvent suddenly fall prey sceptical gaze themarket drive insolvency rise interest burden. downgrade marketperceptions amount self-fulfilling prophecy, phenomenon economist refer asmarkets multiple equilibria.in case central bank come country's aid, accord de grauwe. just asacting lender last resort bank serf safeguard financial stability, so, too, couldcentral bank intervention government bond market fulfil purpose.but me, stretch analogy far. lend government different notcollateralised. walter bagehot advise central bank lend bank adequatecollateral, moral hazard minimised. buy sovereign bond amount lendingto government without mitigate risk moral hazard come it.a second difficulty stem fact exceedingly difficult determine thefundamentally justify price sovereign debt – words, impossible judgewhether market reaction justify overblown. in determine price themselves,central bank set pressure government tend think thatthey deserve good rates. it follow notion central bank act lender last resort government lessin keep bagehot tradition sometimes assumed.and run arguably far great problem moral hazard, especially monetary unionwith fiscally sovereign member states, i mention before.incentives reform public finance real economy stunted. if action take thenational level accountability locate european level, chance euro areagrowth atrophy rather accelerate.research also suggest provide central bank backstop government finance canhave detrimental effect capital allocation financial sector. a recent study viralacharya others look real effect announcement omt programme andfinds stabilise bank system, also increase zombie lend bank tounproductive firms. creditworthy firm industry prevalence zombie firm sufferedsignificantly credit misallocation, slow economic recovery.who, then, take hot potato policy intervention avoid pitfall last resortlending country run finance troubles? it might help look do tomitigate ill-effects central bank lend banks. the answer effective bankrecovery resolution regime. if bank turn temporarily illiquid truly insolvent,they need restructure resolved. a late allan meltzer quipped: "capitalismwithout failure like religion without sin. it work." this hold bank companiesin general. in euro area, progress make term require bank hold highercapital buff well establish single resolution mechanism.but similar progress lack come possibility restructure sovereign debt.the esm could function vehicle regime. but crucial element still missing.one element change contractual term government bond euro area by78 4 / 7bis central bankers' speech introduce automatic maturity extension bonds, would activate momentum government apply esm programme. ongoing deficit would therefore financed, butoriginal creditor would pay mature bonds.not would continue provide incentive private creditor lend cautiously, wouldalso significantly reduce need financial aid esm programme. furthermore, itwould vastly broaden scope rescue mechanism. have possible automaticallyextend maturity bond back 2011, portugal would need around €43 billion tocover entire budget deficit 2014, rather €76 billion total receive inassistance loans.this solution would allow esm work restructure regime. automatic maturityextension buy time figure whether country merely face liquidity shortfall is, infact, insolvent. bond buy private creditor still restructure late date, whileofficial support use smooth economic adjustment process.of course, financial system must also able withstand debt restructuring. otherwise,precious little would gained. because privilege regulatory treatment allow bank tobuy almost unlimited amount government bonds, require back withcapital, haircut particularly risky banks. that get change.not bank begin hold sufficient capital government bond size ofindividual exposure limited, bank able effectively cope process ofrestructuring sovereign debt. and likely concrete political takesuch action. government bond far risk-free. bank regulation shouldacknowledge fact all.capping size individual sovereign exposure bank balance sheet would provide muchof diversification benefit envisage european safe bond proposal theeuropean commission recently take up. that proposal conceive diversify securitywhere member state sovereign debt pool divide safe tranche juniortranche, thereby provide risk-free assets.but european safe bond create official european entity could perceive astepping stone towards

sensibly add maturity extension feature junior bond. combine witheffective regulation sovereign bonds, solution would offer advantage ofdiversification safe-asset generation arguably much feasible politically.these step would allow potato take it’s hot. but, course, would bebetter still let matter come boil first place. and mean strengtheningsustainable growth.i’m convince share view it’s

formidabletask. but effort spar address topic, central bank need beaware that, often not, change result crisis, technology.every technology come technical risk – recent wannacry cyber attack case inpoint. but main challenge central bank probably lie tectonic shift triggeredby digitalisation. digitalisation spawn new form financial intermediation. while mightbe boon economy, central bank face

2000 level expect continue improve implementation product market reform raise competition various sector economy.  at time, sweep structural reform implement cover pension system, health system, labour markets, product markets, business environment, public administration, tax system framework fiscal policy conducted, privatization programme on-going.  recapitalisation restructure take place bank system, enable withstand crisis deterioration banks’ asset quality. in addition, significant institutional reform initiate aim reduce volume non-performing loans. slide 2 on account developments, evidence economy undergo rebalancing towards tradable, export-oriented sectors. a figure indicative force exerted.  the share export gdp increase 19% 2009 32% 2016 increase stem export goods. in fact, accord eurostat data, greece’s export good increase 43% since 2009 real terms, compare 42% euro area 47% germany, europe’s export engine. 3  between 2010 2015, relative price tradables versus non-tradables rise 10%. whereas sector hit hard recession, tradables perform good non-tradables outward-looking company increase exports, take advantage improvement competitiveness. a result, relative size tradables sector, measure gross value added, grow approximately 12% volume term 24% nominal terms. finally, term employment, size tradables sector increase relative non-tradables sector around 8%. these figure would improve reform already implement enhance plan esm programme. base estimate oecd, full implementation reforms, undertake scheduled, expect boost real gdp 10-year-horizon 13%. and figure exclude positive effect structural reform cannot easily quantify modernisation public administration judiciary system, strengthen insolvency regulation resolution non-performing loans. in-house work bank greece provide similar estimate effect structural reform main effect come high total factor productivity (tfp) growth. 2. challenge remain in spite positive developments, considerable stock disequilibria remain:  unemployment, though falling, remain high (at 23%); job creation, although robust, dominate temporary part-time jobs.  the general government debt gdp ratio rise unsustainable level (179% gdp).  the private debt overhang hamper banks’ ability support recovery grant new credit. in addition, despite fact structural competitiveness improve period 2013-2014 (according number index compile oecd, 4 world bank, world economic forum), greece still rank low end advance economies, progress stall even retreat slightly recent years. 3. prospect sustainable comeback financial market slide 3 in order address remain challenges, improve future growth prospect greek economy, ensure comeback financial market 2018, several condition met. a. implementation 2nd review reform first foremost, follow closure second review, necessary smooth timely implementation agree growth enhance reforms. delay close second review increase uncertainty reduce confidence which, couple high tax burden, reverse positive course economic activity 2016 q4. a consequence, follow mild recession 2015, economy stagnate 2016. however, positive medium-term outlook still possible, conditional smooth implementation agree reforms. consumption expect continue rebound, drive robust employment, recover fast output, point job-rich recovery. investment project increase confidence restore financial condition improve. export project benefit benign global economic outlook past improvement cost competitiveness. finally, although sizeable over-performance 2016 assess mainly temporary nature, 2017 target expect meet safe margin. moreover, rebalancing budget towards growth-friendly composition would support economic recovery. b. implementation growth enhance reform boost export attract fdi 5 second, growth enhance reform need boost export attract fdi needed. the economic adjustment structural improvement past six year make greece business friendly create significant investment opportunities. however, domestic save insufficient meet investment need greek economy that, long period low investment rates, significant. thus, besides restore access company capital markets, condition encourage attract foreign capital, notably form foreign direct investment. in order attract domestic foreign investment, emphasis give reform improve business environment, enhance competition reduce excessive regulation, protectionism, bureaucracy complex legislation. for example, investment license procedure need simplified, administrative burden business reduced, remain regulate profession network industry open up, public administration modernise strengthened, judicial efficiency enhanced, court proceed speed course personal corporate taxation lowered. additionally, effective use domestic high-skilled human capital (and return high-skilled scientist executive work abroad) require adoption policy reform encourage research, facilitate diffusion technology boost entrepreneurship. policy include provide incentive increase investment research development (r&d), strengthen link enterprise academic/research community allow university commercially exploit research result ideas, effectively use available eu funds. alongside structural reforms, order facilitate recovery normalization financial conditions, matter urgency private debt overhang problem addressed, since great challenge greek bank system greek economy faces. on one hand, high stock npls reduce bank profitability thus constrain supply credit, primarily affect bank dependent smes. on hand, high npls delay corporate restructure thus thwart 6 ability viable firm finance new investment projects. accord research oecd, industry capital sink non-viable (“zombie”) firms, average viable firm undertake le investment otherwise. simulation oecd suggest reduce share capital non-viable firm greece minimum across oecd country would associate gain investment typical viable firm 4.7%, improve productivity-enhancing capital reallocation greek economy. a series legislative regulatory reform already enact part strategy reduce npls, operational target individual banks, revision insolvency law gradual setup secondary market npls. in addition, number new measure already legislate prior action second review, introduction out-of-court workout framework, revision corporate insolvency law launch platform electronic auctions. besides structural reform npl management, growth prospect also improve act fiscal policy front two ways:  first, growth friendly fiscal policy mix adopted. the increase emphasis taxation need reduce favour policy focus restrain restructure non-productive spend make effective efficient use public sector’s assets, especially land.  second, medium-term fiscal target reduced. accord estimate bank greece, low general government primary surplus target 2021 onwards 2 per cent gdp, 3.5 per cent envisage now, would consistent debt sustainability combine mild debt relief measure structural reform raise potential growth. the ease primary surplus targets, together implementation agree structural reforms, would put necessary condition place gradual low tax rates, positive multiplier effect economic growth. 7 c. ensure debt sustainability a final condition return financial market ensure debt sustainability. the ratio general government debt gdp still high. in 2008 ratio stand around 110%. it around 179%. the debt path strongly affect so-called snowball effect – arise interest rate debt much high growth. indeed, 2010 2016, snowball effect estimate 82% gdp. but whatever cause rise, crucial put sustainable path. in context proposal area fiscal policy making, bank greece recently make specific proposal ensure sustainability manageability public debt. the short-term measure decide eurogroup meet december 5, 2016 positive step expect reduce public debt ratio gdp 20 percentage point 2060. however, ensure sustainability public debt go forward, additional medium-term measure necessary. when debt-to-gdp ratio 100%, measure reduce interest payment debt improve ratio quick rise primary balance. slide 4 the interest burden greek public debt low 2021 increase substantially thereafter payment defer interest efsf loan interest new debt issue financial markets. a simulation perform bank greece defer interest efsf loans, extend weight average maturity 8.5 year – option 1 right-hand diagram. slide 5 if, addition interest deferment, assume primary surplus target 3.5 percent 2018-2020 reduction 2 percent thereafter, see left-hand diagram debt path close primary surplus 3.5 per cent 10 year assumed. this exercise indicative admittedly mild debt relief measure significant effect debt profile cost creditors. 8 however, right-hand diagram shows, term gross finance needs, option 1 make debt sustainable margin. hence, debt relief measure necessary order reduce gross finance need significantly 20% threshold bring debt sustainable path. of course, interest smooth accompany high growth, consequence low primary surpluses, debt-to-gdp profile gross finance need would favourable. alternatively, interest rate smooth occur cost share equally greece esm, would also lead favourable outcomes. 4. conclusion final remark the economic adjustment structural improvement past seven year make greece business friendly, create significant investment opportunities, generate positive prospect greek economy. the realization positive prospect require consistent determine implementation reform privatization programme include tackle private debt overhang problem. these enable adoption medium-term measure ensure sustainability greek public debt, pave way inclusion greek government bond ecb’s quantitative ease programme. such development set motion virtuous circle lead greece’s return international financial market 2018, elimination capital controls, return financial normality definite exit crisis. in order capitalize macroeconomic fiscal adjustment achieve far, institution european partner must act decisive bold manner specify medium-term debt relief measure sustainability greece’s public debt, which, agree last year, go effect end current programme. this must do market greece need borrow end programme summer 2018 demand know whether debt sustainable not. we aware fact re-gaining access financial 9 market end current programme way forward. no one, neither partner greece, mood another memorandum. sources: mcgowan a. andrews, m. d. millot v. 2017 “the walk dead: zombie firm productivity performance oecd countries”. oecd

vice‐governor, central bank chile  i would like start thank organizer invitation.  let start disclaimer. next monday, april 3rd, board central bank chile present inflation report senate. therefore, i able occasion offer detail discussion macroeconomic situation perspective chile, describe detail report. rather, i decide focus broad issue relevant chile region current scenario.  during 2017, finally witness process monetary policy normalization unite states. after almost 8 year keep federal fund rate essentially zero, federal reserve start gradual process interest rate hikes. this good news. fundamentally, normalization monetary policy natural consequence normalization u economy global financial crises. a normal u economy positive phenomenon world economy.  however, transition period may become bumpy. indeed, previous episode rate hike federal reserve smooth emerge economies. the obvious example debt crisis early 1980s. on top series macroeconomic imbalance many latin american countries, sharp raise interest rate generate strong reversal capital flow pressure fx market region induce collapse financial market activity across countries.  since early 1990s, identify two main period interest rate rise unite states, see figure 1. the first one start february 1994, comprise hike 300 bp almost year. the second one take place decade late when, quarter historically‐low rates, feed start process rate normalization june 2004, increase almost 450 bp two years.2  for sake presentation, i want offer simple comparison two episodes, dimension similar. in particular, cyclical position u economy arguably similar occasions, process monetary policy normalization pretty comparable.  however, performance emerge market two episode different. indeed, overall, process feed fund increase early 1994 follow large difficulty develop economy follow years, mexican crisis december 1994 first example. thereafter, series bank balance payment crisis follow latin america elsewhere3. the impact fed’s tighten cycle 1990s emerge market widespread 1980s episode been, country like chile colombia able 1 remark 2017 iif latin america economic forum, asunción, paraguay saturday april 1st, 2017. i acknowledge support diego gianelli mauricio hitschfeld preparation speech. these remark imply endorsement central bank chile board members. 2 there third episode june 1999 june 2000. this process 150 bp hike understand final adjustment along 1994 episode. 3 see, example, discussion garcía‐herrero, a., 1997, bank crisis latin america 1990s: lesson argentina, paraguay venezuela, imf work paper 97/140. see also sachs, j., a. tornell a. velasco, 1996, financial crisis emerge markets: the lesson 1995, nber work paper 5576. 2 weather period relatively well keep high growth rates.4 but ample evidence that, context several macroeconomic imbalance several emerge economies, 1994 episode trigger series difficulty crisis configure macroeconomic map develop world second half decade.  in contrast, monetary policy normalization process start 2004, negative effect emerge economies. moreover, 2004‐2007 period one prosperity stability across develop world. of course, global financial crisis 2008 derail everything, difficult argue consequence hike cycle mid 2000s. if anything, might consequence lack timely normalization.  hence, although many common feature 1994 2004 cycles, consequence different. what i want talk identify feature help u reflect case. i think useful extract lesson current process monetary policy normalization us. 1994‐2004 normalization cycle  a start point, important notice 1994 2004 episode comparable two reasons. first, federal reserve start hike context inflation 2% unemployment rate around 6%. this course simplify characterization business cycle, offer good base comparison.  beyond that, monetary policy adjustment unite state look quite similar cases. not size speed hike feed funds’ rate comparable. also, panel a figure 2 shows, shape yield curve move similarly, flatten 150 basis point 10‐ 2‐year u government bond first year.5 in relate phenomenon, show panel b, term premium implicit valuation 10‐year u government bond also drop 1 2 percentage point two year start cycle.  essentially, monetary policy shock shift yield curve comparable episodes. indeed, lack response long term rate short term hike mid 2000s, label “conundrum” phenomenon alan greenspan was, extent, also present mid 1990s.6  however, many dimensions, two episode show distinct features. (see panel c e figure 2.) first, 1994 one, sharp increase credit spread emerge economies, contribute difficulty balance payments. in le year, embi credit spread increased, average, 1,000 basis points. a decade later, feed fund increase follow secular decline embi spread emerge markets. this contrast strikingly episode decade later, feed fund increase generate increase credit spread rather accompany secular decline embi spreads. a year later, embi spread fall 150 basis points.  a second informative feature similar evolution dollar episodes. it natural expect hike cycle unite state would strengthen u dollar relative currencies. this indeed happen 1994 cycle, u dollar broad appreciate 7% 2 year almost 30% 4 years. in contrast, dollar weaken 5% 4 it asian crisis 1998 consequence balance payment pressure directly felt across develop world. 5 hereafter, panel figure 2 center around month hike cycle started, label month 0. these correspond february 1994, june 2004 december 2015. 6 in case, sharp increase 1994, yield 10‐year u government bond fell significantly 1995 level similar observe hike cycle. 3 first 12 month 2004‐2006 cycle, time federal reserve increase short term rate 200 basis points.  because period dollar strength tend coincide period weak commodities, surprise see commodity flat/declining trend second half 1990s. indeed, high world interest rates, high credit spread low commodity price contribute weaken emerge market economies. the opposite happen 2004 cycle. even context fast increase short term rate unite states, u dollar weaken commodity price increase significantly.  a i mentioned, fact dollar depreciate 2004‐2006 cycle informative phenomenon occur world time. commodity price risk appetite favorable emes, lead important growth gain real exchange rate appreciations. in three year follow begin hike cycles, currency latin american country strengthen average 13%.7 while federal reserve raise short term rates, develop country same.  the good performance emerge economy 2004‐2006 tighten cycle unite states, could respond many factors. three thing stand out: many emerge market much prepare face restriction world financial conditions. the move towards flexible exchange rates, good fiscal policy strong financial supervision improve resilience. the tighten unite state worsen financial condition emes. quite opposite; credit spread become favorable. why happened? the natural answer china. the increase relevance china world economy world trade follow accession wto, generate boom effect commodity market world demand compensate negative effect increase world interest rates, give important support balance payment, fiscal account investment outlook emerge economies.  we early stage new historical tighten cycle unite states. it reasonable ask comparable current situation relative previous experiences. i want make point here. we expect feed move gradually previous occasion  why? first, feed prefer err side move slowly, market expect so. in part, see figure 3, inflation measure pce core still low compare level previous hike cycles. also, neutral rate estimate low time, feed consider monetary policy expansionary headline feed fund rate suggests.  besides, federal reserve much aware financial stability risk abrupt change rates. the term premium implicit long term yield low, taper tandrum episode 2013 show change fast market misinterpret feed communication. the fact previously cycle happen good news, series good output number us, higher‐than‐expected inflation prints, change strategy manage balance sheet feed could, trigger significant increase long term rates. 7 bis‐based real exchange rates; argentina, brazil, chile, colombia, méxico, perú venezuela. 4 the current trajectory dollar/commodities/credit spread provide mix evidence  other dimension suggest somewhat 1994 2004 episodes.  the dollar strengthen multilateral term last quarters, similarly see 1994. commodity show mild upward trend. definitely smooth trend 2004, also markedly bullish 1994. finally, embi spread decrease tandem 2004. indeed, capital inflow return massively region last months. in words, commodity supportive emerge economy previous decade, market show high appetite emerge market debt.  this suggest two things. on one hand, room recovery emerge economies, market price in. but hand, recovery support commodity cycle experience 2000s, region expose financial shock come disorderly normalization monetary policy unite states. emerge economy good prepare 1990s absorb shocks, expect subsidy come commodity windfall. one final point china  china become source stability world economy last decade (isn´t role china play global financial crisis 2009 2010?), become interconnect rest world, also subject pressure capital account balance payments. the risk emerge economy face u rate increase relevant china, too. this time, bumpy process monetary normalization u could become amplify rather ameliorated, depend upon china able adjust it. and time, room look smaller.  thank 5 figure 1 panel a: federal fund rate (percent) source: bloomberg panel b: feed fund hike cycle (percentage points)

express sincere appreciation keynotespeakers, professor thomas sargent new york university president john williams thefederal reserve bank san francisco, well moderators, presenter anddiscussants. special thank professor sargent also great help u yearin organize conference. it nearly decade since global financial crisis. and look back theseyears, global economy emerge condition low growth low inflation along time, even unprecedented accommodative fiscal monetary policy carriedout around world. to make matter worse, financial imbalance increased, mainly emes,as international capital flow emes surged, backdrop continue low interestrates worldwide, private debt level country soared. fortunately, global economy seem regain growth momentum, theinternational financial market stable. however, trade protectionism geopolitical risk areincreasing part world, normalization monetary policy u isexpected continue. productivity growth also yet return pre-crisis level. in viewof this, cannot sure current global economic recovery financial stability willbe sustained. and structural problem build since pre-crisis period makeit even difficult confident. in situation, i think take year’s conference meaningful opportunity tolook challenge lie ahead u next decade, discus way dealingwith them. today, i would like talk bite challenge many countriesface common, possible policy response address them. first, income inequality rise important global policy agenda. income gap among thedifferent social class widen many countries, could impair virtuouscircle economic growth lead increase employment income, helpgrowth strengthen further. recently, globalization technological innovation beingheld responsible worsen income inequality. notably, era fourth industrialrevolution, progress, concern number unskilled job could declinerapidly. however, cannot go flow globalization technological innovation. andin regard, international organization imf world bank recommend weshould pursue “inclusive” growth, ensure many people share benefit ofgrowth. more specifically, create jobs, increase household income expand thesocial safety net recognize relevant policy promote inclusive growth. we talkmore topic session two today, “inclusive growth employment.”another challenge must tackle population aging, progress rapidly inmany countries. population age likely undermine economic growth reduce laborsupply sap aggregate demand time. for korea, particular, pace ourpopulation age rapid, preparation insufficient, negative effect populationaging growth seem likely substantial. in response this, proper policy measure need 1 / 2bis central bankers' speech put place, ease rapid drop elderly consumption sametime strengthen social support relate child birth child care. the theme

courteous relaxed. even discussion within ecb’s governingcouncil good, even critical voices.but it’s german complain ecb, isn’t it?of course, criticism germany somewhat vocal countries. that also hasto germany’s role financial euro crisis. because, one hand, hadalready undertake important reform strong position. and because, otherhand, people germany tradition highly indebted. that’s cultural thing – ivery much share it. but it’s also factor play role origin crisis.how?it concern creditor-debtor relationship: crisis, germany significant lender toother countries. german saver invested, mainly via banks, lot money abroad – thosecountries household company big debts, example spain. and crisiscame money flow back – €400 billion come back spain alone large part ofthat originate german savings. the ecb make liquidity available bank exchange forcollateral. that prevent meltdown financial system, otherwise would lead tostrongly deflationary pressure across euro area.so germany also

bear mind thatlenders well protect crisis – none germany’s largeneighbours slip depression. that would serious impact theeconomy, least germany.what say people put money one side month month order

savings, also borrow money– example, buy house. and result show advantage offset thedisadvantages.so there’s reason complain?yes is, course everyone benefits. all monetary policy decision 1 / 3bis

writes. and he’sright.italy currently case euro area’s problem child. nowhere else economygrowing slowly; nowhere else bank sit many non-performing loans.how serious situation?indeed, italian economy hasn’t grow 20 years. real gdp per caput – take inflation intoaccount – stagnate period. italy therefore deep-seated problem. thegovernment address that, also convince people support reforms. in fact,the economy great potential, many creative enterprises.until now, greece always euro area’s shaky prospect. but country justagreed new loan debt relief international creditors. observersare

speech gent sejko: monetary policy country region -between u federal reserve european central bankspeech mr gent sejko, governor bank albania, becici summit countriesof region "regional financial stability new global environment", becici, montenegro, 16june 2017.* * *dear mr. chairman,dear colleagues,i would like start thank organizer invitation. a usual, i find highly useful toshare, among colleagues, opinion common challenges.the title panel suggest monetary policy stance somehow shape ecband feed monetary policy paths. though far full picture, true, someextent.the monetary policy central bank highly relevant us. they affect externalconditions could dictate directions, speed price financial flows.furthermore, country dollarized euroized financial system, might also affectdomestic credit, financial conditions, balance sheets, well exchange rates.so, bring u follow questions. where monetary policy sit currentsituation? what challenge face? and, respond shift externalmonetary policies? i quite confident issue broadly cover event.now let make remarks, regard monetary policy bank albania vis-à-visthat ecb fed.the boa pursue expansionary monetary policy, supportedand facilitate monetary policy stance ecb.during past four years, bank albania engage extensive course ofmonetary accommodation. in presence weak cyclical development low inflationarypressures, decrease policy rate historical minimum 1.25%. furthermore:we increase liquidity injection bank system;we adopt negative rate require reserve euro, line policy ofnegative deposit interest rate euro area;we engage clear transparent forward guidance, announce ourpreference accommodative policy line inflation target;however, unlike feed ecb, similarly central bank region,we activate unconventional monetary policy tools.this monetary policy accommodation pursue ecb facilitate theimplementation monetary policy.on one hand, low price euro help decrease cost foreign currency loans;on hand, low policy rate ecb enable u decrease policy ratewithout worry exchange rate depreciation financial stability problems. 1 / 4bis central bankers' speech this last one important, give around 40% foreign currency loan un-hedged.at point, i would like take opportunity mention that, order addressthe high euro exposure financial system, bank albania, together otherauthorities, draft plan decrease level euroization country.anyway, turn back topic, accommodative monetary policy essential insupporting growth inflationthe accommodative monetary policy successful ease financial condition andsupporting high consumption investments:lending cost decrease approximately 400–500 basis points;liquidity risk premia system greatly reduced;government’ bond yield curve flatten somewhat;credit growth recover mostly support lend domestic currency;to wrap up, macroeconomic perspective:the economic activity strengthen track meet inflation target withinthe relevant time horizon;our financial system remain liquid well capitalized, profitability ratio arepositive;however, external background seem get complex.the feed ecb follow slightly different policy paths.for past years, federal reserve european central bank pursuedsomewhat diverse monetary policy stances.the feed appear tighten side. it raise policy rate 2016 2017, twoyears gradually reduce quantitative ease program. at time, forwardguidance suggest tighten path near future.in meantime, ecb face different set economic conditions, include slowergrowth, low inflation, high economic political uncertainty. a result, ecb stillholding accommodative monetary policy longer. the forward guidance suggest thatthis path continue least current year.these bring u conclusion potential international spillover fromthese divergent policies, small open economies.as result financial globalization, monetary policy major advance economy hassignificant spillover global economy. likewise, change market expectation thefuture course policy high impact financial market volatility.furthermore, region’s economy small open economies, whose main trade andeconomic partner euro area. in addition, bank system country aredominated eu-based bank groups. so, even though feed ecb’s monetarypolicy decision affect domestic economy financial systems, might adelayed, probably long last effect economies. 2 / 4bis central bankers' speech depend intensity, trade bank channel might affect monetarypolicy stance monetary policy decisions.given exposure dollar euro , ecb monetary policy stance morerelevant economy. in words, strong direct impact ourmonetary condition financial systems.let take albania example, whose main trade partner eu countries:roughly three quarter trade direct eurozone countries.over 60% fdis originate eu.the euro main foreign currency financial system – 4/5 foreigncurrency asset liability common currency.furthermore, study indicate effective basket currency albania would compriseroughly 75–80% euro, rest would usd currency peg it.all indicator mean much expose policy stance across theeuro area, policy stance feed affect u indirectly.at point, presume tighten ecb monetary policy:would increase foreign currency lend cost economy, i.e. tighten financialconditions;if follow monetary policy, would cause internal portfolio-shifts depreciationpressures exchange rate;would result major capital outflows, benefit much capital inflow theextraordinary expansionary policy pursue ecb;on hand, tighten feed monetary policy would affect albaniadirectly, apart usual negative implication might oil commodityprices.however, i state monetary policy would benefit predictablemonetary policy stance ecb near future.a predictable stance monetary policy eurozone enhance effectiveness ourmonetary policy. a wide interest rate differential might lead appreciation pressure theexchange rate, can, take consideration policy analysis actions.to conclude, let recap points:albania remain much expose ecb rather feed policies;our expansionary monetary policy greatly facilitate policy stance theecb fed;the relative stability feed ecb monetary policy help u reduce

deutschebundesbank, 26th annual security finance collateral management conference,berlin, 21 june 2017.* * *1. introductionladies gentlementhank much kind invitation give today’s keynote speech high-levelconference. for me, board member responsible market operation bundesbank,this conference constitute great opportunity exchange view current challenge thefields security finance collateral management.“the convergence liquidity” promise title. to honest, though: at least regard tothe liquidity eurosystem inject markets, – unfortunately – sign ofconvergence towards certain value yet. most well aware governingcouncil ecb decide two week ago leave asset purchase programme (app)unchanged now. the eurosystem continue buy security app tuneof eur 60 billiona month least december 2017. hence, mathematically speaking, lineargrowth name game – least now. excess liquidity, essential indicator formonetary policy implementation, currently stand eur 1,650 billion.i would like take opportunity today elaborate three issue are, least somedegree, interlink eurosystem’s activity markets. first, i would like discussthe remarkable upswing asset price financial crisis driver development.second, i would like briefly discus shift financial market respect marketliquidity. i argue that, whereas factor affect market liquidity temporary,others – regulatory environment innovation trade – stay. finally iwill conclude present view outlook monetary policy implementation. 2. current driver financial marketsthe financial crisis 2008 subsequent european debt crisis deal financial market aserious blow. investor reconsider long-held belief accept truths: thatlarge bank immune bankruptcy, sovereign develop world would neverdefault debt. when crisis hit unimaginable happened, price financialassets, apart view safe havens, go tailspin.this history. asset price rebound remarkably. stock market europe well theus reach new historic heights. corporate debt high demand, risk premia haveshrunk noticeably, even heavily indebted entities. price also increase moretangible asset real estate. naturally, continue rise asset price fuellingspeculation potential bubbles. however, judge whether price development constitute abubble reflect fundamental sustainable factor simple task. 1 / 7bis central bankers' speech 2.1 recovery asset price qethere little doubt extraordinary measure take central bank shore liquidityhave play significant part price developments. they reassure markets, rebuiltconfidence create environment investor will put moneyinto risky assets. it important remember intend effect. for economyto grow again, business household need access affordable capital. investmentis lifeblood recovery.however, is, course, concept much good thing. unintended side effect ofquantitative ease become apparent long programme run le isneeded sustain economic recovery. so far, positive effect may well outweighedthe negative implications, bind change point.quantitative ease design work nudge investor away safe haven andtowards risky assets. however, one realise balance strike ratherdelicate. there serious risk investor start underestimate risk theirinvestments, lead price distortion misallocation capital. an abundance liquiditywill make risky investment le so. market participant think carefullyabout happen ample liquidity provision stops.additionally, thorny issue whether private investor crowd ofcertain market segment central bank long-term effect are. although theeurosystem put high value implement purchase programme market-neutralway, must acknowledge area concern.apart concern private investor simply crowd time andassociated question market functioning, also concern investor willcome back purchase programme end. it certainly eurosystem’s intention toharm capital markets: quite contrary. nevertheless, need recognise investorsprobably likely flood immediately.but wise person said: difficult predict – especially future. instead oflooking crystal ball, i would like discus two driver play major role forasset valuations. 2.2 the macroeconomic environmentthe first one, current macroeconomic environment, convincing. while recovery wasrelatively anaemic long time, seem gather pace last two threeyears. this part thank unconventional measure take eurosystem.quarterly growth euro area improve range 0.2 percent and0.8 percent last 16 quarters. the late read april put unemployment rate 9.3percent. that still high, nevertheless mark improvement peak of12.1 percent mid-2013. and spirit up: economic sentiment close nearly 10-yearhigh.inflation, however, remain sore point. accelerate inflation begin year hascome again. after hit 2.0 percent february, high read since january2013, inflation retreat 1.4 percent may. the oil-price effect subside onceagain onus economic growth generate inflation. the govern council ecbputs strong emphasis underlie inflation. it important credibility policydecisions take strong footing. they cannot behold monthly volatility data 2 / 7bis central bankers' speech publications.so overall, macroeconomic backdrop provide justification price developmentsover last years. asset price rise growth prospect improve. naturally, itwould welcome see asset price inflation translate reasonable level consumerprice inflation well. 2.3 political uncertaintywhile macroeconomic backdrop promising, still complication ahead. politics,another driver asset price i would like briefly discuss, create lot headline overthe last year. these development substantially affect high valuation levels,though.the first major test come form brexit referendum june 2016. the decision amajority uk voter leave european union come quite shock. market exhibitedsubstantial volatility response. this response short-lived, though, market haveremained orderly throughout. next presidential election unite states. marketsadjusted even quickly new circumstances. the constitutional referendum italy indecember 2016 barely register markets.however, political risk remain concern markets. the run-up french presidentialelection investor worried, evidence widen spread french germansovereign bonds. and view u somewhat turn exuberance waryidealism become clear implement stimulus measure promise thetrump administration walk park all.looking forward, question u political agenda remain relevant, roadahead brexit negotiation give investor much interpret think about. theoutcome uk election might well complicate negotiation rest theeuropean union further. in addition, election season europe quite over, germangeneral election due september.the brexit negotiation reflect price financial markets, alsohave last effect financial market location themselves. once uk leave theeuropean union, european agency currently base uk, like eba ema, haveto relocate eu-27. the future location euro clear operation certainly anothercrucial aspect: point view, euro clear key importance europe, meresupervisory recognition uk central counterparty “equivalent” unlikely sufficientpost-brexit.banks financial service industry need waste time plan ahead thefuture, since brexit could involve substantial loss right conduct business europeanunion possibly necessitate relocation sensitive important infrastructures. that iswhy i expect grow number firm transfer operation uk continentaleurope even negotiation finalised. there one city whichattracts companies. city paris, dublin, luxembourg and, course, frankfurtwill complement one another term value add. and, personal opinion,frankfurt quite major sell point offer.looking current asset valuations, market appear take political risk stride. goingforward, behaviour might well continue market adjust look likepolitics impact fundamental outlook. that happen right themarket participant assess reform agenda us, probably happen 3 / 7bis central bankers' speech brexit negotiation underway. if tail risk scenario materialise, however,markets might reassess valuation lot forcefully, price risky asset might thenadjust accordingly. 3. transitory structural change market liquidityladies gentlemendistortions asset price one concern discuss financial markets. other concernsare relate change market place. today, face situation central bankliquidity hit all-time high daily while, time, market liquidity appear ficklein number segments. reason enough, view, shed light factor thatinfluence market liquidity. 3.1 the app security lendingas already mentioned, purchase programme seem successful loweringfixed income yield fight potential deflation risks. nevertheless, criticisedstrongly. not induce concern matter support government debt anddelaying structural reforms, also say create market distortions.academic evidence effect non-standard measure helpful determine needfor remedial measures, unfortunately rather rare. the bundesbank bank forinternational settlement launch joint project analysis impact purchaseswithin public sector purchase programme (pspp) price liquidity bunds thefirst 18 month programme. the researcher provide evidence negative side effectsover lifetime programme, eg decrease bund market liquidity. base data thebund cash market, author show deteriorate liquidity condition course ofthe programme, also find evidence purchase negative effect transactioncosts order book depth. these find suggest scarcity effect asset purchasescan impact adversely market functioning.strains market liquidity also become visible repo market. especially quarter oryear end see deeply negative repo rates. this attribute variety ofreasons, large-scale purchase eurosystem may play role.in order curtail tension repo bond market liquidity, eurosystem central bank havemade hold available security lend start pspp. let go littledeeper here, security lend key topic conference.the lend implement decentralise manner eurosystem. the bundesbankstarted use automate clearstream lend facilities. in september 2016 also beganto offer bilateral repo facility.not feature bilateral repo facility fully appreciate market participants.we impose relatively strict operational risk management parameters. this concernsspecific term maximum maturity seven day exclusion automaticrollovers well certain collateral requirements.i would like stress lend facility asset purchase programme designedas backstop facilities. we want crowd private players; offeringsupplementary facility repo lend markets. against background, regardsomewhat strict operational parameter justified. furthermore, central bank 4 / 7bis central bankers' speech place particular emphasis risk mitigation, lend parameter serve exactlythis purpose.despite criticism put forward market participants, meantime repo facilityappears well receive market. so, allow note condition notappear overly harsh all. the outstanding volume continuously grow andmost active trade counterparties also use repo facility. especially theopportunity submit cash collateral pspp security lending, implement indecember 2016, enhance popularity bilateral facility. the app security lendingprimarily address active market participant respective market primarydealers. it is, however, open counterparties well.in 2017, volatility repo market german government security rather moderateso far, even end first quarter. it seem market participant find way tocope challenge environment. the eurosystem’s lend facility may contributedto development.another area various commentator academic recently criticise theeurosystem collateral framework. the eurosystem conduct repo operation providetemporary liquidity bank sector take financial asset collateral return. thecollateral framework define eligible financial assets, relate price methodology therespective risk-control measures.critics contend eurosystem accept collateral insufficient quality excessivelylenient terms. this – argue – could create market distortion large risk theeurosystem’s balance sheet.the eurosystem take criticism seriously. however, duly note that,throughout difficult time financial sovereign debt crisis, broad collateralframework regard great institutional strength eurosystem’s monetary policy. whilethe pledge collateral successfully protect eurosystem financial losses, thesame time collateral framework flexible enough preserve eurosystem’sability support market function provide liquidity bank system time stress.the eurosystem thereby fulfil one core function central bank. 3.2 regulationas apparent agenda conference, regulatory issue become crucialfactor financial markets, crop almost every agenda item. in aftermath thefinancial crisis, national european regulatory initiative alike mushroomed.in nutshell, regulation involve strict rule capital, strict provision riskytransactions, high administrative burdens. at bundesbank, fully aware thesestrains potential drawback regulatory requirements. liquidity bond repomarkets decreased, also – – new regulations.moreover, high require capital ratio increase banks’ cost capital banks’earnings currently compressed. this make difficult bank raise capital,which may respond regulatory requirement deleveraging. this, turn, maywell negative effect market liquidity.at time, evident well-designed regulatory measure help make financialsystem stable. the ultimate aim make financial market resilient crisis-proof future. high resilience restore market customer confidence banks. this 5 / 7bis central bankers' speech intend partly make high cost capital allow bank attract morecustomers funds. in long run, strong capital base expect enhance banks’loan origination capabilities. these thus positive effect regulation need berecognised.i convince need effective well-targeted regulation. this also mean weneed closely monitor effect – intend unintended – consider makingadjustments, necessary.but even target adjustment make regulatory framework, i believe one thing canbe expected: factor currently weigh market activity eventually go fadeout, tight regulatory requirement definitely stay, “new normal” marketparticipants adapt to. 3.3 high frequency tradinglet turn another phenomenon whose role market liquidity is, view, large thansome observer think. for last fifteen year investment community witness atransformation landscape exchanges, broke investor trade process thatis base human decision make automate electronic high-speed exchange. highfrequency trade (hft) operate matter microseconds.the bundesbank conduct comprehensive empirical study significance hft thegerman capital market analyse whether hft positive impact marketliquidity.the result show hft 40 percent share trade volume dax bundfuture, indeed

transformation automate trade ecosystemindeed change liquidity condition market. draw right conclusion easy –for market participant regulator alike. 4. outlook monetary policy implementationto conclude, number factor impact financial markets. while thetechnological progress regulatory change stay, eurosystem’s extremelyaccommodative monetary policy come end point.discussions normalisation take centre stage last week, u federal reserve 6 / 7bis central bankers' speech system update plan balance sheet runoff. the duration process definedas “a years”. the general approach let balance sheet runoff happen passively“in background,” market simply “watching paint dry.”it self-evident eurosystem hop process bore thefed’s plan. but first, necessary precondition met:inflation sustainably adjustback towards ecb govern council’s target price stability close 2percent medium term. additionally, must bear mind – like u – exitprocess take several years.which technical option eurosystem disposal govern councildetermines time start exit process?from technical point view, neither increase level key interest rate exitfrom individual non-standard monetary policy measure would pose particular challenges.however, since start financial crisis eurosystem gradually implement largenumber expansionary measure would need phase out. once governingcouncil determine appropriate time adjust “forward guidance”accordingly, sequence monetary policy normalisation exit non-standardmeasures follow gradual prudent approach. even non-standard measure havebeen discontinued, considerable amount liquidity stay market prolongedperiod.for bundesbank, key step towards normalisation monetary policy would endof outright purchase government bond asset purchase programme, thisprogramme blur distinction monetary fiscal policy. however, anoperational economic perspective predetermine sequence exit singlenon-standard measures. it note comprehensive package non-standardmeasures highly expansionary. consequently, remove one measure would remove itsparticular effects, i.e. monetary policy stance would become restrictive, lessexpansionary.hence, number different option departure expansionary monetary policymeasures possible. an orderly exit properly prepare technically andverbally allow smooth transition financial markets. talk communication – alook introductory statement press conference last ecb govern councilmeeting reveal interest details. the govern council consider risk thegrowth outlook broadly balanced. it also remove ease bias rate now.some observer interpret statement step towards monetary policynormalisation – market participant prepare new challenges.thank attention. 7 / 7bis central bankers' speech page 1 7 remark lesetja kganyago, governor south

despite promise short-term outlook, number challenge risk persist, i would like highlight these. the shift towards inward-looking policy threaten derail global trade, negative consequence growth. and lack progress implementation financial regulatory reform agree since recent global financial crisis, finalise capital framework basel iii, also something need address threaten create uneven global

furthermore, aggressive monetary policy action currently anticipate could tighten global financial conditions, cause disruption capital flow emerge market develop economy (emdes) like south africa. so short-term outlook optimistic one, general recognition cannot afford complacent. secure sustain recovery medium term require strong international cooperation. allow highlight initiative regard.

first, lawson boom tequila global financial crises, common lesson large current account deficit one trenchant early warn sign financial instability.7 this 7 blanchard, o. milesi-ferretti, g.m. (2011), ‘(why) should current account balance be reduced?’, imf staff discussion note, no. 11/03. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 6 6 especially true deficit accompany rapidly grow domestic credit.8 it dangerous rely entirely discipline domestic financial system. in case, eventual large private loss weigh public balance sheet growth years.9 second, imbalance reflect unfair competitive advantage – either manage trade manage exchange rate – lead protectionist backlash leave everyone bad off. and third, current environment synchronise weakness limit policy space, hard imagine low inflation / low wage / low growth trap seal 1930s. in environment, uk run historically large current account deficit. on positive side, deficit fund domestic currency financial reform increase resilience uk system, thereby make large imbalance sustainable. but uk’s deficit also associate markedly weak investment latterly rapid consumer credit growth. this imbalance is, yet, fund eventual resolution. moreover, despite large depreciation around referendum, extent uk’s deficit move close sustainability remain open question, one whose answer depend crucially outcome brexit negotiations. most fundamentally, uk rely kindness strange time risk trade, investment, financial fragmentation increased. iii. potential solution the world economy before. in 1930s monetary policy exhaust fiscal policy abeyance. the trap seal wave protectionist measure originate u spread europe. a current capital account closed, stagnation ensued. what do prevent history rhyming? in simple world economist, prescription straightforward. deficit country loosen monetary policy tighten fiscal policy. surplus country reverse.10 if g20 would roll sleeves, could easily solve economic sudoku.11 but cure prescribe abstract policy space unconstrained – situation far remove current realities. 8 caballero, j.

governor bank italy chamber deputy rome, 26 april 2017 mr chairman, honourable member parliament, i would like thank committee invite bank italy comment unite kingdom’s exit european union. i begin brief description well-known institutional aspect make comment possible economic (for unite kingdom, europe italy) financial repercussions. at point time, observation preliminary ones. institutional aspects: negotiations, exit future relationship follow agreement reach lisbon 2007, article add treaty european union – constitutional basis eu – explicitly provide possibility member state might wish withdraw, regulate relative procedure. this article 50, well-known invoke first time uk 29 march prime minister may’s letter president european council. article 50 envisage four phases. the first one, already completed, require outgo member state notify european council intention withdraw european union. the step follows: commission give mandate negotiate withdrawal agreement accord guideline unanimously establish council; commission conduct negotiation withdrawal agreement; party approve agreement. the unite kingdom participate council’s decisions; aside that, retain meanwhile right obligation arise eu membership. give geographical proximity, long, share history deep-seated economic integration uk rest europe, great deal discussion side withdrawal take place relation establish afterwards, comparison make hard soft brexits, concept yet clearly defined. in principle two separate relate negotiations. one concern exit agreement such, procedure article 50 refers. it cover issue position people firm live work eu, thank current freedom movement, find side become international border respect 2019: apply british citizen europe european one uk. this agreement might establish transitional rule temporary permanent, conditional 4 unconditional, recognition status, people’s right stay continue current activities. another important issue, presumably cover withdrawal agreement, uk’s financial obligation towards eu member state. the negotiation concern relation two party withdrawal, include trade agreements. although two negotiation link conceptually certainly politically, could theory different outcomes. for example, agreement may reach exit subsequent relationships; case, agreement new relationship formally stipulate late date. it also inconceivable negotiation complete failure, would lead hard hard brexits (except case extension two-year deadline, treaty allow decide unanimously). both side indicate wish avoid traumatic conclusion reach agreement, call recent speech barnier, european commission’s chief negotiator; hop hold intention cause serious avoidable personal economic problems. a far post-brexit trade relation uk eu concerned, theory four possibilities. 1. accession european economic area (eea) iceland, liechtenstein norway belong, well eu member states. membership eea ensure full participation european single market non-eu state entail accept ‘four freedoms’ (the free movement people, goods, service capital), right obligation eu member states, include financial contribution. however, though non-eu state must apply rule participate single market, decide within eu institutions, commission, parliament council.1 2. participation custom union european union, case turkey. this union provide free movement goods, obligation implement relevant european regulation waiver decide custom duty possibility reach independent trade agreements. 3. a free trade agreement.2 1 switzerland, member state european free trade association (efta), iceland, liechtenstein norway, member eea, time stipulate one hundred bilateral agreement european union (including free movement good people, service capital) require implement relative european regulations. 2 depend scope agreement, ratification eu member state could required. 5 4. if agreement reached, trade relation would govern world trade organization regulations. in case, most favour nation (mfn) clause would apply, prohibit form discrimination: state undertake extend every state treatment grant country specific bilateral trade agreements. in practice, however, neither membership eea custom union seem realistic options. the former would impose free movement people obligation implement ‘acquis communautaire’, uk want abolish; latter, well lay certain regulatory restrictions, would greatly curb uk’s freedom decide independently trade relation countries. the uk government’s notification withdrawal make general reference ‘deep special partnership’ eu, effectively appear exclude stay single market. the likely scenario – change heart – uk become real ‘third country’ eu. under hypothesis, question whether possible reach least free trade agreement, would benefit common interest; notification letter express desire ‘bold ambitious’. at stage, nature, timeframe content future agreement cannot predicted. negotiation yet begin; uk government’s stance also depend outcome recently announce general election. we may imagine main topic negotiation trade good and, all, financial services. there free trade agreement nearly one hundred advance emerge countries, include switzerland, canada south korea. the agreement recently conclude canada particularly interest since, well eliminate custom duties, make access public tender investment easy facilitate trade services. if, long as, agreement, trade relation eu uk govern wto regulations, unless specific transitional agreements, mfn clause applied. 6 the economic impact unite kingdom – in short term, negative effect uk’s economy many expect immediately referendum fail materialize. gdp growth actually increase second half 2016, rise 1.6 2.4 per cent annual basis, employment continue rise. much depend strongly expansionary measure introduce bank england august accommodative fiscal policy stance. on 3 august 2016 bank england cut bank rate 25 basis points; resume purchase uk government bonds; launch new scheme corporate bond purchase extend loan commercial banks. the hm treasury put brake fiscal consolidation process. analyst progressively revise growth forecast upwards 2017, continue expect slowdown year. accord recent consensus estimates, growth uk’s gdp expect average 1.7 per cent year, slightly 2016. the significant effect referendum sterling exchange rate, depreciate 10 per cent since 23 june, euro nominal effective term (that is, main currencies, weight accord trade uk); inflation rise nearly 2 percentage points, 2.3 per cent march. the severe tension beset international financial market around time referendum dissipate quickly (table 1). the economic policy uncertainty index rise late june early july, return pre-referendum level (figure 1). it cannot rule tension arise negotiation eu may trigger new bout financial volatility next years, especially coincide renew concern market cohesion union. what may happen long term remain uncertain. openness trade, immigration, foreign investment generally promote growth, decrease factors, especially occur climate increase protectionism global level, could create significant cost uk economy term innovative capacity, competitiveness, productivity growth. this would also occur eu market, though limit scale would vary country country, depend link uk. the uk market quite small one eu, account 7.1 per cent total exports; contrast, eu destination 44 per cent uk goods. accord studies, uk eu impose reciprocal trade tariffs, long-term economic cost british economy would significant, particularly productivity growth diminish time; repercussion euro area would instead small. 7 brexit expect impact eu’s budget, uk make positive contribution. from 2010 2015, even take account rebate negotiate margaret thatcher 1984 rebate receive uk partial participation justice home affair policies, country contribute €13 billion year average receive le €7 billion. moreover, eu long receive custom duty collect uk; instead collect duty levy british export eu. the overall effect still difficult assess. discussion still way uk’s financial obligation eu leaf (the brexit bill). calculate amount complex controversial matter. one question uk’s share eu total calculate (it amount 15 per cent gross national income 12 per cent term contribution budget rebates) asset liability item included. this probably one delicate issue face exit negotiations. italy – unfavourable economic development uk would case major repercussion italy short term. the slowdown bank england forecast 2018-20 would negligible impact. even uk experience deep recession reduce import 10 per cent three-year period, estimate effect italy’s gdp would 0.25 percentage points.3 italy’s trade financial tie uk close major euro-area country (table 2). in 2015 italian export uk amount 1.8 per cent gdp, 2.7 france, 3.2 spain 3.7 germany. import amount 1.1 per cent gdp, le countries. italy mainly export machinery mechanical engineer products, agri-food products, transport equipment, clothe footwear, tourism services. the bilateral balance good positive italy, balance service generally even. italy’s financial tie uk close main european countries, regard portfolio investment direct investment. in june 2016, italian residents’ portfolio include €60.8 billion worth uk-issued security (that is, 3.7 per cent gdp, compare france’s 10.1 germany’s 5.9). italian investor limit exposure exchange rate risk euro sterling, security denominate sterling account little 1.1 per cent total. at end 2015 italian direct investment uk stand 1.4 per cent gdp, compare significantly high percentage lead euro- area countries. uk investment italy amount 2.2 per cent italian gdp. if negotiation free trade deal eu uk unsuccessful, trade two become subject custom duties. to idea potential economic impact side let u assume uk apply current eu tariff least put tariff system place; words, trade tariff eu 3 economic bulletin 3/2016. 8 currently apply outside area apply area uk. on basis, consider impact effect (i.e. exclude reallocation trade flows), custom duty good export 27-member eu uk would total €16 billion duty british good export eu-27 €6 billion. custom duty would average represent high proportion value good (5.2 per cent) export eu-27 uk way round (3.9 per cent) different sectoral composition. in fact, tariff differ considerably across good categories. close one fifth value eu- 27 export uk relate motor vehicles, carry high duty. moreover, structure export differ across eu-27 member countries, average incidence tariff apply export uk would also differ. in case germany, tariff would similar eu-27 average; france italy would slightly less; ireland, spain poland would face average duty excess 6 per cent. if exist european tariff apply italy’s export uk, case machinery mechanical engineer products, sector account 20 per cent italian export uk, effect would small (about 2 per cent value). the difference would great case agri-food product (almost 10 per cent), clothe footwear (8.2 per cent), motor vehicles, even though sector account much small share export uk (12 per cent) country (germany 33 per cent, spain 32 belgium 26). even free trade agreement, uk would pay administrative cost associate ‘rules origin’, i.e. certification good export eu-27 (and many input need manufacture them) come country subject eu custom duty. difference regulation non-tariff measure could increase cost trade. 9 financial regulation, bank market infrastructure financial regulation – one big unknown brexit shape future financial relation take, start regulatory aspect. a eu member state, uk part single market financial service single passport applies. thus, bank authorize one member state operate member state (by establish branch free provision services) system notification without need authorization. prudential control conduct authority home member state; host state responsible anti-money-laundering consumer protection. with brexit single passport withdrawn. british bank treat like third- country banks: need obtain licence member state wish operate become subject supervision host country. uk-based bank economic policymakers financial regulator view possibility lose single passport trepidation, fear city lose part role financial centre europe world. at present, many non-eu bank (especially american asian ones) european legal operational headquarter city, thus gain access european financial market well plentiful professional expertise specialist services. when leaf eu uk’s supervisory framework will, definition, ‘equivalent’ – partly consideration commitment set prime minister may’s letter notification – european regulation initially incorporate en bloc uk’s internal regulations. any change make subsequently examine ensure equivalence maintained. supervisory ‘equivalence’, define eu’s financial legislation, give benefit third countries. most exemption specific requirements, case investment service (mifid/mifir2) alternative investment fund (aifmd) legislation effectively give equivalent third-country financial intermediary single passport sort eu member states, though respect professional clientele. ensure domestic financial legislation stay align europe would make easy uk bank set presence countries, like italy, grant authorization verify standard home country supervision. under proposal european commission include review capital requirement directive regulation, future, third-country bank systemic importance area would set intermediate parent undertake (ipu) europe. the ipu subsidiary eu would subject consolidate supervision crisis management european rules. hence, major uk bank group – many spin-off international group – would presumably require set ipu. 10 the uk certainly try reach agreement eu-27 allow keep benefit london bank enjoy term access european market. it impossible predict agreement affect london’s competitive advantage. brexit also mean european bank authority (eba) headquarter london find new home. the decision, take come months, connect on-going debate possible change architecture european system financial supervision. the commission launch public consultation prior introduce new legislation. the present model sectoral one: eba responsible bank sector, eiopa (headquartered frankfurt) insurance pension fund industry, esma (based paris) security markets. one option consider (with variations) would reduce number authority two: one bank insurance market securities. the debate complicate fact competency transfer european level differ across sector activity (for example, competency transfer regulation supervision, except case bank industry application single supervisory mechanism euro area alone create difficulty). bank – a far italy’s bank system concerned, importance uk-based bank limited. the 16 bank branch italy account 0.6 per cent lend customers. the majority (11 16) belong third-country group establish european headquarter london. they significant role specific segment (advisory extraordinary finance placements, syndicate loans, guarantees) relate large corporations. some international bank may move part activity london another european country, via either new exist subsidiaries. the effect italian bank probably minimal. moreover, 80 uk bank operate italy without branch, free provision services. they could continue so, fail specific agreements, set subsidiary eu member state. the scope activity italy also limited. there italian bank uk. the lead italian bank group jointly six branch london, mainly involve trade investment banking; use city access international wholesale fund market, though small scale financial crisis. if decide move management activity brexit, cost unlikely high. the italian bank limit exposure uk residents: end 2016 €34 billion (1.3 per cent italian bank system’s total exposure), three quarter consist loan bank financial corporations. market infrastructure – since 2007 borsa italiana group control london stock exchange group (lseg), own two important financial market management 11 company (mts eurotlx), italian central counterparty (cassa di compensazione e garanzia) central security depository (monte titoli). in march year interbank deposit market management company (e-mid) also come control english group. lseg deutsche börse already plan merger 2016. the european commission, however, recently announce block plan, opinion would create virtual monopoly clear market fixed-income instruments: fact new group would include four central counterparties large volume business segment. competition clear equity derivative would also significantly reduced. even control foreign entity, trade post-trading management company remain fully responsible operate processes. they supervise domestic level bank italy consob. indeed, unlike banks, market market infrastructure supervise solo level, rather consolidate basis. control shareholder locate outside eu provide meet requirement integrity capital adequacy. when uk leaf eu, bank italy consob need close contact control shareholders. when cooperation mechanism envisage european legislation long place, italian authority step effort sphere cross- border supervisory cooperation, well increase bilateral cooperation uk supervisory authorities. at european level, brexit raise matter importance regard supervision central counterparties, since euro-denominated financial instruments, especially derivatives, mostly clear uk-based entities.4 we need make sure supervision uk central counterparties fall level set european regulation main stability profiles: prudential supervision, currency clear contracts, market control. esma propose review emir strengthen process recognize third-country ccps provide form direct supervision european authorities. in week come, commission publish propose review emir; prospect uk’s exit require aspect carefully consider well. * * * prime minister may’s letter trigger first time process member state leave union. difficult negotiation begin, although lengthy since treaty impose strict time limits, give technical complexity political sensitivity many issues. both side require foresight good will. 4 for example, case interest rate swaps, 50 per cent global trade 90 per cent standardize swap (i.e. clear central counterparty) clear london-based lch group ltd. large share denominate euros. 12 to surprise many analysts, immediate adverse effect uk’s decision exit confidence, investment economic outlook. there significant orderly devaluation sterling. there reason expect serious direct immediate repercussion italian economy bank system. nevertheless, cannot rule possibility difficult negotiations, especially interact increase global european political institutional uncertainty, could certain point trigger market turbulence. it unlikely italy would immune. for us, way prepare reinforce internal stability, deal fragility perceive markets, pursue path reform. what happen long run yet difficult foresee. history teach u international openness is, end day, powerful driver economic growth. an economist may find hard believe country’s prosperity further create barrier free movement goods, capital people. naturally, great deal depend future trade financial agreement global developments. in case, risk unite kingdom rest europe world. allow close say that, personally, i miss british colleague european institution i participate in: skill level preparation, always admirable, i also miss pragmatism, dislike red tape openness market, generally characterize approach. i hope 40 year work together allow u learn other’s best qualities. 13 table 1 effect brexit

structural factors.a key cyclical challenge link difficulty increase revenue low nominal growthand low interest rate environment relatively flat yield curve. a matter fact, net interestincome decline somewhat 2016, compression margin partly offset byincreased credit growth albeit still moderate levels.while profitability headwind stem cyclical factor abate economicrecovery progresses, structural challenge remain need tackled. these include thelarge stock non-performing loan (npls), legacy 2008 financial crisis, cost inefficiencyand excess capacity. let address factor turn.a large stock legacy npl euro area country continue dampen profitabilityprospects. the average npl ratio euro area bank 2% 2007, reach 8% 1 / 7bis central bankers' speech 2013 stand 6%. for six “high-npl” national bank sectors, average wenthowever 5% 2007 23% last year. elevate loan impairment cost remain importantdriver low profitability “high-npl” countries. indeed, follow capital provisionincreases since financial crisis, npl issue primarily concern solvency ratherbanks’ profitability. the coverage npls provision collateral is, average, 82% theeuro area 80% italy. net npls therefore reassuring, solvency perspective.profitability however, affect low return provide npls, give weight ofgross exposure total assets. the share total asset generate low revenue fullperforming loan considerable european problem: gross npls represent 4% total assetsof euro area bank 0.8 % u.s. banks. the figure italy however stand 11%,thereby unavoidable significant impact profitability, despite visible reduction thenpl ratio system since peak 2013. naturally, high npls also tie capital, erodefunding, well operational capacity, thereby constrain banks’ ability support theeconomic recovery. despite visible reduction system-wide npl ratio italy, progress inreducing stock high npls manageable level remain insufficient.amid continue difficulty boost revenues, remain cost-inefficiencies also weigh onbanks’ profitability. on aggregate, euro area banks’ cost-efficiency deteriorate somewhatsince 2010, base cost-to-income cost-to-assets basis comparesunfavourably international peers, notably nordic countries.against background, many euro area banks, return sustainable profitability isincreasingly dependent improvement operational efficiency. a cross-country comparisonsuggests relative importance physical versus digital distribution channel may oneof differentiate factor across country term cost efficiency, illustrate thepositive correlation branch network reduction since late 90 usage

consolidation could bring profitability benefit sector level. these could beparticularly relevant country bank system remain fragment arecharacterised low market concentration high cost-to-income ratios. ideally, consolidationshould go hand-in-hand great geographical diversification. this would allow bank toachieve economy scope scale cross-border merger acquisitions, therebyalso contribute great macroeconomic risk-sharing diversify country risks.the way forwardlooking forward, several way estimate could “realistic”, longer-term roetargets banks. in term historical comparison, need bear mind high leverageobserved pre-crisis year flat measure profitability. therefore, upper boundestimate roe target could derive multiply pre-crisis return asset (roa) ratiosby current, structurally low leverage multiples. from another perspective, long-termaverage banks’ estimate cost equity (i.e. rate return investor expect aninvestment bank equity) useful benchmark. in addition, survey-based information banks’own estimate long-term sustainable roe complement approximation could besustainable level profitability. combine estimate different approaches, wearrive target range 8-10% roe euro area banks.should expect banks’ profitability reach “sustainable” target next 3-5 years?even benign scenario robust economic recovery, may necessarily case.for instance, late global financial stability report, imf argue even cyclicalupturn, many euro area bank may able raise profitability sufficient degree.12 2 / 7bis central bankers' speech against backdrop cyclical structural challenge banks’ profitability, possiblesolutions include: (i) revenue growth; (ii) cost efficiency improvements; (iii) consolidation throughmergers acquisitions; (iv) npl resolution.the first avenue bank may want explore revisit revenue growth strategies,particularly field fee commission still show relatively low level internationalcomparisons.adjustments business model could also include actively target change productmix, seek adjustment fund structure increase geographic diversification ofactivities.these discuss strategy limitations, require capital, entail risk account ofcompetitive pressures. from financial stability perspective, one also mindful thepossible impact revenue diversification bank performance riskiness.as highlight earlier, many euro area bank continue operate relatively high cost levels,which constitute drag efficiency hamper sector’s ability generate sufficient netincome. improve cost efficiency therefore another strategy bank pursue inorder return sustainable level profitability.cost reduction efficiency improvement achieve variety ways, range frommore traditional measure downsizing, branch closure adoption new, cost-saving technology aim digitalise financial intermediation service increase thereliance internet-based banking. there significant room improve cost efficiency amongeuro area bank consider ratio cost total asset is, average, 1.4% euroarea banks,

difficulty undertake radical cost reduction schemes.another avenue towards improve efficiency eliminate redundancy bankingsector consolidation via merger acquisition (m&a). well-managed m&as deliverimportant cost synergy (e.g. low administrative expenses, branch rationalisation) well asrevenue synergy (e.g. low fund cost merge unit) might contribute toimproving bank sector’s profitability prospects.m&a activity has, however, remain subdue recent years, particular cross-border m&as.in ecb’s late financial integration report, document m&a activity euro areabanking sector decline trend

important challenges. first foremost, close current output gap would require recover productive investment remain particularly weak last four years. part due substantial drop investment mine sector,

like japan buildings, must continue find innovative way strengthen thestructure international monetary system. such re-engineering effort may unseat u fromour comfort zone. it certainly invite resistance may even cause temporarydisruptions. but stand still costly option, would stumble one crisis toanother. in sense, work cut us, need distrust status quo willcontinue live decaying,

1668, stockholm court sentence bank director death. the bank director’s name johan palmstruch, founder first bank sweden, stockholm banco. a year earlier, stockholm banco suffer acute liquidity shortage confidence crisis arise regard banknote issue bank. when bank unable pay depositors, simply take riksdag estates, late become precursor sverige riksbank. palmstruch thus condemn death unless reimburse bank's creditors, course unable do. the council realm eventually convert death sentence prison sentence. and later, chancellor magnus gabriel de la gardie rush defence depose banker, palmstruch finally grant pardon. de la gardie also happen one bank's large borrowers. it possibly chancellor's guilty conscience make advocate mild treatment palmstruch. not long released, precisely 8 march 1671, palmstruch die natural causes.2 a bank crisis every thirty year with historical retrospective, i would like remind long banks, also financial crises. and financial crisis arisen, state often rush rescue one way another. in sweden alone, severe bank crisis occur le nine time past 250 years.3 this entails, average, one crisis every thirty years. 1 thank johan molin, help write speech. valuable comment receive mat anderson, christina nordh berntsson, sara edholm, david forsman, mattias hector, martin w. johansson, gabriel söderberg anders vredin. 2 see wetterberg (2009). 3 see, example, hagberg (2007). 1 [14] this speech sweden counteract mitigate effect crises, least significance appropriately-designed foreign currency reserve succeed this. johan palmstruch’s banknote innovation day, now, 350 year later, sweden head towards cashless society, primarily due new financial technology payment field. what development trend may entail society riksbank subject speech today. the banks’ business model entail risk what special bank government sometimes intervene counteract bank crises? nothing like happen when, instance, manufacture construction company collapses. the reason crisis bank quickly spread rest financial system, turn costly consequence economy whole. i shall explain come about. the banks’ traditional business model function intermediary between, one hand household company need credit buy home get business project started, hand household company want hold money account transaction savings. the bank thus help transform save investment economy contribute efficient mediation payments. this course beneficial economy whole. at time, business model entail significant risks. to put simply, bank's asset consist long-term loan cannot quickly easily convert cash, bank's fund largely short-term volatile. normally, entail problems, reason doubt arise regard bank’s ability pay, fund could withdraw quickly, bank could force default payments. problem one bank serious domino effect a bank often interlink one another often similar type exposure, problem one bank quickly serious domino effect rest financial system. financial crisis arise many occasion history, least extensive financial crisis world experience 2007-2009 remind u financial crisis extremely costly government measure sometimes necessary stave total meltdown economy.4 some bank quite simply “too-big-to-fail”. it light bank system's inherent instability, combine significance economy whole regard need special supervision, regulation measure make system 4 see, example, reinhart rogoff (2009). 2 [14] robust. a i mention begin i shall soon develop further, one reason need central bank appropriate foreign currency reserve. in palmstruch’s day, depositor rush bank cause liquidity crisis. unlike 17th century, part world form obligatory protection depositors’ money, deposit guarantee. this reduce risk bank’s depositor rush empty account bank's financial strength suddenly call question. the fact deposit private individual usually regard banks’ stable source funding. but know bank long time also fund short-term volatile borrow international capital markets.5 i shall develop little soon. what situation swedish bank system? the swedish bank sector large cross-border. in january 2017, swedish banks’ balance sheet total amount approximately sek 17,000 billion. this figure rather difficult grasp. it correspond four years’ worth swedish gdp. everyone understand crisis swedish bank system become extremely problematic also costly manage. of course, comparatively low sovereign debt sweden mean great room manoeuvre crisis many countries. comparatively low national debt sweden today note. sweden’s national debt relation gdp, maastricht definition. source: eurostat 5 the design swedish pension system, large share collective save form fund allocation within occupational premium pension systems, one factor may impact banks’ finance structure. see nilsson et al.

one must remember explanation capital ratio look good largely bank use low risk weight internal risk models. if one instead look non risk-weighted capital adequacy, picture different. the so-called leverage ratio almost level prior financial crisis. the risk new financial crisis thus certainly eliminated, make high demand bank regard capital, bank system become robust good withstand crisis. the major banks’ risk-weighted capital adequacy ratio relatively high, leverage ratio almost level prior financial crisis… note. per cent. the major swedish banks’ core capital ratios, sources: the banks’ interim report risk-weighted compare non risk-weighted. weight average. riksbank ...and relatively low international perspective note. per cent, march 2017. leverage ratio european banks. sources: snl financial calculate accord applicable definition basel iii. riksbank 4 [14] the swedish bank dependent foreign funding. i mention early bank around world use fund abroad increase extent. so swedish banks? well, swedish bank system’s fund foreign currency currently amount around 150 per cent gdp, three time much begin 2000s. the swedish bank dependent foreign fund note. per cent. swedish bank system’s foreign fund relation gdp source: statistic sweden foreign fund refer swedish banks’ (including swedish subsidiary exclude foreign subsidiaries) market fund borrow foreign currency. the increase due nordea’s previous bank subsidiary effect start year incorporate swedish parent company. if also include fund foreign currency remain major swedish banks’ foreign subsidiaries, include nordea’s mortgage lend company denmark, norway finland, fund foreign currency amount around 175 per cent gdp, sek 7,650 billion. part bank's borrow u dollar euro exchange swedish krona nordic currency finance asset currencies, include lend household companies.6 and thus banks’ international financiers, rather normal - protect deposit guarantee - depositor dispose withdraw finance go get tough. if investor stop buy banks’ bond certificates, bank may quickly suffer liquidity problem high risk force close down. this turn give rise acute threat financial stability ultimately economy whole – sweden also neighbour countries, swedish bank operations. 6 via fx swap maturity different lengths. these must renew gradually price alter.

counterparties foreign exchange market dependent fund foreign currency function constantly. different currency banks’ balance sheet (a simplify example) how best manage banks’ increase liquidity risk foreign currency? a natural start point bank – like private commercial actor – manage liquidity risk themselves. they therefore need insure enough liquidity reserve sufficiently stable fund foreign currency. this reduce risk government intervene event crisis. hopefully, also give authority little time take whole situation find appropriate solution problem nevertheless arise. a liquidity buff extent also regard “deductible” least margin reinforce banks’ incentive manage liquidity risks. finansinspektionen also already place demand bank manage liquidity risks, among mean require specific buff euro u dollars. a i sure know, riksbank’s opinion bank also need buff important currency use operations. even bank strong self-insurance, certain would enough crisis situation. then riksbank act “lender last resort”, is, assist bank liquidity experience difficulty obtain market funding. the riksbank principle create amount liquidity swedish krona. swedish krona normally exchange foreign currency. so problem? well, word “normally” snag. in financial crisis, little function “normally”. this whole purport word “crisis”. in words, far certain foreign 6 [14] exchange market function crisis. and urgent expensive acquire foreign currency. swap agreements, phone call during financial crisis, acute shortage u dollar arise banks. in september 2008, riksbank able establish, together central banks, temporary currency loan – swap agreements7 – u central bank, federal reserve. however, agreement sign ready put use, riksbank force use foreign currency reserve. with aid this, gradually new swap facility, riksbank lend dollar equivalent around sek 200 billion four weeks. in total 2008 2009, riksbank able offer counterparties, aid swap line unite states, dollar loan correspond sek 1,000 billion. central banks’ balance sheet – grow manage financial crisis note. per cent gdp. source: macrobond it difficult say would happen riksbank receive access swap federal reserve, riksbank able offer bank dollar facility. probably, bank would experience severe difficulties. after global financial crisis, federal reserve announce long offer swap line small group central banks, group riksbank belong. it also highly uncertain whether access similar arrangement feed central bank next time problem arise. the international monetary fund, imf, also express increase concern 7 swap agreement central bank describe rental agreements, one obtain access predetermine period foreign currency exchange remuneration form one's currency. 7 [14] development. in report, imf call country limit currency reserve lack swap lines, like sweden, consider measure aim strengthen protection.8 with 70 year experience problem many countries, imf's advice worth take seriously. many factor contribute sweden’s access potential swap line uncertain. the fact sweden global term small economy course one factor. one cannot assume always interest individual country help another country, particularly case concern largely domestic crisis. the tendency towards introvert policy discern economy exactly give hope great helpfulness future. perhaps condition would good global financial crisis, may one's best interest help others. but hope bring swap agreement could dash borrow country’s buffer, foreign currency reserve, weakened. on contrary, may doubt country capable manage risks. who would want come rescue country prepare pay cost reasonable insurance? let make comparison. some year ago, sweden choose prioritise within defence forces, compulsory military service system abolished. now uncertainty global policy increased, swedish defence budget increased, compulsory military service consider again. it quite simply safe have, instance, number jas fighter plane standby rely able rent one need them, partly acute situation would probably take long would difficult expensive. foreign currency reserve – part sweden's economic defence similarly, regard foreign currency reserve part sweden's economic defence. the advantage foreign currency reserve quickly make available liquidity support bank system acute need arise. a foreign currency reserve also prevent financial crisis create confidence central bank’s ability take action necessary. this particularly important situation market confidence country’s credit payment system pressure. if say could never happen sweden, let remind ireland iceland. prior global financial crisis, country assess good condition healthy public finance consequently high credit ratings. but connection crisis, ireland iceland suffer serious confidence crises. their credit rat cut rapidly, time borrow requirement increased. 8 imf (2016a). 8 [14] interest expenditure soar country force make drastic cut number area expenditure. swedish experience also point confidence fall rapidly take long time regain. for many year 1990s crisis, sweden suffer much high interest rate germany, large risk premium swedish government securities. give swedish financial system’s large degree international dependence, important necessary maintain international confidence financial system. a robust foreign currency reserve is, opinion, important condition this. to return defence force metaphor, country know number jas fighter plane standby, would probably also reduce risk conflict situation arising, would use them. today, proposal table government could principle entail halve riksbank's foreign currency reserve.9 allow foreign currency reserve decline situation bank sector whole fund foreign currency grow say least risky venture. this opinion opinion riksbank, also share international monetary fund. in article iv review sweden's economy 2016, imf conclude foreign currency reserve small now. the european central bank, ecb, also recently issue opinion recommend sweden reduce size foreign currency reserve current level.10 the foreign currency reserve pay bank the cost – insurance premium – liquidity insurance form foreign currency reserve present charge riksbank’s earn central government finance calculate around sek 400-500 million year. this is, course, lot money, calculate per inhabitant per year insurance premium sek 40-50. this correspond around two cup coffee half cinema ticket. moreover, actually cost could well transfer banks, primary beneficiary insurance. one could say – take extreme –

provide strong foreign currency reserve. depend government choose design charge premium insurance, could strengthen incentive bank reduce liquidity risk foreign currency. financial technology change mean payment i begin talk johan palmstruch. let return discus subject also affect riksbank’s ability carry tasks, namely financial innovation development new financial technology, “fintech” know circles. johan palmstruch financial innovator time. he one introduce banknote standardise denomination – real global innovation 17th century. the print press make possible mass produce standardise banknotes. the banknote much light easy transport heavy copperplate use deal with. sweden copper standard time. after stockholm banco collapsed, 1830s financial sector sweden really take off. private bank firm emerged, begin issue banknotes. they continue early 20th century, riksbank grant monopoly issue banknote state could gain firm grip price stability standardise payments. the development financial technology always important drive force behind change financial sector often entail new challenge financial stability. now then, also give central bank reason consider best job. during latter part 20th century begin one, see several innovation change consumers’ method payment.11 in recent years, amount payment make aid smartphones mobile bank id rise rapidly. the riksbank actually contribute latter give bankgirot access special account riksbank's payment system rix enable secure payment mobile application. 12 use cash decline rapidly sweden all contribute volume outstanding cash sweden decline around 10 per cent gdp begin 1950s around 1.5 per cent gdp today. the large decline use cash take place recent 11 some example innovation change way make payment year include cheques, atms, credit debit card bank transfer – initially paper form late direct transfer internet. 12 today 97 per cent citizen sweden access form payment card. 85 per cent access on-line bank 80 per cent access direct debiting. more 60 per cent access swish payment app. 10 [14] years. demand general public fall almost sek 100 billion 2007 around sek 60 billion today.13 banknote coin circulation fall rapidly sweden source: statistic sweden one say riksbank's banknote monopoly almost day, number rapid simple electronic mean payment supply private agencies. you see, sweden, legal requirement cash accept mean payment retail trade. nor bank legal requirement supply cash services. the fact gain efficient mean make payment whole good sweden. but development also entail number difficult challenges, instance, infrastructure cash management phase sweden.14 15 most indication development continue, raise number difficult questions: what happen general public long access cash, possible use cash anywhere? sweden verge situation commercial interest determine whether general public shall access central bank money ultimately payment method used. be risk payment market become oligopoly, high threshold competitor payment service expensive? can ensure access banks’ service future still able manage payment safe efficient way? what would happen future financial crisis, general public distrust bank want withdraw save cash – bank long hold cash? 13 withdrawal atm also decline significantly recent years. in 2010, swede withdraw around sek 225 billion 2015 withdraw sek 153 billion. 14 see, instance, swedish post telecom authority's report task government regard fundamental payment services, 27 february 2017: http://www.pts.se/sv/dokument/rapporter/post/2017/aterrapportering-av-pts-regeringsuppdrag-inom-grundlaggande-betaltjanster---17-201-/ 15 to extent riksbank contribute development reduce number cash depot sweden. see, example, daltung ericson (2004). note. annual average cash outside bank sector, is, cash hold companies, household government agencies. 11 [14] central bank money still need future these important question must answered. in opinion, reason examine whether riksbank offer money digital form general public. if print press make possible print banknote time, current technology enable electronic payments. it therefore reasonable try find whether riksbank use new method technique offer mean payment guarantee riksbank way banknote coins.16 the riksbank's role supplier liquidity change world technological advance structural change affect method payment, also risk threat financial system. this mean authority need regularly evaluate test crisis preparedness. the riksbank also need review maintain liquidity tool good shape. although bank still central payment system comprise natural focus riksbank’s financial stability analysis, agent central counterparties (ccps) gain increase importance financial system. structural changes, banks’ fund choose organise cross-border operations, affect liquidity risk foreign currency, among things. this something riksbank authority must monitor. financial innovation trade robot type automate financial service contribute great efficiency, also give rise considerable liquidity stress.17 in line technological advances, speed transaction implement also increasing. the fact money security can, touch button, move immediately one continent another, something hardly reduce liquidity risk financial system. it also emphasis importance central bank capacity quickly intervene necessary. this require sufficient reserve standby. liquidity decisive let conclude reflection. many agent far express opinion issue emphasise sweden's strong public finance compel reason reduce riksbank's foreign currency reserve. but everyone know uneasy situation always liquidity determine 16 see, instance, skingsley (2016):

around lose confidence ultimately may face seizure bankruptcy. a swedish citizen representative sverige riksbank, duty point importance good liquidity manage financial crisis. this require foreign exchange reserve sufficiently large cover least foreign currency need may arise short term situation financial stress. in opinion, insurance way take responsibility citizen country right require

[14] sabine lautenschläger: supervise bank - four prioritiesstatement m sabine lautenschläger, member executive board europeancentral bank vice-chair supervisory board single supervisory mechanism, atthe international monetary conference, london, 13 june 2017.* * *many thank question, howard. so priority i see moment? in respect ofbanking supervision four thing come mind.most importantly, regulation remain global issue; bank system global scopeand need take global approach regulate it. reform bank regulation nowbeen way almost decade; time finalise them, implement see howthey work.but rule themselves; also application. supervisor aroundthe world apply rule differently. globally focus supervision carriedout learn other. what approach used? what best toolsand methods? what best structure term budget independence, instance?these thing discus global level – also respect brexit.that, fact, second thing list priorities. we know that, event “hard”brexit, uk bank would seek licence eu business continent.and here, i get feel many bank bite relax this. so message todayto bank quite simple: clock ticking. obtain licence take time, don’tput apply one long.but banks. in wake brexit, might also see entities, broker-dealer third-country branches, set shop euro area. these entity wouldprobably supervise national level.the market would become fragment condition race bottom wouldbe present. it might thus appropriate entity supervise european level. thecurrent review european rulebook offer chance adapt relevant rules.non-performing loans, npls, third item list. in part euro area,banks still large exposure npls balance sheet – legacy economiccrisis. npls drag banks’ profit keep bank lend economy.the issue need resolved, cannot resolve overnight. get rid npls takestime effort. in march publish guidance bank deal npls, oursupervisors monitor closely strategy bank devise progress make.still, resolve npls quickly possible require right structures. and here, governmentscould help improve legal judicial systems. the price npls depend largely onwhether system effective efficient.the fourth item list risk management. and broad sense also cover internalmodels. after all, bank use model calculate risk weight assets, thenserve start point determine right amount capital.i think risk sensitivity central calculate capital requirements. but i also see thatinternal model become complex. and make prone error evenmanipulation. 1 / 2bis central bankers' speech against backdrop, launch major project; target review internal models,or trim, call it. with trim, want achieve two things.first, want harmonise supervisory treatment internal model ensure levelplaying field.second, want ensure result internal model conservative drive byactual risks, model choices. this strengthen trust banks’ calculation ofrisk and, ultimately, adequacy capital buffers.thank attention. 2 / 2bis central bankers' speech benoît cœuré: interview bloomberg tvinterview mr benoît cœuré, member executive board european central bank,and bloomberg tv, conduct m francine lacqua 12 june 2017.* * *benoît cœuré, thank much speak bloomberg tv. now, ecb seemsto rush exit accommodative stance. how dangerous low longer?thank invite me. basically thrust govern council decide last week isto acknowledge improve economic circumstances, translate revise forwardguidance, adapt economic reality, also give sense patiencewhen come rate low: still see inflation would like be;we’re still see criterion we’ve set inflation sustainable met. so youneed sense patience here.how much nightmare strong gdp qe?stronger gdp good news. it’s unqualified good news. this acknowledge thegoverning council last week, that’s change communication adapt thechanging reality. it also show monetary policy measure working. all job thathave create eurozone last three, four year so, lot beencreated thank accommodative monetary policy stance, work well. now, wehave inflation mandate, come next step we’ll focus inflation.why taper discuss last week?that wasn’t discuss all. it early discus it. we acknowledge changingreality. we discuss lot economic situation; discuss prospect inflation.there sense progress also come inflation where, spite inflationbeing revise downwards, look carefully staff forecast, you’ll see inflation alsoless dependent monetary policy measures, one step right direction, it’snot yet quite enough start discuss tapering. we’re yet.when think taper need discussed? even accustom marketsto idea tapering.i don’t want give date here. i don’t think serf purpose. the reason we’re verymuch data-driven. we’re drive facts. so we’ll discus taper whenever see theeconomic situation prospect inflation right discuss it.do mind perfect idea – i’m go press it, youhave perfect idea taper discuss would look like?no, again, depend lot economic numbers; depend lot inflation. weobviously discus end year. that’s obvious give we’ve say onbuying bond end year late necessary. so discussion take place,but take place data support it.is july live meeting? i know talk it, live meet give thatit’s july there’s actually usually low volatility markets, give you’re notactually new forecasts?well, work july. it may look nice around, work july. and i said, thediscussion last week much take stock progress economy, take 1 / 5bis central bankers' speech stock progress support improve path inflation, that’s discussion thatwe’ll again. so one lesson we’ve decide last week, governingcouncil want keep forward guidance align reality, that’s go continue.you’re one bright mind come academic economics. why inflationso low? be structural, may count thing differently?no, i don’t think it’s much statistics. that may play role, it’s lot thechanging structure labour market, particular. this recovery jobs-rich. a lotof job create create eurozone economy, it’s differentkind jobs. a lot temporary contracts, lot part-time, thisproduces le inflationary pressures. there time consolidate intopermanent, full-time contracts, nominal wage start growing, we’re yetthere. so lot structure job market, that’s certainly area wherewe’re pay lot attention, understand detail nature job created.do think market understand nuance quite well, especially itcomes talk taper exactly kind potential road maytake?i think it’s well understood. the market example feed us; bedifferent here, operate different markets, successfulexperience policy normalisation. we’ve able communicate intentions. themarket reaction govern council last week positive, smooth. so i’m notvery worry here.yes, that’s didn’t announce much. be danger doannounce something little bite substantive market go haywire?well, change communication, significant change, marketunderstood well, i think.give sense of, talk forward guidance, talk datapoints, everything seem very, clear: parallel feed itcomes inflation strong hop would be?i don’t think so, economy different. i mention labour market earlieron: labour market different u europe. in u participationrate fallen, lot worker detach labour market, ordisenfranchised labour market. they’re stay home, lose hope tofind job. that case europe. so we’ll also account differences.on trade-weighted basis, euro much strong compare dollar: thata concern all? do think it, not?well, don’t exchange rate target, insofar exchange rate movement reflectthe economic fundamental situation, that’s fine, there’s nothing comment stage we’reat. 2 / 5bis central bankers' speech compare six month ago, risk still perceive – forecast lotbetter, right? so seem thing get rosier.well, govern council judge last week risk balanced, also addedthat see downside risk mostly come outside. so see risk surround thefuture course u economic policies, see risk emerge market economies, theseare risk want focus on. risk come inside, is, within eurozoneeconomy, much le use be.how would qualify tension within govern council? i know differentviews, healthy? it seem like you’re become like mpc boemonetary style…it healthy different views. we work 19 countries, need different viewsto reflected. different economy inside eurozone run different paces, thathas reflected. so, far good, long govern council form consensus.and we’ve decide last week much consensus, good givesstrength communication.how rate political concerns? be danger france theway outcome market like, underestimate politicalrisk?well, political risk there. it’s u decide political risks. we’re politicalinstitution; don’t decide base political outcomes. we decide base economic facts,and political timeline certainly way decide monetarypolicy. that said, it’s true political uncertainty hold back consumption investment tosome extent eurozone. i much hope france case more.that certainly support strength french economy. i also much hope theoutcome french election support momentum reform, start france,obviously, also europe, support monetary policy. we want strong eurozonefor monetary policy effective, france key role play here.when come fiscal policies, mario draghi ask fiscal policy aslong i remember: would different time?it’s much fiscal policies; it’s lot structural policies. it’s improvinglabour markets, and, i said, it’s make eurozone work better, politicaldiscussion, ecb cannot lead, lead, politicalinstitution. we don’t mandate that. so need eurozone member states, startingwith germany france, lead discussion, i much hope, i’m confidentnow, discussion start.does uk election last week make job hard easier?well, uk important eurozone economy. i wish best uk economy; icertainly trust bank england steer economy political uncertainty, atthe end that’s major risk us.what mean clear houses?clearing house important discussion. that discussion lead europeancommission, that’s law-making europe. the european commission will, withindays, i guess, make new proposal come derivative clear houses, anobjective ensure safety soundness clear across eu uk leaves. sofar, we’ve able ensure safety soundness euro-denominated clear 3 / 5bis central bankers' speech robust arrangement bank england ccps locate inlondon, work well. the basis arrangement fall 2019, ukleaves, need alternative. different alternative consider europeancommission, lead discussion. so i would defer commission here.right, country want basically sovereignty that, ecb, governingcouncil, i believe, best person regulate yourselves. how think willend up?the govern council, ecb stake discussion, insofar financial stability isconcerned, insofar monetary policy transmission concerned, statutoryrole central bank issue euro-denominated transactions, i welcome fact thecommission refer role play central bank issue, wecertainly need play strong role here. but come requirement hard-wired european law – say, instance, location: need location? – that’s thecommission say. that’s u decide.give sense happen greece.greece discuss eurogroup luxembourg thursday week. that’s anotherof long series meetings. i much hope, ecb much hopes, bethe conclude meet make precise way greek debt address bythe eurogroup. the greek government do part. they do part term ofpolicies, term mou, it’s eurogroup minister deliver come toconfirming sustainability greek debt. a i say earlier, wouldn’t serve purpose keepthe greek economy limbo one year. we need decisive act eurogroup thatwill create confidence greek economy. it’s time investor come back greece, it’stime depositor bring back money greek banks, it’s eurogroup givethe signal make possible.so think resolution week something that’s acceptable ecb?well, another discussion monetary policy consequence inclusion greekdebt qe. that’s different discussion. it monetary policy discussion. so governingcouncil take whatever come eurogroup, consider andassessed rules. we’re certainly go part political quid pro quo withthe eurogroup. these two different discussions.i know we’re go round world 15 minutes. give sense bank howconcerned still italian banks. the resolution last week inspain, blueprint think italian bank problem resolved?i’m hesitant pas judgment, even pas comment, italian banks. i’m asupervisor, separation principle it’s colleague supervisory sideto ass communicate. so danièle nouy sabine lautenschläger that. when itcomes resolution popular last week, main lesson system thatworks, positive test institutional set-up have, single resolutionboard, european commission, single supervisory mechanism, ecb monetary policyfunction: cooperation work well, swift way, want tosee case resolution. would case bank? i don’t know. all banksare different, and, well, know quote leo tolstoy, say happy family arealike, every unhappy family different. so every fail bank different.very diplomatic. one last question, haven’t talk china all:when come external factors, look china? 4 / 5bis central bankers' speech china remain major area interest us. i would say concern, risk, farthe chinese authority able steer transition chinese system well,and provide stability world economy. that said, issue addressed:shadow banking, corporate debt, transition towards domestic demand, transition towards adecarbonised economy. these daunt challenge stay u year tocome, far chinese authority successful steer economy andnot make china become issue global economy. we’ve get enough issues, wedon’t want china become one them. 5 / 5bis central bankers' speech gent sejko: money bank albania, antiquity tomodern timesopening address mr gent sejko, governor bank albania, first

to the finance committee of the honorable senate of the republic ∗ mario marcel governor central bank chile 3 april 2017 ∗the monetary policy report march 2017 find http://www.bcentral.cl/en introduction mr. governor senate’s finance committee, senator carlos montes, honorable member committee, ladies, gentlemen, thank invitation present view board central bank chile recent macroeconomic developments, projection implication monetary policy. this vision contain detail monetary policy report (the report) march 2017. it worth mention report include first time economic forecast 2018, i show throughout presentation. i full board staff responsible topic cover report. i wish make special mention new board member, m rosanna costa, recently confirm senate, m solange berstein, financial policy division director, today. in recent months, annual cpi inflation continue decline, line forecast december report. good inflation continue shape largely movement exchange rate, service inflation continue drop gradually, mark widespread indexation consistently business cycle. meanwhile, late last year this, gdp non-natural-resources sector perform weak forecast. furthermore, incoming data suggest take long expect recover. this, couple recent event considerably erode mine activity, pull annual gdp growth 2017. however, see outlook i share moments, number element help economy regain momentum within projection horizon. worth note among significant macroeconomic imbalance observed, negative impact mine investment adjustment diminished, external scenario improved, monetary policy remain clearly expansionary. overall, capacity gap foresee next two year somewhat wide think december, tone medium-term inflationary pressures. in context, board low monetary policy interest rate (mpr) 50 basis point early month year, speed cut respect provision make december. at time, consider that, ensure convergence inflation target, necessary enhance monetary impulse somewhat, reflect mpr trajectory similar one imply financial asset price ten day prior statistical close report. macroeconomic scenario in february, annual cpi inflation 2.7%, core inflation—cpiefe; cpi exclude energy foodstuffs—was 2.2%, drive mainly good component, whose annual growth fell 0.4% february, line nominal exchange rate, 2 year-ago level. the service component cpiefe post annual change 3.4% february, quite mild fall good component, reflect great inertia (figure 1). about this, worth note one feature cpi service basket 75% price either manage link another indicator past inflation, mean indexed. this fact practice augment inertia cause effect change activity gap take long show up. of course, case every service price, non-indexed non-managed price tend show visible effect change gap. one box report devote this, show difference recent evolution service inflation appear recently mention price group take separately. in report’s baseline scenario foresee headline inflation continue decline months, return 3% year’s end hover around mark first quarter 2019, current projection horizon ends. the cpiefe decline steadily second half 2017 take long hit 3% (figure 2). this inflation path rely two assumptions: first, fairly stable real exchange rate around current levels, estimate line fundamentals; second, although output gap exceed december estimate time, project that, aforesaid reasons, begin close towards end year. activity growth end 2016 line december forecast, although characterize steep slowdown year, expect continue well 2017. on 20 march, bank publish first national account figure base new benchmark compilation us base year 2013. this change intend update way evolution national economy gauged, incorporate new estimation methodologies, change international standard new source information. the bank make change regularly every five years, accord respective international standard set imf oecd. the salient change depict box report, detail see several document upload website. the new data, include small revision 2014 2015 growth, confirm weaken economy last quarter year, time modify growth trajectory already publish quarter 2016. in particular, economy would slightly outperform previous estimate first part year. by sectors, confirm mine post negative y-o-y growth throughout whole year, activity area unrelated natural resource (i.e. other gdp) continue worsen, go grow 3% first quarter 1% fourth (figure 3). in sectors, weak fourth quarter particularly sector link investment construction relate services, usually persistent. also personal service decelerated, although estimate respond partly effect public sector strike end last year (figure 4). on domestic expenditure side, y-o-y growth final demand—minus inventory change—also show downsloping trend throughout year. the big loss 3 dynamism see investment construction works, whose annual rate change -4.9% fourth quarter (0.5% average first third quarters). private consumption, case years, provide support economy, grow 2% annually throughout 2016. this help growth labor income, fall inflation persistent low unemployment historic standards. it worth note growth non-durable consumption remain stable, durable consumption growth recovered, partly due appreciation peso last year partly due necessary replenishment stock several year low even negative expansion. something similar observe gross fix capital formation machinery equipment. discount unusual purchase transportation equipment, investment component tend perform good past month (figure 5). the labor market continue adjust. salaried employment stand fall 2.1% annually december february move quarter, moderation annual wage growth. plus reduction hour worked, time grow number worker claim work few hour desired. anyway, self- employment, precarious, significantly cushion disturbance come salaried employment (figure 6). a constant concern recent year originate evolution labor market. in several report include box research note address various relate topics, include degree work flexibility change labor condition affect unemployment. our last issue include box explore effect business cycle workers' wages. normally, wage analyze use aggregate data that, nature, conceal movement individual wages. use data per worker, show dynamic individual wage much correlate business cycle aggregate wage would suggest. in particular, wage worker change jobs—either voluntarily involuntarily—are affected, good worse, depend business cycle favorable not. this line ongoing research allow u good understand evolution labor market implication medium-term inflationary pressures. domestic financial conditions, meanwhile, still good term interest rates. however, lend volume slow compare previous years, respondent bank’s business perception report bank credit survey interpret consequence weak demand (figure 7). in baseline scenario, estimate year economy grow 1% 2%, range project december, 1.5% 2.5%. around 0.2 percentage point correction originate effect escondida mine downtime. because importance mine country’s copper production—15% 20% 2016—, downtime substantial impact first-quarter gdp, around 1 percentage point reduce growth, take figure near zero. despite economic impact, escondida deadlock, plus effect massive forest fire january february, one-time event affect long- 4 term trajectory, neither influence dynamic business cycle. thus, expect event material repercussion performance economic sector inflation. in case mine production, although impact gdp first quarter significant determine mostly supply-side factors, delete other gdp calculation bank us model measure activity gap medium-term inflation outlook. thus, change project range 2017—of half one percentage point—responds two major factors. on one hand, half explain escondida mine downtime incident first quarter. on hand, great weakness saw course 2016 give low start point economy year. in particular, weakness observe sector tend persistent dynamics, construction associate areas. we must forget sector receive significant boost 2015, last early 2016, result new vat would charge sector tax reform. such reduce strength respond largely end boost. there also effect lend standard mortgage loan tighten too, give high payment demand banks. another important issue worth look change inventory recent years. the year 2016 complete three year inventory depletion, quite uncommon. in general, inventory movement reflect company predict future: optimistic it, accumulate, vice-versa. recent years’ relentless downward revision growth prospect permeate companies’ desire level inventory part see 2017 growth outlook also relate that. for 2018, baseline scenario assume economy perform good year, grow 2.25% 3.25% range. this allow activity gap narrow steadily throughout next year, keep mind board still estimate economy’s potential growth rate 2.5% 3%, trend growth 3.2%. these projection assume that, three-year-long fall, gross fix capital formation (gfcf) post slightly positive growth 2017 clearly strong expansion 2018. this result decisively influence high investment non-mining non-housing investment (mainly machinery equipment). this, former expect regain positive number 2018 latter continue adjust quarters, boom trigger amendment vat payment regulation sector. a percentage gdp, 2017 gfcf reach 21.7% 22.5% real nominal terms, respectively. on consumption side, major change expect annual growth, foresee continue sustain domestic output expenditure. our baseline scenario assume consumption grow pace 2.5% 3% next year, quite like 2016. it also assume export volume grow little 1.5% year, rate double 2018. behind increase improve external scenario, i discus moment. in context, current account deficit small project december, 2017 good 2016, due slow growth domestic demand improve term trade (table 1). 5 a i say earlier, great growth expect 2018 originate economy major imbalances, end factor hind growth recent years—for example, four-year plunge mine investment—an expansionary monetary policy stance strong impulse abroad compare previous years. a fiscal policy, assume consolidation announce administration proceed further. the recovery reflect annual figure project 2018 begin course year, consider negative impact debilitate economic activity end 2016 early 2017. in fact, average annual gdp growth last quarter 2016 first year somewhat 0%. already second quarter, baseline scenario, rise 1.5% annually, which, average, sustain increase second half year. however, see later, scenario rely partly strong monetary policy bias, necessary inflation target met. internationally, last month somewhat favorable scenario forming. on one hand, activity expectation indicator develop world reveal good economic environment. particularly noteworthy situation manufacture sector, long year stagnation show improve result prospects, add great dynamism service sector observe several quarter (figure 8). in unite states, persistent positive consumption figures—sustained robust labor market— couple much desire rebound investment. in eurozone, strong synchronize recovery among member stand out. in japan, depreciation yen give boost foreign sector. thus, relative december forecast, growth projection 2017 trade partner develop world revise upward 2 decimals, 1.8%, year next. improve condition develop world give way expectation point normalization inflation least dissipate risk deflation exist long ago. thus, federal reserve continue normalize monetary policy policy maker europe japan rule qe. market gradually incorporate change expectation avoid major disruption (figure 9). in past, process raise interest rate u surround complex economic financial development economies. in 1980s, critical case, debt crisis latin america. then 1990s, significant effect circumscribe countries. in 2000s, emerge world affect directly, subsequent subprime crisis unite state implication world result federal reserve rate hike. today, condition unite state emerge world confront episode different see sides. china's growth size europe make potential risk fed, cannot overlook effect decision economies. at time, economic policy framework change emerge market capable deal external shocks. anyway, still element risk. a box report provide deep analysis topics. 6 beyond volatility recent months, dollar remain strong respect currencies, develop emerging. our peso, depreciate little 30% 2013 average, behave similarly trade partners’ currencies, multilateral variation much smaller. accordingly, real exchange rate index base year 1986=100 near 93, 3% 2013 average (figure 10). among emerge economies, improvement china’s outlook worth noting. in fourth quarter last year, chinese gdp grow 6.8%, growth full year 6.7%. conjunctural number financial indicator calmer, accord manufacture output foreign trade figures. the renminbi depreciate gradually large capital outflow reserve depletion 2016 stopped. meanwhile, authority set growth objective 6.5%. thus, baseline scenario revise chinese growth forecast upward 2 decimals. in latin america, main economy region still adjusting. in brazil, consumption investment weak, manufacture production colombia. argentina also undergo difficult process and, although lag countries, show sign mild deterioration activity, especially concern manufacture output. the mexican economy could sustain good growth performance labor market market become aware potential effect u election trade migration. this result weak investment. in context, mexican authority take step strengthen macroeconomic fundamentals, policy aim consolidate public finances, withdraw monetary stimulus deal inflationary pressures, manage exchange rate counteract sharp depreciation mexican peso suffer towards end last year. in general, inflation outlook continue improve region, open room monetary stimulus. in addition, external imbalance moderate fiscal account continue consolidate. still, weak support robust expansion region. in context, widespread increase risk appetite, raise stock prices, reduce sovereign premium boost capital flow emerge world (figure 11). the term trade also show significant improvement, largely due combination high price copper low oil assume december. the price export product also risen. copper remain high price two years. this respond partly aforementioned good performance manufacture sector good world growth outlook. another part explain supply disruption important producer lack new investments. thus, rise projection price us$2.55 us$2.50 per pound 2017 2018, respectively. the oil price, rise agreement opec producer reduce output, fall recent weeks. our baseline scenario foresee close 50 dollar per barrel projection horizon. with this, 2017 2018 term trade outperform 2016, also high anticipate december (table 2). 7 in baseline scenario, monetary policy provide somewhat strong impulse estimate december. a work assumption assume mpr follow trajectory similar one imply financial asset price ten day prior statistical close report. thus, assure monetary policy respond swiftly change economic condition remain expansionary whole projection horizon (figure 12). a always, conduct monetary policy possible adjustment mpr contingent effect incoming information project inflation dynamic. on external front, source uncertainty may significant effect nature hard quantify. for example, political economic uncertainty surround european elections, worry brexit implementation possible shift towards protectionism several develop economies. other risk long linger external scenario vary intensity. the u economy evolve favorably, avert risk new recession. the much await fiscal impulse could help sustain somewhat high growth year come. however, also source risk, implementation may problem inflationary effect might trigger fast withdrawal monetary impulse, create disruption financial markets. china continue source concern, especially leverage, although authority successfully weather gradual slowdown without cause disruptions, welcome markets. neither rule intensification recent global trend strong expect impulse abroad, either steep recovery world activity and/or good commodity prices. some seem permeate financial markets, price risky asset risen. although still premature validate optimism, clear market good mood last year, include local markets, even outperform many peers. on domestic front, several year subdue growth, cannot rule persistent phenomenon may affect economy’s ability grow, case spend plan public private agent would need revision. one area call special attention labor market. while acknowledge gradually adjust without significantly increase unemployment past several years, possible that, year low growth company wish make drastic change payrolls, particularly expect growth recovery towards end year stalls. in contrast, context macroeconomic imbalance hind growth, scenario improve external outlook consolidates, plus end cycle mine investment adjustment rebound sentiment, could lead dynamic recovery expected. all considered, board belief risk balance inflation activity unbiased. sum up, inflation evolve line december forecasts. however, economy weaker, widen activity gap beyond expectation reduce inflationary pressures. accordingly, board deem appropriate enhance 8 monetary stimulus january march. go forward, believe necessary increase monetary impulse bite more, use work assumption mpr follow trajectory similar one imply financial asset price ten day prior statistical close report. a always, reaffirm commitment conduct monetary policy flexibility, project inflation stand 3% policy horizon. i share final thoughts. final think the evolution economy recent year bring great challenge monetary policy make around world. the action central bank paramount take world financial crisis 2008-2009 prevent relapse follow years, especially country le room fiscal maneuvering. during long period effectiveness monetary policy influence inflation economic activity call question. though le dramatic places, chile discussion also revisit every then. before respond question effective monetary policy is, must clarify two points: objective pursue, operate, explore whether mean contribute ends. chile’s institutionality assign central bank two main functions: safeguard stability price stability payment system, understand financial stability. the first objective specify regime flexible inflation targeting, govern u 15 years, set target annual expect cpi inflation must stand 3% two-year horizon. this regime also consider float exchange rate, bank reserve possibility intervene market, power exercise barely four time since policy come effect 1999. this clarify lie beyond objective monetary policy: one hand, foreign exchange policy i described, target exchange rate. we allow settle freely market respond local interest rate macroeconomic determinants. this relevant because, empirical evidence shows, small, open economy exchange rate important shock absorb mechanism. second, target short-term inflation, longer-term inflation. thus, extent inflation fluctuation perceive transient, much impact policy decisions. a good example steep increase inflation 2014 2016. this process originate largely shock exchange rate transitory effect inflation. of course, duration period high inflation long, respond succession different shock persistent effect single one. 9 on contrary, whenever identify medium-term pressure inflation, either upward downward, must react vigor. the episode i refer illustrative regard. while short term inflation rise result shock exchange rate, transitory effects, medium-term pressure diminish result deteriorate economy. have target short-term inflation, raise mpr. a not, aim medium-term inflation, decision low mpr prevent inflation two year fall 3% target. this response monetary policy different distant past. in 1990s, economy yet sufficiently prepare deal currency shock, bank choose inflation target exchange rate target. the result exercise complex chilean economy. not mention happen early 1980s, defense peg exchange rate change external financial condition lead u recession cost u 15% lose gdp escalate unemployment. apply present scheme, monetary policy, couple fiscal policy base structural balance sheet, achieve inflation objective dampen external domestic shock strongly. the turbulence past cause recession chile, today manifest change pace growth. to end, monetary policy operate several channels. primarily, regulate market liquidity sets, open market operations, interest rate provision liquidity financial system short terms. by way two mechanism affect market interest rates, one influence asset price economic agents’ decisions. the effectiveness monetary policy therefore depend operation mechanism different levels. first, bank's ability ensure provision liquidity critical, maintain market interest rate align mpr. this do regularly open market operation bank operate system allow operation carry appropriate standards. there may case sudden rise market rates, player system face potential actual liquidity constraints. such situation occur 2008, event associate collapse lehman brother sweep world economy. on occasion, bank announce market would resort exceptional liquidity provision mechanism peso dollars, allow local rate altered, despite severe external risks. although bank's monetary policy instrument short-term interest rate, movement affect complete yield curve. the effectiveness change mpr area hinge credibility bank's decision perceive economic agents. here several areas, within communication transparency decision essential. to extent individual company understand validate bank's decisions, consumption investment decision consistent describe scenarios, well asset price market rates. for reasons, bank make special effort transparent communicate decision scenario best possible way. we publish wide range information 10 member board constantly make presentation raise awareness bank's vision, among many efforts. other important factor effectiveness monetary policy change external scenario. be small, open economy, chile subject vagary countries. a say time again, cushion effects, cannot isolate them. in sense, significant fluctuation external scenario that, example, produce unexpected major change capital flow external financial conditions, could affect local market rates. again, bank's ability provide liquidity compensate possible change external condition vital. the example 2008 i describe relevant too. it go unnoticed several mechanism also affect economic activity. for example, extent reduction mpr properly transmit cost interbank funding, financial institution may offer good credit condition client or, base good spread, bring portfolio client people company leave of, example, high risk assessment. at time, people company see attractive offer credit term amount costs, decide spend thereby boost activity. central bank often caricature obsess inflation indifferent economic activity. nothing reality. the deviation growth relevant evolution inflation medium term, mean play fundamental role actions. the close gdp potential, close inflation medium-term target. moreover, great majority cases, monetary policy influence economic activity inflation direction, surprise since tend correlate within business cycle. this especially important economy weak phase cycle monetary stimulus raise inflation boost domestic demand. in case, one must always keep mind whether persistent drop activity result cyclical problem economy respond permanent phenomenon, low potential growth. in latter case, evident output gap much wide face slowdown and, therefore, evident medium-term inflationary pressure lower. again, conduct monetary policy past year good example implicitly ensure economic stability, stance remain expansionary even annual inflation rate 4%, understand obey exceptional episode exchange rate depreciation. the prolong period low growth chile endure recent year put downward pressure medium-term inflation. therefore, within framework i described, monetary policy continue expansionary. measure expansionary monetary policy is, easy task. typically, so-called neutral rate use benchmark. our recent estimates, report box monetary policy report last september, place 1% 1.5% real terms. with real mpr zero prospect reduction near future, use work assumption baseline 11 scenario report, doubt provide considerable boost economy. even importantly, longer-term real rate also around levels, reflect market consider monetary policy expansionary now, expect remain time, line communication bank itself. the low interest rate reflect record-low level risk-free rates, also borrow cost low historic standards. this apply mortgage loan commercial consumer loans. the exchange rate also reacted. in nominal terms, peso 35% level mid-2013. compare countries, however, behavior currency similar, multilateral real depreciation less. finally, perspective country cycle similar ours, monetary policy rate chile among low real terms. nonetheless, must recognize that, even normal situations, effectiveness monetary policy guaranteed, depend correct implementation. this mean respect certain basic principles. monetary policy, first foremost, must coherent policy framework situation country. this imply refrain favor short-term objectives, rather calibrate monetary impulse way project inflation stand 3% two-year horizon. consistency especially important avoid unnecessary up down economy cause market confusion. it implementation must also timely, require enough information good understand economic environment, act promptly change occur. obviously entail take risks, certainty always elusive. one example may come recent evolution monetary policy conduct chile. at presentation committee last december, note baseline scenario feature work assumption monetary stimulus would boost 50 basis points, would do follow months. new information convince u impulse would need speed up, take action monetary policy meet january march. moreover, report i present us mpr trajectory go al little work assumption. also, always, circumstance change medium-term inflation outlook varies, monetary policy adjust accordingly. furthermore, monetary policy underlie diagnosis must persistent enough influence economic decision regard saving, investment pricing, operate significant lags. in chile, estimate indicate take two eight quarter mpr movement completely pas economy. now, vary economic condition complex magnitude impulse estimate still large enough. the event develop world recent year provide good example. after crisis 2008-2009 federal reserve increase monetary impulse beyond usual limit set interest rate. it take zero percent, also add quantitative boost purchase bonds. in normal environment, probably would unnecessary take impulse extremes, probably economy would take le time react. however, 12 post-crisis damage large persistence momentum allow u economy make successful recovery nine years. we see something similar europe, difference take long apply stimulus, suffer bank crisis 2011 and, addition, agreement procedure european community make difficult take extreme decisions. finally, i said, monetary policy must credible, order economic agents’ reaction impulse line objective. if inflation expectation align two-year-ahead target 3%, agents’ decisions, market interest rates, financial asset price harmonize low, stable inflation. the need persistence credibility raise warn inefficient interest rate reduction may perceive temporary market. this important, practice agent consider rate cut short lived, probably meaningful effect yield curve decision household businesses. moreover, cost could outweigh potential benefits. if agent consider downturn ineffective also compromise achievement inflation target, much le expansionary monetary policy could necessary realign inflation expectations. thus, effectiveness monetary policy depend ability timely diagnose state economy implication inflation, respond consistently set policy rate, give sufficient persistence operate generate necessary credibility market respond accordance expect result interventions. at central bank commit ensure conditions. with this, monetary policy continue contribute country's welfare maintain low stable inflation, cushion volatility business cycle. likewise, although central bank instrument directly influence growth potential country, indirectly contribute prevent loss welfare result economic volatility; reduce uncertainty encourage investment, production, employment consumption decisions, contribute make financial sector safe efficient benefit entire population. thank you. 13 figure

price december report (*) 1 when bank england governor mark carney give famous speech climate change almost two year ago, mention ‘the tragedy horizon’. he refer catastrophic impact climate change felt beyond traditional horizon – impose cost future generation current generation incentive fix. the country i’m strike example phenomenon. one quarter netherlands lie sea level. this area home nearly one third population, heart economy. although highly vulnerable effect global warming, still one carbon-intensive economy europe. a well heavy oil gas consumers, also major producer exporter it. so perhaps i’m best position preach world risk climate change. but representative organization whose mission safeguard financial stability contribute sustainable prosperity netherlands, climate change serious concern me. fortunately, number recent event present u new horizon, horizon action climate change. the notable paris climate agreement, enter force last november. i briefly mention unfortunate recent development respect late on, today i’d like concentrate action climate change might look like. i’d also like offer observation importance manage climate-related risk financial institutions. and lastly i want provide insight business opportunity available you. and right rule incentive introduced, opportunity become ever numerous attractive. the theme conference ‘responding sustainability regulation.’ what i want stress that, rather wait regulators, must act now: to manage climate-related risk seize opportunity transition low-carbon economy offers. in word axel weber, write invitation conference: ‘finance seize opportunity manage risk.’ that’s spirit british financial sector. that you’re good at. so could action look like? after decade scientific research climate change, enter era action. climate change long exclusively preserve scientists. today also challenge policymakers business people. a crucial driver paris climate agreement. the agreement establish global commitment limit global warm well two degree celsius. very importantly, provide monitor reduction emissions, forge pathway ambitious efforts, current policy fall short goal. the paris agreement send strong signal policymakers regulator intensify effort come years. 2 the fact unite state withdraw support course small setback. but i confident international community rally together, set right example, press implement paris agreement. today’s announcement climate accord state california china vivid example this. china, amongst world’s large polluters, become one global champion renewable energy. just day ago, eu china reinforce commitment paris agreement, pledge to: - cut back fossil fuel - develop green technology - help raise $100 billion year 2020, help poor country cut emissions. so despite setback, encourage development. numerous initiatives, national international level, already underway. allow name few. at end 2015 financial stability board launch private sector task force climate-related financial disclosure (tcfd). lead michael bloomberg, task force also draw member british financial sector, include ubs. the consultation period report end day ago. the report contain recommendation efficient voluntary framework climate-related financial disclosures. and recommendation use company across sectors. the potential impact framework, put practice, hardly overstated. for first time, provide investors, lenders, insurer stakeholder information concentration carbon-related asset economy exposure climate-related risks. reliable, comparable forward-looking information significantly improve ability assess, example, expose potential investment target clean energy transition, intend it. information crucial kick-start function market climate-related risk. at european level, high level expert group sustainable finance submit interim report european commission within come weeks. the group’s mission provide recommendation hardwiring sustainability eu’s regulatory financial policy framework, identify obstacle sustainability finance, mobilize capital flow sustainable investments. i privilege group observer, i already tell interim report contain policy option concrete far-reaching. it early go detail, i would urge closely study come participate actively public consultation. it also important pay attention prudential regulation financial institutions: incorporate climate factor risk management bank insurance company become mainstream regulatory requirement. and happen sooner rather later. regulator don’t even completely change rule this. after all, already current regulations, financial institution must manage relevant risks. well, climate change relevant risk. financial supervisor could implement focus climate risk management tomorrow. a matter fact, do. in view, should. 3 similarly, financial institution aware regulation disclosure sustainability factors, include climate risk, likely tightened. for instance, france, specific report obligation already set range financial institutions, integrate sustainability factor risk management. regulator could also encourage require sustainability knowledge competence board members, example part fit proper testing. and that’s all. government intervention confine financial sector, cover entire economy. the uk, back 2008, first country world enact comprehensive general climate legislation. more countries, sweden mexico, france singapore, follow commitment paris agreement adopt implement climate transition laws. the dutch central bank publicly advocate climate law pass netherlands well. these law intend provide predictable pathway low-carbon economy. these include clear targets, new regulation meet time. the point give comprehensive overview new regulation come us, signal come climate change: government mean business. and profound implication risk opportunity company faces. and even great climate sceptic earth cannot afford ignore risks. at time, new regulation create great opportunity invest foresight. and financial sector, seize opportunity manage risk core business. be prudential regulator, you’ll forgive i start discuss risks. there generally two type climate-related risk. first, physical risks: impact today insurance liability value financial asset arise climate-related events, flood storm damage property disrupt trade. second, transition risk: financial risk could result process adjustment towards low-carbon economy. change policy, technology physical risk could prompt reassessment value large range asset cost opportunity become apparent. while still debate scientific evidence climate change, representative insurance industry know physical climate risk already reality, affect underwrite strategies. a governor carney state climate speech, lloyd’s london study estimate twenty centimeter rise sea-level around manhattan since 1950s increase insure loss superstorm sandy 30% new york alone. ever since hurricane andrew 1992 lead serious losses, insurance industry use natural catastrophe model analyse measure risk accurately. use instrument norm. insurer therefore seem well-prepared manage physical risk near term. but ahead, beyond typical insurer’s horizon, previously unimagined level physical risk could shift balance premium claim significantly. this threaten solvency, may even make risk uninsurable. if high level greenhouse gas emission continue, scientist predict ocean could rise close two meter end century. just think threat combine value coastal property. and way, estimate could turn conservative side, give current uncertainty surround stability antarctic ice shelfs. 4 while physical risk pose serious threat, transition risk may even important financial institutions. transition risk could also call risk success. take example commitment make paris limit global warm well 2 degree celsius. estimate vary, certain remain budget carbon emission relate target make large amount exist reserve oil, gas coal unusable. the exposure financial institution result write-off strand asset repricing company potentially huge, could pose threat financial stability. possible delay policy change remove risks, magnify them. this may see significant abrupt policy change market adjustment road. this important: long wait, radical measure need be. what i want stress despite uncertainty, even controversy, pace new policy implemented, financial institution regulator take transition risk account. also here, horizon action approach fast. climate-related risk rapidly become mainstream risk financial institution manage, use example scenario analysis. and it’s regulators. increasingly, market investor asking: model identify relevant trend risks? how robust strategy give different scenario contingencies? some institutional investor see climate risk management key indicator quality board-level risk management. similarly, you’re investor, you’re already ask question company invest approach risks, it’s high time did. we’ve look risks. now let’s turn opportunities. finance transition decarbonize economy present major opportunity financial institutions. it imply sweep reallocation resource technological revolution. estimate investment require area efficiency improvements, renewable energy, nuclear energy, carbon capture storage amount much 1 trillion euro annually. technological innovation assist transition. this include develop efficient heat solutions, advance lead light technology, utilize geothermal power, develop electric vehicles. i know still considerable uncertainty potential return investments. but i expect uncertainty diminish significantly international disclosure standard make climate risk transparent, government introduce clarity set targets, rule deadlines. this potential transform green investment niche market major investment class own.. let give example public policy kick-start whole new market green investment: early year dutch house ministry introduce new rule require commercial real estate netherlands energy rat label c good 2023. build fail meet requirement long use offices. dutch bank get involve add surcharge to, outright withholding, fund non-sustainable buildings. at time offer energy efficiency plan finance owner need upgrade buildings. expectation estimate 860 million euro investment necessary meet target realize much early 2023. there examples. i name two: all new public transportation bus the netherlands emission-free 2025. accord current government policy the netherlands hold true new passenger car 2035. 5 my expectation process play increase number sector within economy. public authority set deadlines. deadline zero-emissions/climate neutrality reach certain date: • public transportation • ship • aviation • house • agriculture • manufacture etc etc and private sector jump opportunity. and often beat deadline. a make business sense so. after all, act now, financial institution first mover advantage competitors. they build specialize knowledge valuable assess risk return. for example, 90% wind farm netherlands finance one bank. the argument apply kind finance frontrunners sustainability. despite uncertainty public regulation develop, still plenty opportunity no-regret actions. lady gentlemen, international consensus grow time climate change urgent problem. what new grow resolve among government across globe something it. and i convince recent setback decision present u administration serve strengthen resolve global community, include many, many public private actor us, foster even great international cooperation. both climate change government action create new risk opportunities. risk opportunity anticipate today. so sit around table authority discus obstacle sustainable finance, change regulation necessary. a experience platform sustainable finance netherlands show, input highly valuable. don’t get wrong: i sell anything. a regulator place convince start finance green investment, buy green bond sake it. some may even skeptical scientific evidence climate change, still others may doubt ability government take action. come oil gas-addicted little country sea level, i would understand believe me. but don’t to. a uniform disclosure standard start adopt good information become available carbon intensity companies, manage risk prepare low-carbon world. information allow ass valuation might change time, risk capital. information bring horizon sharply focus. 6 on day, 6th june, 73 year ago part operation overlord 62,000 british soldier cross channel liberate western europe barbarism. churchill say normandy landings: “this vast operation undoubtedly difficult ever occurred. it involve tides, wind, waves, contact condition cannot fully foreseen.” those soldier overcome challenge brilliantly show courage, devotion skill. and i believe spirit still alive well british business community. it’s spirit walk away challenge, stand meet it, turn opportunity. not oblivious risk danger, mind motif sharpen it. aware company’s interest also help preserve world rapidly changing. the challenge today call climate change. let’s aware risk turn opportunities. lady

sibley: non-performing loan – irish perspective aeuropean problemspeech mr ed sibley, deputy governor central bank ireland, second annualconference esrb, frankfurt main, 22 september 2017.* * *introductiongood morning. it pleasure invite speak second annual esrb conference.as chair previous panellist noted, non-performing loan (npls) manydimensions. they affect credit supply channel, impact banks’ finance costs, bringuncertainty banks’ capital position, block-up capital could otherwise use moreeconomically socially useful activities. they also cause considerable distress borrowers.in short, cause serious dysfunction bank system hence ability servethe economy customers. for me, member single supervisory mechanism (ssm) supervisory board, nplsclearly remain one central challenge face european bank sector today.npls go heart bank – simplicity complexity. because credit, likebanking generally, ultimately require trust. high level npls erode trust andconfidence bank system. in remark today, i would first like reflect issue trust. i elaborate theirish experience, point measure solution take regard npls.finally, i would like draw key lesson irish experience, arerelevant broad trajectory europe go forward.trust nplsboth maturity transformation credit intermediation ultimately rely trust.at simplest, depositor need trust put money bank havecertainty able withdraw money future. similarly, bank need trust thatwhen gather deposits, lend long maturities, either repaid, inextremis able enforce collateral. this require trust legal, judicial extra-judicialprocesses.however, see trust evaporate quickly time crises. and, asfrancis fukuyama notes, “widespread distrust society….. impose kind tax formsof economic activity”.while trust confidence may consider intangibles, quantitative impact aredemonstrated hard numbers. for example, investor mistrust reflect lowerprice book ratios; banks’ mistrust reflect elevate interest rate compensate forhigher risk; potential new entrant consolidators mistrust reflect reducedlikelihood enter market high npls, on. authorities, include supervisors, therefore critical role ensure trust within thesystem.the ssm close three year operation. it still relatively new institution. much been12 1 / 7bis central bankers' speech do establish reputation effective, intrusive, independent supervisor.this trust hard-earned easily lost. by take necessary decisions, rightthings continue earn trust european public market participants. and thisincludes take firm action relation npls.but easy. we must consider financial stability issues, perhaps le obviously forsome prudential supervisor – crucially nonetheless – consumer protection matters. prudential supervision consumer protection inherently interlink mutually self-reinforcing. poor outcome consumer poor outcome bank system.although ecb explicit mandate consumer protection, many nationalcompetent authority – central bank ireland – do. even case, itis important intrusive prudential supervision come cost consumer.and particularly relevant action npls, nature relate deal withdistressed borrower – may, example, risk lose family home, smallenterprises provide local employment. indeed, ensure borrower protect remain heart central bank ofireland’s approach npls. this fundamental aim right, also important inrebuilding trust irish financial system broadly follow crisis.i cognisant much do regard, remain high level ofnpls significant drag rebuild trust across system.the irish experience nplsthis bring experience ireland. the irish bank sector transform since start crisis. intensive supervisoryfocus pressure couple improve economic circumstance continue drive reductionsin npls.nevertheless, npls level remain elevate sustainable resolution remain keysupervisory priority.this chart help illustrate story, increasingly intrusive action takento drive npl reduction:3 2 / 7bis central bankers' speech source: central bank ireland regulatory returns. at q3 2014 eba’s harmonise definitionof non-performing introduced. prior date, internal definition use equivalent toimpaired loan and/or arrears > 90 days.prior crash irish bank balance sheet expand considerably, domestic irish banksmore triple size. this increase heavily drive property relate exposuresfacilitated weak lend standard practice (e.g. high ltvs) ultimately unsustainablebusiness models.the economic downturn burst property bubble result large bank loss (the sixlargest bank lose approximately €67.8bn 2008 2012).the national asset management agency (nama) establish december 2009 one anumber initiative take irish authority address serious problem bankingsector. the agency acquire large commercial real estate connect exposure heldby irish banks, nominal value €74bn. the objective deal large andmost problematic loan bank system to, subsequently, obtain best achievablefinancial return state portfolio expect lifetime ten years.interestingly though, chart shows, npls – amount €85.3bn – peak inireland q4 2013, npl ratio 31.8%, two year loan transferredto nama. so, although nama clearly critical part solution deal bankingcrisis ireland – particularly respect large commercial real estate loan – byno mean silver bullet people may think resolve irish npls overall, sme andmortgage loan remain serious grow problem. of critical importance 2010 2011 ensure bank adequatelycapitalised, impairment recognised, adequately provide for. the work involve anassessment asset quality, stress test banks’ balance sheets. an important milestone work conduct central bank ireland thefinancial measure programme (fmp). under fmp, balance sheet assessment stresstest exercise complete 2011 result total capitalisation requirement €24bnfor going-concern banks.4 3 / 7bis central bankers' speech follow recapitalisation 2011, must forget catastrophic cost theirish taxpayer, supervisory focus turn banks’ npl resolution strategy capabilities. they wholly inadequate.the irish bank remain slow recognise problem many case stillreluctant deal it. furthermore, credible strategies, operationalcapability resolve it. indeed, short-term incentive individual bank andmanagement try avoid resolve large scale npls, hope economic recovery willdeal problem. but evidence show reluctance may understandable atan individual bank level, macro impact deal npls highly problematic thesystem whole.the central bank ireland therefore become prescriptive expectation clearlyset banks, including: segment specific strategies, detail implementation plans, andenhanced board ownership.key element include bank set clear plan go address npls.portfolio specific npl strategies, example, mortgage arrears resolution strategy (mars)were require main lenders. banks’ board require approve strategiesencompassing fair treatment customer ensure adequate capability deal witheach customer.consumer protection measure code conduct mortgage arrears andenhanced sme protection run alongside interlink prudential measures.we assess lender’s strategy plans, revert firm-specific feedback, followup action timeline early 2012. while operational capability improved, weremained concern bank overly reliant short term forbearance “extend andpretend” strategies. in words, still drag feet.so, press bank implement long term sustainable solutions, introduce mortgagearrears resolution targets, underpin give guidance view sustainable solutionsthat protect engage borrower well drive resolution. we also introduce non-public sme target banks.you also see central bank introduce subsequently update provisioningguidelines ensure consistency conservatism recognition andprovisioning npls.towards end programme, 2013, repeat exercise assess thestrength banks’ balance sheets, adequacy capital recognition npls.we challenge progress every step way, go out edge remit –challenging organisational structure resource capacity, challenge skill experience,challenging governance oversight, policy procedures, workout strategy andexecution ability.we challenge implementation plans, challenge credit management impairmentrecognition, challenge provision coverage collateral valuations, challenge short-term vssustainable resolutions.and continue challenge irish bank today.and slow i would like, approach working. this achieve throughbetter cohort cohort borrower engagement strategies, work sustainablyrestructuring loans, portfolio sales. importantly, legislation pass enableborrower protection travel loan sell outside bank system. 4 / 7bis central bankers' speech account write-off yet feature extent warranted.npls ireland reduce fourteen consecutive quarters. it represent 58% reductionfrom peak, decrease €50bn. in ways, graph understate progress,because npl ratio materially reduce time verysizeable deleveraging system – loan book (both good bad) aggregate muchreduced. but remain much done, primarily long past due mortgage arrears,which remain blight distress borrowers, banks, system whole.the reason i recall recent irish history, that, many respect journey take inireland follow european level.asset quality balance sheet strength always priority ssm, evidencedby comprehensive assessment 2014. when take supervisory responsibility foreurope’s banks, npl outlook diverse across euro area. while certain countries’banking sector had, still have, low npl ratios, recognise even countrieswhere bank struggle asset quality, may affect spillovers.through comprehensive assessment, ssm take early action gain assurance thatproblem loan recognise system whole sufficient capital managethe problem, base stress scenario, way do inireland 2010 / 2011.yet npls remain stubbornly high. the banks’ response npl problem havedisappointed, way irish banks’ initial response did. issue regard recognition provision npls persisted. strategy capability fordealing inadequate. individually, bank appear sufficiently incentivised toaddress problem. furthermore, structural issue different jurisdiction causingsignificant issues.following establishment ssm npl taskforce, much work data collection andjurisdictional difference approaches, march year, ecb publish finalguidance bank non-performing loans. the guidance set ssm’s expectation nplmanagement – prescribe bank implement ambitious yet realistic strategy toreduce npls, use granular, portfolio-by-portfolio approach. they must also setinternal target reduce npls. this necessarily mean portfolio sales. the hardyards engagement distress borrowers, workout, restructure right-sizing debtmust also cornerstone successful npl reduction. bank also take actionthrough account reflect reality collectability long date npls.those strategy currently scrutiny joint supervisory team (jsts), andhave become basis day-to-day supervisory dialogue banks.it still early process implementation guidance, many bank havesubmitted credible plans. however, many still need improve – indeed whollyinadequate cases, bank require resubmit.the supervisory review evaluation process (srep) continue underpin ssm’sapproach npl resolution – impose quantitative capital qualitative remediationrequirements part annual risk assessment significant bank.lessons irish crisis5 5 / 7bis central bankers' speech i would like highlight three key lesson irish experience relevant aeuropean perspective.firstly, leave devices, individual bank resolve europe’s npl problem, nomatter primarily responsibility so.intensive, courageous outcomes-focused supervision required. and one-offeffort – need continuous persistent, drive high quality analysis. when get tothe end cycle work need start beginning.the ecb guidance bank non-performing loan therefore important step towardsnpl resolution across european bank system.secondly, clear irish experience single measure resolve npls.supervisors cannot solve alone. what help ireland combination factors:including nama, increasingly intrusive prescriptive supervisory measures, legalinitiatives. the interplay economic recovery obviously hugely important also.as highlight july 2017 ecb stocktake report national supervisory practice legalframeworks relate npls, number structural obstacle still prevent bank resolvingtheir npls timely fashion across euro area. these include lengthy legal procedures, taxand indeed account impediments. action front therefore require – even memberstates high level npls.thirdly, consequence credit boom go bust severe, take hugeamount time address. whilst make significant progress address npls theirish bank system, npl workout resolution take time, even buoyant economy.early intervention therefore critical achieve best outcome borrower andbanks. moreover, intrusive supervision current underwrite practice well continually assessingthe long term sustainability business model crucial prevent recurrence, even arestill deal legacy past mistakes.conclusionmuch work remain irish bank do, european bank whole. first andforemost, bank must act themselves. but not, slow, ambitiousenough, job supervisor drive so.in central bank ireland, continue work tirelessly earn trust irish people,both work financial system whole – isdemonstrably serve long term economic need country customer asustainable way.the central bank ireland continue play active supportive role ssm,

human?” this question preoccupy philosopher hundred ofyears. one popular answer human rational animal – view goesback aristotle.let u take question adapt world: mean european bankingsupervisor? the answer certainly bank supervisor rational bankers.but apart that, european bank supervisor mean many things. first all, itmeans look across borders. it mean tough fair, unbiased national interests. forus, mean part team supervisor 19 country 27 institutions. it meansworking public interest – excite job.but also mean deal many challenge time. and challenge i’dlike talk speech. but many time limited, i make achoice. so let first tell i won’t today.i won’t discus bring together culture language different. i won’tdiscuss deal bank struggle remain profitable. i won’t discus digitalisation, iwon’t discus brexit.instead, i focus three issues: first, rulebook bank relate supervision;second, toolbox supervisor disposal; third, role market.supervisors rulebooka solid rulebook cornerstone stable bank sector. it ensure bank acknowledgethe risk take build adequate buffers. a solid rulebook lay foundation forbanking supervisor job.since financial crisis, rulebook bank thoroughly revised. today, bank facemuch tough rule before. they need hold high capital buff consist bettercapital. at time, need hold liquidity buff – first time ever. and arejust two thing help make bank resilient.so regulatory base make solid. but need solid; alsoneeds level. the rule bank should, general, harmonise across countries. onlythen would bank able compete level play field.but what’s scope harmonisation? here, bold, view. the financialsector global scope, rule govern it. and crisis, wasprecisely idea drive work global rulebook: basel iii.but since then, political landscape changed. it seem havestopped subscribe idea global approach regulation. national interest might getthe upper hand, that’s good. against backdrop, need finalise basel iii quicklyas possible. 1 / 6bis central bankers' speech but global set standard first step. the second step country toimplement consistent manner. that include euro area. here, level play field iseven important, give single currency single market.and indeed single european rulebook. however, take close look, turnsout single rulebook single, all. so, fact, still kind regulatoryhotchpotch europe. how be?well, one reason part single rulebook come form eu directives. andthese directive still transpose national law. that turn open door forsignificant difference countries.one many example relate know “fit proper” requirements. bankdirectors fulfil certain criterion competence probity take job.however, criterion differ across euro area. in countries, quite strict, inothers le so. and ecb bind national law, cannot provide harmonisedsupervision case.but patchwork consist that. the rulebook also contain know asoptions discretions, o&ds short. these o&ds provide government supervisorswith leeway apply rules. again, lead difference across countries.here make progress, though. together national supervisors, haveagreed exercise number option discretion harmonise manner. but arestill o&ds lie hand governments. so bring moreharmonisation. and i admit i quite disappoint little do area.and last least, third item help explain europe’s regulatory mix. we stillsee country issue national law affect core european bankingsupervision. there are, instance, national law govern risk management. and lawsapply bank directly supervise ecb, course. now imagine abanking group entity germany spain. this bank group would subject todifferent rule come manage credit risk liquidity reporting. needle say, thisseems ill-suited bank union level play field.now regulatory hotchpotch mean european bank supervisors? well, itmakes le effective le efficient. in bad case, deal 19 nationalrules instead single european one. this make hard treat bank equally. it lead morebureaucracy high costs. it open door regulatory arbitrage, distortscompetition.my advice therefore clear: must harmonise rulebook. instead eu directives,we rely eu regulations, directly apply member states. weshould deal remain o&ds, stop pass national laws,especially apply bank supervise european level.instead, strive cut national laws, concerningthe report requirement become redundant result european reportingframework. scrap law would increase efficiency reduce cost bank andsupervisors.so supervisor need strong level regulatory base. however, must careful itdoes turn cage. how could happen? how could rulebook evolve way thatwould confine supervisors? 2 / 6bis central bankers' speech the problem “too much detail”, kind regulatory “overload” – involve manystakeholders much bureaucracy. there tendency add detail tothe rulebook. this drive desire rule cover every eventuality. whateverhappens, rule deal it. it would trigger supervisory action. and didn’texist, well, there’s trigger action.however, try rule every eventuality elusive goal, course. the business ofbanking complex fast-changing rulebook would able fully cover it. theunexpected always happen. if chance, bank make happen onpurpose.and precisely one problem entail overly detail rulebook: regulatoryarbitrage. the detail rules, way bank game them. this create newrisks, cover rules.on top that, overly detail rulebook would make much difficult supervisor toreact decisively quickly change environment. supervise bank could turn amere box-ticking exercise. and supervisor would turn expert tiny details; could endup focus minutia forget big picture.and would waste. it would waste experience, expertise insight thatsupervisors have. why strengthen judgement? why keep flexibility need toreact newly emerge risk ever-changing bank sector? and within asensible legal framework, course.at end day, need both. we need clear-cut rules, need sound supervisoryjudgement. add detail rule might come expense supervisoryjudgement. with recent reform strike balance regard. if upsetthis balance, would become much hard ensure bank remain safe sound.supervisors toolboxbut european bank supervisor need adequate rulebook job. theyalso need right tools, course. they need european toolbox.and here, lot done. we harmonise main tool bank supervision: thesupervisory review evaluation process, srep short. in srep take closelook bank. we analyse business model, governance, risk management wellas risk capital liquidity positions.the srep provide common yardstick compare bank across euro area. it help u toidentify best practice spot common problems. by refer srep, developspecific supervisory requirement measure bank. and way, supervisoryjudgement play big role srep.but srep massive tool, still need refine it. let give example. aspart srep, review process bank use ass maintain adequatecapital liquidity buffers. these process know icaap ilaap. base whatwe learn srep exercises, refine expectation regard icaap ilaap,and method review them.and also need consider best ass risk management bank srep.we need define expect regard management it risks,outsourcing leverage finance. we need define fully fledge minimum expectation therisk management banks.1 3 / 6bis central bankers' speech but toolbox comprise srep. so thing need toimprove. first, tool apply different way different countries. on-siteinspections bank one example. in countries, preparation take time,while actual inspection quite short. in countries, way round. this makesit difficult coordinate create international team on-site inspectors.second, tool exist country others. in regard, themoratorium tool come first mind. it allow supervisor suspend activity failingbank short period time. it help handle failure timely orderly manner.therefore, moratorium power part european toolbox.another tool need call “deductions funds”. it would help ensurethat bank make adequate provision risk – adequate prudential point view. thenational account framework allow flexibility regard provisioning. and abank choose may sufficient supervisors’ viewpoint, take account thebank’s risk profile. that’s supervisor able impose prudential deduction fromown funds.and third, tool part european toolbox twice. andthis cause problems. a relevant case relate bank get trouble questionof intervene early possible. a rule thumb, bank don’t get trouble theblue. rather, gradual downfall cases. thus, tool disposal thatallow u step early send warn signal banks.this know early intervention. however, relevant tool ourstandard tools. and overlap might prevent u use early intervention tools. the reasonis bind use least intrusive tool, always standard one. this isparticularly relevant market authority demand bank disclose whether earlyintervention tool deployed. so, overlap early intervention tool andstandard tool removed.to sum up, still need work toolbox european bank supervisors. we toexpand, harmonise streamline it.supervisors marketnow let u come back initial question. be european bank supervisor mean doingan important job. equip adequate rulebook necessary tools, supervisor helpto make bank safe sound. such bank turn form foundation strong economy.but become self-centred.banks private enterprises, bank sector market, all. a such, deploysforces help keep risk check secure stability. there even time whenmany believe market force alone could bring stable efficient bank sector,ensure sustainable business model make bank resilient up down theeconomy. that belief shatter crisis.but don’t get wrong. i believe market; theory, force market work fine. theproblem that, practice, always work well, several reasons.first all, market make people interacting, people limits. ampleresearch show human brain good handle risk. we tend over- orunderestimate it; tend get carry away potential gains; tend overreact whenthings change.and then, people’s behaviour depend incentive sometimes distorted. the 4 / 6bis central bankers' speech prominent example this: whenever keep gain pas potential loss tosomeone else, might tempt take much risk.so, practice, market shortcomings. but reason away it? no, notat all. we try make work. for bank sector, mean align incentives.and i mentioned, best incentive keep risk check potential failure financialloss. a economist allan meltzer noted: “capitalism without failure like religion without sin.it doesn’t work.” but banking, lack failure.during crisis, many bank fail fail. instead, government proppedthem public fund – huge cost taxpayers. they fear systemiccrisis. they worry large bank fails, would drag others destroy theentire system.so situation bank could pas loss someone else keepingany profits. they incentive gamble people’s money. so, need make itpossible bank fail without cause whole system collapse. and need makesure profit-makers also loss-takers. that would align incentives, strengthen marketdiscipline keep risk-taking check.in europe, new system exactly purpose: single resolutionmechanism, srm short. the srm provide tool resolve bank orderly manner.earlier year, pass first test couple bank failed. this huge steptowards impose market discipline bank make safe sounder.and i confirm deal fail bank among complex thing doas supervisor. the first step ecb declare bank fail likely fail. and that, initself, delicate matter.a bank fail million reasons. sometimes slow death drag week andweeks. sometimes happen within couple days. in end, ecb decidewhether moment come, decision cannot take lightly.taking early might infringe right investor creditors. take late might leadto systemic crisis; might harm economy society. so decision thatrequires supervisor carefully judge case hand.once ecb declare bank fail likely fail, another body take over: singleresolution board, srb short. it srb decide deal bank.in nutshell, handle fail bank europe. once start look details,it become much complex, course. it require party involve closely cooperate.and require parties, include banks, well prepared. that’s importantfor bank carefully draft recovery resolution plans.but i said, recent experience show approach works. the ecb, srb, theeuropean commission relevant national authority prove cooperateclosely. they demonstrate deal fail bank handle wholeprocess smoothly.that said, thing improved, course. and i think actualfailure bank. i also think do come that.and here, need think precautionary recapitalisation, instance. under strictconditions, european rule state aid allow bank give public funds. however, theseaid rule might need update would align new european resolution regime. 5 / 6bis central bankers' speech in context, also need reflect define solvency. after all, bank need tobe solvent order receive precautionary recapitalisation. here, need reach commonunderstanding define solvency, particular forward-looking aspect.as banks, need reflect handle liquidity crisis. mostimportantly, need make sure backstop place readily accessible.and then, push come shove, need improve tool need actuallyresolve bank. i already mention tool still need add europeantoolbox. the moratorium one them.and finally, must keep mind systemically relevant bank resolve ateuropean level. all bank subject national insolvency regimes. it might thus bewarranted harmonise regime across europe ensure level play field.all thing i mention impact supervisor ass react therisks bank risk bank failures.conclusionladies gentlemen,what mean european bank supervisor? that one question theoutset. and answer mean many things. it job challenge andrewarding time.today i mostly talk challenges. i talk need write solid andharmonised rulebook. i talk need expand, harmonise streamline thesupervisory toolbox. and i talk make market work again.to end positive note, let u turn reward aspect european bankingsupervisor. above all, mean part unite europe. it mean work towards stableand truly european bank sector – bank sector span 19 country serf morethan 300 million people.and people rely banks. they rely bank invest savings, help starta business buy home. it job european bank supervisor contribute stablebanking system reliably efficiently serve needs.thank

time variated range, mostly shortperiods time due fluctuation exchange rate. this case approximately 3years ago, inflation fell systematically target 3 consecutive years.note medium long term inflation expectation continue well anchor withinthe target band, thus give credence monetary policy.the importance price stability, reiterate renew bank israel law 2010,where state bank’s first role maintain price stability, support economicgrowth financial stability. the bank give appear ample room attain itstarget, 24 months, allow “look through” temporary shocks, onetime event areexpected short-lived impact inflation, thus push range fleetingly. or wethought. but first, let zoom give broad outline macro data mpc take construct view economic developments.over past years, many israel’s trade partner face financial crisisand cop protractedly underperform economy, israel’s economy growingsteadily, close potential growth rate, support continue rise laborrate participation (particularly women), growth employment across sectors, rise realand nominal wage embolden private consumption expenditures. of course, thedata underlie picture, come smoothly, aside labor market datathat consistently strong, plenty fluctuations, include significant revision ofquarterly national account data despite robust current account surplus, face clearlyunderperforming export sector. the lull export part due slowdown world trade,but keenly aware continue strengthen shekel, beyond couldestimate would normal adjustment reflect relatively good performance israelieconomy.so unemployment all-time low, wage rise yet inflation remain low,compelling u dig deep source order disentangle underlie “core” trend,from series exogenous shock push inflation down. these many varied,from import

thesecame addition backdrop social protest concern cost live thatincreased public’s price awareness change consumer habit enhance competition inthe retail sector, particularly increase use internet

consumer savvy.throughout period, 3 years, forecast market expectationssystematically underestimate downward force prices, thus overestimatedforthcoming inflation.the discussion mpc reflect challenge one hand allow welcomereduction level prices, maintain overall price stability environment– hard anchor allow good function economy.we low bank israel’s rate inflation dropping, reach 0.1% march

always happy st. john’s, unique corner country. give city’sgeography, history rich culture, get call st. john’s home fortunate,indeed.the idea “home” preoccupation u bank canada. we workingsince global recession almost decade ago bring canadian economy home. what iwant today give sense far economy come much ithas go, talk sign watch along way.the goal monetary policy keep inflation low, stable predictable. under termsof agreement bank federal government, aim annual rate ofconsumer price inflation 2 per cent. of course, unforeseen event always push inflationup down. so, agreement set target band 1 3 per cent.what i mean “home”? for us, home intersection full capacity 2 per centinflation. we expect economy reach full capacity, inflation converge 2per cent midpoint target band. that preoccupy idea home.our adjustment interest rate affect economic activity, affect gap thelevel output full capacity, turn affect inflation. however, importantconsideration sometimes get lost: process take time. any change interest rate willnot full impact inflation year half two years. so, makeour monetary policy decisions, le concern late inflation numbers—whichare already month old—than inflation future.forecasting inflation: data, sentiment intelligencethat bring u question forecast future inflation. the place start witheconomic models. model indispensable develop forecast inflation rest ofthe economy. however, central banker would ever base monetary policy decision solely ona projection economic model. model provide u coherent start point, weneed apply real-world judgment reach policy decision.a lot judgment come conversation people. early year, deputy governorlynn patterson spokeabout bank glean intelligence financial markets. equallyimportant effort gauge business sentiment—sometimes call “soft data”—and gatherintelligence real economy business leaders. we need understand viewfrom main street bay street help inform outlook growth inflation. this iswhere regional offices, staff people routinely visit company across country,play vital role.one important vehicle effort business outlook survey (bos),which celebrate 20thanniversary year. the informal process visit beganwhen i bank early 1990s. in fact, first time i visit st. john’s 1 / 5bis central bankers' speech consultations. through survey conversation business leaders, weregularly get clue economic trend show official economic statistics.let illustrate. the roughly 50 per cent drop oil price 2014 represent cut ofroughly $60 billion per year export revenue oil producers. some impact cutwere immediately obvious predictable. we know oil-intensive region would hurt thedrop income oil company would reduce spending. certainly, people thiscity province aware pain cause oil price shock.however, bos take late 2014, together additional discussion energycompanies, reveal warn sign go well beyond decline business investment.for example, company region tell u flood résumés ofworkers return alberta. service firms, hotel truck companies, tell usabout book suddenly cancelled. energy-service company tell u previouslysigned contract construction exploration work renegotiated, eventerminated.so, well shock start show statistics, could see would asignificant negative effect canadian economy outlook inflation. this wascrucial decision low interest rate january 2015. and, company cut theirinvestment intention further, low interest rate follow july.to clear, economic model correctly predict collapse oil price would aserious blow. specifically, main policy model give u invaluable insight shockwould affect economy subsequent adjustment would unfold. but fact thateverything hear support insight increase confidence cuttingrates right course action.adjusting low oil pricesobviously, drop oil price significant detour canadian economy. we knewthat shock would trigger complex series adjustment create significant hardship formany people.basically, model project economy would go reverse experiencein 2010–14, high oil price lead strong increase business investment nationalincome. province energy sector relatively important, newfoundlandand labrador, would feel effect acutely. this underscore one fundamentalchallenges policy-makers, economic shock different effect acrosscanada’s regions.in term adjustments, anticipate low oil price would mean decline theenergy sector, also pickup growth non-energy sector. we expect export beboosted low canadian dollar. and, export company reach capacity limits,we expect see business investment increase. strong export investment wouldcomplement household spending, growth would become broadly-based self-sustaining.certainly, adjustment energy sector painful. beyond cut investment spending,oil company restructure operation lay workers. employment resource sectorfell roughly 50,000 job begin 2015 middle last year. despite this,companies boost production export crude oil early investment completedand find great efficiencies. and, since oil price u dollars, decline thecanadian dollar also help cushion impact shock. the increase output weakercurrency help offset almost half $60 billion decline revenue oil shipments,boosting export $25 billion. 2 / 5bis central bankers' speech that said, canada’s export take long recover anticipated. exportingcompanies take significant hit global financial crisis. manydisappeared, replace time new firm export new good services. a aconsequence, composition canada’s export also change since crisis. exportsof service category technical, travel, financial management services, havetaken lead, traditional goods, motor vehicle parts, see theirshares decline. by mid-2016, non-energy export fully recoup previous drop, andtoday, total export almost 10 per cent pre-crisis peak.monetary policy play key role adjustment. we estimate loweredour policy rate 2015, economy would roughly 2 per cent small today—a difference ofalmost $50 billion—and would 120,000 few jobs. government fiscal stimulusmeasures also contribute importantly growth, mean good mix monetaryand fiscal policy. without fiscal stimulus, interest rate would evenlower were. all thing equal, would mean even household debtand increase longer-term vulnerability economy.as look ahead, project business investment key driver economic growth.business investment also slow materialize expected, beenstrong across board first half year. further, recent bos, ourregional staff find company focus expand capacity werepreviously. indeed, business across increase range sector say expect salesgrowth improve further, hire intention reach record high.given evidence, could see begin summer economy’sadjustments low oil price essentially complete. to clear, impact shockwas still visible energy-intensive area country. but offset macrolevel great strength areas.so, july, early month, raise key policy interest rate. between thosetwo rate hike saw long string stronger-than-expected economic data, culminate thegdp report end august show annual growth rate second quarter 4.5per cent. a note recent interest rate announcement, pace unlikely besustained, recent data point clearly moderation second half year. still, theexpansion become broadly-based self-sustaining, important rememberthat level output relative potential drive inflation, growth rate. we inthe process develop update forecast growth inflation, publish innext month’s monetary policy report (mpr).risk managementdespite recent news economic growth, story inflation canada pastfew year dominate downside risks. indeed, past five years,inflation bottom half target band. bear mind long lag betweeneconomic activity inflation, much low inflation due slow economic growthin past. more recently, also reflect temporary factor weakness food andelectricity prices. in fact, inflation surprisingly soft recently much developedworld, canada. i say minutes.since inflation consistently low half target band, risk-managementapproach monetary policy lead u pay great attention force push inflation down. thisis inflation already low, negative shock outlook inflation moresignificant policy consequence surprise upside. throughout, want besure policy would sufficiently stimulative get economy home.as expansion continues, continue manage evolve risk inflation outlook. 3 / 5bis central bankers' speech the temporary factor hold inflation dissipate monthsahead, although recent exchange rate development could affect timing. in julyprojection, forecast inflation would reach close 2 per cent middle next year.since projection, bank’s measure core inflation edge higher, expected. weexpect downward pressure inflation shift upward pressure economic slack isused up. indeed, model forecast slight overshoot 2 per cent target 2019—aproduct model’s dynamics.the appropriate path interest rate situation difficult know, area number important unknown around inflation outlook. these unknown unusual, asthey mostly product unusual nature situation find in—thelegacy global financial crisis, protract period slow economic growth extremelylow interest rates, on. accordingly, need keep update understand theeconomy real time. that say outlook inflation, therefore monetarypolicy, particularly data dependent right now.the mean data dependencewhat mean, practical terms, say monetary policy “data dependent”? after all,central bank always depend data measure economy’s progress relative toexpectations.what i mean context period heighten uncertainty economyis evolve implication inflation, need pay close attention theinformation receive, include data, sentiment indicator intelligence, makecontinuous inference economy evolving, behaviour may bechanging.let give four example issue monitoring.the first, important, evolution economic capacity. i say version of“home” intersection full capacity 2 per cent inflation. but full capacity amoving target. this company increase investment, augment theircapacity produce combination raise productivity increase theirworkforce. this welcome development because, economy approach full capacity,investment spend effect push capacity limits, give economymore room grow non-inflationary way. in short, something worth encouraging. tosome extent, happen point every economic cycle, protract cycle wehave make issue particularly relevant time around.a second issue question inflation technology. some economist citedtechnology contribute weakness global inflation. the digital economy may beallowing good service produce deliver efficiently, help keep pricesdown. we may also see strong competition e-commerce, affect howretailers set prices.it worth emphasize type disinflation increase everybody’s purchase power andtherefore also positive development. the bank would want estimate impact oftechnological development trend inflation and, assume impact temporary, seethrough it, provide inflation expectation remain well anchored. there lot workto do understand size persistence effects.a third issue wage growth, slow would expect economythat approach full output. hourly wage increase annual pace 1.7 per cent thesecond quarter, growth subdue months, although sign anincrease late monthly employment report. the slow growth likely due part 4 / 5bis central bankers' speech employment shift higher-paying job oil sector lower-paying job elsewhere.how long effect continue clear, phenomenon may work. again, wemust work hard understand data, underlie shift behaviour may bepointing to.the fourth issue elevate household

look closely seehow economy’s adjustment change interest rate may differ previouseconomic cycles.this exhaustive list. there also many external risk uncertainty around ouroutlook, include geopolitical development rise protectionist sentiment partsof world. the evolution neutral rate interest also topic significant debate theprofession. we talk uncertainty time.in environment, simply cannot rely mechanically economic models. this notmean abandon models. it mean need use plenty ofjudgment, inform data, sentiment indicator intelligence, go delicateprocess bring inflation sustainably target. we continue watch data closely,as well development financial markets, term impact outlook inflation.we recognize economy may act differently previous cycles. we bemechanical approach monetary policy. let quickly make one final point. among financial market development watchclosely movement longer-term interest rate exchange rate. change interestrates naturally lead movement canadian dollar. however, currency move formany reasons, include external factors, movement affect inflationoutlook, depend cause, size persistence.conclusionit time conclude. i hope i give appreciation far economy hascome way home. and although confident economy make significantprogress, cannot certain exactly far leave go.the economic progress see tell u move take ease policy 2015were right thing do. at minimum, additional stimulus long needed. but isno predetermine path interest rate here. monetary policy particularly datadependent circumstance and, always, could still surprise either direction.we continue

lead severe inconsistencies, recent resolutionof banco popular español strongly put evidence.one underestimate much achieve short time-span. however, inthe rush solve overarch problem always risk create new problems. the accountability recently create european institution good example regardwhere must ask intrinsic goal preserve financial stability beingsuperseded strict auto-protective

transmission bank system hasbecome increasingly effective since begin adopt credit-easing measures. i referringhere specifically expand asset purchase programme (app), similar case bemade target longer-term refinance operations.at request committee, let focus one component app, namely cspp.together purchase asset-backed security cover bonds, cspprepresents important credit-easing component app. by directly low market-based finance cost non-financial corporations, boost pass-through monetarypolicy.under cspp, eurosystem since june 2016 purchase bond issue widerange non-bank corporation

people already high ataround 15%.1 1 / 7bis central bankers' speech youth unemployment structural also highly pro-cyclical. during greatrecession, correspond cyclical downturn, youth unemployment surge markedly.between 2007 2013, increase 9 percentage point euro area – twice asmuch overall unemployment rate.but euro area aggregate hide important difference across euro area. greece spainentered

percentage point peak, euro area average.however, headline unemployment rate give partial picture labour market situation.many young people euro area still education actively seek employment.the possible significant social economic consequence even relevant look atnew measure labour utilisation, take account unemployed people notinvolved education training. in 2016, around 17% people age 20and 24 euro area neither employment, education training, ireland beingclose euro area average. in greece spain, number 23% 21%respectively.the persistence heterogeneity youth unemployment across member state point tocontinued underlie problem labour market structures, correspondingly high cost forour societies.long-term cost youth unemploymentcyclical unemployment turn structural people remain unemployed long time.protracted period unemployment result “scarring” effects, lead greaterlikelihood future unemployment, human capital loss low earnings. and hasnegative effect life satisfaction, also health, may persist well late life.the sense detachment produce prolong unemployment welldocumented several social experiments. with large proportion young people havingany define role society (neither look jobs, acquire skill find one), ahigh risk social cohesion trust public institution undermined, harm formedium-term growth prospects.youth unemployment also costly term long-term productivity. high-productivity firms,particularly early expansion phase, likely hire young people thatgroup help become innovative.innovation driven, among things, curiosity creativity. the fact young peopleare curious require explanation; teacher among withchildren grandchild well aware that.when come creativity, age play crucial role. creativity measured, example, bythe number original

much interest firm recruit young people.the young also good position facilitate knowledge diffusion. in regard, labourmobility key. during early year careers, young workers, search betterjob, move frequently profession assignments. a get old changejobs le often: age 40 switch half much 20. the mobility theyoung likely facilitate efficient allocation labour high job-to-job transitions. andthis mobility across firm sectors, sometimes across region countries, contributesto diffusion expansion knowledge.for reasons, youth employment productivity growth create virtuous circle. whenfirms become productive likely employ young people. and youngpeople opportunities, capitalise skills, add productivity growth,which among benefit society lead high wages.youth unemployment break virtuous circle: drag innovation impedesknowledge diffusion decrease mobility.additionally, unemployment prevent experience worker young worker interacting.the experience one don’t benefit insight knowledge young. and they, turn,don’t gain know-how experience workers.the role policiesas seen, cyclical structural reason high rate youthunemployment.demand-side policies, fiscal monetary policy, help address cyclicalfluctuations. our monetary policy measures, aim maintain price stability, supportingdomestic demand thus recovery employment, also young generation ofeuropeans benefiting.furthermore, forget crisis financial crisis, therefore financialpolicies also essential. it important improve resilience financial systemby strengthen sectoral balance sheets, appropriate financial regulatory andsupervisory framework, robust macroprudential policy framework.but rise youth unemployment also deeply root structural reasons.the persistence heterogeneity youth unemployment rate across euro area

change relate digitalisation globalisation. the skillmismatch index euro area labour market 2007 almost twice high in2004.there also large heterogeneity across euro area countries. the oecd’s survey

karl brunner distinguish lecture. the swiss national bank establish karl brunner distinguish lecture series pay tribute academic whose research particular relevance central banking. with annual lecture, want reach wide audience, including, particular, students. for reason today’s event take place eth zurich, internationally one renowned academic institutions. i would like thank president eth zurich, professor lino guzzella, make fantastic premise available us. this year, pay tribute john b. taylor. he one world’s foremost economists. john’s work characterise keen interest highly relevant questions, academic apply point view. he make major contribution economic theory. in addition, bridge divide theory practice, one economist profound impact economic policy thus macroeconomic stability. john also effective teacher. just let give one example. do know tiger woods, famous golf professional, student introductory class stanford? john teach tiger opportunity costs. immediately afterwards, tiger leave college join pro tour. clearly, decision pay off. but back john taylor again. today, talk ‘ideas institution monetary policy making’. before give floor, i briefly introduce him. bear yonkers, new york, john taylor earn a.b. princeton university ph.d. stanford. he teach columbia university 1973–1980 princeton university 1980–1984. and since 1984, teach research stanford. john perfect economist. he outstanding researcher, policy advisor teacher. in acknowledgment exceptional services, receive number prestigious award excellence three fields. let say word areas, begin john taylor researcher. his research topic range work rational expectation wage price dynamics, macroeconomics, econometrics, fiscal policy, and, course, monetary policy. he write impressive number influential article lead journal important books. it impossible summarise research sentences. therefore, i limit two topics. the first topic date back second half 1970s, john initiate research strategy would profound last impact profession. it time new-classical macroeconomist claim monetary policy powerless come steer economy. this challenge keynesian monetarist views. john quickly accept new concept rational expectations. however, reject page 3/4 assumption market always clear, price wage perfectly flexible. his research show – result stagger wage contract – monetary policy, even anticipated, useful stabilise economy. this restore proposition keynesian monetarist model even anticipate change money affect economy. the second topic i would like highlight recurrent theme john’s research agenda. this deep interest rule monetary policy. john’s research always emphasise importance rule-like, systematic behaviour monetary policy. however, late 1980s, many people argue efficient rule would complex, express severe doubt practicability rule monetary policy. so john decide time write workable rule consistent research. the result simple equation guide interest rate decision fed. the equation relate policy rate inflation unemployment. when present rule carnegie-rochester conference november 1992, regard big deal. it turn quite differently. his paper, publish 1993, become one cite work macroeconomics. the rule become know taylor rule. my experience snb testify importance taylor rule. for us, taylor rule derive appeal three features. the first simplicity describe behaviour different central bank estimate policy reaction deviation inflation target output gap. the second quality benchmark assess current stance monetary policy respect historical average similar macroeconomic situation. and, thirdly, taylor rule appeal set standard monetary policy introduce macroeconomic model forecast simulation purposes. the snb’s monetary policy focus maintain price stability, follow explicit rule set short-term interest rate. however, taylor rule serf important indicator decision-making process help u conduct systematic policy. have talk john researcher, i would like turn john taylor policy advisor. time again, john merge research policy making. on account, record long outstanding well. he serve member president’s council economic advisor 1989 1991. he panel economic adviser congressional budget office 1995 2001. and 2001 2005, serve under secretary treasury international affairs. his responsibility include set new currency iraq get terrorist finance control. he work economic reconstruction afghanistan, coordination financial policy g7 countries. all all, impressive job. currently, john member g20 eminent person group global financial governance, aim improve function global financial architecture governance. no le fascinate john taylor teacher ‘quantitative’ ‘qualitative’ terms. on one hand, give countless speeches, hundred lectures, write several page 4/4 textbook develop online courses. on hand, know mix teach entertainment. indeed, john hesitate use special didactic technique help student understand remember material. during classes, cite one example, john enter humorous dialogue adam smith, reveal deep enthusiasm dedication job. and way, example quite remarkable someone describe humour “as mostly deadpan”, generally take lecture student able figure something actually joke. have talk john’s three occupation separately, i emphasise well interact stimulate one another. research integrate college lectures; government work enable understand policy constraints, turn stimulate research. “economic research,” john wrote, “is excite productive policy-driven.” karl brunner could agree more. come end remarks, i would like repeat profoundly john taylor’s think affect central banking. for this, earn deep respect gratitude. i certain lecture give u much new food think crucial issues. lady gentlemen, please join welcome john

time take stock learn map whatmay come next.following stable principle eurosystem’s risk management frameworkthe eurosystem clearly define objective, enshrine treaty, preserve pricestability euro area. the treaty speak eligible counterparties, collateral haircutsor issue share limit bond purchases. however, would mistake assume thatmanaging financial risk role eurosystem’s monetary policy implementation –especially light significant balance sheet expansion past years. on thecontrary, apply guide principle financial risk management framework astable manner. we establish principle long embark non-conventionalpolicies, least statutory obligation lend adequate collateral.we continue apply standard well non-standard policy measures.broadly speaking, principle protection, consistency, simplicity transparency. thismeans – multiple monetary policy option exist fulfil mandate – select themeasures minimise exposure financial risks. this idea sometimes refer toas risk efficiency. these principle also imply aim avoid undue distortion themarkets operate. we trade market price adopt risk-equivalentapproach set risk control measures. in addition, principle require risk managementto integral part decision-making institution. so compel measure riskin objective consistent way across different type operation. lastly, frameworkspromote transparency simplicity, champion adherence principle beingrules-based predictable possible operations.we come together discus risk management central bank lessonsfrom crisis. but, addition look back, i would like take opportunity map outsome fundamental element part future risk management framework, oncewe return conventional monetary policy environment. of course, arelargely inform action take past decade found theprinciples i described. so clearly position move newsteady state one go, broad feature already see today.navigating gusts, storm crosswindsrisk managers, include central bank risk managers, generally prudent. such prudence isnot necessary preserve market confidence central bank’s independence abilityto comply mandate, also appropriate since entrust public money. in a1 1 / 4bis central bankers' speech crisis, however, central bank’s exposure financial risk – may indeed –increase, still expect fulfil policy mandate. the non-conventional measuresthat implement necessary proportionate achieve mandate; alsocontributed financial stability reduce financial risk euro area. there are, course,limits action central banks, monetary policy cannot address structural fiscalsources financial distress, step rectify national deficiency mandateapplies euro area whole. it important central bank strike right balance inthis regard, financial risk correctly measured, properly understand sufficientlycontained.moreover, european court justice, judgment outright monetary transactions, hasconfirmed need provide sufficient risk management measure “likely reduce therisk loss ecb exposed”.speaking country proud history maritime exploration let recall word ofseneca, younger:when man know harbour make for, wind right wind.the “harbour” central bank mandate. the principle seek adhere the“compass” help fulfil mandate. when central bank face crisis, need toconsider whether monetary policy operation still proportionate. this need stem theobligation primary law (proportionality principle) properly weigh component ofa give measure one another. the aim determine whether expect benefit ofthe measure outweigh costs. a general rule, stable risk management approach athrough-the-cycle approach advisable. however, extraordinary circumstance may requireextensions framework, acceptance additional collateral. if still provesinsufficient, unprecedented type monetary policy measure may call entirely newoperations, accompany new risk management measures.the evolution eurosystem’s monetary policy operation response crisis featuredall activities. our risk management framework evolve accordingly, guide ourstable principles.first, “gusty winds”: early stage financial crisis, increase amountof liquidity provide bank system without tighten risk control framework,despite onset stress system. in respect, risk management frameworkfollowed through-the-cycle approach – thereby avoid distress bank system.it also stand stark contrast pro-cyclical nature commercial bank sector’srisk management approach – thus part central bank’s duty lean suchpotentially self-reinforcing winds.it possible avoid tighten framework without expose eurosystem unduerisks pre-crisis framework calibrate sufficiently prudent manner. infact, framework prove robust enough protect eurosystem loss resultingfrom counterparties defaulting, lehman brother icelandic bank – although thecomplexity collateral case lead lengthy liquidation processes. thisexperience certainly merit careful review collateral rule complex security andfinancial innovations. more broadly, justify take step towards reduce reliance onexternal credit ratings, line g20 agenda.second, “storm break out”: default lehman brothers, become evident suchstandard measure long sufficient achieve price stability euro area. wetherefore provide enhance credit support and, late on, non-standard credit operation thelight increase liquidity demand bank system. to avoid potential collateralshortages satisfy increase demand, expand range asset 2 / 4bis central bankers' speech bank draw liquidity eurosystem. but time, follow theprinciple risk equivalence asset accept pre-crisis rules.let give concrete example: since 2012, several national central bank euro area,including one host conference, accept additional bank loan collateral. toensure risk equivalence, haircut asset high use regularoperations.this bring third phase crisis, “crosswinds”: recent year continueddecline inflation rate euro area call additional non-standard measure – i amreferring, course, asset purchase programmes. this type liquidity provision anovelty eurosystem, although instrument outright purchase envisagedas one legal operational tool eurosystem since inception. accordingly,additional risk control framework need develop keep financial risk checkgiven significant rise exposures.our asset purchase program, especially pspp, large component, case point:the eurosystem apply strict eligibility requirements. purchase subject issuer issuelimits. we closely monitor risk programme place possible deviation fromthe benchmarks, e.g. cbpp3. our due diligence can, strict conditions, lead topurchases cover bond credit rat agency rate regular eligibility threshold.on hand, due diligence also lead additional risk control measure forparticularly risky cover bonds.given suffer impairment since start expand asset purchaseprogrammes, i feel justify say financial risk successfully contain sofar.maintaining risk management principle return conventionalmonetary policyit clear that, see sufficiently sustain adjustment path inflation, wewill continue prudently adjust tool-box monetary policy instruments, beendoing since december last year. this also moment carefully reviewhow operational risk management framework deviate pre-crisis state.where necessary, temporary measure roll back. but also considerwhether area take new risk onto balance sheet – andconsequently certain element kept.the development i describe offer insight future steady state riskmanagement framework might look. at moment, i see four key features:first, temporary collateral framework successfully ease potential collateralshortages, could argue become part regular framework. a liquiditydemand declines, also le need expand set eligible collateral. whethersome temporary measure might transform state-contingent framework, ready beactivated future circumstance require, open question. a experienceshows, crisis need tailor response.second, need keep flexibility adjust collateral framework financialinnovations, especially come complex new financial products. the new “simple,transparent standardised” securitisation regulation case point. it allow u betterassess collateral accept. in similar way, need forcefully deal new type ofsecurities, conditional pass-through cover bonds, whose risk may yet beenfully appreciated. 3 / 4bis central bankers' speech third, retain risk control framework asset purchase programmesbeyond horizon net asset purchases. a long keep outright portfolio ourbalance sheet, reason behind risk control measures, include eligibility criteria,purchase limits, benchmark ensure diversification different risk-sharing agreements,will continue apply.fourth, govern council decide whether ought rely ownjudgement quality asset counterparties expand eurosystem-internal credit assessment systems, step would require additional resources. it meansfurther enhance due diligence external credit ratings, sufficient transparencyon judgement underlie rat essential. and mean use supervisoryinformation ensure efficient implementation monetary policy operation – introductionof european single supervisory mechanism bring fundamental improvementshere, allow share relevant information within legal limit

june 2017 fritz zurbrügg introductory remark fritz zurbrügg in remark today, i present key find year’s financial stability report, publish swiss national bank morning. in first part speech, i look situation big banks, focus progress make implement revise ‘too big fail’ regulation (tbtf2) come effect almost year ago. in second part remarks, i outline current assessment situation domestically focus banks. big bank let start big bank tbtf2 regulations. the revise regulation design resolve ‘too big fail’ issue switzerland, systemically important bank long bail taxpayers’ money event crisis. the tbtf2 regulation rest two complementary pillars. first, aim strengthen resilience systemically important bank going-concern perspective. they therefore specify high requirement going-concern capital particular, thereby reduce likelihood systemically important bank get financial distress. second, systemically important bank nevertheless get financial distress – call gone-concern perspective – regulation provide framework orderly resolution, ensure continuation systemically important function without use public funds. to end, regulation stipulate requirement loss-absorbing capacity gone-concern perspective resolution planning. what progress two big bank make implement tbtf2 regulations? regard first pillar, resilience, big bank improve loss-absorbing capacity going-concern perspective since last financial stability report. with improvement, credit suisse ubs track meet final capital berne, 15 june 2017 fritz zurbrügg news conference page 2/3 requirements.1 in going-concern risk-weighted perspective, bank already fully compliant. however, improvement necessary respect leverage ratio. the snb acknowledge progress make improve capital situation. achieve full compliance tbtf2 regulation strengthen loss-absorbing capacity. this necessary big banks’ loss potential relative capitalisation continue substantial, measure basis stress test carry snb well loss experience last financial crisis. give big banks’ significance swiss economy, important remain adequately capitalise event loss occurring. this bring second pillar tbtf2 regulation – resolution. here, too, big bank make progress. on one hand, since june 2016, credit suisse ubs significantly improve gone-concern loss-absorbing capacity. to end, issue bail-in bonds, convert equity event impend insolvency. on hand, two big bank implement key organisational measures. for instance, set swiss subsidiary contain systemically important functions, including, particular, domestic deposit lend business. in order resolve ‘too big fail’ issue switzerland, progress also need make area resolution. this involve, first, improvement gone-concern loss-absorbing capacity gone-concern perspective, stipulate regulation and, second, progress draw robust resolution plans. by end-2019, big bank need demonstrate would able maintain systemically important function switzerland without interruption event impend insolvency. the resolution plan also need meet foreign regulatory requirements. domestically focus commercial bank i turn domestically focus commercial banks, whose main business lend deposit-taking. i would like highlight three key development banks. first, domestically focus bank increase risk exposure 2016. mortgage growth bank remain strong. moreover, interest rate risk exposure maturity transformation continue high levels. in addition, take great affordability risk share new mortgage high loan-to-income ratio reach new peak. all take place background high imbalance swiss mortgage real estate markets. although imbalance decline slightly 2016, still level similar 2014, sectoral countercyclical capital buff (ccyb) set 2%. 1 final requirement refer requirement apply expiry transitional provisions, particular qualitative requirement going-concern capital. berne, 15 june 2017 fritz zurbrügg news conference page 3/3 second, average interest rate margin domestically focus bank decrease 2016, stabilise low level previous year. this renew reduction interest margin highlight considerable pressure bank continue face core business, environment exceptionally low interest rates. at time, however, banks’ net interest income report profit increased. this mainly growth mortgage volume offset reduction interest rate margin. third, resilience domestically focus bank remain adequate. in term risk-weighted asset leverage ratios, well capitalise historical standards, capital surplus currently exceed regulatory minimum requirements. snb stress test indicate surplus bank large enough absorb loss adverse scenarios. that snb’s evaluation current situation domestically focus commercial banks; assessment outlook? here, predominant feature margin pressure i mentioned. the pressure interest rate margin remain strong long interest rate remain exceptionally low. thus, strong incentive bank take risk. in short term, increase affordability risk interest rate risk may help prevent decline profitability. however, would make bank vulnerable large upward interest rate shock correction mortgage real estate markets. great risk-taking lend could also lead renew increase momentum mortgage real estate markets. this apply particularly residential investment property, upward pressure price could remain strong. if interest rate rise, risk substantial price correction. this could result credit loss bank provide fund investors. this highlight importance capital surplus currently hold domestically focus banks. go forward, bank set risk appetite capital plan ensure absorb loss would arise highly unfavourable possible scenarios. even scenarios, bank must able perform economically important function – especially provide credit economy. the snb continue monitor development mortgage real estate market closely, pay particular attention residential investment property segment well banks’ risk-taking mortgage lending. in parallel, continue regularly reassess need adjustment ccyb. japan's economy monetary policy speech meet business leader osaka bank japan september 25, 2017 haruhiko kuroda governor bank japan (english translation base japanese original) 1 introduction it great pleasure opportunity today exchange view distinguish gather business leader kansai region. i would like take opportunity express sincere gratitude cooperation various activity bank japan's branch osaka, kobe, kyoto. in speech today, i would like first explain bank's view recent development economic activity prices, talk think behind conduct monetary policy. i. economic development let start talk development japan's economy. the economy expand moderately, real gdp growth rate april-june quarter register firm increase 2.5 percent annualized basis. it first time eleven years, since 2006, continue mark positive growth six consecutive quarter (chart 1). look ahead, economy likely continue moderate expansion. some recent characteristic economic expansion follows. the first feature economic growth lead external domestic demand well-balanced manner. look overseas economies, business sentiment manufacture sector improve trend advance emerge economies, world trade volume recovering. under circumstances, japan's export increase trend, automobile-related capital good (chart 2). regard domestic demand, business fix investment moderate increase trend corporate profit record high levels. private consumption increase resilience recently background steady improvement employment income situation. furthermore, effect government's large-scale stimulus measure formulate last year emerge lately, public investment increase (chart 3). the economy expanding, basis single factor, rather support multiple factor -- namely, external demand, domestic private demand, domestic public demand -- 2 well-balanced manner. for reason, economic expansion expect sustain go forward. the second feature recent economic expansion effect spread wide range economic entities. the difference degree improvement diffusion index (di) business condition either firm size region large recovery phase mid-2000s global financial crisis (chart 4). the di kinki region national average 2015 toward 2016, improve rapidly since second half 2016, reflect remarkable recovery overseas economies. look employment income situation, current economic expansion benefit wide range households. the year-on-year rate increase hourly wage part-time employees, particularly sensitive tighten labor market, register 2.5 percent. this high full-time employees, imply difference wage level part-time full-time employee become smaller. there many case work part-timer want become employ full-timers able so. moreover, active job openings-to-applicants ratio full-time employee exceed 1 june first time since statistic start compile 2004 (chart 5). a described, economic expansion benefit full-time part-time employees. in labor market whole, unemployment rate decline around 3 percent, equivalent virtually full employment, active job openings-to-applicants ratio stand 1.52, exceed high figure bubble period reach level last see far back 1974 (chart 6). trigger part tighten labor market conditions, become another feature japan's economy late wide range firm industry take measure raise labor productivity. since wage increase result labor shortage mean rise labor cost firms, many firm make various effort avoid pass rise labor cost directly customers. a typical example labor-saving efficiency-improving investment use information technology. in fact, labor-intensive sector retail well accommodations, eat drink services, software investment increase remarkable degree recently (chart 7). 3 furthermore, firm streamline business processes. for instance, supermarket chain restaurant discontinue service late night early morning, time number customer relatively small, instead allocate limit employee daytime services. even reduce labor input due short business hours, sale decrease much, thereby lift firms' labor productivity. of measures, increase labor-saving efficiency-improving investment certainly contribute recent growth business fix investment. in addition, longer-term perspective, firms' various effort expect play important role raise japan's growth potential. in japan, essential raise labor productivity compensate decline labor force. although easy, firms' increase effort various kind amid widespread labor shortage late become drive force toward raise productivity, long-standing challenge japan's economy. ii. price development now i move price developments. the year-on-year rate change consumer price index (cpi) exclude fresh food increase around 0.5 percent recently, also exclude effect rise energy price relatively weak, remain around 0 percent (chart 8). look ahead, bank japan project rate change cpi likely continue uptrend increase toward 2 percent. in follows, let describe process operate, especially firms' standpoint. what lie behind fact inflation relatively weak despite increase labor cost firms' effort absorb cost i mention earlier. specifically, many japanese firm raise wage employee keep price product service unchanged, labor-saving investment streamline business processes, example. it often point one reason firm raise sale price kind caution that, raise price competitor not, may lose customer competitiveness market. give competitor thought, perhaps compete firm wait see others none make first move. this strategy would reasonable firm face stiff 4 competition. at time, however, also make unlikely firm raise sale price pass increase cost price necessary. what happen go forward? give firm already work streamline business process many ways, gradually become difficult continue absorb increase wage cost measures. in addition continue effort streamline business processes, firm need reflect sale price increase cost cannot absorb. lately, also seem become likely competitor follow suit firm move toward increase prices. this highly likely that, face tight labor market, every firm feel reach limit absorb increase labor costs. on consumer side, perception price rise seem change gradually, employment income situation improve due good labor market conditions. after one major transportation company announce spring plan raise price delivery services, competitor follow suit. accord news report, slightly 30 percent firm restaurant business plan raise price menu within fiscal year, mainly due increase labor costs. these development appear show possibility firms' price-setting stance change response tighten labor market improvement economy. these kind change firms' price-setting stance yet become widespread entire economy. however, firms' consumers' stance pass cost change economy continue expand moderately, firms' attempt raise sale price likely gradually become widespread across broad range industries. furthermore, process lift actual prices, firms' households' medium- long-term inflation expectations, people's perception future inflation, increase. the bank japan project that, mechanisms, inflation rate likely increase gradually toward price stability target 2 percent. iii. the bank's conduct monetary policy next, i elaborate bank's think behind conduct monetary policy. a stipulate bank japan act, objective bank's monetary policy 5 "achieving price stability, thereby contribute sound development national economy." the specific number represent "price stability" "2 percent" term year-on-year rate change cpi. for reason need 2 percent, i explain three point sequence: bias price statistics, secure policy room future, global standard. let start bias price statistics. although i go detail since might bite technical, inflation rate base cpi bank refer tend high actual inflation. give this, aim zero inflation term cpi mean aim negative inflation, effect. therefore, order ensure price stability, inflation rate sufficiently positive. the next point regard secure policy room future. the level nominal interest rate usually determine accordance inflation rates. look interest rate level around 2007, right global financial crisis, whereas policy interest rate unite state europe around 4 5 percent inflation around 2 percent, policy interest rate japan, uncollateralized overnight call rate, 0.5 percent almost zero inflation (chart 9). in response global financial crisis, exert significantly negative impact global economy, unite state europe counteract shock monetary ease push policy interest rate 4 5 percentage point around 0 percent. on occasion, although japan also reduce policy interest rate around 0 percent, unite state europe did, able exert limit monetary ease effect 0.5 percentage point. a remember, real gdp japan drop significantly europe unite states, epicenter crisis. this imply possibility fact japan le room policy response low interest rate become contribute factor severe downturn economy. with level nominal interest rate high, japan's economy policy room mitigate impact future economic downturns, equip sort insurance sustain economic growth. 6 so far, i mention bias price statistic secure policy room future, alone give good enough reason target level inflation 2 percent. there proposal advocate overseas target level inflation 3 4 percent order increase policy room, although proposal seem realistic. so, 2 percent consider appropriate? to answer question, third reason, global standard, key. central bank major economy currently conduct monetary policy aim achieve around 2 percent inflation. give this, bank japan's monetary policy conduct aim achieve 2 percent inflation also likely contribute stable foreign exchange rate long run. foreign exchange rate fluctuate due various factor short run, consider reflect inflation differential home abroad long run. from long-run perspective, inflation rate home remain stable around level major economies, stability foreign exchange rate consequently ensured. for precede three reasons, bank set price stability target 2 percent term year-on-year rate change cpi. however, may feel uncomfortable aim positive inflation rate 2 percent. for example, bank's opinion survey general public's view behavior, questionnaire survey individuals, 80 percent respondent answer price rise rather unfavorable. i would like emphasize bank aim conduct monetary policy simply increase inflation. it aim achieve economy virtuous cycle income people increase firmly price stability target 2 percent term year-on-year rate change cpi achieved. the historical data show consumer price wage generally move parallel. in japan 1980s unite states, positive inflation, nominal wage generally increase high pace cpi (chart 10). give development actual price factor annual spring labor-management wage negotiations, parallel relationship inflation wage growth easy understand. in economic environment, nominal interest rate usually increase well. since interest rate rate 7 return investment economic activity within economy whole, expect converge level consistent nominal growth rate country medium long run. in economy economic expansion steady positive inflation, nominal wage nominal interest rate increase, mean income wage salary earners, live deposits, increase. i would like underscore fact bank, achieve price stability target 2 percent, aim realize well-balanced economy people's income increase accordingly. conclusion lastly, i would like conclude speech briefly explain bank's recent conduct monetary policy. the bank implement powerful monetary ease "quantitative qualitative monetary ease (qqe) yield curve control," aim achieve price stability target 2 percent. this policy framework introduce exactly year ago, meet last year, i talk new policy, introduced. "qqe yield curve control" consist two components. the first inflation-overshooting commitment, bank commit expand monetary base year-on-year rate increase actual cpi exceed 2 percent stay level stable manner. the second component yield curve control, bank control short- long-term interest rate guideline market operation decide every monetary policy meeting. look back one year since introduction, japan's long-term interest rate stable around zero percent, target level, bank lend rate well issuance rate corporate bond extremely low levels. moreover, financial institutions' lend attitude perceive firm remain positive large small firms, year-on-year rate increase amount outstanding bank lend 8 range 3.0-3.5 percent recently. such highly accommodative financial conditions, well proactive initiative financial institutions, firmly support corporate activity japan. although still long way go achieve price stability target 2 percent, bank continue persistently pursue powerful monetary ease view achieve target early possible time. thank you. september 25, 2017haruhiko kurodagovernor bank japanjapan's economy monetary policyspeech meet business leader

developmentremarks mr william c dudley, president chief executive officer federal reservebank new york, onondaga community college, syracuse, new york, 25 september2017.* * *good morning. it pleasure syracuse, i want thank onondagacommunity college host us. this fourth visit central new york president thenew york fed, i always look forward come back part regular visit differentparts district. these trip meet stakeholder region give mycolleagues important insight what’s happen economy.today, i briefly discus outlook u.s. economy see theregional level, offer reflection challenge importance workforcedevelopment region across nation. a always, i say reflect ownviews necessarily federal open market committee (fomc) federalreserve system.two year ago, i speak nearby rochester topic workforce development. since then,the need effective workforce development become le pressing, newyork feed federal reserve system focus great effort critical issue.this morning, i return theme speech look lesson havelearned.the u.s. economic outlookalthough damage work hurricane harvey, irma, maria imposedimmeasurable hardship many undoubtedly disrupt commerce time, theseeffects likely relatively short-lived context overall economic outlook. naturaldisasters tend depress economic activity initially, recovery reconstructionefforts get underway earnest, disaster actually serve lift economic activity.looking beyond storm effects—which make interpret near-term economic datareleases difficult—the u.s. economy remain trajectory slightly above-trend growth,which gradually tighten u.s. labor market. over time, support rise wagegrowth. the fundamental support continue expansion generally quite favorable. lowunemployment, sturdy job gains, rise wages—even pace previous expansions—are lift personal income. household wealth boost rise home equityprices, household debt grow relatively slowly, contribute healthyhousehold balance sheet. thus, consumer spend continue advance comingquarters.business fix investment outlay also likely continue rise. with supply labortightening, great incentive business invest labor-saving technologies.investment spend also benefit good international outlook improvement inu.s. trade competitiveness cause dollar’s recent weakness. the soft dollar solidgrowth abroad also suggest trade sector long significant drag economicgrowth.12 1 / 5bis central bankers' speech with firm import price trend fade effect number temporary,idiosyncratic factors, i expect inflation rise stabilize around fomc’s 2 percentobjective medium term. in response, federal reserve likely continue removemonetary policy accommodation gradually.the regional economywhile national economy grow steadily since end great recession, theeconomies upstate new york lag behind, job growth run halfthe national pace much expansion. and, past year, job growth upstatenew york slow considerably, particularly rochester buffalo.here syracuse, job growth also disappoint expansion, aneven slow pace growth many upstate areas. in fact, today, almost 10 year afterthe great recession, syracuse still fully recover job lost—abenchmark upstate new york pass time ago.however, slow growth imply region stand still. indeed, lot ofactivity go beneath surface. the syracuse economy labor force evolve andbecoming good position future. but, need do help worker adapt tochange, theme i return moment.as case much country, syracuse experience dramatic decrease inmanufacturing jobs, reflect dual force technological change globalization. thesewere well-paying job support vibrant middle class. now, i firm believer theoverall positive effect open trade unite states, i also recognize itsbenefits cost distribute unevenly, positive negative consequence begeographically concentrated. on whole, do enough recognize vastconsequences change help hurt technological change andglobalization.the syracuse economy change considerably 25 year ago, manufacture wasthe dominant source job income. the number manufacture worker cut inhalf since then, reduce sector’s share employment 15 percent 8 percent—ashare par nation. this transition painful, result amore diversify stable regional economy.in manufacturing’s place, healthcare education sector pick slack, andhave stabilize force syracuse economy. offset 20,000 manufacturingjobs lose past 25 year around 25,000 job add education andhealthcare. those two sector employ almost 20 percent worker region. othersectors, like business service leisure hospitality, also create new jobopportunities differ one region previously rely on.in addition, job create innovative hot spot region. for example, start-upcompanies rise syracuse tech garden, well new global center unmannedaerial systems, provide excite new opportunities. while particular effort stillrelatively small scale, potential change trajectory regional economyover time. however, syracuse need worker deep skill set fill jobs.to end, difficult worker adapt changes, may need help toget there. take broad view, good job create today’s economy require moreeducation, training, and, ultimately, skill ever before. the skill requirement virtually alljobs increasing, worker need rise occasion thrive today’s economy.the challenge face u best help worker develop skill necessary land a3 2 / 5bis central bankers' speech good job, enhance skill time work requirement evolve. worker withyears experience job long demand especially hard, skillsmay sufficient match current opportunities—an all-too-familiar story worker thesyracuse area.workforce developmentworkforce development must, therefore, top priority everyone involved: workers,employers, communities, government, educational train institutions. there silverbullet one-size-fits-all solution. this complex challenge require combination ofstrategies. but one thing clear: require holistic approach encompass “three p’s” idescribed two year ago—partnerships, programs, placement—and some. beforedelving deep these, let first explain we, nation’s central bank, care aboutworkforce development.as many know, federal reserve task congress dual mandate:maximum employment context price stability. clearly, cannot declare success wehave people want work lack skill fill available jobs. a skilled workforce ismatched need employer necessary economy grow prosper, forindividuals reach potential. monetary policy help labor market recover providingincentives firm invest grow. however, monetary policy cannot solve skillmismatches gap exist economy.so, do? the federal reserve provide research analysis, leverage itsconvening ability bring together diverse stakeholder good understand issue andidentify practice work. for example, run lead way video campaign p-tech school employer partnerships. this competition challenge team high schoolstudents rochester area create public service announcement detail skill requiredto work industry currently hiring. we also participate new york city datascience task force increase number diversity student metropolitan areaprepared enter graduate school workforce data science skills. and, finalizingthe result survey community college across new york state look theirengagement employer purpose workforce development. i talk bite moreabout survey’s preliminary result shortly.in addition, work federal reserve board governor fellow regionalreserve bank broad initiative promote investment workforce development andencourage partnerships, include next month’s invest america’s workforce conference inaustin, texas. the conference joint effort federal reserve system severalleading institution field intend connect businesses, government agencies, non-profits, academics, philanthropic organizations. the goal reframe workforcedevelopment investment, attract new resources, leverage exist one improveeconomic mobility job opportunity potential workers.the three p’s workforce developmentthe core workforce development effort need help worker build skillsnecessary adapt change, meet challenge evolve economy, find good-paying jobs. we hear business owner across district, advisorycouncils, survey several year skill gap face, area asdiverse engineering, long-haul trucking, welding, metalworking. what incommon require specific skill training, whether certification program,a two- four-year degree, formal apprenticeship—an approach verysuccessful country germany uk, widely use here.45 3 / 5bis central bankers' speech this partnership concept come play. partnership entail cooperative effortsbetween local employer educational institution determine best strategy helpworkers develop skill employer need. the good news new york state seem beahead curve area.as i mentioned, process complete survey community college new yorkstate. the early result encouraging: find community college stateoffer workforce development programming, partnership employer norm.in fact, median number employer-partners among community college 100, andthere partnership every industry, healthcare utility agriculture. suchpartnerships grow importance fill need local worker employers. thisgoes second p: programs. community college new york become adept atcreating program tailor current skill require local employers.locally, i’d like highlight onondaga community college’s partnership madison countymanufacturers, train worker apprentice career train program. thisprogram provide pay train student lead four-year apprenticeship inparticipating business advance manufacturing, develop skill necessary forjobs high demand, include maintenance mechanics, tool makers, machineoperators.i would also like call attention work train’s job train industry collaboration, wellas work onondaga citizen league quantify type job centralnew york, job opportunity likely exist future, critical workforce-relatedquestions. i anticipate citizen league’s report central new york work willserve important resource shape workforce development program area.however, train skill-building foundational, enough. placement intogood jobs—my third p—is critical component effective workforce development, especiallyfor currently unemployed. recent work federal reserve economist highlight ofthe hurdle job placement need overcome. this research leverage newyork fed’s survey consumer expectation examine people find work. the differencebetween look work employ versus unemployed stark.relative unemployed, employ worker spend le time search job threetimes high contact rate two time many job offers. furthermore, worker hire fromanother job good unemployed, receive 28 percent high wage andtwice level benefits. while always know difficult recent high schoolor college graduate find first job, seem currently unemployed face evengreater hurdle, issue need address.another find work importance network reference seekingemployment. referral account 40 percent total job offers, 60 percent jobapplications result job board searches, account 24 percent offers.this suggest workforce development provider need build relationship trust withemployers way help job-seekers find available opportunity successfully applyfor them.having cover three p’s, i’d like focus briefly “and some,” refer toaddressing number social structural factor work even best workforcedevelopment efforts.in travel throughout region interaction workers, business leaders,workforce development practitioners, others, i regularly hear access transportationand childcare prevent able will worker actually working. people’s inability toget job relatively far live—either can’t afford car no678 4 / 5bis central bankers' speech viable reliable public transportation. this challenge see sparselypopulated areas, like north country, cities, job may available thesurrounding suburb exurbs easy public access. with regard childcare, cost andaccess hear hind people’s ability fill jobs. and, even whocan afford childcare, irregular schedule employer make difficult plan effectively.additional adverse factor include decline geographic mobility—that is, people’s ability orwillingness relocate job are—and opioid epidemic, chair yellenrecently speak significant negative impact workforce.while i expert subjects, i say inefficiency impedimentscreate keep u realize full potential individually country, thataddressing part comprehensive workforce development solution essential.i would like conclude say syracuse, well upstate new york generally,has deal head-on consequence economic change long time. perhapsbecause this, region develop deep understand importance help itspeople adapt workforce development programs. the issue workforce development isa complex one require holistic approach close collaboration among interestedparties. the good news many great organization area try differentapproaches discover work best. our region many way lead way, atthe new york feed continue support

andreas dombret, member executive board deutsche bundesbank,at strategy conference rhineland save bank giro association, bonn, 29august 2017.* * *1. introductionladies gentlemensome may perhaps recall i guest rhineland save bank andgiro association’s strategy conference – two year ago, precise. on thatparticular occasion, i share view variety topic include precarious situation ingreece slump china’s equity market. fast forward present day, areother, entirely new challenge look at: digitalisation, regulatory matters, interestrate levels.we today discus strategy use counter current challenges. iwould like make practical contribution today’s proceed talk challengeof regulation. my speech focus particularly small bank save bank aregional footprint show regulatory landscape might evolve them.2. regulation – challengelet begin ask this: you, personally, associate regulation andsupervision? i trust think competent analyst bundesbank.but many you, i would imagine, think also turn paperwork, constraints,costs. and let tell you: wouldn’t wrong. regulation supervision indeed achallenge – create constraints, run costs.yet le true regulation necessary, useful. the paperwork, constraints,the cost – good reason things.after all, service provide bank save bank crucial stable economiccycle, growth prosperity. bank save bank fund investments, managesavings deliver important services, process payments.but take risk also part bank business. and take risks, there’s chanceyou might fail. but financial institution fails, implication far-reaching – i don’tjust mean institution itself, also investors, real economy, u all.the financial crisis, mark tenth anniversary next weeks, teach u thefailure single institution enough trigger chain reaction throughout entire sector.smart regulation ensure bank save bank still go business, thatthey appropriately protect big risks. it shield economy, consumersand financial system turbulence. the reason can’t give financial institutionsfull rein important part play economic cycle.that’s point often go unnoticed debate surround regulation. please don’t get mewrong: regulation supervision sacrosanct; criticism certainly bounds. inthe day i supervised, i voice criticism i felt right so.but criticism, whatever form may take, need constructive honest shouldn’t beunduly sweeping. regrettably, cannot say utterance public debate 1 / 13bis central bankers' speech topic.3. regulatory proportionality lackingregulation supervision crucial, it’s right something burden.but also clear needlessly heavy demand avoided. regulation need costa much necessary also little possible.and i fear mark we’ve fall short respect lately. because regulationhas grow ever complex time. the year since onset financial crisis, inparticular, see basel committee adopt wide-reaching global reforms. the idea behindthese initiative learn right lesson financial crisis good equippedgoing forward fend disruption magnitude. the increase complexity regulations,then, merely reflection mount complexity global bank business. so couldsay warrant – sector’s global player mostly certainly position get togrips new rules.but actual fact, bulk complex rules, especially europe, apply majormultinational institution every single bank save bank well. and that’s quite aproblem. because small medium-sized institution comply rules, notbenefit economy scale large rival harness. for one thing,small institution face much heavy costs, relatively speaking, invest itinfrastructure hire additional employee compliance department. that’s downsidethey partly offset cooperate institution network. a such, thesingle rule book run counter idea level play field create problematicincentives term uniformity size bank sector.regulation today already take account proportionality degree. tiered standard exist inareas reporting, large institution require meet frequent andcomprehensive report standards, supervisor largely exercise proportionality whenapplying minimum requirement risk management. proportionality also embedded, inprinciple, eba guideline supervisory review evaluation process. but practicei repeatedly encounter situation exist gradation inadequate eyes. theproportionality principle nothing new, then, still anchor deeply enough.4. the road great proportionality: chronologythat’s take action explore way principle proportionality could beembedded deeply within regulatory supervisory frameworks. let start byrunning briefly though event past one-and-a-half years. 2 / 13bis central bankers' speech german finance minister wolfgang schäuble uk counterpart george osbornemoved ongoing debate forward substantially april last year noting, joint paper, theincreasing complexity bank regulation point excessive burden smallinstitutions run straightforward business models. it topic bundesbank also feelvery strongly about. hence decision go public first set specific proposal littlewhile later.that november saw european commission likewise table proposal forstrengthening proportionality part general overhaul eu bank regulation, isstill ongoing process. these proposal would make major change small print, iam certain able roll number meaningful initial improvements.that said, proposal don’t go far enough – think ahead. theestablishment german specialist work group follow draft abundesbank paper set concrete measure well several consultation thegerman central associations. the outcome process german “non-paper” – is, adiscussion paper – federal ministry finance put competent expert groupof european commission june year. 3 / 13bis central bankers' speech 5. which way? when work common german proposal, essentially two path couldtake move towards great proportionality. should look specific adjustments, shouldwe go straight create separate regulatory framework small institutions?the first path clear practical advantage: would quick relatively simple toimplement, especially since european legislation bank regulation currently revisedanyway. it disadvantages, however: realistically speaking, small institution willnot gain substantial relief burden account specific improvement toregulation. there also risk end patchwork exception difficult tointerpret.the second path would radical. the creation separate regulatory framework forsmall institution – also know “small bank box” – would mean fundamental relieffor institutions. a clear consistent definition would also prevent difficulty ininterpretation. though implementation maintenance would somewhat morecomplicated, future regulation small large bank would develop paralleland alignment other. depend threshold value small bankingbox set, also risk cliff effects. 4 / 13bis central bankers' speech we carefully weigh many argument specialist work groupon proportionality. the group’s purpose facilitate exchange view betweenpoliticians, supervisor bank industry. the federal ministry finance, bafin, thebundesbank five central association german bank industry allrepresented group.these member agree would expedient bolster proportionality regulation. the aimof work group therefore work specific proposal alleviate burdenof regulation small institution simple business models. and deliver aim: thenon-paper i mention earlier, write group’s help, brussels,where use basis discussion european level. 5 / 13bis central bankers' speech 5.1 the question “who?": three-tier approachso german proposal look like? first, let address “who?", namely arethe relief measure intend for. the proposal take three-tier approach regard.at top systemically important potentially systemically risky institution – thesmallest group term number extremely important term risk. because this, isalso intensely regulated. generally speaking, group include institution totalassets €20 billion. nothing change institutions: basel iiirequirements still apply, additional capital buffer, total loss absorb capacity,and on.a second group would include institution large systemically important, butwhich also small low-risk, possible make extensivesimplifications them. nonetheless, proposal include middle group sometargeted relief measure could achieve make specific amendment currentregulations.finally, third group make small non-complex institution – bank aremost affect fix cost regulation without systemic importance consideredindividually. this group – large numerical term – cost burden alleviatedradically mean separate regulation: small bank box.the burn question now, course, institution belong group – andparticularly, bank could include small bank box. i say right i amnot able conclusively answer important question today. these classification bebalanced carefully, part european-level discussions. 6 / 13bis central bankers' speech i would, however, like give initial idea classification might look. by talk ofsmall institutions, suggest qualification criterion small bank box would berelatively modest total assets. for example, germany, total asset threshold value €3billion could put 80% institution category.what constitute large small member state completely different, however. toaccount heterogeneity, absolute size would supplement relative size. 7 / 13bis central bankers' speech this could ratio bank’s total asset home country’s economic power thesize domestic bank sector, though case, too, size isn’t everything. i’ve alreadysaid institution small bank box relatively small, alsomust complex. this need additional criteria.first, institution believe would subject insolvency proceed theevent resolution may part box.second, candidate small bank box must engage notable capital marketor cross-border business.third, have, most, small trade book small derivative book.fourth, instead internal models, may use standardise approach.this list requirement prevent institution risky business model part thesimplified regime.experience teach us, however, almost never perfect list criterion thatcovers every eventuality. this final decision always rest supervisors.should serious misgivings, opt subject institution simplifiedrules. they also take account systemic risk arise connectedness ofseveral small institution – say, small bank “too many fail".incidentally, possibility choose one-way street. i believe institutionsthat would consider eligible small bank box also nevertheless give theoption supervise pursuant complex rules.but come back figures: apply threshold value €3 billion, around1,300 bank save bank germany could fall simplify rules, 80%of institutions, mention earlier. this would equivalent 14% german bankingsector’s total assets. of course, initial calculation doesn’t include theadditional criterion i listed.if look bank save bank north rhine-westphalia alone, picture largely 8 / 13bis central bankers' speech same: here, too, around 80% institution could come simplify rules. thiswould equivalent 24% total asset state.some doubt wonder happen institution close thethreshold value. this good question, alone around 50 german save bank havetotal asset €2.5 3.5 billion, rhineland – perhaps ofyou even run one institutions.the question potential cliff effect always come quantitative threshold set.nonetheless, regulator cannot without thresholds. i believe two thing important toprevent institution move category or, bad still, base businessstrategy attempt stay within certain threshold. first, quantitative threshold must beflanked qualitative criterion supervisor must also take decision case-by-case basis.in words, bank’s total asset fall specify threshold, isnowhere near enough include small bank box. second, discussingintroducing transitional arrangement help make easy switch regime –something want option.ladies gentlemen, sensible workable definition institution whose burden could berelieved perfectly feasible. and may appear way first glance, create smallbanking box necessarily require whole new set rules. all need shortsection crr dedicate issue. 9 / 13bis central bankers' speech 5.2 the question “what?": reduce paperworkthat leaf second key question: exactly might box look like? let u start theheart problem, namely, paperwork complex requirement create variousareas.some requirement could completely eliminate institution small bankingbox. i could, instance, imagine largely exempt small bank disclosure requirementsand abolish remuneration rule them. in addition, could absolve recoveryand resolution planning.full exemption requirement would step far. but prevent usfrom try make thing easy small banks. for example, report could reduce acore report process – standardise report approach, like. a simplify form thenet stable fund ratio (nsfr ) also debate.when design small bank box must weigh benefit supervisors, ieensuring financial stability, burden create banks. a rule thumb, cansay rule dispensable effective supervision negotiation. 10 / 13bis central bankers' speech 6. limit small bank boxconversely, however, also mean lot rule debate. and bringsme limit small bank box. i beat bush: noconcessions term risk-based capital ratios, leverage ratio short-term liquidityratio. and list go on. small banks’ business model neither per se simple norautomatically low-risk – particularly true look whole. the newregime must therefore simple yet robust. whatever happens, financial stability must beguaranteed.and, course, also want avoid unintended consequences. simplification one areamust create additional work another area. that also mean sensible division oflabour cooperation within bank association make needlessly complicated.however, i overly concern issue either. a i say earlier, principle ofproportionality new already well-established risk-oriented supervisory practice.so far, bank association manage well organisational terms. and i would like toremind purpose joint proposal avoid unnecessarily high amount ofpaperwork. 11 / 13bis central bankers' speech 7. what happen next?the objective reduce regulatory burden small medium-sized institution isattracting supporters. speak jackson hole weekend, chair theunited state federal reserve janet yellen speak favour reduce burden smallerinstitutions.achieving goal stroll park, however. in draw concept smallbanking box, take first important steps. the aim gain european majorityfor idea.for reminder difficult could be, bear mind different europeancountries bank sector are. a lot european neighbour relativelysmall number banks, virtually medium-sized large. others lot smallbanks, experience serious problem recent past. and othercountries, bank system currently undergo far-reaching transformation process,which mean structure bank system experience sweep change.the question encounter always same: agree small bank box?that situation within europe, must provide information, explain thesituation convince people.for succeed, must present unite german front. if germany manage toall stand behind small bank box concept, hard job convince othereuropean countries.1 12 / 13bis central bankers' speech lady gentlemen, motto strategy conference today tomorrow roughlytranslates

it also give bank canadaoperational independence achieve goal.the regular five-year review, meanwhile, afford bank opportunity revisit manyimportant aspect monetary policy framework

financial crisis make centralbankers pay attention management financial risks. the evaluation, control andmanagement financial risk become central before.central bank financial institutions, risk management totally dissimilar withother financial institution commercial banks. but important differences.for central banks, difference must understand perform properly policy tasks.the position objective central bank different institution operate afor-profit basis. their responsibility different, power capability wider, andtheir accountability requirement broader.these difference matter risk management. today, i would like talk differencesand focus four aspect risk management central banks.1. how central bank's mandate responsibility influence risk management?2. how risk management function organize relation policy andinvestment function within bank?3. how accountability transparency requirement take account inmanaging central bank risks?4. how financial regulation help risk management central banks?i conclude collect lesson learn turbulent, certainlyinstructive year since 2008.i concentrate financial risk balance sheet mostly pas importantrisks, operational cyber risks. the area financial risk specialcharacter responsibility central bank probably matter most, make risk controlproblems even complex nuanced case "ordinary" banks.what be special about central banks?as policy institutions, central bank objective responsibility differ thefinancial institution operate commercial basis. to enable central bank fulfil theirresponsibilities, also special power – especially monopoly issue currency 1 / 7bis central bankers' speech reserve money.we resist temptation use special characteristic central bank excusesfor implement best risk management technique develop elsewhere. the riskmanagement standard technique "ordinary" bank serve obvious startingpoint discuss risks. there differences, justify case.how risk come about? central bank take balance sheet risk result theirinvestment activity (as hold foreign reserves), monetary policy operations, fromtime time provider lender last resort credit counterparts.as investors, central bank traditionally conservative. this mean facedwith trade-off risk return, central bank traditionally tend favour assetswith low credit risk even expect return investment modest.traditionally, central bank also prefer liquid, short-term investments. thesechoices clearly visible way foreign exchange reserve usually invested.as policy makers, central bank influence market condition market price unique way.this task central bank exist today, able conduct monetary policy.the ability, indeed obligation, steer money market order delivermacroeconomic stability add important extra twist risk management problem: thecentral bank price taker financial markets, price maker too. this one ofthe feature make special investor lenders.one may see sort paradox central banks, make policy, seem tocreate control much risk bear investor creditors. however,the central bank actually arbitrary power steer interest rate marketprices. they mandate exercise monetary policy power pursue specific pre-setgoals: policy objective accountable.in eurosystem instance, price stability override objective. therefore, although theactions central bank may impact financial risks, action takenwith requirement monetary (and financial) policy view.so, ability influence market condition may important risk managementproblem central banks, read much this. there wide agreement thatcentral bank use monetary policy power instrument riskmanagement.there also broad agreement information central bank future policiesshould use financial gain. in investment activity securitiespurchases monetary policy purposes, preference best creditworthiness hasbeen traditional risk management technique.in credit operations, situation complicated. when credit grant banks, inmonetary policy operation last resort lending, traditional

collateral requirement need eligibility standard outrightpurchases securities. this compensate ways. haircut routinely use tocompensate suspect risk value collateral.this bring u important difference central bank institutions: role ofcentral bank policy institution matter collateral policy make policy 2 / 7bis central bankers' speech different usual, private lenders.the special nature central banks' collateral policy first note walter bagehot, alreadymore 140 year ago. bagehot concern central bank could best supportfinancial stability. accord famous bagehot's rule, time crisis central bank shouldlend freely good collateral, penalty rate interest. but take "goodcollateral"? it worthwhile cite bagehot (1873) word word:"if know bank england freely advance ordinary time reckoneda good security—on commonly pledge easily convertible—the alarm thesolvent merchant banker stayed. but securities, really good usuallyconvertible, refuse bank, alarm abate, loan make fail inobtaining end, panic become bad worse."the key phrase quote "in ordinary times". bagehot mean collateralrequirements central bank set situation panic (caused runfor liquidity) would prevail.the revolutionary point bagehot make central bank's collateral policy viewquality collateral offer given. the bank take account decisionsabout eligible affect quality collateral. the central bank takethe long view, quality collateral, also confident view, take account itspower stem liquidity crisis.this rule make plain great difficulty central bank's risk management problem, whichalso policy problem, whenever market stress. the quality collateral "in normaltimes" bagehot refer market deem be; necessarily thequality prevail crisis. it something sustainable future.how bagehot's recommend policy different behaviour privateparticipants? when decide lend policy central bank take account theeffects credit decision quality collateral. this bagehot's point. that isnot easy practice.the task central bank ass quality collateral future situation thecrisis abated. there cannot fix rule that. in particular, market notgive firm guidance: central bank always follow market decide collateral isgood, could add much liquidity market could job calm thesituation case market stress panic. on hand, central bank notbelieve make bad collateral good pretend case lend moneyagainst it.bagehot's advice collateral policy, reflect central bank practice time.it has, however, relevance also security purchase open market policy well. itis market stress always right, without guidance least. onelesson outright monetary

markets, way broadly similar way bagehotexplained bill market time could pacified.organizational aspectsturning organizational aspect risk management, find similarity anddifferences central bank financial institutions. 3 / 7bis central bankers' speech start similarities, generally accept principle apply risk controlfunctions risk-taking function separated. a rule, separation reachthe top decision-making level organization. the different business report lines, boththose take risk behalf bank ass control it, present viewsdirectly decision-making level.after financial crisis, unpleasant surprise uncover number ofinvestment retail banks, value follow principle understand even moreclearly before.the top management must responsible ensure oversee strong risk governanceframework, must able carry responsibility. this require systematic approach. itincludes strong risk culture, well-developed explicit policy regard risk take riskmanagement, up-to-date methodology measure financial risks, well-definedresponsibilities risk management control functions.an effective risk control function key component organization. this function isresponsible oversee risk-taking activity across institution. the important thing itshould authority needs. the risk control function independent, sufficientstature, resource direct access board.risk report board require careful design order convey bank-wide, individualportfolio risk concise meaningful manner. report accuratelycommunicate risk exposure result stress test scenario analysis shouldprovoke robust discussion of, example, bank's current prospective exposures(particularly stress scenarios).a balance find independence risk control function, onehand, smooth horizontal information flow other. a emphasize bi principle forrisk

controlfunction.in "ordinary", for-profit institutions, main organizational challenge reconcile businessorientation revenue-generating function caution guard risk controllingfunction. this balance manage high, responsible decision-making level.a broadly similar, wide balance challenge exist also central banks. their problem oforganizing risk control management complex for-profit institutions.while central bank important investment functions, much like banks, alsohave separate monetary policy responsibility functions. the organizational architecturemust therefore accommodate distinct functional line ordinary financial institution– least investment function, monetary policy preparation execution, finally therisk control function.the presence monetary policy preparation execution function addedcomplication risk management characteristic central banks, compare themto banks. monetary policy plan execution hamper hiddenconsiderations risk gain.likewise, necessary monetary policy decision take full awareness theirexpected financial consequence associate risks. only then, adequate riskinformation, responsible decision maker really discharge responsibilities. 4 / 7bis central bankers' speech the idea completely independent risk control function around least 1990's,but take late crisis galvanize central bank take big steps. before crisis atypical solution separate responsibility board level, fullyindependent business line unit risk management control. this changing.in bank, i know best, risk control function reorganize begin of2009. a separate unit establish report line board. this reorganizationhad preparation couple year already crisis, perception ofincreased riskiness environment certainly accelerate implementation change.within ecb, audit committee active promote enhancement riskmanagement ecb eurosystem whole. especially eurosystem level,the cooperation member central bank previously limit slow cope withthe new situation emerge

organization ecb itself, status ofthe risk management function enhanced, too, promote level adirectorate 2012.these change significant, would proper claim development ofthe risk management organization activity eurosystem complete. theassessment especially quantification risk task always incomplete andalways need development. nevertheless, i think significant improvement havebeen achieve governors, govern council board member amuch good overview financial risk bank whole eurosystem before.accountability and transparencythe organizational principle i discuss relate mainly sufficient internal informationflows within institution. however, external information strategically important asinternal management information. therefore, financial institutions, ordinary bank andcentral bank need reconsider time time transparency communication abouttheir risks. there central banks, start report publicly risks.ordinary, for-profit bank need transparency least vis-à-vis customers, creditor andshareholders, well supervisors. all stakeholder interest risksof bank deal with.central bank somewhat different position. for one thing, set stakeholder ofcentral bank broader. in particular, include political decision maker (in governments,parliaments etc.) general public citizens, money-holders, voter taxpayers. inaddition larger, interest political constituency central bank morecomplex many-sided interest stakeholder commercial bank.communication transparency financial risk course one facet centralbank's general communication tasks. another facet policy transparency. actually, twoare closely intertwined: experience show clearly necessary, order maintain publictrust central bank's monetary policy liquidity-supplying operations, clear thereasons consequence policies. otherwise, central bank may even endanger thenecessary public acceptance operations. 5 / 7bis central bankers' speech this important implication: the transparency public report central bank risksshould embed broad economic perspective. this apply contentof risk information per se, probably develop new way present financialrisk central bank economic context, isolate value-at-risk expectedshortfall number (for example). the increase transparency along line beendeveloped make positive contribution, still, seem find new way ofpresenting risk good context could useful.in final analysis, concern risk capital adequacy central banks.this must maintained, margin caution, level independence ofmonetary policy endangered. the central bank must able accumulate sufficientreserves provision safeguard position. a public bodies, also amatter public trust political acceptance, central bank depend.we might note eurosystem ecb somewhat different position thatregard federal reserve, example. because institutional position, federalreserve able operate quite small capital. in europe, contrast, central banksare construction financially separate governments. this mean mustbe quite self-reliant term risk-bearing capacity capital buffers.on financial regulationthe change central bank's risk management occur parallel major reform inbanking regulation, globally especially eu. these reform necessary ongeneral terms, by-product, also facilitate central banks' risk management tasks.first, good regulation improve creditworthiness central banks' monetary policycounterparts thus make risk management easy central banks. direct credit risk besmaller. second, good regulation solid bank also reduce likelihood marketdisturbances cause shortage liquidity, run safe assets. this reduce thecentral bank's burden stabilize financial markets, enable central bank toconcentrate attention good monetary policy tasks.the aspect bank regulation ease burden central bank include good capitaladequacy requirements, strict liquidity norms, general improvement supervision andsupervisory information, include periodic stress tests. these stability-enhancingdevelopments help reduce dependence financial system central banks.in euro area, particular, central bank risk management benefit current europeanprojects complete emu, especially bank union initiatives:single supervisory mechanism already improve supervisory information generaltrust euro area banks, thereby facilitate ecb's operative tasks. the european depositinsurance scheme, i hope move forward soon, help stabilize bank liquidity evenunder future adverse shocks.the regulatory framework complete even project i mention finalized. itis complete even central banks' risk management point view.the constantly evolve financial industry bring new challenge must take intoaccount.currently, unregulated segment financial intermediation ("shadow banks") source ofconcern. they make central banks' job protect financial stability harder, theyare subject monitor account scrutiny banks, cannot bemonetary policy counterpart central banks, liquidity fragile. the 6 / 7bis central bankers' speech consequence activity shadow bank sector volatility supply ofliquidity challenge await proper regulatory response.conclusionsthe central bank face new challenge risk management last decade.these challenge respect similar bank met, policy roleof central bank make even complex.the central bank must consider risk also broad risk financialsector macro-economy make decision risk

ask whether learn lesson northern rock bank failure followed? i want today look unable safely wind fail bank without taxpayer intervention, progress make uk towards rectify failings, challenge remain. the pre-crisis regime the failure northern rock 2007 later, rb lloyd expose brutally uk lack tool need manage failure bank. depositor expect take comfort depositor compensation scheme base principle ‘co-insurance’. they fully cover first £2,000 deposit. any depositor strong financial incentive run hear rumour bank fail – hear northern rock receipt emergency liquidity assistance bank england. when

insolvency, put financial stability risk, taxpayer bailout. the uk course jurisdiction discover financial crisis effective regime deal failure banks. and, discover lehman brother failed, authority different jurisdiction pre-agreed mean coordinate deal sudden failure major cross-border bank. nor confidence action take authority another jurisdiction would align national interest. with hindsight clear lull false sense security. in britain, northern rock represent first major run bank since failure overend gurney 1866. unlike, example, us, uk experience bank run 20th century. bank uk failed. but insolvency generally avoid bank england twist arm ‘encourage’ banks, support rescue ‘lifeboat’, secondary bank crisis 1973 take fail bank bar 1995. the failure bcci 1991 lead protract difficult insolvency. but bank’s activity uk scale pose risk uk financial system economy the bank england’s approach bank failure, approach share many central banks, one ‘constructive ambiguity’. the aim guard moral hazard maintain uncertainty whether bank trouble would get liquidity support threat insolvency background. in event threat insolvency prove neither credible effective. when northern rock get

bank nationalise avoid insolvency allow bank’s critical function continue buyer find deposits. the lesson northern rock dramatically underscore year late failure rb lloyds. face choice insolvency taxpayer intervention, government force inject £37bn two banks. the bank put insolvency prove impossible fully write exist shareholder impose loss bond holders. the first lesson constructive ambiguity simply didn’t work. the market always suspect case. the implicit subsidy enjoy large bank crisis illustrate market’s assumption state would always intervene prevent bankruptcy. and market generally prove right. the exception prove rule fed’s decision let lehman brother enter insolvency. the fallout globally lehmans demonstrate dramatically, why, large bank perform critical functions, insolvency viable option. the second lesson, follow first, want, bank fails, good option disruptive insolvency taxpayer bailout, option put place well beforehand. do come cost bank public authorities. but point failure, good option available 2008, moral hazard cannot avoided. rather constructive ambiguity, need credible clarity bank get trouble, loss make fall shareholder creditor taxpayer. and bank provide critical service economy, continue bank resolve orderly way. the purple book it order achieve credible clarity, next week bank publish update approach resolution. this document – know colour cover purple book - first publish october 2014. it purpose set clearly option bank deal failure bank way would use powers. explain resolution design work practice need remove barrier resolvability necessary step ensure resolution regime credible. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 5 5 the purple book illustrate scale progress make uk towards put place credible effective way deal bank failures. i would pick three crucial area reform: first, comprehensive statutory framework deal fail banks, bank england formally responsible. we statutory power match responsibility wide range option available us. unlike 2008, there, special bank insolvency procedure require insolvency practitioner prioritise pay-out insure depositor speedy transfer deposit purchaser. eligible depositor protect £85,000. ‘co-insurance’ consign history. for large number small build society banks, procedure mean failure manage depositor pay transfer quickly follow entry insolvency – leave shareholder creditor take losses. but large bank hold majority deposit uk provide critical function economy. these would disrupt insolvency, even new regime. be large bank fail, bank england trigger use ‘stabilisation’ power outside insolvency. these power include ‘bail-in’ recapitalise bank impose loss shareholder creditors, critical operation continue. this provide time firm safely restructure address cause failure. second, well way ensure bank fail take resolution, sufficient, private sector, financial resources, form debt equity, bail absorb loss recapitalise bank continue operate. to achieve bank set every uk bank (and build society) requirement minimum amount loss absorb resource – know mrel – need hold. this requirement need meet full 2022. mrel cover capital bank hold go concern capital debt bail fail enter resolution. the big uk bank already go go concern resource sufficient absorb loss almost quarter risk-weighted assets, well way towards meet full mrel requirements. current level loss absorb resource mean even major uk bank saw loss six time loss incur 2008 2009, would sufficient private sector resource could bail recapitalise bank stabilise without taxpayer support. and next week, alongside purple book, publish consultation bank england’s proposal loss absorb resource distribute within bank groups. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 6 6 in set timetable meet full mrel requirements, bank consider balance cost benefits. issue mrel impose cost banks. these cost minimize bank able build mrel loss absorb debt replace exist debt matures. it could counterproductive if, seek impose requirement intend address financial stability, timetable dislocate bank system make le vulnerable process. third, statutory power loss absorb resource necessary sufficient condition effective resolution regime. there barrier resolution also need addressed. resolution must provide continuity, whether continuity access financial market infrastructure, continuity contract operational continuity. for example, service it underpin critical function need set way enable continue resolution. the bank work alongside pra assess firms’ readiness meet operational continuity resolution. we however illusion resolution major bank. if happens, even regime fully place, painful exercise. resolution magic wand; loss need fall creditors. even prepare advance, stabilise large fail bank easy. but take together, reform mean would able handle fail bank differently today compare 2008. there place credible options, insolvency bailout, ensure bank shareholder creditor bear loss bank fails. and much good able ensure fail bank necessary stabilise continue provide critical service economy. what remain done? however remain done. first foremost, need implement fully reform i mentioned. bank need continue build necessary loss absorbency restructure necessary ensure operational continuity resolution. this perhaps

fiscal policy, follow therecent paper auerbach gorodnichenko (2017). a reconsideration effectiveness ofboth macro policy become even necessary view two major problem thatcentral bank confront with: first, linger low inflation associate flatterphillips curve impair policy transmission and, second, need policy instrumentsto deal next recession, even mild one.the various point i list relevant aspect on-going revision ofmacroeconomics justify point recently make blanchard need different type ofmodels understand, forecast analyse economy policy necessary addressits shortcomings. in spirit, i concentrate remain remark on-goingdevelopments specification macroeconomic model ecb.desirable property policy modelsmacroeconomic model use variety purpose central banks. they helpfulto articulate relationship certain variable interest systematic fashion, whileensuring resource constraint respected. they provide input complex process ofmacroeconomic forecasting. and helpful conduct scenario analysis studypolicy counterfactuals.to perform task effectively, model satisfy two simple criteria. first, since manypolicy question inherently quantitative nature, useful model must fit data reasonablywell able produce effective economic forecasts. model-based counterfactualanalyses serve credible benchmark policy discussion, result arequantitatively plausible. in practice, criterion two implications. on one hand, themodel incorporate realistic elasticities. for example, dynamic effect change inmonetary policy interest rate consistent available reduced-form evidence. in theeuro area, model provide reasonably good account inflationary impact ofnational fiscal expansions, development national wage negotiations. on hand,the model provide credible narrative observe economic developments.the second criterion really implication first. partly due new research findings, partlyas result puzzle economic developments, constantly update belief keyeconomic mechanism necessary fit data. the model reasonablyflexible able adapt change economic policy environment speak tocurrent policy questions. the financial crisis case point. the macroeconomic modelsmaintained central bank early 2000s equip speak questionsarising aftermath crisis without adjustments. from today’s standpoint, theseadjustments simply inescapable. we would like model provide reasonable account ofthe dynamic effect non-standard monetary policy measures. with policy rate effectivelower bound, really need model provide realistic implication impact forwardguidance. for policymaker, key importance model adapt fastenough address newly emerge question timely manner. of course, order reap thebenefits flexible model framework, equally important expert staff use andenhancing model practical innovative manner.the new ecb multi-country model: ecb-mcthese consideration play important role ecb, recently facedwith decision enhance multi-country (mc) model euro area. which paradigmshould adopt?one option remain within dsge framework. for 10 years, dsge model havebeen key tool use policy analysis exercise many central banks. this also been5 2 / 6bis central bankers' speech case ecb, initial development estimate dsge model takenplace. dsge model typically estimate thus consistent data. they oftenreproduce dynamic effect change monetary policy interest rate observe inidentified variable autoregression model (vars.) this also case dsge modeldeveloped directorate general research, new area-wide model, regularly use forcounterfactual policy analysis.at time, good fit data extent accomplish dsge modelsthrough persistent shock processes, question empirical validity model’sintrinsic propagation mechanisms. more importantly, dsge model always provide aplausible story observe economic developments. for example, so-called “technologyshocks” tend play overwhelmingly important role account evolution gdp,even external data show evidence technological innovations. moreover,dsge model slowly adapt new policy environment. the requirement fullinternal consistency make incorporation new features—be granular financialsector, household heterogeneity strong nonlinearities—often demanding.enhancements come long gestation periods, sometimes limit ability dsge modelsto speak newly emerge policy questions, timely manner.in design new ecb-mc therefore start premise that, word ofolivier blanchard, “policy models” cannot expect tight structure as“theory models”. we decide adopt semi-structural approach inspire twoguidelines: 1) include financial friction financial mechanism could allow monetary policyshocks transmit via channel absent crisis; 2) adopt flexibleand empirically-driven approach.the emphasis equation-by-equation fit, cross-equation constraint mostlyignored impinge model’s ability provide sound quantitativepredictions. when introduce financial frictions, rely reduce form representationthat consistent different theoretical micro-foundations. this flexible, semi-structuralapproach allow u model wide range bank financial variables, go banklending spread term premia, without take stance exact theoretical mechanismlinking

in short run, however, isassumed agent face adjustment cost imply stagger adjustment actual tothe desire levels.challenges aheadi believe design ecb- mc model increase robustness model-basedpolicy analysis strengthen capability address newly emerge policy question atimely manner. the model development, lead directorate generalresearch, joint effort economist wide-range policy area inside ecb,colleagues national central bank academic consultants. i confident soon bepart ecb toolkit. however, easy forecast refinement prove benecessary future, model continue valuable policy tool. i specifically seefour area significant progress already made, improvement arelikely necessary.the first area relate model aggregate consumption. i share concern ofmuellbauer standard dsge framework impose unrealistic micro-foundations thebehaviour household embody ‘rational expectation permanent income’ model of678910 3 / 6bis central bankers' speech consumption. in typical representative-agent models, consumption behaviour capture aneuler equation, inter-temporal optimality condition link today’s level consumption toexpected consumption next period future. in linearise form, doesneither envisage consumer face idiosyncratic (household-specific) uninsurable incomeuncertainty, uncertainty interact credit liquidity constraints. this starkcontrast recent research emphasis importance precautionary saving, liquidityconstraints, leverage heterogeneity, include heterogeneity marginal propensity toconsume. compare simple representative-agent models, ecb-mc clearly mark animprovement. the consumption function explicitly affect agents’ wealthholdings. agent short average horizon presume text-book permanentincome hypothesis model allow presence agent optimizebut rather exhibit ‘hand-to-mouth’ behaviour. last, least, risk aversion incomeuncertainty also play role consumption behaviour. this setup, example, allowsquantifying large income uncertainty reduce power forward guidance. all all, i thinkthat move right direction. nevertheless, model aggregate consumptionis area research currently develop fast ready learn fromnew findings.the second area improvement concern model expectations. a sargent (1993)emphasizes, rational expectation meaningful characterisation long-runequilibrium, transition new steady state might display non-rational behaviour. anincreasing body research aim explore implication alternative type departuresfrom rational expectation business cycle dynamic general, transmission ofmonetary policy particular, paper garcia-schmidt woodford (2015), gabaix(2017) fahri werning. once again, ecb-mc go right direction. the modelcan simulate two expectation setups: (i) model consistent manner, (ii) underthe assumption bound rationality agent form expectation small-scale varmodel. other expectation formation mechanisms, learn use marketexpectations, also easily implementable. a show blanchard co-author arecent study macroeconomic effect change expectation long-runproductivity growth, different assumption expectation formation mechanism lead toconsiderably different outcomes. assess realistic way treat expectation inpolicy model remain crucial area work.the third area improvement nexus inflation, wage realeconomy. when model expectations-augmented phillips curve, nexus seemsto become weak financial crisis. commentator repeatedly talk abouta “missing disinflation” trough great recession, “missing inflation” inmore recent years. recent study come alternative explanation thesephenomena. for instance, “missing disinflation” argue consequence ofeither presence well-anchored inflation expectations, increase downward wagerigidities recessions, fall total factor productivity increase cost workingcapital. understand underlie source apparent structural change beimportant monetary policy. the semi-reduced-form nature ecb-mc make ill-equipped address deep question, study structural change challenge allcurrent model build study cyclical developments.the fourth final area improvement necessary macro-financial linkages.i already mention ecb-mc incorporate linkages. nevertheless, exactway affect monetary policy transmission mechanism remain imperfectlyunderstood, even empirical literature make important advances. these linkage arealso relevant financial stability may evolve response recent reform theregulatory environment. this ecb also make parallel progress front101112131415161718192021 4 / 6bis central bankers' speech within dsge paradigm, 3d model. the 3d model develop

reduction default riskin economy, bank also borrowers, i.e. non-financial firm andhouseholds.concluding remarksto conclude, build model policy analysis associate trade-offs. this animportant reason

carlos da silva costa: risk management central banksopening remark mr carlos da silva costa, governor bank portugal, jointbank portugal european central bank conference "risk management centralbanks", lisbon, 25 september 2017.* * *thank much presence, i welcome i hope conference andyour stay pleasant summer turn autumn lisbon.the first point i would like make carlos bernardel, helena adegas i first plan toorganise conference two year ago. we able say right decision,and i think end first witness that. when take decision go ahead conference, risk management importantmatter. but even important. there lot think available matter, butaside available thinking, lot problem solve. and mean weneed new think way solve problem link risk management.my open remark take different approach close remark end theconference. i would like speak initially central bank way face, facedby, risks. central bank ‘complex entities’ broad mandates. firstly, central bank arepolicy-makers regulators. secondly, also corporation service providers. andthey ask accountable capacity important theeconomy society.as policy-makers regulators, central bank pursue public interest mission deliveringprice stability safeguard financial sustainability. a corporation service providersthey well managed, need efficient need care aboutsustainability. the risk management framework within central bank need take account twodifferent – sometimes conflict – realities. a policy-makers, need understand thatthe financial crisis, context crisis emerge developed, provide amplefood think role central banks, include issue risk management.indeed, policy-making involve different type risk uncertainties.when speak risk management, asset management, also aboutrisk associate decisions, act defer action, creatinguncertainties third party economy. for instance, central bank may base thedefinition policy faulty representation reality, either model use areconceptually wrong incomplete, coefficient long right. and yourecall past history crisis see two risk present: quality ofthe model quality, accuracy, coefficients.under certain circumstances, central bank may also lack necessary tool achieve itspolicy objectives; may cope deficiency institutional set – i haveplenty say institutional set difficulty create central bank alack right institutional set – may cope failure coordination theother relevant policy-making authorities. and speak coordination risk central banks, also plenty say.materialisation risk may lead late recognition accumulate imbalances. this, 1 / 4bis central bankers' speech turn, result failure prevent imbalance reach point disruptive adjustmentbecomes inevitable crisis emerges. this mean main risk central bank term policy-making act rightmoment order avoid make late action harder, ultimately lead crisis.once crisis erupts, nature risk changes, call action policy-making authorities.initially, priority must manage crisis mitigate immediate impact. i amreminded popular portuguese saying: ‘in time war time clean weapons’.and crisis. when face problem need act, despitethe presence risks. that initially priority must manage crisis tomitigate immediate impact.unconventional, often untested, measure put place, question arise to,first: what right do medicine right duration intervention? then one worry adjustment process towards new ‘steady state’, second,about reduce probability similar crisis occur future. this mean aresimultaneously situation need ensure patient survive, risksassociated medicine also control. the dilemma theappropriate doses: how facilitate speed adjustment minimise risk ‘curing thedisease kill patient’? and smooth adjustment without sow seed next crisis? in words, policy avoid tail risks? and cost?also, policy design avoid tail risk often carry significant risk central banks’ balancesheets. this something study professor ricardo reis, ustoday. such policies, reversal future, may jeopardise central banks’ independenceand ability deliver objective medium run. this mean need tounderstand central bank need act face difficulty, time actingcould big threat bank itself.so, decide policies, central bank need consider overall economicimpact policies, also possible implication sustainability. these difficult question trade-off much present central banks’deliberations past ten years; go away future bepresent manage balance sheet.the second topic need understand central bank corporation serviceproviders. and relate risk associate formulate monetary policy andensuring financial stability, activity impact capacity manage balancesheet. central bank also face variety risk emerge operational activity,extending limit affecting:asset management;cash issuance;payment systems;information communication systems, include cyber risks.materialisation risk may severe impact central bank’s financial 2 / 4bis central bankers' speech position reputation. their prevention need part central bank’s daily activities.on top that, bank balance sheet, responsibility asset balancesheet need central bank, also entity supervisory powers,central bank need set example bank community financial system. thismeans need first introduce new approaches, need first thinkabout risk need first spread best practice among financial community. in nutshell i believe effective, central bank need trusted; order betrusted, need:to ability explain policy deliver mission;to accountable use taxpayers’ resources;and finally lead example.the road narrow failure deliver cause serious long-lasting reputationaldamage. risk important face risk always front-runner therisk emerges.a ‘risk-free’ organisation exist. this something emblazon frontof central bank also commercial banks: risk-free organisation doesn’t exist. andit important central bank – within constraint institutional regulatoryenvironment embrace operation – define appropriate level risk appetite andtolerance, monitor risk effective suitable way.a properly design risk management framework central bank pillar confidence andtrust financial system wide economy. this conference important. by bring together academics, policy-makers, practitioner market analyst exchange view – different, butcomplementary, angle – contribute robust policy framework morerobust institutions.and i think main takeaway need end conference: ideathat better, cannot avoid risk; art central bank deal therisk without lose sight two main goals, financial stability monetary stability. to dothat, may need accept collateral effect part process theprice pay order achieve two main objectives.thank much. and thank much make presentations, agree take partin discussions, agree participate conference.it honour present yves mersch, member executive board ecb.it

whether respective jurisdiction adopt ifrs not, i sure find benefit discussion presentation take place workshop. ifrs 9 g20 on 24 july 2014, iasb issue new account standard financial instrument call ifrs 9, replace exist standard, namely international account standard (ias) 39, mandatory effective date 1 january 2018. ifrs 9 inter alia specify entity classify measure financial asset liabilities. one fundamental change ifrs 9 introduce concept expect credit loss (ecl) provisioning. this new principle replace current incur loss model materially change way companies, particular banks, require approach account impairment credit losses. accord bank international settlement (bis), great financial crisis 2007-09 highlight systemic cost delay recognition credit loss part bank lenders, application prevail standard time see prevent bank provision appropriately credit loss likely arise emerge risks. these delay result recognition credit loss widely regard ‘too little, late’, give rise question procyclicality spur excessive lend boom force sharp reduction subsequent bust. the development ecl account framework consistent call leader group twenty (g20) april 2009 strengthen account recognition loan loss provision incorporate broad range credit information. one consequence new framework fact while, past, loss event occur impairment raise bank. the standard require loss provision raise early take account past present page 4 9 information also forward-looking information, emphasis future probability credit loss determine them. this standard aim resolve weakness identify global financial crisis ‘too little, late’ refer above, hopefully result robust financial system resilient hence good able withstand shocks. the adoption ifrs 9 give rise high level credit impairments. a study undertake european bank authority estimate implementation ifrs 9 would give rise average increase 13% loss provision compare current level ia 39; expect core equity tier (cet) 1 ratio decrease average 45 basis points. small banks, mainly use standardise approach measure credit risk, estimate large impact fund ratio large banks. estimate exact impact differ, however, time tell estimate accurate. there argue adoption ifrs 9 may fact increase procyclicality, recessionary condition may sharp fall cet 1 capital level this, turn, may lead sharp ease credit extension due so-called ‘cliff effect’ stag approach prescribe ifrs 9. others, notably bis, reject argument basis banks, global financial crisis, good capitalise high buff thus good able absorb losses. they argue early loss recognition credit loss enable quick ‘clean-up’ banks’ balance sheets, thus enable support economic recovery. this debate clearly yet settle need wait see play next recession. the economic impact is, however, limit level loss time recognition; implementation ifrs 9 also likely impact price product may thus impact overall credit extension within economy ultimately consumption hence economic growth. it furthermore likely banks’ earn volatile future due effect forward-looking approach require ifrs 9. therefore, page 5 9 disclosure education stakeholder interpret financial information ifrs 9 imperative important consideration. over past two years, many seminars, workshops, train session provide range organisations. however, focus jurisdiction african continent. there factor unique africa need take account. with workshop, want fill gap provide platform african regulator discus specific issue concern may affect implementation ifrs 9. in context, much look forward presentation bank zambia in-country regulator perspective. auditor the bi correctly point effectiveness new standard depend bank implement also depend contribution central banks, supervisors, stakeholders, auditors. the bi highlight supervisor play important role promote sound bank implementation practice bank supervision activity manner complement effort accost standard setters. the audit profession, mentioned, important stakeholder come implementation ifrs 9, discussion ifrs 9 would complete without reference role. there little doubt audit profession likely challenge introduction ifrs 9. the reason audit account estimates, impairments, always complex area introduction ifrs 9 add complexity. we extremely please multiple representative audit profession midst today tomorrow. we listen presentation pwc kpmg deal audit expectations, ey provide u perspective panel discussion tomorrow. we especially want welcome representative pwc kenya share u experience date. page 6 9 before i conclude, i would like touch two audit-related topics, namely mandatory audit firm rotation recent development engulf global audit firm kpmg. the independent regulatory board auditor (irba) recently issue new rule mandatory audit firm rotation, limit audit firm appointment maximum period 10 years. the effort irba improve independence welcomed. the sarb proactive regard auditor independence, example section 61 bank act provide registrar bank must approve appointment auditor auditor take office. such appointment require audit committee proper assessment suitability auditor hold office, office registrar bank would also fit proper assessment prior approval auditor’s appointment. the sarb, supervisory perspective furthermore, many year now, require large bank appoint joint auditor reduce independence-related risk. the sarb therefore, broadly supportive principle mandatory audit firm rotation, belief bank exempt requirement supervisory standard practice relate auditor independence far exceed recently put place. we believe maximum period appointment increase propose 10 year long period 15 20 years, individual audit partner rotation already effect. the challenge around skill shortage furthermore reality may act obstacle achieve objective rotate audit firm 10 years. if mandatory audit firm rotation retain current form, sarb may compel revisit requirement joint auditor appointment large financial institution due practical considerations. although removal requirement joint auditor large financial institution lead reduce audit fee efficiencies, believe likely weaken auditor independence may detract current high level audit quality thus possibly erode effective oversight supervision banks. this would public interest. we page 7 9 remain unconvinced mandatory audit firm rotation represent effective policy intervention address state secondary objective redress high level market concentration promote transformation within audit profession. a regulator, sarb rule comment individual firms. we, however, take extraordinary step comment publicly development surround kpmg last week auditor three big four banks, well bank insurance companies. our interest stem solely public policy perspective arise financial stability mandate. we note concern regrettable audit practice serious error judgment occur kpmg lead significant damage inflict certain individuals, organisations, country whole. during engagement local global leadership kpmg, note increase firm commitment new management team fully past mistake work towards restore public trust. the recent announcement regard recognise important first step towards end eagerly await result independent investigation undertake irba recently announce one kpmg. a regulator, pick winner losers, concern stem extensive experience regulate bank unfold situation may take form bank run contagion risk extend beyond individual firm. this situation call thoughtful leadership restraint believe economy good serve avoid market concentration within audit auxiliary professional service sector. these recent development have, however, provide u cause pause. in come month years, follow policy consideration may need ponder interest strengthen governance transparency within audit account professions. these include: page 8 9 (i) the requirement audit firm may ‘too big fail’ whether may require regulatory intervention, include limit extent audit firm provide non-audit services, especially audit clients. the imposition cap regard value non-audit service render audit client prohibit render certain category non-audit service audit client line reform announce european commission 2016 enjoy serious consideration. (ii) a far great degree disclosure transparency audit account profession required, give public function audit firm perform inter alia attest financial statement public companies. hence, consideration give make full public disclosure comprehensive set audit financial statement mandatory, irrespective form legal structure ownership firms. (iii) the appointment independent board director strengthen risk management function within audit firm strengthen oversight governance within audit account firms. (iv) the publication integrate report large medium size audit firm may contribute improve transparency around transformation initiative could assist accelerate transformation within sector. full disclosure regard compliance governance framework king iv could also assist improve governance arrangement within firms. while list exhaustive, would useful public discourse around policy questions. we firmly believe implementation proposal may go way strengthen governance within audit account profession could assist support possibly strengthen trust society place them. page 9 9 conclusion the say go change constant life. ifrs 9 certainly represent major change bank industry. it certainly change need embraced. the regulate sector look towards regulator guidance, hence need date well verse order able provide effective guidance. to end banks, auditor regulator work together ensure implementation ifrs 9 success. i hope workshop contribute towards goal. i sure next one half days, interest fruitful discussion benefit jurisdiction present today even workshops, i sure conversation continue. i wish well ifrs 9 implementation journey hope enjoy workshop. thank you. speechcentral bank

explanation low level nominal growth, particularly wage growth. theconcerns around income distribution much stark (though necessarily less), whennominal wage stagnant significant share population. another possible explanation isthat primary transmission channel unconventional monetary policy asset prices(including house prices), wealth channel may play disproportionately large rolethan past. the distributional impact wealth channel may well large otherchannels monetary policy transmission. if distributional impact monetary policy channel islarger past, compromise legitimacy instrument

ingrain bad habit governance management. these weakness feed decry conference publicly condemned. give also deeply root country history, least recent history, solution appear remote. if get rag temperature already weather, run serious risk, italy years. the country come round yet decisive, sign encouraging. what happen outside border recent year – worldwide effort draw new regulation finance, bank union europe first falter step – analyse future historians.1 europe’s bank union must ensure function smoothly, start single supervisory system (ssm) single resolution mechanism (srm) establish frankfurt brussels. i return point shortly. 1for overview event italy’s perspective, see i. visco, speech 23rd assiom forex congress, modena, 28 january 2017; s. rossi, ‘the bank union european integration process’, deliver conference european bank union bank/firm relationships, cuoa business school, altavilla vicentina, 7 april 2016. 3 from legal perspective, bank union formally rest numerous complex legislative acts, i refer use english acronyms. for euro area only, two ssmr srmr regulation establish new body task supervision bank resolution, date 2013 2014 respectively; european union whole, crd iv (the capital requirement directive), follow crr (capital requirement regulation), 2013; finally, brrd (banking recovery resolution directive), 2014, dgsd (deposit guarantee scheme directive), also date 2014. several act still revise refined. on question bank resolution, vital component overall project bank union, european commission’s july 2013 communication update early interpretation rule state aid bank sector. take together, brrd, dgsd communication play important role case fail italian bank wind up, place resolution sell banks. bank union make sense market investor believe europe’s bank european first foremost, italian, german french. it follow bank difficulty, must matter europe, country bank headquartered. this imply share risks, private public level, concept many country yet accept. for several good reasons, i might add. however, one point must clear: bank run many risk managed, also share state establish – whose government bond hold portfolio – commonly term sovereign risk. in euro area today 4 reflection idiosyncratic factor state, also possibility – market continue entertain, though much le 2011 – euro break-up redenomination credit renascent national currencies. this element risk must eliminate drive message home every opportunity: whatever happens, euro endure. proceed bank union necessarily imply share bank risks: country must work make reality. the problem beset ‘business banking’ today what problem italian bank face today, fall-out crisis, specifically ratio non-performing loans, slowly diminishing? essentially, bank generate little profit, even exclude cost bad loans. to understand why, help look happen internationally. over last five year return capital reserves, namely return equity (or roe), bank virtually nil, euro area roe 2 per cent unite kingdom hit 3; unite state reach much 9 per cent. italian bank make enormous write-down non-performing loan balance sheets, also bear high cost countries. up now, traditional lending, especially concentrate around small customers, oblige bank allocate large amount human resource per unit revenue; moreover, major bank labour productivity, express value add per employee, modest, average 5 €124,000 last five years, compare €170,000 sample large european group similar business models. the low interest rate environment, create world monetary policies, squeeze interest margin reduce profits. although global phenomenon, italian bank suffer country owe traditional business model: several year roe much low cost capital, make easy find new fund capital markets. a see, italy’s entire financial structure difficulty. despite progress make recent years, still company poorly capitalize (as well small average) bloat bank sector within financial system. and yet overall size italy’s financial sector great advance countries. on contrary! at end last year, financial debt private sector (excluding bank financial entities) 120 per cent gdp, compare around 160 per cent euro area, unite kingdom unite states. but, companies, equity finance account 46 per cent total liabilities, compare average 53 per cent euro area. moreover, turn mainly bank rather financial market non-banking intermediaries: bank loan represent 60 per cent firms’ financial debts, euro-area average even 40 per cent unite state unite kingdom one third. 6 a result, italian banks, even large ones, specialize retail lend firms. they therefore expose adverse cyclical conditions. the transition italian financial system the rule change the response government supervisory authority global financial crisis focus two key concepts: ‘more capital banks’ ‘no taxpayer-funded bail-outs’. this all: action take liquidity, securitizations off-balance-sheet transactions. limit leverage also recognize necessary supplement risk-based capital requirements. even strict rule envisage systemically important financial institutions. instead, le attention paid, least far, two extremely important non-banking topics: shadow bank system over-the-counter derivative transactions. ha pendulum swing far towards rule banks? many institution naturally begin think so. the basel committee bank supervision world’s supervisory authority debate question, negotiation propose basel iii reform package, reinforce refine bank supervision rules. i three observation make, line stance adopt bank italy. first observation. a period adjustment reform need produce stable legal framework, otherwise uncertainty increase, risk cost banking. we must allow rule settle place look effect business conduct 7 models. the burdens, especially small banks, need reduce possible, though do subject discussion. second observation. the desire period stability confuse ease rules, usa currently wrestle problem. the feed defend reform make response global financial crisis show strengthen bank system without limit economic growth. however, new administration yet define negotiation strategy. this uncertainty, occasionally see position take american representative international forums, deprive entire international community important leadership. third observation. work ongoing euro area regulatory institutional reforms. this good thing bank union still incomplete. yet europe, also need consolidate already achieved, start ssm srm, two organization responsible supervision resolution euro-area banks. practice need harmonize take best national system without prejudice. progress way, include contribution italy, must continued. rule contribute forge business model banks. if rule change, bank must take account decide identity strategy. we hope uncertainty global european regulatory framework dispel soon possible, banks, especially italy, must reinvent redefine themselves; also light new technologies. 8 technology us change fintech new buzzword centre debate future banking. fintech company make use exist technology, new technology become available, offer financial product customer year ago could purchase bank. this business expand rapidly market loans, payment services, financial advice manage attract substantial fund venture capital private equity firms: last year firm invest $13 billion fintech. this still trifle amount compare trillion dollar involve global finance, growth exponential. until recently, bank benefit main gateway financial world population. by provide simple fundamental product like current account, able reach vast client base make profits. today, fintech company try unpack bundle financial service offer banks, leave latter least profitable ones. fintech us innovative data analysis technique (artificial intelligence machine learning) process efficiently information individual company put online, sometimes unknowingly (big data). use data, algorithm calculate creditworthiness apply loan result available, digital platform require bank act intermediary, saver directly disburse financing. the method seem particularly profitable individual small company ask loan: case, accord advocate fintech, algorithm base big data far efficient office people bank clerks. 9 fintech company radically change relationship client financial service providers, even term usability. they mainly meet need young people, enable conduct financial transaction hour day night use mobile devices. this pose serious threat traditional banks. the factor keep borrower lender tie traditional bank trust, base familiarity human be behind counter even base purely brand. this imponderable factor, one difficult predict. certainly, bank give much importance digital distribution channel radically alter way client data analyse stored. substantial investment technology human capital necessary. another option traditional bank acquire one fintech companies, seem happen payment services. small bank could team fintech company outsource business, happen many english-speaking countries. fintech also raise question problem public responsibility financial regulator supervisors. there risk, instance, enlarge boundary shadow banking, financial entity elude kind supervision. progress cannot stopped, point right direction public

bank - moment truth fordecision-makersspeech dr andreas dombret, member executive board deutsche bundesbank,at bain banker lounge, frankfurt main, 21 september 2017.* * *1. introduction: structural change reach tip pointladies gentlemenbanking necessary, bank not.don’t worry: that’s view, bill gates. what bon mot, utter 20years ago now, tell u structural change bank sector new mightseem.in fact, it’s something almost take stride days. for year now, hasbeen constant talk upheaval revolution, bank die structural change. but onthe face it, much actually happened. one could forgiven, then, think wehave le accept structural change annoyance – even bearable one –rather like visit bank supervisor.my view technological progress concern different one. annoy though may beto some, it’s good shrug one’s shoulder it, escape it. the bankingsector reach tip point evolution. that is, reach position whereeven small change unleash wave innovation bank world.that technological progress always stand upheaval, redirection society’sresources. sooner later, activity create significant value become automated,standard processes.and trend reach financial sector well. ever once-innovative bankingoperations standardise perform technology.ladies gentlemen, i confession make. there side structural changewhich i, too, struggle come term – day, i would much rather type ablackberry swipe iphone.but capacity bank supervisor, i wonder bank possible without banks– who, then, provide tomorrow’s customer bank service require?that’s question i answer straight up. there are, however, five theory future ofbanking i would like discus today. 2. reliance net interest income need stoplet’s begin question earnings. my first theory this. germany’s bank savingsbanks continue over-dependent revenue interest business. this preventingthem profitable long run.net interest income german credit institution shrink year now. to day,they still haven’t manage refocus strategy new normal, theirprofitability ebb away. 1 / 6bis central bankers' speech that clear message low-interest-rate survey, release threeweeks ago conjunction federal financial supervisory authority, bafin. our findingsshow small medium-sized german credit institution expect profit tocontinue shrink 2016 2021, accord planning. they also projectinga remarkable 16% drop return total capital.monetary policymakers popular scapegoat malaise – low policy rates,some say, cause earn dry bank sector. but that, i feel, would beoversimplifying things. if ecb govern council consider accommodative monetarypolicy stance appropriate, also need set interest rate level accordingly. monetarypolicymakers are, all, responsible entire euro-area economy. see thatprism, bank sector profitability one aspect, albeit important one.as understandable criticism direct interest rate policy may seem theperspective german credit institutions, there’s risk might overlook big economicpicture.i say partly historical reasons. interest rate level germany generally thewane 30 year now, notably account demographic macroeconomicfactors. unsurprisingly, then, german bank sector’s interest margin steadilynarrowing 30 year well. hence, accommodative monetary policy one –albeit important – aspect. that said, interest-driven business model pressurefor quite time already.and yet see little way adjustment. the business model small andmedium-sized german institutions, particular, tend reliant interest business thanthose international peers, despite fact generate sufficientprofits even challenge setting.my conclusion, then, this. excessively interest-heavy business model particularlyexposed structural change. it become increasingly important tap new source ofincome.3. flight risk isn’t answerone simple escape route malaise, would appear, flight risk – search foryield i’m talk here. my second theory, then, this. bank save bankswould unwise escape structural change flee risk.and long low-interest-rate environment persists, great risk institution takingon excessive risk. after year de-risking, see first sign germany agrowing willingness assume risk.prices financial market leap one all-time high next – thing is,volatility conspicuously low, despite absence consistently robust economic andpolitical backdrop.what’s story bank save banks? interest rate risk remain elevate level. inreal estate business, bud sign institution soften credit standards.our low-interest-rate survey likewise point increase risk propensity. one-third smalland medium-sized german credit institution plan increase business volume andrisk taking. however, wish increase capital extent – themedium term, erode resilience.as know, one swallow make summer. not that, take risk, 2 / 6bis central bankers' speech itself, isn’t problem, yet least – all, manage risk raison d’être creditinstitutions. i still ease right now, stress test conduct part thelow-interest-rate survey show 95% bank would satisfy broadly basedcapital requirement even crisis scenarios.and yet caution warrant two counts. for one thing, bank save bank need tometiculously check whether tab effect risk portfolio canhandle crisis strikes. for another, take risk – portfolio shiftsor extend balance sheet – nothing resolve structural issues. at best, provideshort-lived respite earn problems.4. credit institution need open-minded new form value creationand bring third theory. if bank save bank fix earningsproblems all, need tap new source income open-minded tonew form value creation. and i dare say simply hike price exist serviceswon’t go far enough. especially competitor don’t follow suit.i little time overblown forecast predict bank save bank bereplaced fintechs future. hugely successful though amazon been, town centre arestill abuzz shoppers. a ubiquitous smartphones nowadays, people continue sendletters – mail firm need evolve make downturn postal business, forexample, deliver parcel send online mail order companies.i firmly believe credit institution continue exist future – one whichare will position embrace change.no-one say sure bank business look like year hence. institution cancounter uncertainty explore customer – legacy new one –actually want; also harness digital expertise fintechs instead regard themas kind nemesis.take look customer you’ll see that, millennials notwithstanding, onetype customer there. plenty people still prefer bank via traditional channels. it’s justthat share continue dwindle – make structural change increasingly press topicfor institutions.i would also recommend harness benefit swarm intelligence. open bank system –arrangements bank open data trust fintech partner provideapps bank customer – increasingly catch on, mean scope new feemodels boost customer satisfaction.open bank system risks, though – case, cyber risks. i please tonote low-interest-rate survey show institution plan step investment inthis field – present many still vulnerable. this hugely important topic mebecause i feel still neglected. we intend increasingly probe extent creditinstitutions handle cyber attacks.yet time, supervisor keen take account competitive environment. thesingle supervisory mechanism, member, today release consultation onguides concern assessment licence application – explicitly also addressesthe question fintech credit institution licence applications. i urge bank fintechs use theconsultation phase constructively. 3 / 6bis central bankers' speech 5. bank save bank must become efficienti come cost side challenge compensate decline income throughgreater efficiency.this bring fourth theory: german credit institution could provide service moreefficiently. once again, i would draw attention low-interest-rate survey, whose findingssuggest small medium-sized german institution expect cost-income ratioto increase. unfortunately, put german credit institution bottom europeanleague.if cost-income ratio remain poor failure significantly bring downadministrative costs, done. an optimist would therefore hope onlyreason number remain unsatisfactory bank save bank busyinvesting thing new it infrastructure, good risk management system moreefficient processes. i fully support institution that, i saythat still many institution not.and i talk three pillar german bank system, although perhaps notto extent case. we point difference conversation thesector associations, i hope tell sink in, difference candefinitely sign do quarter others.banks save bank become even efficient, ina new, tough regulatory environment. what i get regulatoryframework cannot loosen allow inefficient institution kick structural change intothe long grass.i readily admit credit institution incur cost regulation oversight. but bankor save bank cannot survive effective regulatory supervisory environmentneeds urgently rethink business model.it go without say adapt new regulatory requirement mammoth task, andthe uncertainty surround regulatory reform yet put place clearly aproblem. what basel iii bring it, mean bank eu?this make every effort complete basel iii without create excessive burdens.once done, basel iii should, far possible, implement way iscommitted basel rules.but one thing must ensure: namely, remain true original intention thebasel accords: provide global rule global credit institutions. for others, i would liketo see appropriately gradate rules. this something achieve mean ofthe crr crd: apply smart threshold values, simplify rule apply, andby put place separate oversight regime small institutions, refer asthe “small bank box”, currently lobby brussels.6. not even merger shield institution structural changeladies gentlemen, regulation must never instrument structural policy.that something market player need decide among themselves. and bringsme final theory, merger takeover make bank savingsbanks immune structural change.many commentator believe fierce competition german bank sector make furtherconsolidation inevitable, i one share view.1 4 / 6bis central bankers' speech the form consolidation take determine customer behaviour banks’response behaviour. capacity reduction exist institution likely play major partin this.the specific question ask therefore, merger and, so,can alleviate problem associate structural change?again, low-interest-rate survey provide interest insights: one every nine ofthe nearly 1,600 institution take part survey already process mergingwith another institution specific plan so. and similar number institution think ita plausible proposition could take part merger next five years.but i wish warn unrealistic expectations: numerous example mergerswhich failed. this because, merger succeed, number important conditionshave fulfilled. for example, sustainable synergy business modelsor regional coverage.there exhaustive list factor determine success, blueprint forsuccess. german institution must therefore perform comprehensive health check order todetect avoidable problem early stage.even merger successful, however, new opportunity value creation comeabout automatically, customer need automatically good served.7. conclusionsladies gentlemen, animal try resist evolutionary change notcongenial risk become another animal’s dinner. similarly, technological progress changesvalue creation bank sector. there escape simple truth. adapt die.it undeniable monetary policy regulation currently major side effect thebanking sector, cannot allow side effect blind u uncomfortable fact itis precisely new, creative innovative force destroy exist structure thebanking sector.every bank every save bank must ask want part creative force, partof new structures, part ruin structure. i dare suggest wish tobelong first group. do believe possible without take courageous decisions?without risky decisions? or without unpopular decisions? i not.creative decision presuppose creative questions: question show world newlight. in germany’s bank landscape, question ask oftenframed decades-old mould thinking. so, misquote title song german singer inadeter, perhaps country need new bankers?essentially, does, able lead institution new era oldthinking. bank become service provider bank licences; account holder bankcustomers become “users” require broad spectrum flexible financial services. so,yes, new world need new bankers, least experience banker courage totake innovative decisions.my challenge sector therefore perform mental demolition establish institutionswherever necessary rebuild green-field sites. today’s bank besuccessful tomorrow enough new bankers, take new decisions.i please take question hear comments.1 5 / 6bis central bankers' speech the find

(this is, effectively, double ratio le 10 years.) from 1 gross domestic product page 5 10 relatively low level emerging-market standard 2000s, south africa’s debt-to-gdp ratio move relatively high position, could – continue – reduce country’s relative attractiveness global investors. equally, raise tax higher-income household corporations, country tax system already fairly progressive (and tax burden, least emerging-market standards, relatively high), could undermine already anaemic pace economic growth trigger capital outflows. for state effectively help poor, need maximum fiscal space, mean (among things) well-managed public finance sustainable debt burdens. this also key repercussion monetary policy’s ability best contribute sustainable long-term economic growth. in event public finance keep deteriorating, country experience ‘fiscal dominance’ – central bank’s interest rate policy primarily dictate need ensure adequate finance budget deficit expense other, real, economic considerations. it easy see suboptimal outcome point view economic development. fortunately, difficult trade-off make duly elect representative people south africa. a south african reserve bank, look implication monetary policy. furthermore, rat downgrade affect price government debt; also affect pay bond issuer country – raising, instance, cost issue service debt bank state-owned utilities. to maintain profitability, page 6 10 likely bank pas high cost customers, form high rate loan high bank fee low interest rate pay deposits. in fact, high fund cost bank may one reason spread bank lend rate repurchase rate well deposit rate widen since global financial crisis. with many low-income household rely cash loan meet subsistence need (often already-high rates) use bank deposit major form savings, one easily see high borrow cost bank penalise them. equally, state-owned utility like eskom force pay high interest rate debt, cost likely ultimately pass customer – form high electricity tariffs, include poor households. separately, south africa’s domestic save insufficient meet investment needs. offshore borrow therefore require fund growth development. so, downgrade sovereign rat bound, sooner later, negative consequence exchange rate rand. this, too, potentially harm poor households. historically, openness south african economy, depreciation exchange rate tend raise inflation. in turn, high rate inflation hit vulnerable harder, especially people depend basic grant get adjust year most. in particular, food price transportation cost rise back rand depreciation. this reflect one two things: either need import good (for instance petrol, time affect price public collective transport) linkage price foodstuff agricultural commodity global market. these item account large part total expense poor page 7 10 households. for example, accord calculation statistic south africa, food non-alcoholic beverage account 48% consumption expense 10% poor households, compare weight 17% whole population. the impact rat downgrade financial market may also direct implication poor generally assumed. a mention earlier, poor household directly hold share portfolios, – particular, old people work public private sector – rely payment pension provident fund main, sole, source income. if value financial asset declines, money available pension provident pool shrink accordingly. separately, research show save vehicle typically use poor people, stokvels, gradually invest financial asset create wealth rather use solely short-term purpose (such as, instance, cover funeral costs).2 again, drop value financial asset would undermine effort aim create wealth save vehicles. finally, rat downgrade cast general doubt long-term economic financial health country. this downgrade typically weigh business confidence, undermine companies’ willingness invest new productive capacity boost size workforce. at worst, business fear worsen economic future may shed jobs, result overall decline number employment opportunity throughout country. in south africa, unemployment exceed 27% 2 see ‘investments stokvels gain ground’ publish fin24 website 9 july 2014. page 8 10 workforce, ability find job often provide main chance escape poverty individual family. decline job opportunity would therefore risk aggravate incidence poverty. arguably, many channel describe operate investor sentiment financial asset prices, include exchange rate rand. one therefore argue far, particular since late rat downgrades, reaction financial market rather benign. for instance, yield 10-year south african government bond still close average past five years, 5-year cd spread south african sovereign debt around low since late 2014. a rand, recover 20% trade-weighted basis low reach early 2016. yet relative stability fragile, dependent development may reverse not-too-distant future. the lack strong sell-off either rand local bond conjunction favourable international factor investor downplay possible negative consequence downgrade. in particular, factor refer improvement global economic developments, absence inflationary pressure advance economies, still-accommodative stance world’s major central banks. these factor ensure capital continue flow emerge world, even country experience deterioration creditworthiness. but flow could easily reverse. and amid tight global financial conditions, investor would likely differentiate strong weak sovereign credits. should south africa face another global shock, like 2008-09 global recession, page 9 10 recent rat downgrade could well make vulnerable shock. admittedly, commentator claim downgrade south africa’s sovereign rat would starve country foreign capital, investor – specifically, fund speculative nature – would still buy domestic financial assets. however, apart fact investor would require high return south african asset recent historical norms, investment would short-term nature, likely result high volatility market prices. this, turn, would increase climate uncertainty face domestic businesses, negative consequence fix investment, job creation, therefore poverty inequality. in conclusion, let say sovereign rat policy goal per se. rather, reflection broad range economic, social, political factor constitute creditworthiness country. key among factor strength institutions, include chapter 9 institutions, judiciary, south african reserve bank. these institution underpin democracy creditworthiness. it creditworthiness policymakers strive improve, goal include development poverty reduction. a international experience shows, failure generate sufficient economic growth maintain healthy fiscal external balance keep large portion country’s population poverty. for south africa’s economy become strong resilient, make inroad poverty, need avoid downgrades; also ensure recent downgrade eventually reversed. page 10 10 thank you. vítor constâncio: macroprudential stress-tests tool

risk;the role central bank lender last resort; andthe set problem relate “too big fail” financial conglomerates. when international financial crisis began, follow european sovereign debt crisis andthe vicious circle link sovereign bank several countries, issue become focalpoint. many new topic also join research agenda, as:the misuse so-called originate-to-distribute model, particular resort

strategies. in particular, thevery low interest rate environment unconventional monetary policy conduct themain central bank dramatically change operate environment incentive banksand markets. at present, four key issue opinion deserve attention policy-makers researchers:1. the regulatory supervisory frameworkan economy’s regulatory framework reflect society’s preference term risk

gather today outstanding group fiscal expert come central banks, fiscal councils, national international institutions. let take opportunity reaffirm particular importance fiscal council independent fiscal watchdog pursuit sound public finance countries. global economic activity gradually recovering. however, structural challenge persist many countries, include low productivity growth, high unemployment, insufficient level investment, high public private indebtedness well weakness financial sector. how structural reform help? these reform key improve long-term economic growth prospect reduce economies’ vulnerability future adverse shocks. however, also take consideration may associate negative effect short medium term, reform implementation without economic social costs. structural reform may link fiscal policy various channels. this workshop focus specific subset structural reforms, namely fiscal-structural 1 version prepare presentation. www.bportugal.pt 2 reforms. fiscal-structural reform encompass area like taxation, social security pension systems, healthcare, education, justice, institutional framework public finance management, among others. they

fiscal-structural reform face several tough challenges. first, preferably part broad package necessary structural reforms. a such, assessment potential impact economy usually complex require comprehensive approach. the technical expertise make correct assessment likely effect reform paramount efficient design. second, closely relate previous point, plan reform take account institutional legal framework country. indeed, political decision-making process, type government, exist domestic laws, particular constitutional level, external rule like include stability growth pact european

strong base country implement them, along ‘national champions’ support reform merits. domestic “ownership” critical. reform never understand society imposition abroad, either imf european institutions. www.bportugal.pt 3 fourth, careful attention need pay communication strategy redistributive mitigation measures. both key ensure adequate support public contain populist appeal target part society potentially adversely affect reforms. indeed, reform may involve long implementation periods, transitional arrangements, often lead change distribution income wealth. this may create pocket discontent spite clear overall benefit society. lack understand challenge decision-makers may seriously jeopardise expect outcomes. last least, length political cycle often prof insufficient provide right incentive effective implementation fiscal-structural reforms. therefore, broad agreement across political spectrum, possible, significantly increase likelihood reform success. however, nature especially country need them, agreement quite hard achieve lately. all all, i convince sustainable public finance good long-run economic performance pose significant challenge tackle without delay. the long-term benefit structural reform decide today far outweigh short- medium-term costs, particular reform appropriately design order mitigate latter jeopardise former. today gather ingredient rich fruitful debate topic i touch upon. i thank participation wish pleasant constructive workshop. news conference page 1/5 berne, 15 june 2017 andréa m. maechler introductory remark

future. challenge macroeconomic research today tomorrow talk essentially macroeconomics. look forward, macro policies, monetary, fiscal, macroprudential policies, face number challenge require deep theoretical empirical analysis. perhaps, first all, need understand cause consequence current level low inflation develop economies, despite fact major central bank introduce unprecedented monetary measure support activity growth. several explanations, range “debt supercycle” secular stagnation proposed. if natural rate low even negative level stay, central banker rethink standard toolbox decide policy measure put place last decade maintained. in respect, i think first paper conference, analyze effect negative nominal interest rates, offer new insight important topic. secondly, need improve understand link monetary policy, macroprudential policy financial stability. the financial crisis underline impair financial system could cause severe economic damage disrupt transmission monetary policy. moreover, follow financial crisis, many central bank provide new macroprudential tool remain largely untested. the question role central bank 4/4 financial crisis prevention mitigation still far away reach definite answer. several paper conference deal important issue. third, need good understand monetary policy macroeconomic policy transmitted. by now, clear standard new keynesian framework, still shape general view basic element monetary policy, relevant shortcomings. for example, recent research underline additional channel relate household firm heterogeneity may provide realistic depiction monetary fiscal policy affect economy, modify –or even overturning- prescription derive model representative agents. this line research link empirical theoretical work may

non-performing loan (npls) european banks’ balancesheets remain high. at end 2016, stock gross npls eu bank sector wasaround €1 trillion. this number, however, take account fact thatcollateralised lend play important role europe. for example, include collateral andprovisioning, coverage npls is, average, 82% euro area. banks’ profitability,however, affect low return provide npls, give weight grossexposures total assets: gross npls represent 4% total asset euro area banks,against 0.8% u banks.the outstanding stock npls consequence cyclical structural factors. first, thesevere recession result global financial crisis lead deterioration quality ofbanks’ loan books. the current economic expansion therefore help improve assetquality european banks. at time, structural weakness still persist. these includeinadequate internal governance structure banks, ineffective costly debt recoveryprocedures member state misalign incentive prevent quick resolution ofnpls. to end, esrb propose series measure complement alreadybeing take eu euro area level.in short term, esrb’s proposal focus strengthen banks’ npl management,including prudent measurement valuation associate collateral. policymakerscould aid process develop blueprint asset management companies, accompaniedby harmonise data template across eu.measures also concentrate insolvency regimes, debt recovery

future downturns. a recent impact assessment,based sample 54 bank across 20 member state publish european bankingauthority, suggest introduction ifrs 9 would lead increase provision ofabout 13% average.the expect credit loss approach also mean bank react account tonew forward-looking information received. this mean impairment allowancesmay increase suddenly significantly economic condition deteriorate, couldhave certain pro-cyclical effects. the esrb report consider number policy couldaddress effects.for example, stress test could use mean gauge variation impairmentallowances associate

american chamberof commerce australia (amcham), perth, 21 september 2017.* * *i would like thank andrea brischetto assistance preparation talk.i would like thank american chamber commerce australia invitation speaktoday. it pleasure perth again.this lunch hold time one chapter australia’s economic history draw toa close another start. a main theme chapter come endis mine investment boom. that boom, unwinding, central story ofthe australian western australian economy decade now. the new chapterwill, almost certainly, different central theme.today, i would like provide sketch likely plot line next chapter. beforedoing that, though, i reflect current chapter.the current chapterthe storyline current chapter well known. it two main plot lines.the first trouble global economy. a decade ago global financial crisis theworst recession many advance economy since 1930s. a gradual recovery tookplace, painfully slow. recently, thing improve noticeably unemploymentrates advance economy low level many decades. throughoutthis chapter, central bank mostly worry inflation rate might turn low,not high. interest rate record lows. and worker advance economy haveexperienced low growth nominal wages. so it’s challenge international backdrop.the second plot line resource boom. strong growth china saw strong growth indemand resources. price rise response, australia’s term trade reach thehighest level least 150 year (graph 1). then investment boom take place response tothe high prices, investment resource sector reach high level share ofgdp century. and see dividend this, large increase inaustralia’s resource exports. 1 / 11bis central bankers' speech overall, reasonably successful chapter australia’s economic history. realincome per person around 20 per cent high mid 2000s real wealth perperson 40 per cent higher. australia one advance economy avoid arecession 2008. and big mine boom century end crash, previousbooms did. our interest rate remain positive, unlike many advancedeconomies. since mid 2000s, unemployment rate average 5¼ per cent, betteroutcome previous three decades. inflation average 2½ per cent. and thisperiod, gdp growth average 2¾ per cent, high advance economies.so, take period whole, positive picture.at time, though, chapter draw close, face issues. i would liketo highlight three these.the first recent slow growth real per caput income. for much past two decades,real national income per person grow strongly australia (graph 2). we benefit fromstrong productivity growth, high commodity price population working. incontrast, since 2011 little net growth real per caput incomes. this change intrend prove difficult adjustment. the solution strong productivity growth andincreased labour force participation. 2 / 11bis central bankers' speech a second issue unusually slow growth nominal real wages. over past fouryears, increase average hourly earn slow since least mid 1960s(graph 3). this partly consequence unwind mine boom arestructural factor work well. the slow growth wage put strain householdbudgets contribute low rate inflation. 3 / 11bis central bankers' speech a third issue high level household debt house prices. over recent times,australians borrow lot purchase housing. this add upward pressure onhousing prices, especially two large cities, structural factor also work.australians cop well high level debt, debt level increase relativeto income medium-term risks. the high level house price ourlargest city also make difficult low middle income buy ownhome.so turn final page chapter, issue face. but weturn pages, also see improvement number fronts.business conditions, report surveys, high level almost 10 years. thereare also grow sign private investment outside resource sector pick up. wehave wait time. for number years, animal spirit beenmissing, many firm prefer put make decision capital spending. it appearsthat reluctance invest passing. accord june quarter nationalaccounts, private non-mining business investment increase strongly first half 2017, tobe around 10 per cent level start 2016. non-residential build approvalshave increase level recent year large pipeline publicinfrastructure investment complete (graph 4). the decline mine investment alsolargely run course. 4 / 11bis central bankers' speech there also positive news employment front. over past year, number ofpeople job increase 2½ per cent, positive outcome give theworking-age population increase around 1½ per cent year. growth full timeemployment particularly strong. the various forward-looking indicator suggest thatlabour market condition remain positive period immediately ahead.here western australia, also sign improvement adifficult years. the drag decline mine investment diminishing. business arefeeling positive year ago employment rise period ofdecline. at time though, condition house market remain difficult, housingprices rent continue fall perth. weak residential construction also weigh onaggregate demand first half year, although build approval liaison reportspoint stabilisation period ahead (graph 5). 5 / 11bis central bankers' speech for australia whole, recent national account – show healthy increase inoutput 0.8 per cent june quarter – line bank’s expectations. these, andother recent data, consistent reserve bank’s central scenario gdp growthaveraging around 3 per cent mark next couple years. this bite fast ourcurrent estimate trend growth australian economy, expect see gradualdecline unemployment rate. this lead pick-up wage growth, although weexpect gradual process give structural factor work i speak abouton previous occasions. we also expect see gradual increase inflation back towardsthe middle 2 3 per cent medium-term target range.there clearly risk around central scenario. we would like see improvement inbusiness investment consolidate continuation job growth rate least sufficient toabsorb increase australia’s workforce. some pick-up wage growth response thetighter labour market would also welcome development. so area watch.but thing stand, economy look improving.the next chapteri would like lift gaze little turn next chapter economic story. i wouldlike sketch four possible plot lines, acknowledge that, good stories, thereare likely plenty surprise along way.shifts global economya first likely plot line, previous chapters, ongoing shift globaleconomy. here, change technology growth asia likely prominentthemes. 6 / 11bis central bankers' speech in quarter pessimism future prospect global economy. thepessimists cite demographic trends, high debt levels, increase regulatory burden stifleinnovation political issues. they see future low productivity growth modestincreases average live standards.it’s right concern issue pessimist focus on, i optimisticabout ability technological progress propel growth global economy, hasdone past. we still learn take advantage recent advance technology,including advance tool science. in time new industry andmethods production evolve, hard even imagine today. so stillplenty upside. the challenge face make sure benefit technologicalprogress widely shared. how well could major bear next chapter.beyond broad theme, appropriate recognise important leadership role theunited state play global economy. if u economy well, therest world. the unite state long strong supporter open market arules-based international system. it breed grind much progress intechnology. and safe place people invest important source financialcapital countries. it interest unite state continue play thisimportant role. a retreat would make life complicated.another important influence next chapter thing play china. while growth inchina trend lower, share global output produce china continue rise, percapita income converge towards advance economy (graph 6). a thisconvergence take place, structure chinese economy change willchina’s economic relationship australia. export resource continue animportant part relationship, increasingly trade service high value-addedactivities, include food, become important. notwithstanding this, risk thehorizon, chinese economy go difficult adjustments. one theswitch growth model base industrial expansion one base services.another manage increasingly large complex financial system. australia stronginterest china successfully manage challenges. 7 / 11bis central bankers' speech another shift global economy could shape next chapter growth othereconomies asia. development india indonesia bear especially close watching. both ofthese countries, especially india, large populations, per caput income stillquite low. in time, effect economic progress country others regioncould expect substantial effect australian economy, thedevelopment china has.normalisation monetary conditionsa second likely plot line next chapter return normal monetary conditionsglobally. since financial crisis extraordinary period monetaryhistory. interest rate low even negative countries. central bankshave greatly expand balance sheet order buy asset private sector(graph 7). this period monetary expansion draw close. 8 / 11bis central bankers' speech some normalisation monetary condition globally see positive development,although carry risks. it sign economic growth advance economy hasbecome self-sustaining, rather dependent monetary stimulus. it would also liftthe return many saver receive low return interest-bearing assetsfor decade now.on side ledger, period rise interest rate globally have, historically, exposedover-borrowing somewhere global system. investment strategy look sensiblewhen interest rate low tend look good interest rate higher.we take comfort major effort past decade improve resilienceof global financial system. but time, investor increasingly preparedto take risk search yield. many continue expect continuation low rate ofinflation low interest rates, despite quite low unemployment rate number countries.so area worth watching. if high interest rate result surpriseincrease inflation, financial market could difficult adjustment.a rise global interest rate automatic implication u australia.notwithstanding this, increase global interest rate would, time, expect flowthrough us, low interest rate have. our flexible exchange rate though give usconsiderable independence regard time might happen.higher level debtthis bring third plot line: is, deal high level household debt andhigher house prices, especially world normal interest rates.it likely high level household debt change household spend patterns. havingincreased borrowing, household le incline let consumption growth run ahead 9 / 11bis central bankers' speech growth income long. high level debt also mean household spend couldbe quite sensitive increase interest rates, something reserve bank pay closeattention to.to date, household cop reasonably well high debt levels. theaggregate debt-to-income ratio trend higher, ratio interest payment incomeis particularly high, give low level interest rate (graph 8). house loan arrearsremain low, although increase little recently, especially western australia.over recent times, one issue reserve bank focus build-up medium-term risk growth household debt persistently outpace household income. ourconcern that, environment, small shock could turn seriouscorrection household seek repair balance sheets. we work aprathrough council financial regulator address risk. the various measure arehaving positive impact improve resilience household balance sheets.a broaden driver growththe fourth likely plot line broaden driver growth australian economy. howthe next chapter economic history turn depend partly ability lift productivitygrowth across wide range industries. the resource sector will, doubt, continue makean important contribution australian economy, unlikely shape nextchapter economic history current chapter. with another major upswing theterms trade unlikely working-age share population peak thepopulation ages, improve productivity key growth national income.the driver growth changing: increasingly depend ability produce innovative 10 / 11bis central bankers' speech good service rapidly change world. in world, difficult make precisepredictions job growth economy go come thefuture. but seem clear best place take advantage whatever possibilitiesarise business workforce innovative adaptable.australia fortunate natural resource base provide important source ofnational income, remain case. but next chapter need look moredirectly skill worker business drive economic growth. if totake advantage opportunity offer technology growth asia, need aflexible workforce strong skill area problem solving, critical think andcommunication. investment human capital one key success. we also need acompetitive business environment encourage innovation. how well next chapter turnsout depend areas.so, summary theme might expect see next chapter – theimpact technology growth asia; normalisation monetary conditions; theeffects high level household debt; capability workforce business tobe flexible, innovative adaptable.this is, obviously, complete list. there clearly factor could majorinfluence storyline, include geopolitical tension resolve adjust toclimate change. and doubt surprise well.but overall, i remain optimistic next chapter might unfold. while ourchallenges, i talk about, also advantages. we astrong institutional policy framework, skilled, grow diverse population wealthof mineral agricultural resources. we strong link asia, fast grow part ofthe global economy. we also flexible economy demonstrate capacity adjust toa change world.these factor give u confidence future. but can’t rest area number significant risks. the world competitive place global economy iscontinuing go challenge adjustments. if well world, weneed keep invest physical human capital. we also need keep invest inpolicy reform.finally, i say relatively little monetary policy today. this partly areother force likely important shape next chapter australianeconomy. monetary policy important role play support economy goesthrough current period adjustment. it also help stabilise economy hit byfuture shocks. monetary policy make predictable investment climate keepinginflation low stable. have competent, analytical, transparent independent centralbank also source confidence country. but beyond effects, monetarypolicy little influence economy’s potential growth rate.over recent times, reserve bank board seek overly fine-tune things. we haveprovided support allow time economy adjust new circumstances. in itsdecisions, board careful balance benefit provide support therisks come rise household debt. a thing currently stand, look oncourse make progress reduce unemployment move towards midpoint ofthe medium-term inflation target. this would good outcome.thank listen i look forward answer questions. 11 / 11bis central bankers' speech official launch of bank gaborone maun branch keynote speech moses d pelaelo governor, bank botswana september 11, 2017 good morning thank part official open maun branch bank gaborone. today mark yet another important milestone history bank gaborone botswana. last year, march 22, bank open door resident palapye, two year open kang branch (in 2014) kgalagadi north, where, way, date, bank gaborone bank village. it is, therefore, commendable period three years, bank gaborone add three new branches, take total 9 17 automate teller machine (atms). this become even significant consider fact bank gaborone start operation botswana 2006 and, relatively short period 11 years, expand network branches, comparable number to, even, surpass old bank country. the bank also provide electronic bank services, extend coverage footprint. 2 i also recognise that, bank gaborone employ 261 people, mostly batswana, hence, contribute economic social well-being employee families. distinguish guests, i say bank gaborone, demonstrate clear commitment contribution botswana’s financial inclusion agenda. the strategy expand branch network beyond cities, potentially open access bank service great number individual businesses, include small medium scale enterprise and, indeed, informal sector. by doing, bank gaborone add input resource need enhance productivity economic pursuits, community harness profit business opportunities. the extend outreach financial service undertake bank gaborone accord well nation’s financial sector development strategy and, ultimately, contribute aspiration inclusive economic growth. distinguish lady gentlemen, may aware, bank gaborone member capricorn group - financial service group root namibia, offer banking, insurance asset management service 3 botswana, namibia zambia. in botswana, bank’s financial position grow steadily since commencement operations, 2006. total asset increase p268 million june 2007 p4.6 billion june 2017; lend increase p197 million p3.2 billion june 2017; deposit grow p188 million p3.9 billion june 2017. the bank has, therefore, relatively short period, mobilise approximately p4 billion worth financial resources. these resource productively employ distributed, form loan credit facilities, support real economic activity diverse sector across botswana, include consumption spending. a regional bank relatively new, expect bank design product continue well align contemporary domestic market requirements. notably, area around maun, branch bank gaborone invariably expect support various facet business value chain tourism agricultural sector associate region. in way, bank gaborone would contribute sustainable economic activity inclusive growth part botswana. 4 it worth point tourism industry, maun significant player, account 3.9 percent country’s gross domestic product (gdp) 2016, industry hotels, restaurants, travel agents, airline passenger transportation services. the industry contribute 2.6 percent total employment 2016. it therefore expect provision additional enhance financial services, form transactional accounts, save products, credit extension, payment bank service offer bank gaborone, well player course, help sustain contribution tourism sector gdp. in turn, foster economic diversification broad-based private sector development, critical endurable economic growth raise live standard people. to maun resident north west community, general, recognise maun branch bank gaborone business need good durable customer base order profitable sustainable. therefore, encourage use branch and, course, license bank 5 area, save money undertake financial transactions. similarly, expectation bank gaborone take full advantage botswana payment public infrastructure, partnership mobile operator electronic payment systems, enhance financial inclusion; include provide much-needed support informal business botswana general maun, particular. distinguish guests, lady gentlemen, in addition i said, i wish implore maun community engage bank viable borrow proposal sustainable yield positive returns. equally, important, obtain loan credit facilities, borrower honour obligation adhere repayment programme agree banks. distinguish guests, i make point bank botswana concern recent observe upward trend non-performing loans. while trend could be, part, due sluggish global economic activity idiosyncratic business performance environment, evidence lack financial discipline part individual poor management practice businesses. there also undesirable creep culture, part 6 customer banks, fail repay obligation bank accord agree schedule. let me, therefore, take opportunity remind you, distinguish guest that, main, bank botswana fund mainly depositors/savers’ funds. therefore board management bank fiduciary duty responsibility ensure lend credit underwrite standard sound; bank manage safe prudent manner, safeguard depositors’ fund ensure borrow fund lose uncollectable loans. in context, i therefore caution that, borrower default, bank entitle institute lawful, procedural ethical recovery procedure include attachment liquidation property pledge collateral recover money. moreover, provide loss write loan bank’s books, non-bankable asset, extinguish debt customer owe bank. in case, bank prudent adhere sound account international financial report standards. the default customer continue oblige repay. in context, let u always remember safe, sound stable bank system necessary condition sustainable economic development. 7 director ceremonies, distinguish guests, i reliably inform bank gaborone, identify mission statement: “to make bank reward experience stakeholders”, strong customer-focus orientation make good business partner. i also aware customer demonstrate confidence bank’s service delivery vote “best bank customer care”, customer service survey carry kpmg 2013 2016. this commendable trust maun community soon reason validate accolades. in term corporate social responsibility, bank gaborone qualify call good corporate citizen, evidence participation charitable activities, include financial literacy programme, bank educate batswana financial matters. other corporate social responsibility initiative include support youth football development; involvement diabetes apple project journey hope raise breast cancer awareness; sponsor lady khama charitable trust, ub foundation kang primary school. 8 distinguish guests, lady gentlemen, allow comment issue topical interest. first, status liquidity bank system; one key economic function bank manage provide liquidity firm economic entities. a many aware, liquidity maturity transformation essence banking. in regard, bank ensure that, times, adequate funds, include contingency fund sources, meet financial obligations. these obligation typically include customer withdrawal drawdown loan facilities, well capacity accommodate growth profit opportunities, new credit requirement clients. therefore, liquidity critical integral component bank’s operations, strategy governance framework. consistent principal objectives, central bank regulatory authority, namely, “to promote maintain monetary stability, efficient payment mechanism liquidity, solvency proper function soundly base financial system”, bank botswana monitor bank ongoing basis ensure continually meet minimum prudential thresholds, case, liquidity ratios; constraint transmission monetary policy stance. 9 it reason that, bank botswana stand ready inject and/or withdraw liquidity bank system and, also, provide overnight credit facility solvent banks, needed, meet temporary liquidity shortfalls. these form support central bank common across world, central primary objective “fostering monetary, credit financial condition conducive orderly, balance sustainable economic development” country. a regard current status health bank system, i report bank sufficient liquidity, total approximately p19 billion, inclusive bank botswana certificate balance hold abroad, could liquidate case need, minimal capital loss, finance effective viable demand credit. however, note distribution liquidity amongst bank vary time time. distinguish guests, lady gentlemen, second issue relate conduct bank accept foreign currency denominate deposits. consistent international norms, case many jurisdictions, botswana’s bank law permit non-residents open account local banks. i note that, similarly, botswana resident open 10 operate account countries, subject compliance botswana tax applicable laws. however, legal requirement declare cross-border transfers, include cash currency equivalent p10 000 above. in open account accept deposit foreigner (non-resident accounts), local bank compliance botswana laws. bank are, however, require consistently undertake effective due diligence, include strict application know your customer procedure transaction and/or customers. these include obtain customer identity documents, residence status, address, business location source income; do account open ongoing basis. bank also need ensure cross-border cash deposit similar inward transfer support duly complete valid documents, process transactions. it also important indicate bank screen process ensure entity individual international sanction list use botswana bank system conduit illegal activity form financial crime. bank also routinely monitor 11 account suspicious activity file suspicious transaction report (str) financial intelligence agency. while evidence illegality, report trigger appropriate steps, include follow action relevant authorities, bank botswana, non-bank financial institution regulatory authority law enforcement agencies. have say that, i confirm financial intelligence agency bank botswana continue monitor enforce, line respective mandate, local banks' compliance applicable laws, business conduct requirements, well anti-money launder combat finance terrorism protocols. this lead third topical issue, namely, cyber-crime relate financial crimes. distinguish guests, technology future bank many u welcome benefit new information communication technologies, various facet lives, include enhance cost-effective access financial service associate convenience conduct bank transactions. however, much technology increase efficiency bring 12 economic benefits, speed, scale cost fraudulent activity perpetrate channel enormous, ruin life many cause major harm institution society, general. these financial crime take many form include unauthorised cash withdrawal customers’ bank account automate teller machine (atms), identity theft, scan clone bank cards, disruption compromise business processes, internal fraud and, broadly, cyber-crime. if properly mitigated, crime discourage member public entrust save bank could undermine public confidence trust bank system. consequently, need guard, institutions, business individual mitigate cyber-crime form financial crime risks. the national bank week message bank botswana, 2011, articulate issue well follow that; “combating fraud on-going share responsibility interest parties; require involvement bank botswana, bank vigilance member public. vigilance important bank system diversify competition intensify way new entrant market, increase branch network, 13 new products, progressive globalisation bank services”. i trust, closing, presence bank gaborone maun, add value community broad region, expand bank service mutually reward endure bank-customer relationship. mr coetzee, again, you, i would like thank board, management staff bank gaborone, invite part occasion. i wish bank gaborone every success hope continue grow expand service across country. distinguish lady gentlemen, honour privilege declare maun branch bank gaborone officially open. i thank kind attention. 1 5 conference „20 year stability“ governor senad softić, ph.d. welcome speech sarajevo, 22

### timothy lane: how canada's international trade change withthe timesremarks mr timothy lane, deputy governor bank canada, saskatoonregional economic development authority, saskatoon, saskatchewan, 18 september 2017.* * *introductionmy theme today international trade, lifeblood canadian economy.throughout history, successfully rely export imports, particularlyduring vast expansion global trade decade follow second world war, tosupport rise standard living. today, export import represent 65 per cent ofour output, one high ratio among g7 countries.few place canada illustrate importance trade innovation vividly assaskatchewan. historically, people live prairie rely export grain—and, morerecently, potash oil—to market outside canada’s borders. they import many theproducts consume tool used, t-shirt tractors. in first severaldecades confederation, often chafe trade barrier put place protectand nurture growth manufacture industry central canada. what remarkable ishow nimble business province been. they adapt innovate togrow market share also develop new product market them.in recent years, pattern driver trade nationally saskatchewan haveevolved dramatically response force act global level. innovation inmany areas, notably information communication technology (icts) logistics, havegiven rise development new product new way produce trade them. aparticularly important trend emergence global value chain (gvcs), variousstages production locate different countries.in context, progressive low trade barrier worldwide outsized effects.trade agreement enable much close economic integration, trade flow haveburgeoned, lead increase productivity live standards.these trade relationship call question. populist movement ofour major trade partner demand new trade barriers. however, protectionistmeasures would undoubtedly mean le trade, would reduce economic growth. while ican’t comment specific particular agreement, certainly assessingthis shift toward protectionism, might affect outlook growth canada itstrading partner ultimately would mean conduct monetary policy.in presentation today, i’ll review change nature international trade, factors, suchas innovation, propel benefit canada. i’ll discus challenge canadafaces international trade affect economic outlook. i’ll conclude whatthis mean monetary policy.the great unbundlingwe use think great benefit trade accrue country market dominancein specific industries. think switzerland watch france wine. historically, canadaexported abundance—raw material fur, fish timber—and importedmanufactured goods. of course, still case much trade. but biggestincrease world trade recent decade intra-industry—that is, two-way trade within 1 / 10bis central bankers' speech give industry (chart 1). some simply reflect product differentiation: canada export ryewhisky import scotch bourbon. but, even importantly, expansion intra-industry trade enable unbundling different stage production process.consider automobile industry: canada export import auto part different stagesof production well finish product. the potential kind unbundling wasunleashed technological innovations, particularly advance ict, enable logisticsneeded manage supply chain criss-crosses international borders. bank canadaresearch show separation production stage significantly increase theeconomic gain trade.in world gvcs, ease trade restriction also outsized, positive effect theeconomy trade flows. this describe “leveraging” every unit thefinal product—say, every car—incorporates great deal trade intermediate product andany reduction cost impose trade cascade effects. low trade barrier alsomake le expensive firm allocate different stage production country theyare efficiently produced.what benefit canada barrier-free, intra-industry trade within gvcs? within anygiven industry, low trade barrier enable efficient producer expand supply awider market. that low cost move large scale. other, le efficientproducers plant may shrink fail. canada’s experience 1965 auto pact, 1988 free trade agreement unitedstates 1994 north american free trade agreement (nafta) good example theeconomic impact low trade barriers. the north american market open wake ofthe agreement (chart 2). employment manufacture decline short term, butproductivity rise and, long term, number job economy increased. efficientplants able expand scale allow

example, export machinery tothe unite states, efficiency-enhancing input exports.benefits open trade may also come increase competition. this result ofboth open one’s home market import gain access foreign markets.creative destructionmore generally, innovation drive change trade patterns. this economist josephschumpeter’s idea creative destruction. the new replace old. firm invent newproducts may expand export penetrate new markets. they also develop newproduction process enable produce low cost.there many example throughout economy—in high-tech industry well inmany sectors. for example, 45 year ago saskatchewan, pulse lentilsand pea small part province’s farm economy. in 1970s, however,researchers university saskatchewan begin search protein crop tocomplement wheat, suffer oversupply low prices. they saw theopportunities lentil develop new variety suitable climate soil ofsaskatchewan. today, province world’s large exporter green lentil world’ssecond large producer (chart 3). in 2016, export crop generate $2 billion insales.678910 3 / 10bis central bankers' speech innovation production process also drive export growth. historically, amajor part history saskatchewan. new technologies, farm machinery seedvarieties, drive consolidation prairie farm take advantage great ability tocultivate harvest crop large scale. saskatchewan’s farm production exportsexpanded massively, even population steadily declined. that free worker moveinto job opportunity open elsewhere economy, increase productivity andincomes remain (charts 4a b). this story personalconnection me: half great-grandparents farmer prairies, none theirdescendants still farming. 4 / 10bis central bankers' speech i’ve talk innovation drive trade, reverse also true: trade opennessdrives innovation, too. this happen two reasons. first, access foreign market exposesfirms new technology provide incentive invest produce moreefficiently. and second, competition trade encourage firm innovate invent newproducts maintain market share. trade also important channel knowledge spill overacross borders: operation one country become competitive combine homeadvantages best technique develop

clemence.choutet@banque-france.fr). page 1 sur 5 lady gentlemen, it pleasure london today i wish thank invite speak annual financial lunch. the destiny france unite kingdom indeed link long time; existence french chamber commerce great britain, establish 143 year ago, good illustration firm last ties. in regard, i would like express full solidarity series terrorist attack hit london recently. king george vi declare 1940, word still apply day, that: “it wall make city, people live within them. the wall london may battered, spirit londoner stand resolute undismayed.” i believe spirit resilience characteristic londoner need time crisis. we always remain close friend partners, even long – unfortunately – european club brexit completed. today, i first elaborate two challenge continue unite us: need good national economic policies, pro-business long-term oriented; need active multilateralism face global challenges. then, i dwell challenge address together: future relationship brexit. ** i. the need pro-business long-term national economic policy let start challenge national economic policies. in euro area, economic recovery robust broadly-based across country sectors. gdp growth stand least 2.2% 2017 accord ecb forecast. the ecb’s accommodative monetary policy contribute acceleration growth euro area. yet monetary policy cannot game town. structural reform country, along strong european coordination, essence boost potential growth medium term treat fatal disease mass unemployment. in recent years, several european countries, include southern europe, successfully carry in-depth reform yield positive result term growth employment. germany, netherlands nordic countries, well spain portugal, proof economic success, solid single currency, european social model compatible. we run pro-business, long-term oriented, fiscally sound economic policies, keep core element common social model, dna pride europe highly divide world. the social model share eurozone combine high level public service, relatively low level inequality – much low unite state – good intensity social dialogue. call “social market economy” want, without prejudice intense legitimate debate within uk today. page 2 sur 5 in france, growth start pick up, reach 0.6% 0.5% second third quarter 2017 respectively. however, despite strong job creation, unemployment rate still high, 9.4% third quarter 2017. therefore, step reform priority france too, focus two main areas: sustainably consolidate public finances, aim achieve structural economic transformation, major simplification effort labour market, large-scale investment education, vocational train apprenticeships. the new government, mr. macron’s presidency, make decisive step direction. i stress independent central banker. a regard public finances, france still one high public spend level among oecd countries, 56% gdp 2016. the french government commit reduce ratio 3 gdp point within next 5 years. besides, measure take keep public deficit threshold 3% gdp. for first time 10 years, government deficit threshold 2017 (2.9%). needle say, effort pursue future, european commission stress yesterday acknowledge progress france already made. a regard structural transformation, government decide act rapidly pass legislation decree first month mandate. a substantial labour market reform approve last summer already implemented. it provide flexibility firm give social partner room negotiation reduce uncertainty regard contract terminations. moreover, measure announce promote employment reduce labour costs: transformation cice – credit tax competitiveness employment – permanent reduction social contributions, transfer social contribution finance health unemployment insurance flat income tax large base (csg). in addition, measure take reduce tax burden investment; abolition wealth tax financial investments, reduction corporate income tax towards eu average flat tax 30% capital income. by support equity financing, measure hopefully enhance creation development firms, especially innovative smes. fund devote vocational training. a forthcoming reform vocational train apprenticeship expect next year, badly need french economy still experience labour shortage despite high unemployment. these reform significant impact growth employment long term. page 3 sur 5 ii. the need active multilateralism face global challenges. let turn second point: need active multilateralism face global challenges. in current context, international cooperation country maybe important ever. beyond eu’s borders, partners, strive maintain collective rule game order preserve improvement global economic environment. the global recovery indeed gather pace since 2016: accord late imf forecast, global growth stand 3.6% 2017, 3.2% 2016. however, two major risk threaten growth: first, financial instability, continue rise global public private debt since start 2000s – 190% global gdp 2001 230% 2016. the 2008 crisis stem this, trend unfortunately slow since; private debt emerge country (namely corporate debt) rise particularly rapidly. any temptation dilute financial regulation implement wake 2008 crisis would worrying. since g20 summit london pittsburgh 2009, regulatory effort undertake unprecedented, particular bank sector: increase quantity quality bank sector funds, basel iii reform considerably enhance robustness banks; addition, ensure good account take diverse risk bank exposed, thank introduction two new liquidity ratio bank cash levels. but beyond basel iii, finalise measure target non-banks. we must ensure balance finance channels. the priority shift solvency banks, improve substantially, liquidity shadow bank sector, particularly fund asset management company expose risk sudden panic-driven runs. we make sure internationally agree regulatory framework implement everywhere consistency. unilateral deregulation would nothing le lose-lose scenario serious consequence stability global financial system – would pave way next financial crisis – well competitive landscape us, british european banks. a bank england governor financial stability board chair mark carney advocate washington april, need is: “the combination robust international standard great trust consequence transparent implementation intensive supervisory cooperation”. the second risk relate protectionist tendency unite states, election president. we, europeans, shoulder-to-shoulder canada, japan others elsewhere, must resolutely defend international economic relation base page 4 sur 5 commonly respect rule multilateral institutions: deterioration would dampen world trade economic activity. iii. our future relationship brexit. there one obvious challenge nevertheless face together: future relationship brexit. a year half ago, british people choose leave eu and, even regret it, respect democratic decision. now work towards reduce uncertainty negative impact may unite kingdom and, albeit less extent, european union. the banque de france directly involve brexit negotiations; fall within remit government european commission, specifically michel barnier, conduct mission impressive commitment. i sincerely wish achieve constructive agreement. let say loud clear: one seek punish uk way truly hope keep uk close partner. but preserve interest eu, citizens, businesses, member states, mean agreement uk undermine manage achieve europe economic field: one strong asset single market; remove internal border regulatory obstacle free movement goods, capital, services, person european union. for sake consistency, one principle particular stick prepare agreement eu uk: single market, cannot separate access rules. for financial service industry, mean hardly expect obtain european passport accept single market's rules. london remain future global financial centre, architecture european financial system may evolve regard. we cannot foresee outcome negotiation – i hope interest party – actor undertake necessary preparation avoid potential “cliff-edge” risk. london probably continue attract transform save world. in respect, personal note, allow comment i read surprise british newspaper last july: i personally never meet city’s special representative eu, mr browne, banque de france never wish brexit detrimental city london, friendly frequent contact city london corporation. but, besides save rest world, save eu-27 member state increasingly handle within single market, give significant size safety page 5 sur 5 rules. this mean move towards degree “europeanisation” wholesale banks, insurer asset managers. it symmetrically duty europe member country business-friendly attractive financial industry. we achieve low bar common regulations: ssm, eiopa esma duly mobilise prevent certain entity keep resource outside eu set empty shell corporation eu, mere company name plates, benefit passporting rights. we rather attractive offer stable favourable framework investors, include infrastructures, labour skill labour laws, taxes. there fair positive emulation regard. in new environment, paris financial centre obvious advantages, build welcome measure announce july prime minister strengthen paris’ attractiveness. to name few, france big investment bank continental europe, large asset management industry lead private equity investor; french university renowned worldwide excellence finance teaching. and, last least, paris privilege welcome eba. furthermore, euro area keep control risk regard currency, euro, euro-based transactions. some financial market infrastructure locate london, key eu, soon become off-shore eu consequence brexit. this particularly problematic infrastructure could put eu’s financial stability risk, represent 70% daily euro clear business, equivalent around eur 930 billion (gbp 792 billion) trade per dayi. this reason commission propose – support – location policy ccps. clear activity euro, “super-systemic” importance, must locate supervision eurosystem exercise effectively. it matter consistency monetary policy financial stability. ** to conclude, let quote sentence attribute one great british statesmen, benjamin disraeli: “circumstances beyond human control, conduct power.” we indeed go difficult period, put friendship country test. but face together. our objective reach last consistent agreement allow country remain closely link future. i believe common desire interest. thank attention. house lords, report 2016 ; https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201617/ldselect/ldeucom/81/81.pdf william c

economic mobilityin unite state would increase overall post-secondary educational attainment. thereare, however, number important barrier achieve goal.first, many high school student parent appear lack accurate information thereturns obtain college education. new york feed research show evidence ofsystematic underestimation average benefits—and overestimation costs—of collegeeducation, large bias among lower-income non-college households. research bycaroline hoxby sarah turner show among low-income high school students, evenvery high achiever poorly inform academic option available theireffects career opportunities. this research find provision relevant information canlead markedly good outcomes.a second impediment lack preparedness among new college entrants, largenumbers student need remedial course earn college credit. low readinesscontributes persistently low college completion rates, especially among lower-income, part-time, nontraditional students. high dropout rates, turn, contribute substantialreduction net expect realize return college attendance.the third major barrier college attendance completion rise cost collegeeducation. while college education generally good investment, cost attend four-year college rise considerably fast wage last several decades. thismeans college become increasingly unaffordable—which act drag oneconomic mobility growth

broadly financial sector risk management general.please note view i express today necessarily reflect thoseof federal reserve bank new york federal reserve system.misconduct riska primary goal bank regulator supervisor support sustain provision offinancial service household business fair transparent way. in order this,we examine financial institutions, individually collectively. we ass safety soundnessto ensure firm appropriate risk identification risk management process forprudent banking. we hold standard require resilient broad range ofpotential risk credit, market, liquidity, operational risk.one specific risk employee “misconduct risk.” we define potential behavior orbusiness practice illegal, unethical, contrary firm’s state values, policies, andprocedures. the impact employee misconduct extend beyond individual impactthe firm whole, well economy financial market broadly. that is,misconduct risk prudential financial stability implications.for firm, employee misconduct make le resilient divert management attention,by harm firm’s reputation way impede business, drive adverse change inthe composition workforce, deplete capital loss fines. since 2008,1 1 /

addition, time, market participant may lose confidence inthe financial sector whole adversely impact sector’s critical role financialintermediation. in 2016, example, gallup find confidence financial sector hadfallen half previous decade.these incident misconduct introduce friction raise cost financialintermediation, turn, reduce flow productive financial services. these sort ofexternal effect spill firms, consumers, business critical rationalefor official sector intervention relate employee misconduct.in u.s., official sector concern damage inflict employee misconduct date backto bank act 1933. more recently, supervisor traditionally address firm’smanagement misconduct risk assess effectiveness firms’ risk management andinternal control functions, compliance audit. yet, despite regulations, supervisoryfocus, firms’ efforts, significant misconduct risk bad outcome continue. why?what explain persistence?one hypothesis recent problem stream idiosyncratic events, random drawsof “bad apples.” another hypothesis firm operational weaknesses, “badprocesses,” allow outcome occur. i don’t believe, however, either thesehypotheses tell whole story.root cause analysis many recent case misconduct financial sector suggest thatmisconduct product individual bad processes, rather result ofwider organizational breakdowns, enable firm’s culture. from prudential perspectiveand financial stability perspective, misconduct risk threaten core supervisory objective tosustain efficient provision financial service economy. this suggest thatsupervisors obligation promote strong

assessed, ultimately influenced. for example,in organization high level cultural capital, misconduct risk low observedstructures, processes, formal incentives, desire business outcome consistent withthe firm’s state values. the unspoken pattern behavior reinforce alignment. problemsare escalate senior manager routinely, employee feel empower raise handand believe effort result meaningful

themselves? why regulator andsupervisors need get involved?i believe firm ultimately responsible decision observe progress. manylarge financial firm increase attention misconduct risk cultural driver thewake serious fraud enforcement action past several years. but, degree ofcommitment progress effort even across industry serious orpersistent misconduct continue firms.so, wouldn’t firm more? one turn traditional economic theory offer anexplanation firm might underinvest cultural capital. firm may operate level ofcultural capital beneath social optimum even private optimum due differenttypes market failures. today i consider three well-known phenomenon—externalities,principal-agent problems, adverse selection—that may explain misconduct risk persistsand firm might underinvest cultural capital relative might socially optimal.externalitiesexternalities impact one actor other, unrelated actors. externality drivea wedge private socially optimally outcome and, supervisors’ perspective,lead firm underinvest resiliency ignore broad impact bad outcomeson financial sector real economy.in context like environmental policy, externality pollution motivate

opacity intrinsic many financial activity allowsmisconduct persist erode cultural capital firm.8 3 / 5bis central bankers' speech adverse selectionadverse selection occur particularly ill-suited something likely toparticipate. this could complicate factor context conduct-related event changethe composition firm’s workforce. firm relatively low cultural capital (and relativelyhigh tolerance misconduct risk) may attract retain employee client incline totake inappropriate risk push beyond internal limit controls. further, high-qualitydirectors, executives, employee might leave firm decline join them, depletingthe firm’s human capital contribute deterioration cultural capital.role official sectorthese type market failure may explain firm might investenough cultural capital mitigate risks, include misconduct risk. and suggest rolefor official sector encourage resiliency, include investment cultural capital, beyondwhat firm would choose own. that is, firm don’t sufficient incentive toovercome forces, official sector push toward good outcome.in case misconduct risk, supervision seem like particularly appropriate approachbecause hard-to-define evolve nature behavior

successfully stimulate demand return slack resourcesinto productive use. one would expect strong demand generate mark increase ininflationary pressures. yet yet fully materialise euro area, although sign ofinflationary pressure limit lag constant last six month. why thenhave reduce purchase without substantial adjustment inflation?the decision reduce monthly rate purchase rest two factors. the first involvesunderstanding stimulus provide asset purchase evolve time, thesecond relate relationship output inflation.the recession cause global financial crisis sovereign debt crisis

temporary headwind isfading. fear deflation dissipated. in circumstances, unchanged monetary policyparameters would fact imply unwarranted increase monetary stimulus, onelooks 10-year german government bond yield since summer one might conclude that,despite few purchases, ease monetary policy, step correspondto plan.a reason govern council elect scale back monthly purchase that,as size portfolio increases, marginal impact give level purchasesincreases. owe already large bond holdings, free float security nowsubstantially low begin programme 2015. this increase relativeshare purchase market, therefore impact purchase per billioneuro spent. in words, slow pace purchase today equivalent effect onyields high pace yesterday.moreover, stock bond rises, reinvestment need rise tandem toincrease gross purchase – is, net purchase plus reinvestments; inan environment low new borrow euro area countries. this mean that, even witha slow pace net purchases, eurosystem still substantial

explanation put forward byeconomists. in truth, i’m particularly persuade them. i believe suchfactors prevent u achieve mandate medium term. we may take littlelonger achieve objective, achieve will.let focus one explanation – relationship domestic slack inflation,termed phillips curve, become flat change output little effect inflation.prolonged period low inflation reduce wage growth, since wage-setters pay someattention past outturns. moreover, job insecurity, digitalisation high unemployment haveencouraged union prioritise employment wages. and deep downturn lead tobroader slack labour market – i.e. involuntary part-time temporary work – need tobe reabsorb wage pressure rise.yet go transition phase deep crisis, downward forcesshould wane. indeed, difference headline unemployment rate broadermeasures labour market slack already edge past two years. the share offirms say labour shortage limit production high level ever inmanufacturing services. this translate high wage growth now, turncontributing pick-up inflation. various measure underlie inflation, key for1 2 / 5bis central bankers' speech assess durability, appear turn corner.i say “appear”, policymakers humble pronouncements. estimate ofthe degree slack economy vary widely often revised. model outputs, howevercomplex may be, treat due caution, judgement base experienceremains essential part policymaking process. we avoid make unwarrantedstatements point time far future little true visibility.it also mean policy decision base likely outcomepredicted models, also take account balance risks. there timeswhen risk inaction far outstrip risk action, prudent course act withvigour. introduce asset purchase stave risk deflation one recent example. butthere also time balance risk lie opposite direction, prudencedictates policymakers circumspect.future challenge monetary policyon note, i believe force already work due course bring end tothe need asset purchases, matter ecb’s govern council decide theexact time move. our approach evolve tandem improvedexpectations development real economy ensure mandate pricestability fulfil medium term.let instead spend moment consider risk face implement ourpolicy come years. i also add point risk likely grow thelonger asset purchase programme continues.the first risk relate subside deflationary headwind i already mentioned. could itbe current monetary set suddenly accommodative? in short, theuncertainties imprecision involve measure slack inflationary pressure theeconomy, might find behind curve without realise it. hence, longand variable lag monetary policy, end inflation rate consistent withour price stability mandate.this would require sharp correction monetary policy set year come. yet sucha correction interest rate would pose risk financial sector. bank could hit hard asfunding cost rise fast interest income outstanding loans.the second risk relate one, factor could already unwound, inflationcould turn much high expect course 2018. we would find ourselvesbehind curve – realise – optimal monetary policy response would involve ushaving adjust forward guidance.this forward guidance put place stabilise market expectation enhance theeffectiveness asset purchases. this indicate interest rate riseonly “well past” horizon asset purchases. so prolong asset purchasespushes market expectation first rate rise, depress interest rate expectationsacross curve. of course, effectiveness guidance also rely market belief ofour future actions.in effect, forward guidance promise react data outturn future topersuade market maintain low expectation interest rates. but offer guidance thatextends far distance, beyond point form reasonable expectationsabout economy, risk unduly tie hand unless back unanimity thegoverning council.2 3 / 5bis central bankers' speech this particular risk present when, i describe earlier, future increase interestrates need gradual, hence move late could result policy remain loose fortoo long. certainly time come reconsider monetary policy stance courseof 2018, reflect length degree wish pre-commit ourselves.risks monetary policy extend beyond immediate outlook inflation. our policy havereduced spread risk-free interest rate pay household firm borrowing,and unblock flow credit real economy. such spread low ever level.yet reduce spread may encourage investment business profitable lowinterest rates, loan risk turn sour interest rate rise. indeed, bank investorsmay tempt “search yield”, without adequately recompense risk aretaking on. the normal place monetary policy long end yield curve, theshort end.the focus monetary policy course price stability mandate, ensure financialstability risk adequately mitigate role microprudential supervision andmacroprudential policy. while little evidence present area-wide credit-fuelledbubbles, notable localise pockets, commercial real estate, andevidence “search yield” behaviour.the financial crisis show risk interfere smooth operation monetarypolicy effect banks, remain key part monetary transmissionmechanism euro area. we therefore bear mind risk could potentiallycomplicate ability meet price stability mandate future.there longer-term risk monetary policy, namely allocation credit toboth productive unproductive firms. by reduce interest rate firms, monetary policymay indirectly permit inefficient firm remain business – become so-called zombie firms.this blunt productivity-enhancing function downturn bring “creative destruction”,whereby inefficient firm force business, free resource move moreefficient firm boost aggregate productivity. indeed, evidence creativedestruction weak great recession previous downturn thatzombie firm weigh productivity growth euro area countries.productivity growth play important role raise aggregate live standards, alsoaffects conduct monetary policy. high productivity growth spur investment, andexpectations high future income encourage household spend today. thus slowerproductivity growth require monetary policy low interest rate would otherwisebe case stimulate economy. give interest rate currently low, stockof purchase quite large, would restrict ability respond future downward shocks.what i explain economic risk arise potential misallocation betweenproductive unproductive business bring asset purchases. but arealso legal risk ecb regard treaty obligations. article 127 require “act inaccordance principle open market economy … favour efficient allocation ofresources”. thus, respect price stability mandate, much isnecessary, aware potential side effect run expansive policy long.an important principle open market economy price formation market theinteraction private sector agents. it interaction ensure correct pricing,notably credit risk, interaction create asset purchases.it clear that, eurosystem own public private sector asset amount toover €2 trillion, become big player market ever before. this mean thatwe buy bond price-insensitive investors, pension fund and34 4 / 5bis central bankers' speech insurance companies, bid price need pay. liquidity condition areexpected become challenge certain market segment long purchasingprogramme remain active.as such, mindful exert undue influence price formation.another potential complication relate public sector purchases. a key safeguard wehave set purchase operate so-called “blackout periods”, buyaround date new issuance. this facilitate price formation ensure article 123 ofthe treaty fully respect – monetary finance prohibition.mindful self-imposed constraint respect remain space net grosspurchases largely newly issue bonds. this pose potential complication thatwe monitor closely.conclusionlet conclude.the recovery euro area continue robust pace, employment rise strongly. bothwages underlie inflation appear turn corner.at october meeting, govern council choose reduce rate net asset purchases,which, i explain today, prevent unwarranted increase monetary stimulus. wewill continue monitor development economy set policy way consistentwith price stability mandate.in so, must also take account balance risk set policy.if withdraw monetary policy stimulus early fast, asset price could drop andyields rise sharply, negative spill-over effect economy. at time, tobe mindful, asset purchase programme continues, risk attach mayincrease long lasts. nourish market belief exit might permanentlypostponed could exacerbate potential cliff effects. a credible perspective exit need tokeep risk contained.a sense proportion therefore crucial manage

economic activity prices. at monetary policy meet hold october 30 31, 2017, bank japan publish outlook economic activity prices, outlook report. in report, bank present projection japan's economic activity price fiscal 2019. i explain development economic activity price present main content outlook report. a. overseas economy let first touch development overseas economies. the bank's assessment overseas economy continue grow moderate pace whole. in term outlook, advance economy project continue grow steadily, recovery emerge economy likely take hold back steady growth advance economy effect policy measure take emerge economies. a similar view present world economic outlook (weo) release october 2017 international monetary fund (imf). in recent years, imf often revise downward projection global growth, early fiscal 2017, revise upward. look development major region, u.s. economy continue recover, mainly household spending, owe steady improvement employment income situation. a outlook, economy expect continue see firm growth drive domestic private demand. the european economy also continue recover steadily likely follow moderate recovery trend. 2 the chinese economy likely continue broadly follow stable growth path authority conduct fiscal monetary policy timely manner. other emerge economy commodity-exporting economy pick whole, particularly reflect increase exports, past bottom commodity prices, effect economic stimulus measure economies. the growth rate economy likely increase gradually, due mainly spread effect steady growth advance economies. in view, downside risk global economy diminish whole, partly concern financial sector europe abated. in situation, i pay particular attention firm international commodity prices; namely, crude oil prices. while uncertainty regard global economic outlook easing, likely commodity-related fix investment, curtail last years, start increasing. i expect strong possibility global economy continue steady growth fiscal 2018. b. japan's economy price development 1. current situation now i would like discus development economic activity price japan. the bank's assessment japan's economy expand moderately, virtuous cycle income spend operating. in fiscal 2017 date, bank revise economic assessment twice. industrial production increase trend, reflect increase demand home abroad, labor market condition continue tighten steadily. a result, output gap -- capture utilization labor capital -- improve steadily. on domestic demand side, business fix investment moderate increase trend corporate profit business sentiment improving. accord september 2017 tankan (short-term economic survey enterprise japan), business fix investment plan fiscal 2017, especially large enterprises, show firms' solid 3 stance. this evidence by, example, fact fix investment basis close gdp definition saw year-on-year increase 6.9 percent -- level clearly exceed past average 4.9 percent september tankan survey period fiscal 2004-2016. private consumption increase resilience background steady improvement employment income situation, house investment le flat. export increase trend back growth overseas economy i mention earlier. one feature ongoing expansionary phase economy grow across wide range regions, firm sizes, industry comparison past expansions. in late september 2017 tankan, diffusion index business condition small firm reach high level almost 26 years. in regional economic report, many region revise economic assessment upward 2017. indeed, kinki region, include hyogo prefecture, revise assessment two previous report release july october. on price front, year-on-year rate change consumer price index (cpi) item le fresh food range 0.5-1.0 percent. 2. outlook i look outlook japan's economy projection period, cover fiscal 2017 fiscal 2019. the economy likely continue moderate expansion. domestic demand likely follow uptrend back highly accommodative financial condition fiscal spend government's large-scale stimulus measures. export expect continue moderate increase trend along growth overseas economies. reflect outlook, japan's economy likely maintain growth projection period pace potential, mainly fiscal 2018. in fiscal 2019, expect continue expanding, although growth pace project decelerate due cyclical slowdown business fix investment effect consumption tax hike schedule october 2019. look median policy board members' forecast october 2017 outlook report, real gdp growth rate project 1.9 percent fiscal 2017, 1.4 4 percent fiscal 2018, 0.7 percent fiscal 2019. let explain outlook detail major component. first, business fix investment likely continue increase moderately. this because, situation extremely stimulative financial condition maintained, fix investment positively affect (1) improvement corporate profits, (2) materialization effect project conduct fiscal investment loan program, (3) moderate improvement growth expectations. specifically, increase likely see investment, particularly (1) relate 2020 olympic game urban redevelopment projects, (2) aim improve efficiency save labor order deal labor shortage, (3) research development growth areas. private consumption expect follow moderate increase trend, due mainly increase employee income well replacement demand durable goods, house investment expect remain le flat. export likely firm trend time being, underpin it-related good capital goods, japan comparative advantage. thereafter, expect continue moderate increase trend, due mainly improvement overseas economies. industrial production likely continue increase firmly time being, thereafter project continue moderate increase trend. the year-on-year rate change cpi (all item le fresh food) likely increase toward around 2 percent. this because, although upward pressure energy price likely wane gradually, firm likely gradually shift stance toward raise wage price improvement output gap, inflation expectation expect accelerate moderately. in short run, rate increase price food product good relate daily necessity particular expect accelerate gradually moderate increase private consumption, move pas increase labor cost price general services, include dining-out housework-related services, likely prevail. look median policy board members' forecast october 2017 outlook report, year-on-year rate change cpi (all item le fresh food) project 0.8 percent fiscal 2017, 1.4 percent fiscal 2018, -- basis exclude effect schedule consumption tax hike -- 1.8 percent fiscal 2019. 5 i believe follow upside downside risk outlook. risk japan's economic activity development overseas economies, u.s. economic policy geopolitical risks, firms' households' medium- long-term growth expectations, well fiscal sustainability medium long term. risk price development firms' households' medium- long-term inflation expectations, fact item price particularly responsive output gap, well development foreign exchange rate international commodity price go forward. i hold view that, downside risk japan's economic activity limited, price fairly significant. this particularly considerable uncertainty far firm adopt share attitude toward raise prices. ii. the bank's monetary policy next, i talk bank's monetary policy. with view achieve price stability target 2 percent, bank maintain highly accommodative financial condition pursue strong monetary easing. a. quantitative qualitative monetary ease (qqe) yield curve control the framework qqe yield curve control bank adopt consist two major components. the first "inflation-overshooting commitment" bank commit continue expand monetary base year-on-year rate increase observe cpi exceed price stability target 2 percent stay target stable manner. it aim raise inflation expectation demonstrate bank's unwavering determination. i come back point later. the second component "yield curve control," bank control short-term long-term interest rates. in current framework, set short-term policy interest rate target level 10-year japanese government bond (jgb) yield operate targets. at present, guideline market operations, bank set short-term rate minus 0.1 percent target level around 0 percent, conduct jgb purchase 6 achieve target level. b. the aim strong monetary ease since introduction qqe april 2013, basic mechanism monetary ease changed; is, (1) push entire yield curve bank's large-scale purchase jgbs (2) raise inflation expectation bank's strong commitment 2 percent price stability target. these factor lead reduction real interest rates. now, bank think necessary reduce interest rate extremely low levels? the basic mechanism monetary ease consist drive real interest rate interest rate neutral economic activity prices; is, natural rate interest. japan's natural rate interest follow downward trend, mainly reflect deceleration potential growth rate.1 the estimation result obtain bank's staff suggest natural rate interest around 0 percent recently. give estimate rate differ depend methodology employed, regard subject considerable margin error; however, result show rate extremely low level. therefore, order realize accommodative financial condition low level natural rate interest, necessary bring interest rate further. i consider current highly accommodative financial condition -- create yield curve control way -- strongly support japan's economic activity financial side. c. toward change norm price japan's economy suffer deflation 15 years, since late 1990s, year-on-year rate change cpi zero slightly negative. one likely reason take time deflationary mindset dispel japan household firm adaptive deflationary environment. despite strong monetary ease pursue almost five years, 2 percent price stability target achieved. this confirm deflationary mindset 1 such downward trend natural rate interest unique japan, rather global phenomenon. this one element behind fact that, since global financial crisis, interest rate japan, unite states, europe decline low level ever before. 7 persistent initially assumed, although external factor substantial decline crude oil prices. have say that, still necessary pursue strong monetary easing; is, drive real interest rate sufficiently natural rate interest. meanwhile, almost five year pass since bank introduce qqe, i believe positive effect side effect qqe continue warrant careful examination. recently, price increase around world relatively weak, many point factor behind deepen globalization digitalization. a research factor still progress, empirical evidence yet yield conclusive results.2 i consider important fully take account effect change economic structure prices. however, even effect stem globalization digitalization push price advance economy extent, i think price development japan quite different unite state europe. this inflation expectation seem anchor around 2 percent unite state europe, price index show underlie trend around 1.5 percent, despite past experience substantial decline crude oil prices. on point, japan, year-on-year rate change cpi (all item le fresh food) remain range 0.5-1.0 percent -- i mention early -- cpi (less fresh food energy) still range 0.0-0.5 percent. in order achieve 2 percent price stability target japan, necessary (1) deflationary mindset dispelled, (2) perception price good service well wage suppose go every year around 2 percent become firmly entrench society whole -- or, words, 2 percent inflation take hold 2 the well-known argument global approach take account basic determinant inflation one make claudio borio, head monetary economic department bank international settlement (bis). for recent empirical analysis, see following: auer, raphael, claudio borio, andrew filardo. "the globalisation inflation: grow importance global value chains." bi work paper no. 602 (january 2017). https://www.bis.org/publ/work602.pdf. meanwhile, confirmation noticeable, direct influence global slack domestic inflation, accord analysis conduct economist federal reserve board. for details, see following: ihrig, jane, steven b. kamin, deborah lindner, jaime marquez. "some simple test globalization inflation hypothesis." international finance vol. 13, issue 3 (december 2010): 343-375. federal reserve board staff update latter analysis use data early 2017, confirm argument remain valid. 8 norm prices. in regard, essential bank commit conduct monetary policy achieve price stability target, i mention earlier. in meantime, maintain effective communication bank government crucial. furthermore, nationwide change need overall behavior awareness toward prices. of firm raise price product service recently, many do first time two decades, present, firm limit experience term raise prices. moreover, consumer yet accustom environment wage price increase certain pace. thus, change norm indeed mean change various aspect society. financial literacy -- next topic i touch upon -- may seem unrelated economic activity price monetary policy first, i believe fact connection change norm i described. iii. initiative improve financial literacy a. global awareness importance financial education the importance financial education reaffirm worldwide wake global financial crisis. in 2012, organisation economic co-operation development (oecd) develop high-level principle national strategy financial education, endorse g-20 summit los cabos late year. accord oecd, financial education merely dissemination financial knowledge, "the process financial consumers/investors improve understand financial products, concept risk and, information, instruction and/or objective advice, develop skill confidence become aware financial risk opportunities, make inform choices, know go help, take effective action improve financial well-being."3 there widespread progress initiative improve financial education, base principle endorse g-20 leaders. it report number government adopt national strategy financial education increase almost 60. 3 oecd, "recommendation principle good practice financial education awareness" (2005). http://www.oecd.org/finance/financial-education/35108560.pdf. 9 b. importance improve financial literacy japan a part global movement, japan's financial service agency (fsa) central council financial service information (ccfsi) establish committee promotion financial education 2013, strengthen initiative promote financial economic education.4,5 let also mention government's growth strategy, investment future strategy 2017, approve cabinet june 2017. the strategy refer nippon individual save account (nisa), tax-free small-lot investment program introduce 2014. it state that, order promote households' stable formation assets, government disseminate promote nisa system, include introduction january 2018 installment-type nisa, enhance financial investment education lead improve practical knowledge investment among households. i believe crucial improve financial literacy give situation many people feel somewhat uncertain future. moreover, i mention earlier, bank japan aim achieve 2 percent price stability target, society wage price rise stable manner, financial literacy become even important. therefore, i believe promotion financial education japan particularly significant. a number survey financial literacy conduct japan, result reveal many challenges. one survey financial literacy survey conduct 2016 ccfsi. in international comparisons, japan rank 24th 31 country economy term percentage correct answer give common financial questions.6 accord another survey, percentage correct answer give 4 since 1950, effort encourage voluntary proactive savings, aim realize economic autonomy, lead local council save promotion. the central council save promotion establish 1952 focus private organization relate movement. this reorganize central council save information concentrate public relation activity provide accurate knowledge information regard economy, finance, currency. the council rename ccfsi (secretariat: public relation department, bank japan) 2001. 5 a suggest april 2013 report study group financial education fsa, committee promotion financial education (secretariat: ccfsi) establish address challenge face promotion financial economic education. 6 the financial literacy survey japan's first large-scale survey cover 25,000 individual choose proportion japan's demographic structure. the comparison overseas do 10 question mean deflation slightly 20 percent.7 obviously, wonder face many challenge financial education, case education general. my concern, however, possibility sufficient recognition japan necessity financial education first place. for example, survey adult conduct 2016 fsa, 70 percent respondent answer "have participate investment education," two-thirds respondent state "do wish acquire financial investment knowledge." this mean nearly half respondent survey indicate unwillingness. my impression investment, particular, still perceive something wealthy people do.8 while may partly due prolong period deflation, i believe important necessity financial education gain recognition japanese society. i feel increase awareness similar rise public acceptance certain degree increase prices. it seem indicative social norm take grant wage price rise stable manner. term simple average percentage correct answer give six common question oecd survey, conduct 30 country economy 2016. 7 the multiple-choice question asked: "which statement correct time deflation, price continue decline?" there three answer choices: (1) "borrowing profitable value money increases"; (2) "borrowing unprofitable value money increases"; (3) "borrowing unprofitable value money decreases." the survey cover men woman live japan, age 20 69, 1,000 people provide valid response questions. the result publish the nikkei september 2, 2017. 8 accord national survey security investment conduct 2015 japan security dealer association, 30 percent respondent answer security investment "something wealthy people do." the survey conduct 7,000 men woman live japan least 20 year age. mario draghi: ecb press conference - introductory statementintroductory statement mr mario draghi, president european central bank, mr vítorconstâncio,

“whatever takes” lender-of-last-resort capacity, financial market overestimate central banks’ ability fine-tune inflation. since acute crisis abated, euro area inflation low rise slowly. a chart 1

current inflation outlook assess background robust expansion eurozone economy. a chart 2 illustrates, euro area currently enjoy fifth consecutive year gdp growth. since mid-2014 growth also dub “reflationary”, sense quarterly growth read consistently outpace potential growth rates. 2 claudio borio, “through look glass”, omfif city lecture, london, 22 september 2017.

to, 2% medium term. it emphasize ecb’s early day onward, medium term define flexible concept. it depend shock hit economy efficacy monetary policy transmission bring inflation back target. the global financial crisis arguably much deep average shock foresee euro’s inception, financial fragmentation create within euro area severely impede monetary transmission. in context widespread financial imbalances, ecb’s first chief economist, otmar issing, argue “there little sense continue pursue inflation forecast consumer price horizon one two years. in circumstance may instead advisable set interest rate view time frame extend well beyond conventional forecast horizons.”3 concern voice prolong period low inflation could lead de-anchoring inflation expectations. while conceptual relevance argument beyond dispute, challenge issue operationalising monetary policy process. market-based survey-based measure inflation expectation exist, come range caveat often provide conflict signal whether inflation expectation anchor not. moreover, mechanism inflation expectation affect actual price- wage-setting behaviour far understood. i therefore sympathize former feed governor dan tarullo, recently argue “inflation expectation bear awful lot weight monetary policy days, consider range depth unanswered question them”.4 3 otmar issing, “the ecb euro - first five years”, mais lecture city university business school, london, 12 may 2004. 4 daniel tarullo,”monetary policy without work theory inflation”, hutchins center work paper #33, october 2017, “fed reliable theory inflation, say tarullo”, financial times, 4 october 2017. 6 all all, i confident monetary policy measure continue work way transmission mechanism. also current low inflation rate ecb fulfil price stability mandate successfully protect purchase power european citizens. current policy stance so assessment leave term current monetary policy stance? after all, crisis several year behind us, economy enjoy solid expansion, price stability jeopardy, yet many unconventional monetary policy measure still place. liquidity operation still conduct fixed-rate full allotment, significant volume target longer-term refinance operation still outstanding, deposit facility rate still negative territory. but measure attract controversy recent year asset purchase programme (app). a aware, programme extend least september 2018, albeit reduce pace 30bn month. a state introductory statement, “the recalibration asset purchase reflect grow confidence gradual convergence inflation rate towards inflation aim.” although past occasion i sceptical app’s effectiveness respect raise inflation, app contribute four important achievement i would like recall here. first, app ease finance condition across euro area point borrow cost long impediment whatever spend decision. this also mean since monetary policy constraint become de facto non-binding, marginal benefit accommodation negligible. second, financial fragmentation euro area country reduce monetary transmission become much homogeneous across member state case crisis. third, app support strong economic expansion i talk earlier. fourth, perhaps importantly, tail risk 1930s type deflationary spiral averted. in so, programme achieve could reasonably expect it. 7 with deflation risk clearly radar, main rationale employ app therefore cease exist. fear relapse owe alledgedly premature discontinuation net purchase seem rather overdone. the programme simply run course. continue programme sake fine-tune inflation rate precise value below, close to, 2% suggest degree control inflation process least debatable. risk side effect at time, continue monetary expansion free lunch. unconventional policy measure unconventional consequence even professional economist cannot always oversee. a prolong period low interest rates, ample liquidity prominent central bank intervention market give rise potential misallocation credit wide resource toward zombie firms.5 risk premia compress point long reflect assets’ inherent risk characteristics. the dynamic prevent financial market adequately price risk extend period time take economy largely uncharted territory. these financial stability risk also need consider assess monetary stance. while would argue prudential monetary policy address financial stability risks, i tend agree former bank england deputy governor charles bean “important qualification somewhat panglossian view ability maintain price stability financial stability assign monetary policy former macroprudential policy latter.”6 after all, monetary policy set “the universal price leverage”.7 conversely, materialization financial stability risk also become detrimental price stability. 5 viral acharya, tim eisert,

stability risk interact issue procyclicality. the failure traditional phillips curve relation business cycle inflation thus far assert make monetary policy increasingly procyclical. economic growth euro area pass cyclical trough first quarter 2013, core inflation bottom early 2015. yet least september 2018 app add stimulus. not term length, also term magnitude expansion, economy outstanding shape. with real gdp growth hit level 2% year-on-year, monetary policy stance increasingly sync business cycle. chart 3: euro area business cycle monetary policy decision a simple historical

pattern weak elusive character traditional phillips curve relationship cyclical condition inflation. whether merely temporary permanent phenomenon topic ongoing debate. my colleague mark carney, example, recently argue “globalisation accompany weaken relationship domestic slack domestic inflation, correspond strengthen global force domestic prices”9. also euro area, strong recovery labour market yet translate upward pressure wage prices. communication patience therefore need monetary stimulus unfold. the reflate economy ultimately translate increase pressure wage prices. this may however take time. central bank affect price level “long uncertain lags”. consequently cannot over-ambitious try steer price development short run, seek precisely define horizon action.10 a intend reinvest mature security extend period time, financial condition likely remain accommodative long net asset purchase come end. in view above, adjust communication. with medium-term focus mind, need highlight patience confidence measure already taken, time remain realistic measure cannot achieve. we need cater possibility sustain adjustment path inflation (sapi) achieve well net asset purchase come end. fortunately, 8 moreover, data since 1960s show recovery take hold, first policy rate increase typically take place 10 quarter germany 11 quarter us, average. a indicate earlier, current euro

therefore need shift element policy toolkit, forward guidance key policy rates, together ongoing stimulus provide stock asset purchases. conclusion let conclude. our economy midst strong cyclical upswing. far-reaching policy measure contribute cement growth, avert deflation risk, enhance cohesion monetary union. although raise inflation towards aim take long expected, current inflation rate threat price stability. with actual growth exceed potential labour market slack falling, inflationary pressure eventually unfold. at time, long phillips curve fail assert itself, procyclical policy might become, great likelihood financial stability risk build up. patience confidence therefore replace suggestion open-endedness communication. absent deflation risk, full phasing-out net asset purchase september 2018 onwards warranted. preservation exist stimulus sufficient reach inflation objective, albeit medium term may away many u use to. let end relevant word augustus william hare,

contrast tosome topic discuss hamburg summit, g20 member state wereunanimous support objective inclusive growth.so inclusiveness mean respect growth? let’s start break term 1 / 3bis central bankers' speech “inclusive growth” two components: “inclusive” mean share benefit ofgrowth amongst all, “growth” simply state economic term long-termincrease real gdp.thus, talk economic prosperity benefit everyone. put way, itbecomes obvious inclusive growth recent invention rather economic goal thatis common sense. after all, back 1957, ludwig erhard, former german minister foreconomic affair late chancellor, entitle book german social marketeconomy "wohlstand für alle", translate “prosperity all".although invisible hand work market economy lead efficient allocation ofresources, widely accept market mechanism create winner andlosers. while technological change generally lead increase production capacities, itaffects worker different capability different ways.obviously, far-reaching redistribution would hamper incentives. excessive public expenditure— speak generally – excessive redistribution tax system might harm thepotential sustain growth entrepreneur worker become discouraged.on hand, "excessive inequality conducive sustainable growth" either, aschristine lagarde rightly stated. excessive inequality harm growth dampen theprospect significant part population ever participate country’s prosperity.and matter course countries, public sector share individuals’income certain degree impose taxes, majority country imposingprogressive taxes. this enable public sector supply public goods. achieve socialcohesion mean social security transfers, build human capital subsidise education,and promote labour market participation women, long-term unemployed low-skilled worker – thing boost inclusion, growth well.bearing mind, important find right calibration growth policies.the public debate inclusive growth policy often take development economicinequality recent decade start point. rise inequality see major challengearound world. however, perception steadily rise inequality depend strongly indicator used.when look gini coefficient net income, example, commonly usedmeasure inequality, inequality across country decrease last two decades.within countries, however, see mix picture high gini coefficient since 1990s insome advance emerge countries, yet low coefficient countries. of course, gini coefficient look distribution net income tax transfer areonly one many measures. the dispersion gross market income, distribution wealth,the median income poverty rate measure seek quantify economicinequality. further measure describe inter-generational distribution look demographicaspects public debt. all all, uniform answer question inequality hasevolved last decades.3. conclusionnotwithstanding difficulty associate measure inequality meaningfully, policy thatachieve inclusion growth especially seek after. we need ensure

macroeconomic policy management moses d pelaelo governor, bank botswana october 3, 2017 director ceremony i please indeed honour part important information share empower seminar, organise kgori business press club. the initiative forum resonate bank’s desire contribute development inform financial economic journalism mean improve transmission market information, well incisive commentary policy analysis decisions. for number reasons, central bank need continually interact disseminate information stakeholders. such interaction communication clarify bank’s role and, therefore, reinforce effectiveness discharge mandate ensure price stability, sound financial well- 2 function payment system and, broadly, financial stability. director ceremonies, subject remark morning ‘the importance communication macroeconomic policy management.’ for purpose, let distil macroeconomic policy three distinct elements, namely fiscal policy, monetary policy exchange rate policy; convenience add financial sector policy order complete interactive inherent relationship involved. distinguish guests, lady gentlemen, appreciate individually together, policy intend affect behaviour economic agents, is, response term supply demand factor economic activity. at broad level, entail decision invest, save, consume, and/or trade across borders. in regard, relative incentive across sector industry engender various policy instrument impact rate economic growth, words, pace increase national wealth live standards. evidence 2007/08 global financial economic crisis indicate well manage coordinated, macroeconomic financial 3 policy also potential undermine economic growth. at point, distinguish lady gentlemen, let take moment illustrate influence various policy relate instrument real economic activity: start fiscal policy - in situation slow economic growth, fiscal policy might involve increase expenditure reduction tax government stimulate activity. in event, spend government low tax generate increase demand, include consumption, provide incentive business invest increase operation meet high demand; thus make positive contribution economic growth. monetary policy – with regard monetary policy, assume need support growth, reduction interest rate central bank, right level doses, low cost finance, therefore, potentially lead high demand consumer investment businesses, ultimately raise overall rate economic growth. exchange rate policy – a discretionary devaluation maintenance undervalue exchange rate could undertake order enhance competitiveness 4 domestic industry external market imports. this relevant support sustainable industrialisation diversify source growth, may similarly raise overall rate economic growth. financial policy – in area, sound, stable inclusive financial sector facilitate conduct transaction payments, also conduit macroeconomic policy transmit real economic activity. thus, need continuous attention ensure developmental aspects, well integrity, safety, stability well-functioning financial sector support sustainable inclusive economic growth. distinguish guests, i turn role communication ensure ultimate efficacy various policy action decisions. efficacy potency regard would mean policy action desire intend outcome. in example give above, would mean high rate economic growth respect fiscal monetary policy fast pace industrialisation arise exchange rate policy. 5 go back history, time policymaking shroud secrecy, policy framework action design surprise market; language policy maker colour obfuscation ambiguity order generate uncertainty. in particular, mystique surround central banks. the former chairman u federal reserve bank (fed) allan greenspan even say 1987, “since i become central banker, i learn mumble great incoherence. if i seem unduly clear you, must misunderstand i said”. indeed, speech 2014, president european central bank, mario draghi, point time feed would even publish interest rate decisions. at time feed would let outside world derive interest decision market reaction; 1994 feed decide make interest rate decision public real time. no doubt thing change economic policy make involve phrase “forward guidance” real policy tool design enable market public anticipate direction, magnitude time policy action. and regard, manner word communication become crucial. 6 therefore, i argue communication instrument macroeconomic policy, without desire outcome would realise would realise sluggishly. there two relate dimension this. first is, economic policy awareness help public economic agent anticipate policy action; call expectations. second direct relay information policy action intend outcome. in cases, three pillar support effective communication. on one side policy institutions, middle, vibrant knowledgeable media, economically aware, participative responsive market economic agent third pillar. that said, order communication tool effective macroeconomic policy formulation, institution framework policy need sufficient integrity. in turn, integrity derive clarity respect governance, policy setting, operational accountability frameworks, well transparency consistency. regard general awareness understand economic financial matters, need appreciate that, generally, economy characterise business cycle vary length intensity, drive various factors. 7 while, time go details, message i relay various macroeconomic policy program respond cycles. therefore, economic awareness entail understand state economy, current cycle, direction momentum, and, therefore, anticipate policy direction. thus, term macroeconomic indicators, up-cycle normally characterise acceleration economic growth credit demand, increase inflation. in instance, well-informed market public anticipate next set policy would contractionary. the converse true, sustain low fall inflation, depress economic growth credit demand engender expectation expansionary accommodative monetary policies. therefore, environment well-informed expectation trust stabilise capacity potency instrument arsenal authorities, le risk market overreaction path economic indicators. indeed, economic agent might take stabilise policy reinforce decisions. consequently, policy-setting institution build integrity reputation, market economic agent generate belief respond accordingly 8 institution consistently say give circumstances. i illustrate, indeed reinforce, communication evolve respect two area macroeconomic policy formulation botswana. you appreciate, area monetary policy exchange rate policy, ongoing improvement clarity relate institutional setting, policy framework parameters, instrument decision-making cycle dissemination platforms. in view development greatly improve understand efficacy policies. regard monetary policy, bank botswana entrench price stability objective 3 – 6 percent, institutional set-up entail six pre-announced meet year, monetary policy committee ass developments, economic outlook make policy decision. a medium briefing, statement announce policy decision relate background information follow meeting. the annual monetary policy statement mid-term review serve anchor dissemination monetary policy framework, policy analysis guide expectation economic policy outcomes. 9 in regard, awareness policy framework, institutional arrangement decision-making consistency, promote necessary integrity transparency foster efficacy monetary policy. in essence, economic agent able anticipate, well respond policy action. in addition, market align policy stance. we, therefore, view maintenance transparent accountable monetary policy relate communication strategies, contribute sustain attainment inflation objective. the exchange rate policy also much transparent. it clear market fix exchange rate, albeit crawl band arrangement, peg 55 percent sdr 45 percent south african rand. it also know exchange rate continuously adjust use annual rate crawl base difference project inflation trade partner country botswana’s inflation objective; rate crawl public knowledge, typically announce begin year. such transparency remove uncertainty

gentlemen, i delight welcome new conference organise autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de résolution. for first time, morning conference focus bank resolution. this always somewhat paradoxical subject: spend time today, hope never deal future. "si vi pacem, para bellum", roman said... prepare war maintain peace, must fully prepare crisis avoid it. but i would like start note important victory: paris france, welcome european bank authority. it represent achievement highly motivate dynamic team, well threefold recognition, i.e. attractiveness france paris financial centre today; richness financial ecosystem boast one europe's impressive talent pools; lastly, i believe, quality public regulator supervisor – acpr. and european bank authority's decision move london paris clearly bode well post-brexit financial relocations. there good time talk resolution, year, 2017, see adoption first resolution decision management several crisis cases, baptism fire single resolution mechanism. 2 the bank union, major step forward euro area, operational, base single rulebook – already – two pillars: single supervisory mechanism (ssm) since end 2014; single resolution mechanism (srm) since begin 2016. those two pillar supplement third pillar, deposit insurance, need find practical reasonable compromises. but today i would like focus two cross-cutting challenge le often discussed: consistency consolidation. a see, involve resolution. however, goal morning go consider completion bank union whole. i. the first challenge achieve good consistency regulation, supervision resolution, three levels: - first, consistency concrete mechanisms: finalise simplify resolution pillar priority. the case italian bank failure illustrate complex combine resolution regime lay bank recovery resolution directive (brrd) state aid framework orderly liquidation. in addition, confidence single resolution fund (srf) capacity intervene bolstered. the setting-up common backstop, mention european commission’s communication 11 october, promise avenue, could take form credit line grant esm (the european stability mechanism). if place within esm's remit, rule trigger backstop could introduce esm governance review. furthermore, avenue could provide partial response issue liquidity newly resolve entity – mainly “good banks” –, yet address sufficient clarity: liquidity support public sources, beyond legitimately expect eurosystem, clarified. - second, consistency legal framework requirements: face accumulation new “separate” requirements, need adopt holistic consistent approach order avoid prudential overload. in particular, total loss absorb capacity (tlac) requirement result new international framework require consistent adaptation european minimum requirement fund eligible liability (mrel). therefore, mrel target set basis update prudential requirement – pillar ii buff – up-to-date financial position bank concerned. it question consistency. in vein, consequence basel iii reform package – finalise – carefully 3 take account, may lead increase risk-weighted assets, could turn impact mrel. all regulatory developments, combine change pillar ii capital requirement amounts, could lead over-calibration: individual decision may warranted; somewhat disorderly accumulation not. and naturally, set requirements, must jeopardise level play field euro area bank international competitors. - third, consistency interaction authorities, improved: case banco popular spain, although resolve satisfactorily, also demonstrate importance swift close cooperation supervisory resolution authorities, european national levels. there deny still need good coordinate role different european authority – ssm ecb, srm, commission, european bank authority – order clearly establish “pilot plane” crisis management. we still need define role order decompartmentalise different pillar guarantee continuum, vital smooth run operations. but must give unequivocal support authority performance duties: ssm, chair danièle nouy, ecb propose standard provision new non-performing loans, operate fully within remit prevent future crisis ensure convergence within euro area heart bank union. we see precise outcome present dialogue be, already i would like say i find resistance show bank generally, even so, controversy arise italy particular, inappropriate unfounded. for non-performing loans, plan ahead stop pick piece afterwards. if ever need proof necessity independent european supervision, controversy provide it. ii. the second challenge encourage consolidation within bank union consolidation must result consistency, consistency consider bank union unique jurisdiction. - we must therefore stop hind cross-border bank consolidation euro area. 4 we need ensure implementation new regulation give rise new barriers. the development cross-border bank activity essential reinforce single market, facilitate allocation save finance investment. we still lag far behind american market respect: market share unite state top five bank 40% whereas market share euro area top five bank le 20%. sound safe cross-border consolidation would make bank good able diversify risk across euro area, channel save effectively towards productive investment. this i call "financing union investment innovation", notably shore equity, key innovation economy. the aim crystal clear: within monetary bank union, cross-border merger must difficult cumbersome “domestic” merger. several lever must pull obstacle activity removed. from supervisory point view, involve promote consolidate approach grant waiver liquidity capital allow flexible capital allocation limit ring-fencing. from resolution point view, internal mrel requirement tool facilitate resolution institutions, would become meaningless calculate national basis. they must calculate level bank union, consider unique jurisdiction. indeed, compartmentalise internal mrel within national border would obstacle single market european bank cross-border mergers. a first concrete step, i suggest european bank authority publish comprehensive stock-take regulatory supervisory obstacle cross-border activity mergers. *** conclusion: bank must prepare extreme situation because: - there thing zero risk, despite improvement prudential regulation reinforcement banks' financial capacity. - the failure single participant, even one consider secondary, systemic effects, even large group long immune. since 2011 end "too-big-to-fail" doctrine, group become increasingly aware this, draw recovery plan work closely authority ready crisis situations. the role play authority continue effort crucial. accordingly, acpr france, ecb srb bank union level, guide support efforts, also prepare failure scenarios. 5 to end, 2015, acpr provide decisive boost lead draft first resolution plan france's lead institutions. today, institution authority single resolution board resolution plan place. a institution direct responsibility acpr, first wave plan complete plan finalise 142 institution concern end 2018. these combine effort pre-empt manage crisis situation must therefore maintain order ensure continuity bank operation essential function economy, avoid harm financial stability, protect resource member state strengthen protection depositor investors. page 1 12 an address daniel mminele, deputy governor south african reserve bank, sixth bank america merrill lynch annual summer macro investor conference johannesburg 24 november 2017 macroeconomic policy financial risk – from 2017 2018 introduction lady gentlemen, good morning. thank invitation deliver keynote address sixth bank america merrill lynch annual summer macro investor conference. the end year upon us. no late yesterday south african reserve bank (sarb) conclude last monetary policy committee (mpc) meet year. it around time many analyst forecaster publish respective outlook year ahead, complete „baseline scenarios‟ list major risk thereto. but extent risk differ u flag big threat 12 month ago? doe way economic agent policymakers respond threat hold lesson future? or face many uncertainty last year? a american author david levithan said: “the mistake think antidote uncertainty.” we strive achieve best circumstances. page 2 12 in try tackle question i posed, i look back global risk official private forecaster highlight turn 2017, try gauge extent risk materialised, all. i also consider whether new risk emerge approach start 2018, may deserve attention year ahead. i zoom south africa‟s situation, analyse much global environment influence domestic development past year and, equally, new global uncertainty may combine local issue influence monetary policy come year. at end, i also briefly touch yesterday‟s monetary policy decision, assume however, would see statement. what investor fear early 2017 there general feel economic optimism, albeit prudent one, start 2017. for example, world economic outlook update publish january, international monetary fund (imf) write „in [the] advance economies, modest uneven recovery [was] expect continue, gradual narrow output gaps‟. yet, document, imf also warn risk global outlook remain „tilted downside‟ relate „ongoing adjustment global economy‟. fear disorderly adjustment indeed numerous, include us1 – major country recover relatively fast global financial crisis even though epicentre. indeed, imbalance create global crisis heal early jurisdictions, u also first advance economy raise interest rate zero-lower bound. this process initially gradual. however, u federal reserve system (fed) signal likely acceleration pace interest-rate increase (and would embark process reduce balance sheet) become increasingly confident meet medium-term growth inflation goals. in light early key influence low u interest rate exert boost risk appetite compress term premium global financial markets, investor become concern reversal early favourable market developments. 1 unite state page 3 12 the election new u administration november 2016, pledge large-scale tax cut „america first‟ approach external trade, compound market fear disruptive rise u interest rate appreciation dollar. in fact, many observer view 2016 presidential election result u one many example – albeit key one – depict general shift voter advance economy towards populist politics policies, include rejection several key tenet wave globalisation past decades. the grow hostility towards tenet – include free trade, free capital flows, easy cross-border movement labour – see strong continental europe. with key election schedule throughout 2017, least france germany, observer fear move towards populism potential torpedo already delay eurozone economic recovery. at time, end eurasian continent, economic observer note stabilization chinese economy capital markets, yet doubt whether pattern would durable light continue growth imbalance seem involve, least ongoing build-up corporate debt, especially state-owned enterprises. in turn, investor fear china would continue suffer capital outflows, might force authority allow kind depreciation yuan exchange rate prompt tighten global financial condition late 2015 early 2016. concern sustainability economic stabilization china also raise worry price many commodity (in particular metal minerals) could experience renew sell-off view china‟s key role shape demand commodities. furthermore, last month 2016 saw jump crude oil price key producers, inside outside opec2, somewhat surprisingly agree freeze production levels. a market adjust new supply-demand equilibrium, possibility rise oil price time commodity price could back foot pose risk economic recovery advance economy oil-importing emerge economies. 2 organization petroleum export country page 4 12 the global backdrop prove benign 2017 however, look back development year, thankful risk i list materialise. in us, policy normalization continue largely like feed anticipate start year. the fomc3 raise federal fund target rate 25 basis point march june meetings, market largely anticipate third hike december, would bring fund target rate 1.25-1.50%, line median forecast fomc participant start 2017. separately, feed begin gradual unwind balance sheet october. yet step trigger yield-curve steepen sell-off risky asset many feared. in fact, 17 november, 10-year u treasury yield stand 2.36, 8 basis point low begin year. the yield curve thus flattened. at time, u corporate credit spreads, investment-grade high-yield, low start 2017, s&p 500 equity index rally 15% period. several factor contribute solid market performance. on macroeconomic front, real economic activity u continue expand solid pace, price wage inflation keep undershoot official private forecasts. indication price may become structurally le responsive erosion economic slack, well perception potential u gdp4 may slow time, lead fomc low medium-term projection equilibrium federal fund rate, even monetary accommodation withdrawn.5 at time, expectation quick sizable fiscal stimulus us, could justification fast pace monetary tightening, gradually fade throughout 2017. the economic recovery eurozone continue display strong momentum expect start year. consensus forecast gdp growth 3 federal open market committee 4 gross domestic product 5 a december 2016 fomc meeting, median projection medium-term federal fund rate 3.0%; decline 2.75% september 2017 meeting. page 5 12 2017 2018, stand 1.3% 1.6% respectively begin year, since revise upwards 0.9 0.2 percentage point respectively. but so-called „populist risk‟ disappeared. while anti-mainstream candidate cause major upset election france netherlands, result still generally confirm significant portion electorate choose candidate openly critical globalisation policy consensus prevail past decades. nonetheless, political background prevent rise business consumer confidence region. if anything, current confidence read eurozone stand well average past decade increase broad-based across countries. the chinese economy also perform somewhat good year analyst anticipated. while degree policy tightening, mostly strict regulation, weigh certain component domestic demand, chinese export benefit improve global regional trade environment. at time, authorities‟ tight regulatory stance appear succeed curb specific component private-sector finance (specifically fund shadow-banking institutions) keep bank loan growth relatively stable thus avoid broad-based credit slowdown. finally, pressure china‟s capital account continue moderate, allow official foreign-exchange reserve edge loss previous years. with respect oil market, opec member appear largely comply late-2016 deal limit output, although agreement „game changer‟ observer feared, part u shale industry‟s ability quickly ramp production oil price exceed break-even point. admittedly, oil price post significant gain latter part year, rise low us$44 per barrel mid-june us$63 per barrel 23 november. yet move seem reflection strong demand (as global economic growth exceed expectations) supply constraint could endanger economic recovery. overall, consider many risk fear early 2017 materialise fact „push pull‟ factor remain favourable, year saw page 6 12 renew solid net non-resident capital inflow emerge markets, include south africa. in october report, institute international finance (iif) project flow would rise us$1.1 trillion year, 4% emerging-market gdp – meaningfully high low 1.5% 2015 although still far pre-crisis peak 9% 2007. the bulk improvement would reflect debt portfolio banking-related flows. indeed, iif estimate first 10 month 2017, former total us$162 billion versus us$37 billion whole 2016. what worry 2018? of course, fact major risk materialise 2017 breed complacency come year, even though official private forecaster broadly agree continuation broad-based, relatively inflation-free economic expansion region world 2018. history teach u often observer concur low probability negative scenario unfold. the trigger next downturn may well event forecaster see risk right now. nevertheless, economic downturn – beyond immediate trigger – always deep underlie causes. let list underlie trend could source fragility world‟s economy. first, considerable uncertainty remain long-term impact large-scale monetary stimulus put place major central bank since global financial crisis well (more short-term) implication gradual unwinding. while degree global monetary stimulus far surprisingly little impact inflation, debate remain open whether pattern continue output gap fully close legacy issue crisis (for instance bank sector) finally resolved. equally, analyst debate whether even gradual unwind central banks‟ balance sheet trigger quick decompression term risk premium across major financial assets. because size balance sheet (relative world gdp) unprecedented, guidance economic history limited. page 7 12 second, recent cyclical improvement global gdp growth may mask persistent issue around low trend gain productivity which, unresolved, could result economic agent financial market participant over-optimistic future economic activity. in large economies, average labour productivity total factor productivity slow past decade – trend which, least advance economies, predate global financial crisis. the exact cause „secular stagnation‟ yet fully understood, economist disagree long may last. a yet, limit sign trend reversing. third, despite effort deleveraging sector countries, global debt, share gdp, remain high global financial crisis. data bank international settlement show that, first quarter 2017, total credit non-financial sector (in report countries) stand 219% gdp compare 185% end 2008.6 while credit household stabilise relative gdp, finance extend general government non-financial corporation steadily increased. if unchecked, rise trend potential trigger phase financial instability future, weigh growth undermine financial assets. in fact, many case market valuation asset already appear elevate relative long-run norms, increase vulnerability potential repricing risk. and valuation may inconsistent across different category – equity risk premium bond yields, example, relatively large – preclude situation asset category sell together. the catalyst sell-off need economic one. geopolitical tension region diverse middle east, korean peninsula, south china sea indicate world necessarily safe place previous decades. the global backdrop south african economy let turn influence global backdrop had, likely have, south african economy. 6 these statistic use credit data market value, convert ppp-adjusted exchange rates. page 8 12 a i mention above: relatively benign global environment, couple failure key risk materialise, support continue inflow capital towards emerge market 2017 – south africa exception. iif statistic show that, first 10 month year, net non-resident purchase south african debt instrument total us$4.9 billion, us$1.9 billion whole last year. such inflows, last couple months, help country‟s financial asset weather unfavourable domestic growth development well political policy uncertainty without major, lasting, consequences. for example, early january end august 2017, rand‟s trade-weighted exchange rate depreciate 2.5% yield benchmark r186 government bond decline 35 basis points. in addition global factors, downside surprise domestic inflation figure first half year well reduce deficit current account contribute resilience domestic fixed-income assets. yet, south africa‟s domestic problem prevent country fully benefit benign global backdrop historical experience international comparison would suggest. in fact, global risk see start 2017 materialise, several domestic risk become reality, especially late year. this illustrate depreciation 6.3% nominal effective exchange rate rand rise 53 basis point benchmark r186 government bond yield end august end october 2017. real economic growth fail display meaningful acceleration poor performance 2016, despite rebound agricultural production follow previous year‟s drought. at present, sarb forecast average growth 0.7% 2017, mere 0.3% last year. hence, gap south african gdp growth world gdp growth, minimal 2013, continue widen. disappoint economic growth, together surprisingly low buoyancy major tax revenue relative bases, compound fragility south africa‟s fiscal situation. page 9 12 for several year already, project fiscal consolidation debt stabilization postpone gdp growth shortfall relative budget projections. however, medium term budget policy statement october 2017 saw meaningful upward revision deficit estimate current year, also project reduction deficit out years. consequently, debt-to-gdp ratio project keep rise throughout period, approach 60% 2020/21. this mixture weak growth rise debt – two concern repeatedly flag rat agency – suggest south africa must increasingly wary possible downgrade sovereign ratings. follow announcement fitch rat yesterday affirm south africa‟s bb+ rat (which case apply local foreign currency debt), announcement make late today s&p moody‟s outcome rat review recently undertake them. while exhibit uncertainty generate volatility, recent behaviour financial market clearly highlight risk. admittedly, i indicate earlier, global economic financial backdrop shelter south african asset year. yet underperform relative emerging-market peers. for example, first nine month 2017, j p morgan emerging-market foreign-exchange index appreciate 5.6% rand gain 1.3% u dollar. such underperformance already warn sign relative unattractiveness south african assets, generally, period improve global risk appetite, rand domestic bond tend outperform peers. in recent weeks, particular since upward revision deficit debt projection medium term budget policy statement, sell-off local currency domestic bond much clear indication investors‟ nervousness south africa‟s rise economic fiscal risk draw curtain 2017 move towards 2018. recent monetary policy development the sarb cannot ignore recent shift balance risk affect south africa‟s economy way perceive financial markets. obviously, page 10 12 central bank target exchange rate level bond yields, mandate keep inflation within 3-6% target range. nonetheless, market development important input policy formulation – fairly directly exchange rate (which impact inflation lag) indirectly level bond yield (which reflect investors‟ perceive risk inflation outlook expect monetary policy respond consequence). in july meeting, mpc sarb low repurchase rate 25 basis points, reaction sequence better-than-expected inflation data strong likelihood inflation would remain comfortably within target range forecast period. in fact, sarb‟s projection headline core inflation 2018/19 revise downwards several instance first half year. nonetheless, mpc guard expectation rate reduction would mark start ease cycle warn future move would remain data-dependent. this reflect high degree uncertainty future inflation profile; decision also inform mpc‟s continue discomfort broad measure inflation expectation remain uncomfortably close upper end target range. by september meeting, mpc view balance risk inflation tilt upside warrant cautious approach, thus decide leave policy rate unchanged. at conclusion mpc meet yesterday, decide leave repurchase rate unchanged 6.75 per annum. our decision err side caution september meet appear correct, upside risk inflation outlook increase last two months. the bank‟s inflation forecast show deterioration, inflation expect 0.2 percentage point high 2018 2019, level 5.2 5.5 per cent, respectively. these revision mainly influence weak exchange rate path, high international oil prices, high average wage growth. inflation expect remain within target range forecast period. yet „baseline scenario‟ tell part story. although inflation expect breach upper end target range forecast horizon, page 11 12 indicated, risk outlook currently assess skew upside, time imminent key event risk contribute environment heighten uncertainty. in light grow fiscal risk increase domestic financial market volatility, mpc cognisant possibility inflation outlook could deteriorate further. the mpc also weigh risk i outline earlier, include possibility global environment could turn le favourable, which, current circumstances, could exacerbate downward pressure domestic financial assets. at end day, mpc well aware current weakness economic growth, continue downside risks, will, wherever possible within mandate, strive support improvement economic activity appropriate monetary stance. however, environment characterise elevate uncertainty, inflation expectation could become unanchored, best approach sarb minimise number threat price financial stability. consequently, mpc continue closely monitor global domestic development well implication inflation outlook, act accordingly. conclusion while acknowledge five week long time economy markets, i think reasonably safely already draw conclusion global backdrop 2017 prove benign many anticipated. for first time many years, outlook finally look promising, global growth gather momentum, without yet generate much inflation. financial market generally perform well. south africa face particularly challenge domestic environment, affect growth performance, mainly low business consumer confidence. we fail fully take advantage global cyclical upswing. the inflation outlook improve year, inflation expect inside target range forecast horizon. but recently upside risk inflation outlook intensifying, require careful monitoring. page 12 12 a niels bohr said: “prediction difficult, especially it‟s future”. we know 2018 store us, global risk profile unfold. the relatively benign global backdrop 2017, make u complacent, rather encourage u take advantage current cyclical economic upswing strengthen structural reform implement growth-friendly policy need boost economic growth create employment. in south africa, 2018 provide opportunity press “reset button” and, collaborative approach, try break self-reinforcing negative feedback loop policy uncertainties, low private-sector confidence, subdue investment productive capacities, poor competitive performance. thank you. jens weidmann: monetary union – ever work progress? theeuro area tear maastricht framework fiscal unionspeech dr jens

gather economists, thereis one point must forget discuss monetary union: namely eurowas also political project outset. a early 1949, french economist jacquesrueff declare money would pave way european integration. in words:“europe either build money won’t build all."the unification europe second world war political vision intend bringlasting peace stability continent. to put word jean monnet, greateuropean winner charlemagne prize, whose name chair, mr köster, alsobears: “by create europe, european build true foundation peace."yet integration europe’s economy major catalyst

crash down.that didn’t happen – would disaster had. at time, let’s honest123 2 / 9bis central bankers' speech – future might also hold regional sectoral crisis store put euro area thetest. the upbeat economic situation right shouldn’t blind u fact one outcomeof accommodative monetary policy.the low-interest-rate environment, then, contribute air deceptive calm mighttempt economic fiscal policy decision-makers sit back nothing. but crisis doesmaterialise, european house live today need sufficiently strong withstandthese headwinds. there still much do, make reality.4. ensure long-term stability monetary unionone define characteristic european monetary union that, common monetarypolicy, also encompass 19 largely independent national fiscal economic policies. this,incidentally, make european monetary union unlike federal currency areas, suchas unite state switzerland.this particular composition make european monetary union unique, alsopotentially make vulnerable. a crisis make clear, euro area whole ultimately hadno option cushion unsound development individual member state order preventthe stability entire monetary union jeopardised.the underlie context that, careful, membership monetary unionundermines incentive exercise fiscal prudence. this consequence ofexcessive debt one member state can, extent, pass rest group.mr kösters, alone flag incentive run debt inherent monetaryunion early on. when country monetary union take debt, interest rate notrise quite sharply would country currency. instead, however, theinterest rate member state rise slightly.economic theory call phenomenon “common pool problem", overfishing oftenused example explain it. a single fisherman catch many fish leaf fewerbehind others ultimately jeopardise long-term sustainability fish stocks.overfishing, then, detrimental fish community. but, individual fisherman, ishighly desirable net many fish possible consider interest futuregenerations fishermen.this arguably one reason historian winner 2017 charlemagne prize timothygarton ash describe story monetary union far “crisis foretold".yet remark really entirely fair found father monetary union, mostcertainly eye particular incentive run debt. their idea acombination market discipline fiscal rule would keep budgetary policymaking soundbasis. a know, maastricht treaty contain no-bailout clause prohibit member state fromassuming other’s debts. the treaty also ban monetary finance government debt bythe eurosystem. together, safeguard aim ensure investor – notother party taxpayer – bear risk invest government bonds.in addition, stability growth pact include rule restrict government debt budgetdeficits. these aim ensure public finance remain sustainable path, butalso create buff need allow budget fluctuate economic cycle toenable member state take countermeasure economic crisis without force tocall external aid fend loom overindebtedness.4 3 / 9bis central bankers' speech these rule form principle national fiscal responsibility. this foundation themaastricht framework.walter eucken, founder freiburg school pioneer social market economy,summed liability principle follows: “whoever reap benefit must also bear theliability."and go economy go country well: decision ever takenresponsibly decide also bear responsibility consequence actions.thus, maastricht treaty largely assign power act liability matter economicand fiscal policy member states.and yet, government debt euro area country rise significantly. one reason forthis repeat breach budgetary rule – even germany, incidentally, verybeginning monetary union. capital markets, contrary initial expectations, also punishthese infraction impose high risk premiums. the no-bailout clause, seemed, lackedcredibility.but another reason balloon debt level undoubtedly financial crisis, whichforced euro area country shore bank systems. this another reason whydoubts emerge sustainability member states’ debt subsequentsovereign debt crisis. rescue measure swiftly roll prevent crisis fromescalating.this episode show might wise euro area, too, lender last resort tosupport country face exceptional circumstance order limit negative fallout thecurrency area whole.hence establishment permanent safety net form european stabilitymechanism (esm). it financial assistance allow distress sovereign bridge temporaryliquidity bottleneck put government finance back sustainable footing. this whycountries require commit reform put finance back order assoon possible.however, even financial assistance programme make monetary union crisis-resistant good. for benefits, add element mutual liability andsoftened principle independent accountability. at time, economic fiscal policyremained national matter. the balance action liability consequences,then, get kilter.the euro area ever make crisis-proof balance actionand liability restored. there two way achieved. either deeperintegration, ie situation every member state surrender decision-making power infiscal economic policy matter european level, return overhauledmaastricht framework. in latter case, euro area country would bear greaterliability decisions.the first solution road fiscal union centralise decision-making powers. admittedly,fiscal union would guarantee fiscal prudence, permanent guide rail would need beadded matter stability policy, though could curb aforementioned propensity rundeficits.this obvious many economists, even monetary union launched, that,in long term, monetary union must go hand hand political union. one thoseeconomists you, mr kösters. in 1994, wrote: “it first clear long5 4 / 9bis central bankers' speech run emu exist accompany european political union." german chancellorhelmut kohl hold similar view. address bundestag november 1991, remark that“the idea sustain economic monetary union time without political union afallacy".true political union prove unfeasible back then, however. it seem much haschanged regard, least necessary transfer sovereign right wouldrequire comprehensive change eu treaty national constitutions.that would suggest option number two currently stand realistic chance restoringthe balance action liability. it essentially mean bolster principle ofindependent national responsibility. only public finance put sound foot andcountries stop drift apart economically eurosystem ultimately relieve thepressure constantly intervene firefighter. and financial market theirjob take adequate account risk lend activities.but would change monetary union’s regulatory framework function good thanit do past?to paraphrase johann wolfgang von goethe: “easier say done.” goethe apoet, also finance minister duchy saxe-weimar-eisenach. whether bonmot sum experience fiscal policy unclear, however.in case, remark hold true fiscal rule euro area: establish bestintentions, rarely adhere consistently. the european union’s budgetary debt ruleshave reform again. but make stricter, put mildly. ihave already mention even germany set shin example early days.the late reform stability growth pact originally set strengthen bind forceof rule debt. a turn out, reform create considerable discretionary scope,mainly european commission. we also draw attention june monthlyreport. the commission already exploit leeway several occasion invariablyinterpreted rule liberally so.the commission’s dual role guardian eu treaty one hand politicalinstitution undoubtedly factor repeat compromise make expenseof budgetary discipline. after all, political institution, commission must always strive tostrike balance various political interest member states. the outcome isthat individual euro area country breach budgetary rule ever since financialcrisis erupted.austrian comic werner schneyder accurately characterise situation follows:europe, quipped, make country want tell havedecided themselves.4.1 reinforce bind effect fiscal ruleswhat need reinforce bind effect fiscal rule straightforward andtransparent design implementation rules. an independent institution take overresponsibility fiscal surveillance commission would key step towards lesspolitical approach. that would clear marker unbiased analysis end politicalconcessions begin. that one bundesbank’s suggestion strengthen role ofthe esm matter fiscal surveillance.one thing seem obvious me, however. if member state retain fiscal autonomy, thesustainability public finance cannot safeguard rule alone.56 5 / 9bis central bankers' speech this bind force rule need strengthen; also needthe discipline effect market, found father envisage monetaryunion. in words, interest rate level align strongly risk ingovernment budgets.that achieved, however, credibility no-bail-out clause maastrichttreaty restored. investor need illusion risk lose money theybuy bond government unsound public finances.this another reason i take critical stance eurosystem’s government bondpurchases, weaken market mechanism price sovereign solvency risk.this end blur boundary monetary policy fiscal policy. and yet cleardivision responsibility vital stability-oriented monetary policy euro area ifeurosystem central bank wind dance tune fiscal policymakers. this iswhy i call quick end government bond purchase end october.4.2 automatic esm maturity extensionand also one proposal put forward bundesbank envisage change thecontractual term government bond euro area. in future, maturity country’sbonds ought automatically extend soon country apply financialassistance.under exist procedure, remember, large part assistance loan go towards payingoff legacy creditors. this let legacy creditors, banks, hook – theexpense taxpayers. extend maturities, hand, would leave hook,and could still hold liable debt restructure line. in emergency, bevery difficult tell certain whether debtor temporarily illiquid actually insolvent. anautomatic extension maturities, however, would grant esm far time give carefulconsideration question debt sustainability – without release legacy creditor fromliability period.a maturity extension would add advantage substantially reduce need forfinancial aid esm programme. this would also broaden reach exist rescuemechanism. have already able automatically extend maturity three year back in2011, say, portugal would need around €43 billion 2014 instead total €76billion receive financial assistance.i also convince come resolve future crisis euro area, imf willarguably play far le prominent role could, most, involve advisory capacity.so increase clout would certainly helpful.incidentally, esm stand substantial form fiscal solidarity. esm chief klaus reglinghas say esm loan cost two-thirds le imf loan esm – unlike theimf – charge risk mark-up loans. in case greece, instance, savingcomes 5.6% p.a. gdp.this major transfer government need assistance. but permanenttransfers tie strict conditionality order eliminate much moral hazard aspossible. permanent direct transfer necessary function currency area, theunited state demonstrates. quite opposite, fact: divide agent transfer providersand transfer recipient risk undermine public acceptance monetary union individualmember countries.ladies gentlemen, propose automatic extension maturity boost thedisciplinary role capital market restructure sovereign debt really realistic option. but 6 / 9bis central bankers' speech ever case financial system really absorb haircut, ahaircut bring financial system knees, community state would still anincentive bail private creditors.politicians supervisory authority euro area have, one occasion, facedthe follow paradoxical situation: haircut overindebted country drag bankingsystem it. but bank carry government bond risk default book areresolved, necessary rescue measure plunge country financial distress andfor all.this remind little novel catch-22 joseph heller, “catch-22” anintolerable situation every apparent alternative draw protagonist ever closertowards fate. in heller’s novel, it’s contradictory rule put american soldier intoan absurd situation.in euro area, primarily lack rule regard dilemma pivotal: therewas rule state that, bad come worst, mainly investorsand creditor shoulder banks’ losses, taxpayers.this also precisely make new european regime bank resolution, rigorousapplication, important. because rule stipulate bank need tobe wind up, investor creditor first line bear ensue losses. only thatdoes resolution fund finance bank step in.add close-knit sovereign-bank nexus euro area, evidence hugestocks government bond bank hold balance sheets. this notenough focus bank resolution.4.3 abolish preferential treatment sovereign bondsit would enough curb banks’ appetite government bond force treat sovereignexposures book exactly way private ones.because, unlike case corporate bonds, bank require back governmentbonds denominate domestic currency capital, comply anyceilings caps. this case irrespective issue sovereign’s credit rat quality – andeven though euro area debt crisis make quite plain government bond nomeans risk-free.only bank hold sufficient capital government bond limit place thesize individual exposure bank able cushion restructure sovereign debt. andonly probably political need take step.the bundesbank put topic abolish preferential treatment government bondson agenda international committees. but talks, particularly basel committee onbanking supervision, straightforward. that’s it’s vital give issuegreater prominence european committee make headway there.ladies gentlemen, toughen fiscal rules, abolish preferential treatment affordedto government bonds, automatically extend maturity sovereign debt threeimportant reforms. they play part put monetary union sound long-term footing.these proposal put shine back principle individual fiscal responsibility – isthe key feature maastricht framework.at end day, proposal future direction monetary union need beassessed accord impact necessary alignment action 7 / 9bis central bankers' speech liability.in recent speech garner great deal attention, french president emmanuel macronput forward vision advance european project, suggest policy areascould communitised – is, transfer brussels thus fund jointly.such proposal substitute strengthen individual national responsibility euroarea. nor, token, odds principle individualresponsibility. indeed, quite possible issue like prevent climate change, securingexternal border develop common communications, energy transport network canbe handle efficiently european rather national level.5. monetary policyladies gentlemenone policy area know long deal collectively euro area level ismonetary policy. and, far monetary policy concerned, i kick last part myspeech good news. the euro area experience ever robust economicupturn continue unabated 17 quarter spread euro area countries.and trend look set continue yet. in september ecb’s economist raisedtheir forecast 2017 economic growth 2.2%. and anticipate growth rate ofaround 2% next two year well.an update forecast release two weeks’ time, customary december, thatwill base detail country projections. at moment, good reason believe thatthe economic outlook upbeat then, even better. at least, severalshort-term indicator make surprisingly positive reading.and economic situation germany look exceptionally good, too. employment level areat high since reunification, business consumer sentiment splendid, ifobusiness climate index even hit new record high. and, go late economicindicators received, difficulty germany experience form governmentare show sign markedly dampen mood.the economic recovery we’re see germany euro area benefit part fromthe eurosystem’s exceptionally accommodative monetary policy. this monetary policy stancewas ecb govern council’s response subdue inflation outlook.one reason behind mute rate price inflation euro area country arestill process remedy loss competitiveness play role trigger theeuro area crisis. but improve price competitiveness generally also mean great wagemoderation.the ecb govern council initially respond weak price pressure cut policyrates. once cut rate 0%, start roll host non-standard measuresin effort loosen monetary policy still further.since march 2015, measure include eurosystem’s large-scale purchase ofsovereign corporate assets, currently monthly pace €60 billion per month. fromjanuary fall €30 billion month – purchase continue september 2018, ifnot longer. a know, purchase hotly debated, particularly germany. andyou doubt also aware i view purchase scepticism, too.the eurosystem become large creditor euro area countries. this meansthat governments’ finance condition hinge much directly action time 8 / 9bis central bankers' speech normal monetary policy. my concern, therefore, ecb govern council could end upfacing political pressure keep rate low long justifiable strictly monetarypolicy perspective.ladies gentlemen, read ecb’s projections, however, domestic pricepressures euro area gradually build project path quite consistentwith definition price stability.for one thing clear, it’s even net purchase discontinued,euro area monetary policy remain highly accommodative.october’s monetary policy decision even mean foot still accelerator far asmonetary policy concerned, quite hard before. give favourable economicoutlook pick-up prices, somewhat le accommodative monetary policy stancewould also justifiable, view.6. conclusionladies gentlemeni’ve speak lot today euro area manage – institutional order – aboutmonetary policy. on subject order, physicist georg christoph lichtenberg saidthat “order lead virtues, lead order?” today, i’ve endeavour tomake answer clear context euro area, help various reference points.in essence, solution lie ensure alignment – though since philharmonic hall,perhaps i say harmony – action liability. in debate future ofmonetary union i make sure fundamental harmony forgotten.ladies gentlemen, i hope stimulate panel discussion. and you, mr kösters,may i wish best upcoming retirement.thank you.badinger, harald

haruhiko kuroda governor bank japan december 4, 2017 bank japan 1 i. paris international exposition 19th century -- explore future new technology -- it great honor opportunity give speech paris europlace financial forum today. nowadays, rapid innovation information technology significantly change financial services, even economy society whole. it seem people thrill watch, hope little anxiety, innovation change world landscape affect role human beings. similarly, time past people strong interest new technology would change future. particularly late 19th century, development heavy industry, popularization electricity, mass production new material iron glass, people wonder technological progress would change economy society. during period, paris host international expo many five times. these expo present prospect 20th century new technology could open up, bring technology close ordinary people. indeed, many major structure use new material construction method build time expos, namely, la tour eiffel, la gare d'orsay, le pont alexandre iii, le grand palais. they continue symbolic landmark paris today. moreover, interestingly, bordeaux wine classification also introduce 1855 paris expo, seem create "database" help french wine become world's lead brand. the paris metro also open 1900 paris expo. the subway play major role urban transportation system since early 20th century. i particularly attract art nouveau decoration entrance paris metro. art nouveau widely adopt new material iron glass, combine delicate artistic sense human beings, create path future fine art architecture. 2 ii. innovation information technology fintech undoubtedly, paris expo late 19th century present "visions" "prospects" science technology could lead economic social development improve people's daily life wide range fields, urban architecture, transportation, fine art. they thereby contribute broad application science technology 20th century. i believe also make use historical analogy maximize value on-going rapid innovation information technologies. if many people could share vision prospect new technology could contribute make world good could bring daily life, benefit would substantial. namely, intimately feel benefit new information technology cope associate anxiety share vision prospects. if so, would become easy facilitate collaboration among various entity apply new technology improve financial service develop economy. in regard, application new information technology toward financial innovation, call "fintech," present follow vision prospect open frontier financial services. i would like encourage wide-ranging stakeholder make effort realize them. first, fintech facilitate delivery financial service customize suit individual user around world. more specifically, emerge develop economies, financial infrastructure bank branch atm underdeveloped, internet smartphones spread rapidly. in countries, fintech enable provision financial service use internet smartphones new access tools. therefore, emerge develop economy eager promote fintech order accelerate "financial inclusion." moreover, big data artificial intelligence (ai) make possible customize financial service accordance need individual users. second, fintech contribute increase efficiency financial operation service raise productivity application information technology. 3 fintech also potential create new network financial service wide-ranging industries, internet thing (iot), e-commerce, share economy. by foster development new source growth, fintech could contribute boost growth potential enhance productivity, common policy challenge develop countries. furthermore, fintech improve daily life address various social challenge financial aspect. for example, population age japan many develop countries, become increasingly important make financial transaction easy safe elderly protect fraud. in regard, biometrics ai could effective tools. in addition, new technology ai big data analysis may enable rapid credit assessment low-cost remittance services. they could facilitate easy access lend remittance service financially vulnerable people. moreover, robot adviser utilize ai may provide easy-to-access asset management service low costs, thereby promote "the shift save investment," long-standing policy challenge japan. in way, fintech could contribute raise growth potential address social challenges, emerge develop economy also develop countries. on basis, major city paris tokyo consider fintech one major drive force effort promote financial service industries. in november 2016, metropolitan government tokyo establish "advisory panel global financial city tokyo," senior official bank japan participated. in discussion there, fintech, well foster asset management services, consider core driver promote financial activity tokyo. iii. initiative bank japan central bank's perspective the bank japan actively promote fintech standpoint central bank. in april 2016, bank establish fintech center within payment settlement system department. the bank also build bank-wide "fintech network" share information expertise relate fintech. 4 also, bank hold four fintech forum far. in forums, focus topic high interest, information security, open innovation, distribute ledger technology (dlt), big data. in november 2016, university tokyo bank japan hold joint conference focus future money. moreover, april year, bank organize conference ai. furthermore, order gain deep understand new information technology impact, bank conduct various research activities, include joint research european central bank dlt. in parallel activities, senior official bank, include myself, deliver speech focus it innovation fintech well impact finance economy, order convey bank's view issues. when try examine impact fintech finance economy central bank's perspective, i think follow four point important. first, entity provide financial service become widespread. one major characteristic fintech various new player it company start-ups, different traditional financial institutions, enter financial service businesses. it would informative examine new player could influence structure financial service provision, financial markets, risk-sharing among various entities. from central bank viewpoint, need closely monitor impact new entrant new technology enhance efficiency payments, settlements, financial services, ensure safety stability. second, new style systemic importance may emerge development fintech. since global financial crisis, effort make classify big bank systemically important financial institutions, sifis, base factor size balance sheet. base efforts, various financial regulatory measure take systemic importance would threaten financial stability. recently, however, entity provide global it platform many entity accumulate huge volume big data become increasingly powerful influential wide-ranging 5 business include financial services. in addition, high-speed, high-frequency transaction financial market expanding, many market participant come use similar algorithm conduct transactions, might involve risk amplify one-way market developments. base change environment, rather size balance sheet banks, factor global it platforms, huge volume big data, widely use algorithm might become systemically important viewpoint financial stability. third, utilization big data become important provision financial services, data security, privacy, consensus stakeholder data utilization become even critical. thus, financial service provider stakeholder require pay due attention data protection privacy, order maintain public confidence innovative financial service utilize new technologies. finally, application ai financial operation become widespread, ensure governance ai's decision-making accountability customer use ai-related service may also become critically important. if customer concern ai's decision-making might turn "black box" pose risk them, customers' anxiety would hind application ai create innovative financial services. in regard, effort ensure governance accountability ai meaningful "wipe out" people's concern new technologies. iv. close remark in promote fintech, france japan seem common challenge develop countries. in case emerge develop countries, basic financial service underdeveloped, market growth expect certain extent, simply introduce promote basic services. on hand, france japan, basic financial service already embed people's daily life. thus, order make fintech bloom countries, strongly need create innovative financial service high added-value beyond already-available services. in addition, financial 6 institution require take forward-looking measure reform structure order make effective use fintech. without efforts, country traditional financial service already prevail might lag behind field fintech. in regard, let introduce another important aspect paris expo late 19th century. at period, japan middle big transition phase, edo period meiji era. nonetheless, japan actively participate paris expos. it seem japanese people, midst big historical turn point, drive strong motivation learn much possible european countries, already industrially-advanced country world. i feel japanese people really want obtain prospect future gain clue reform. at time, many ukiyo-e print bring france japan. the interaction western oriental art consequent "chemical reactions" lead creation new fine arts, namely, japonisme impressionism, remarkably incorporate western oriental cultural backgrounds. these history vividly illustrate interactive dialogue, sometimes carry across borders, chemical reaction bring cross-cultural exchange play critical role innovative creation. needle say, france japan history culture, play lead role science technology. i firmly believe extremely beneficial two country strengthen dialogue also area financial innovation fintech. the bank japan would like deepen exchange banque de france financial innovation fintech. thank attention. 1 monetary policy: achievement challenge már guðmundsson, governor central bank iceland. monetary policy meet iceland chamber commerce, hold gamla bíó reykjavík 16 november 2017 madame chairman, honour guests, once again, gather iceland chamber commerce’s monetary policy meeting, year hold central bank publish autumn forecast and, latter years, monetary policy committee’s interest rate decision. i would like thank chamber commerce continue tradition give opportunity talk monetary policy. in speech meet last year, i note icelandic economy seldom stronger, experience combine effect robust gdp growth, full employment, large rise real wages, below-target inflation, current account surplus, strong international investment position, low private sector debt see years. at time, also achieve historical milestone bring inflation expectation back target measures. the outlook positive well, prospect continue strong gdp growth, current account surplus, target-level inflation throughout forecast horizon. but concerns, too: potential overheating, possible over-valuation króna, uncertainty would happen general liberalisation capital controls. now, one year later, economy still strong, yet important change take place – change respect reduce potential risk price stability financial stability. first all, vast majority capital control lifted, risk materialised. short-term exchange rate volatility indeed increase, expected, pronounce enough cause financial instability, i discus moment. and exchange rate volatility subside autumn. second, historical achievement monetary policy, horizon last year, confirm much convincingly. the credibility monetary policy increased, see perhaps clearly inflation expectations, much firmly anchor 2 target. it least make possible low bank’s key interest rate full percentage point one year, even though demand pressure economy grow recently interest rate already low historical context 2016, adjust business cycle position. i explain detail speech last year. third, gdp growth appear approach long-term trend rate rapidly previously anticipated, indication positive output gap already peak grow stronger. a result, likelihood overheat receded, although economic policy mistake decision make labour market could certainly increase likelihood again. a case 2016, economic outlook positive, accord central bank’s baseline forecast, publish yesterday. gdp growth slow next three years, desirable inevitable. the current account surplus small previous forecast, surplus remain. there full employment, real wage rise entire period expect long run. inflation converge target mid-2018 remain close target rest forecast horizon. this one best inflation forecast i see entire career. but baseline forecast, unforeseen external shocks, economic policy, decision make labour market could easily change situation significantly. current situation outlook let u take close look several aspect current economic situation outlook. chart 1 show export growth slow year 2016 peak yet remain robust. the combination weak export growth increase import explain year-on-year slowdown gdp growth. it also explain narrow current account surplus, although deterioration term trade also factor. the current account surplus project 2% gdp end forecast horizon could easily erode surge demand and/or low export revenues. 3 chart 1 a chart 2 shows, private consumption growth rise house price due mainly increase real income households’ improve financial position. this differ greatly situation pre-crisis iceland, increase household leverage play lead role, see chart right, lend household increase real term since 2012. chart 2 the fact inflation low recent year despite steep rise wage house price stem primarily two things: one hand, positive supply shock form strong export growth improve term trade, push exchange rate króna upwards, hand, price deflation international good trade. import price therefore fall steeply krónur terms, see leave chart 3. what would happen import deflation turn around always source concern. such development appear horizon, see chart. but fortunately, rise unit labour cost seem lose pace, see chart centre, house price appear 4 peaked. the inflation outlook therefore favourable, see chart right, look past change value-added tax could possibly implement near future. chart 3 “missing” inflation headline inflation central bank’s target nearly four years, even though negative output gap close turn positive time ago wage rise well excess what, average year, would deem consistent inflation target. this unique case, however. in international circles, widespread discussion “missing” inflation, generally refer fact wage rise astoundingly small give business cycle position country concerned. for example, country dissimilar u sweden consider full employment, yet wage increase small consistent inflation target. in countries, us, may partly slack labour market actually large conventional measurement indicate, labour participation rate historically rather low. but tell whole tale, country robust explanation. give widespread phenomenon is, give respect independent domestic condition economic policy, number indication global factor increase cross-border mobility labour production factors, international value chains, existence large excess labour force emerge market economy play important role it. an underestimate slack labour market hardly factor iceland, labour participation rate historical high wage rise substantial. labour importation indirect pressure unutilised lower-income labour force country clearly dampen effect wage increases, however. even so, inflation low. this true 5 economy well. but le puzzle wage development industrialise country overall: global trend favourable them, see improve term trade rise exchange rates. it well know create condition strong gdp growth sizeable pay rise coincide time low inflation. and one difference iceland many industrialise economy country concern inflation expectation would fall steeply become anchor target. in order place iceland context, let u look chart 4, give relevant metric several small medium-sized inflation-targeting countries. chart 4 6 in context, discussion centre extent low inflation problem pair robust gdp growth full capacity utilisation, particularly result positive supply shocks. in case, perhaps problem lie inflation target present understood. this call flexibility long horizon target, one proposal explore central bank’s 2010 report monetary policy post-capital control iceland.1 monetary policy milestone i mention early success monetary policy – success visible year ago even obvious now. this past september, central bank iceland issue special publication entitle monetary policy base inflation targeting: experience since 2001 post-crisis changes.2 in addition discuss topic title, report map success monetary policy. chart 5 show entails: inflation expectation target, unexpected change inflation strongly affect short- long-term inflation expectation past long so, movement exchange rate króna function much shock absorber le source shock use to. in short, monetary policy flexible exchange rate much successful 2012, bank publish report entitle iceland’s currency exchange rate policy options.3 chart 5 1 special publication no. 4, monetary policy iceland capital

management tool there proposal medium recently effect special reserve requirement foreign capital inflow investment bond market high-yielding deposit immediately reduce even eliminated. in box newly publish monetary bulletin, bank discus special reserve requirement. it agree proposals. the special reserve requirement function intended, monetary policy transmission along interest rate channel improved, see right chart 6. without it, monetary policy transmission would shift great measure exchange rate channel, lead strong appreciation increase exchange rate volatility, would terribly popular current conditions. although goal lift special reserve requirement, condition warrant yet. it probably necessary scale back increment demand pressure domestic economy recede growth trade partner country gather momentum. current forecast indicate happen, see right chart. long-term interest rate reflect this, long-term interest rate differential narrow. chart 6 another important factor unclear benefit investment affect capital flow management measure iceland present. the treasury’s borrow need limit historical context, strictly speaking, treasury need fund generate bond question. if special reserve requirement effect, central bank would probably hold large foreign exchange reserve mitigate risk associate carry trade-related inflow potential sudden outflows. this would quite costly, global market return reserve unusually low present. at time, foreign investor expect attractive return icelandic treasury bonds, stable króna, great risk-adjusted interest rate differential. in order reduce 8 differential, central bank would therefore need allow increase exchange rate fluctuations, would also exacerbate risk face residents. under current conditions, even argue icelandic economy, net benefit inflow negative. nevertheless, aim lift special reserve requirement soon condition warrant not, general rule, use normal conditions. even so, central bank consider important able activate need arises. the special reserve requirement would third line defence, support conventional economic policy micro- macroprudential tools. in order possible capital control lift full, new statutory foundation (other foreign exchange act) must find special reserve requirement, primarily monetary macroprudential policy instrument. furthermore, efficacy special reserve requirement must ensure speculative derivative trade krónur re-authorised, full liberalisation implies. the central bank currently review technical foundation special reserve requirement prepare proposal statutory amendment pertain application. exchange rate fluctuation the new issue monetary bulletin contain box fluctuation exchange rate króna international context. that article present several point bear mind discussion monetary policy possible modification monetary policy framework, include exchange rate policy. they follows:  short-term exchange rate volatility increase capital control lifted, expect monetary policy committee point advance statements. this volatility subside recent month (see right side chart 7).  if look beyond aftermath peg exchange rate regime, financial crisis, capital control regime, cannot see short-term fluctuation icelandic króna vastly large nordic krónur flexible exchange rates, commodity-exporters’ currencies. these currency also period peak volatility.  long real exchange rate cycle well-known phenomenon, also country fix nominal exchange rate (chart 8).  a previously noted, exchange rate movement effective shock absorber recent year previously. although effective credible monetary policy play part this, probably important capital control – now, 9 capital flow management measure – mitigate volatile capital flows, undermine economic stability, experience shown. chart 7 chart 8 review monetary policy framework currency exchange rate policy option in closing, i would like focus ongoing review iceland’s monetary policy framework currency exchange rate policy options. in recent past, i emphasise important discussion take account monetary policy cannot do. in long run, monetary policy deliver price stability, short run also mitigate effect shock reduce fluctuation output employment. but monetary policy cannot long-term impact real exchange rate. a such, little mitigate crowding-out effect strong growth new export sector. if try to, effect would temporary, would come expense sacrifice objective monetary policy entrust – objective achieve. industrial fiscal policy real impact long term, however, concern party turn. 10 but possible choose among various option spectrum rigid peg free-floating exchange rate. and possible adopt another currency, either unilaterally bilateral multilateral cooperation. these option explore central bank’s 2012 report.4 the conclusion unilateral peg unrestricted capital flow could run aground, many economy capital movement liberalise 1980s 1990s. a firm peg currency board could pose risk financial stability, consider true unilateral adoption another currency. it deem highly uncertain – actually unlikely – bilateral adoption another currency would offer anywhere. that leave two

reformingbanking regulation financial crisisspeech dr andreas dombret, member executive board deutsche bundesbank,at 21st colloquium institute bank financial history (ibf) "ways stablefinancial system", frankfurt main, 23 november 2017.* * *1. way stable financial systemladies gentlemenyou hear numerous speech today proposal reform pro cons.now i think it’s time briefly revisit actual objective. and “ways stable financialsystem”.scholars, politician regulator rack brain problem since 2007,the year financial crisis break out. the question whether financial system even bestable first place also emerged. and yet one thing know, therewill never completely stable, completely crisis-proof financial system real world.however, today colloquium conviction that, nothing else, afinancial system make little le vulnerable, thereby contain fallout crisis –provided right solution found.the g20 country travel long often rocky road order make financialsystem stable. i follow path perch atthe bundesbanksince 2010 – i start originally responsible financial stability and,since 2014, charge bank financial supervision.and i, too, ask time again: take right road? or wefallen short? have possibly go far places, even go entirely track?the answer questions, sadly, simple – occupyingus day. still, i would like attempt deliver answer, base three points.i initially wish discus regulatory principle suppose guide post-crisis reforms:if assume idea 100 % stable financial system utopian, reform beconducted prevent financial bubble create misvaluation excessiveleverage crisis-proofing banks.my second point concern equilibrium assessment reforms. a supervisor andregulator, i naturally partial convince take path golden mean: inmy assessment, financial stability risk appetite treat equally. and why,once basel iii finalised, take regulatory break now.yet – third point – reform desire effect if, if, rule arealso credibly rigorously implement applied.2. prevent build-up bubble make bank crisis-prooflet u begin question right guide principle regulation. a long ago 1986,economist hyman minsky formulate one avenue worth explore book stabilise anunstable economy, book remain largely obscure 20 year – thus long past hisdeath 1991. it 2008 crisis reveal importance thesis all.1 1 / 6bis central bankers' speech minsky saw financial market natural inclination towards instability crisis. thatwas wholly kilter then-prevailing zeitgeist – blossom financial marketsof period. nor, token, go along prevail theory economics – theefficient market hypothesis.from today's perspective, know financial market tendency exaggerate andthus experience cyclical instability. minsky far along notice this. his decisivediscovery, however, instability origin stability – precisely, periodof stability encourage increasingly excessive risk taking.what i mean that? long period growth lead exceptionally favourable fund terms;these, turn, encourage enterprise household make investment base avery great extent principle hope – hope economy continue grow thesame pace. bank prop optimism ease term condition lendingand late even low credit standards. this add burgeon debt, issustainable long debt serviced.however, long possible service debt, asset value subsequently fall,what know “minsky moment” occurs. that is, debt become unsustainable, materialisingwhen positive expectation give way pessimism. a subsequent cascade financial pricecorrections default cause loss real economy.one decisive thing learn financial crisis cause anintegral part system. and, like system, disrupt factor already build intothe financial system.so minsky mean term bank financial regulation? in case, doesn’tmean sit around twiddle one’s thumbs. although minsky explain financial crisesoccur, cause effect relationship describe law nature. far importantis regulator supervisor understand interrelationship use instrument attheir disposal reduce likelihood “minsky moment” occurring.minsky therefore tender guide principle discussion: regulator develop new rules,they ensure build-up bubble excessive credit growth le likelythan would wholly unregulated financial market inclination towards exaggeration.however, since regulation, however forward-looking might be, completely prevent crisesaltogether, bank crisis-proofed.as i said, minsky’s theory around 20 years. yet guide principle – allknow – automatically translate optimal regulation. real regulatory initiative need alittle actual content.this matter policymakers supervisor equal measure since 2008. thesecond point i discus well performed.3. reform financial crisis: little, much right?this morning, colleague bundesbank executive board, carl-ludwig thiele, alreadygave account colloquium major cornerstone reform financialcrisis. i shall flesh name late developments: case basel iiireform, compromise within reach. at technical level, negotiation already beenconcluded. with completion basel iii, g20’s reform agenda essentially beenfulfilled.the question whether put u path towards stable financial system one iam go answer cite individual regulatory clause percentages, general 2 / 6bis central bankers' speech evaluation.the objective good regulation always prevent economic bubble fromforming far possible – crisis unavoidable – limit impact thegeneral public economy. it therein lie major challenge: correctmeasure? what constitute proportionate intervention? what regulation appropriate andwhich disproportionate?as i already explained, i firmly believe embark effective and, thesame time, balance path past years. the reform package make bankssignificantly safer: result stringent capital requirements, introduction theleverage ratio, introduction one two liquidity minimum requirements, theintroduction capital buff elements.more that: also tackle problem bubble formation. through prudentialrequirements stress tests, example, institution place anobligation conduct cautious risk management early stage. there also amicroprudential upgrade, say, result strict requirement systemically importantinstitutions instrument design prevent emergence bubble – think, example,of possible cyclical capital add-on mortgage loans.and, least, creation bank union much strengthen regulation andsupervision financial system euro area.in total, reform concern restore equilibrium marketeconomy. you tell that, particular, additional, quite important new instrument – theway bank distress treated. during financial crisis, number bankrescues. mr thiele already refer “fall market economy”.a resolution regime establish europe. the failure major spanishinstitution five month ago demonstrate rule work investor indeed bebailed in. other, le satisfactory case shown, however, gap still exist, thesehave closed. all thing considered, i nevertheless regard reform importantinstruments fall-out cost financial crisis distribute fairlyamong responsible.you see, therefore, rely single solitary instrument single solitaryapproach – rather, toolbox complementary instruments. in total, toolbox – ifirmly believe – make financial system much stable.other proposal present today go even further. their common denominator, however, thatthe cause financial crisis supposedly eliminate even radicalapproaches.i think debate important: opinion, scholar downright duty lookbeyond field, question old approach develop bold new ones.for reason, too, i shall go detail pro con alternativeapproaches. my point general one: advantage far-reaching, fundamentallynovel approach may also inherent drawback. while offer new solutions, also createsnew problem – problem mostly unidentifiable draw board.seen light, comparison exist system radically new one alwaysflawed: exist system, focus real problems, new approachdirects attention improvement full promise. because new approach yetundergone reality check, virtually almost always look like good option. but 3 / 6bis central bankers' speech implementation term actual regulation may bring serious, unintended side effect ourfinancial system wake.it also extremely important take account fact regulation can, indeed,go far ‒ say form illusion perfect, stable financial worldcan create zeal reform restrict economic activity extent thatinnovation choke economic upturn stifled.but, sadly, unintended side effect reform indeed lead obstruction key functions,the unnecessary break-up beneficial, establish structures, unpredictable frustrationof wealth creation. sustain economic growth need innovation risk taking, however: afailure safeguard supply credit economy enfeeble economic activity.i perceive threat call make bank regulation even stringent. a muchas i understand motivation behind them, i immense appreciation theaccompanying effect turn screw tightly come regulation.anyone want live completely risk-free world would therefore also accept muchless dynamic economic growth.there another point seem important me: regulation create inadvertent effect onthe structure financial sector. apply regulation adopt large bank aninternational focus one-to-one small institution clearly place small institution adisadvantage. that i advocate low regulatory burden small, low-riskinstitutions operate internationally.in summary, i take positive view overall post-crisis reform soon completed.taking compromise start point, look future – wellknown challenge bank sector considerable. with regard regulations, wemust give want turn back regulatory clock. but must go ontightening screw regulation ever further.i therefore favour regulatory break reform completed. this shouldbe use thoroughly evaluate impact reform amend improve wheregaps error found. this include outstanding area action iscalled for, regulatory treatment government bonds.4. paper never refuse ink: reform short-lived without change attitudeladies gentlemen, tell, i realist. and bring third point i wouldlike make – even best reform go far accompany apermanent change attitude.because without change, rule monitor le rigorously intended. evenbefore diesel scandal broke, know even best rule don’t achieve much nobodyis make keep them.ideally, change attitude financial sector base around understandingthat consistently monitor comply rule everyone’s interests. all often,decision-makers think economy favour save bank frominsolvency call prudential leniency order prolong risky type activity. theirintention, one would imagine, safeguard stability job – unfortunately, oftenturned unrealistic one.instead, leniency do make two thing likely medium term:financial market bubble economic stagnation. 4 / 6bis central bankers' speech that’s financial crisis outcome handful undisciplined banksor gap rule also belief light-touch interpretation monitor ruleswas promote economic activity. a see, political belief influence rule areapplied – even clear, international evidence confirm view.and yet people keep slip back old way thinking. the debate aboutderegulation u spring mind, example, discussion non-performing loan – here, times, seem that, decision-makers, thing can’tprogress slowly gently enough come tackle long-standing seriousproblems. the debate competitive deregulation brexit suggest old mindsetmight make comeback.the important, then, grasp reform discuss today actuallyprevent bubble form strengthen bank rule apply consistently andeffectively.those go easy even rescue sickly bank interpret rule generously areeroding substance economy. they deactivate market economy principle ofcompetition, enfeeble innovative potential bank sector and, anything, help propup “zombie banks” whose day would number light-touch approach.indulging credit institution creditor ultimately come cost economic growth.financial history repeat itself, too, need rigorously implement reform haveagreed upon. but change attitude i talk mean prudentialdecisions ground?to clear, prudential decision make within establish legal framework, whichthe reform undertake make far tight-knit robust.decisions rule entirely clear-cut – is, discretion apply –might pose difficulties. and change attitude come play. today, knowthat supervisor need weigh reduce likelihood bubble form orpermitting low-yielding relatively risky activity. a i see it, must courage andconfidence situation best financial stability – bold enough toface music – even late transpire one decision go overboard.because decision gear preserve stability generally good economy asa whole.to put principle practice, decision-makers also make uncomfortabledecisions – wind bank bail-in investors, impose capital add-ons, orrestricting distribution dividend institution fail comply buff requirements.i would like remind balance act prevent bubble form onthe one hand, stunt economic growth other. this feat something whichregulators supervisor need take seriously times. for vast majority ofdecisions, would wrong u act like supervisory sheriffs, clamp usefulfinancial intermediation. we need focus decision really count – prudence,expertise determination.specifically, mean change attitude, see post-crisis reformsand elsewhere, need embrace – supervisory authority well aspolitical decision-makers. not supervisor need tool intervene; alsohave confident enough use them. and would wrong confidence beundermined incentive shield banks. policymakers, then, would well respect theprofessional independence authority objective decision make. conversely, thismeans must refrain apply pressure authority political reasons. 2 5 / 6bis central bankers' speech 5. conclusionwe make considerable progress since financial crisis erupted. the bank andfinancial system great deal good days. we create toolkit make futurecrises le likely make institution resilient withstand turbulence doesoccur. bank capital, manage risk better.but danger even best regulation remain piecemeal rule notapplied consistently. only rigorous consistent supervision credit institution canensure bubble le likely form that, emergency, enough capital toabsorb losses.when come apply rule future, heed minsky’s key message, isthat, undeniable merits, financial market always tendency form bubblesand thus slip financial crises; also, bubble build upbeat economic spell –which nobody want talk it.to stall formation bubble equip bank cope headwinds, supervisor andpolicymakers need evaluate impact society whole. but happen thechange attitude take hold among policymakers supervisors. let u hope today’sconference help make happen.thank attention. hp minsky (1986) stabilize unstable

kisaragi-kai meet tokyo bank japan december 7, 2017 haruhiko kuroda governor bank japan (english translation base japanese original) 1 introduction it great pleasure opportunity today speak kisaragi-kai meeting. the last time i give speech kisaragi-kai meet early september last year. two week that, bank japan conduct comprehensive assessment development economic activity price well policy effect quantitative qualitative monetary ease (qqe), decide introduce new framework strengthen monetary ease -- "qqe yield curve control." while year pass since then, highly accommodative financial condition maintain japan framework, economy continue improve. today, i would like first explain bank's view recent economic price development japan, talk think behind conduct monetary policy. i. the current situation economic activity it outlook overseas economy let start talk economic developments. i first touch development overseas economies. overseas economy continue improve steadily since mid-2016. by region, u.s. economy continue recover firmly, mainly household spending, owe improvement employment income situation. the real gdp register relatively high growth 3 percent annualized quarter-on-quarter basis last two quarters, suggest major hurricane hit southern unite state summer short-term effects. a european economy, although continue attention need pay negotiation unite kingdom's exit european union (eu) european debt problem, include financial sector, uncertainty surround factor abated. under circumstances, european economy continue recover steadily, divergence growth rate among euro area economy clearly become small recently. emerge commodity-exporting economy follow recovery trends. specifically, chinese economy continue see stable growth whole, partly due effect authorities' measure support economic activity; 2 commodity-exporting economy brazil russia -- stagnant -- pick up, particularly reflect bottom commodity price monetary ease effects. at international monetary fund's (imf's) annual meet october, i participate in, imf manage director christine lagarde assess recent global economy show "the broadest-based recovery last 10 years." with regard outlook global economy, advance emerge economy project continue grow well-balanced manner. accord late world economic outlook (weo) release imf, global economy expect maintain firm growth, annual real gdp growth rate register 3.2 percent 2016, 3.6 percent 2017, 3.7 percent 2018 (chart 1). the current situation japan's economic activity it outlook next, i talk japan's economy. it continue grow well-balanced manner, similar case i mention global economy. japan's economy expand moderately, virtuous cycle income spend operating. the real gdp growth rate july-september quarter 1.4 percent annualized basis, represent positive growth seventh consecutive quarter. this observe first time 16 years, since 2001. the output gap show utilization capital labor exceed long-term average 0 percent second half 2016, widen positive territory recently (chart 2). this third time past 20 year japan's output gap turn positive. the past two case occur so-called dot-com bubble period early 2000s global credit bubble period 2006 2008. both recovery phase depend external demand. by contrast, current recovery phase, external domestic demand strong driver japan's economic growth. a external demand, japan's export increase -- mainly lead it-related good export asia -- back growth overseas economies. in addition, domestic demand increase trend. specifically, business fix investment moderate increase trend, corporate profit improved, mark record high level (chart 3). private consumption increase resilience, support steady improvement 3 employment income situation well replacement demand durable goods. public investment also increase due implementation government's stimulus measure formulate fiscal 2016. a development show, japan's current economy support multiple factor -- namely, external demand, domestic private demand, domestic public demand -- well-balanced manner. for reason, possible ass economy resilience exogenous shocks. another notable feature japan's economy recently effect expansion spread wide range economic entities. the diffusion index (di) business condition tankan (short-term economic survey enterprise japan) continue positive, large enterprise manufacturer also small enterprise nonmanufacturers. this clearly different recovery phase early mid-2000s, lead external demand (chart 4). look development region, di positive region since december 2013 survey. labor market condition tighten nationwide, see active job openings-to-applicants ratio many region rise level comparable major metropolitan area (chart 5). let turn economic outlook. go forward, japan's economy expect continue expand moderately. the bank make projection japan's economic activity release quarterly outlook economic activity price (outlook report); late outlook report release end-october, median policy board members' forecast real gdp growth rate fiscal 2017 2018 1.9 percent 1.4 percent, respectively. these figure japan's potential growth rate, estimate range 0.5-1.0 percent. in fiscal 2019, although growth pace project decelerate, economy expect continue expanding, underpin increase export back growth overseas economies, median forecast real gdp growth rate 0.7 percent. the economic activity could, course, deviate either upward downward projections. the big risk factor development overseas economies. a i mention earlier, baseline scenario overseas economy expect continue grow 4 moderate pace, long case risk likely skew downside. that said, u.s. economic policy impact global financial market warrant attention, geopolitical risk also could exert downward pressure economic activity. the bank continue pay close attention upside downside risks. ii. price development their outlook price development now, i move price developments. price japan increase gradually, mainly back rise energy prices. the year-on-year rate increase consumer price index (cpi) exclude fresh food accelerate 0.8 percent october, rise 1 percentage point year rate change minus 0.4 percent register october last year (chart 6). exclude effect energy prices, however, rate change cpi remain slightly positive. thus, price development japan still relatively weak despite continue economic expansion tighten labor market conditions. somewhat strong economic activity relatively weak prices, seem contrary first glance, coexist japan. this situation also observe advance economy recently. the inflation rate unite state euro area remain central banks' target level despite firm improvement global economy i mention outset. federal reserve chair janet yellen describe recent sluggish price development unite state "mystery," refer possibility development mainly due transitory factor decline telecommunication service prices. the chair point outlook subject considerable uncertainty multiple sources. specifically, addition uncertainty regard supply capacity labor market medium- long-term inflation expectations, chair mention possibility factor increase competition emerge economies, reflect globalization, rapid spread use online shop back advance technology could affect price developments. it may beneficial japan well 5 consider point analyze price developments. however, also keep mind inflation rate unite state euro area around 1.5 percent despite regard somewhat weak, situation somewhat different japan. therefore, natural think low inflation japan also attributable factor unique japan. the background relatively weak price development their outlook i elaborate relationship economic activity price japan. take account firms' wage- price-setting stance exert large impact prices, weakness price development japan explain follow two steps. the first moderate improvement wage despite tightness labor market conditions. in particular, noticeable wage increase full-time employee sluggish, compare part-time employee (chart 7). since schedule cash earn full-time employee account almost 70 percent total employee income, impact small. on issue, point fact that, since labor management japan place priority long-term stability employment wage wage increases, follow observed: employment adjustment wage reduction full-time employee conduct marginally economic downturn, wage barely rise even economy recover labor market condition tighten. it also say past downward rigidity wage lead present upward rigidity. the second that, even though wage increase take place, albeit moderate pace, pass-through wage cost sale price observe yet widely. this reflect firms' effort absorb increase wage cost through, example, labor-saving investment make use information technology, evident software investment increase remarkably late industry labor shortage particularly acute, restaurants, retail, construction (chart 8). while effort base individual firms' reasonable business strategy view raise productivity, would reduce upward pressure price economy whole. 6 however, i believe situation change gradually. first all, see change wages. give labor market condition tight, wonder lead increase wage full-time employees. it also important fact base pay rise, take place deflation, continue four consecutive year since 2014. in order create virtuous cycle moderate rise price increase corporate profit income, widely recognize society wage rise continuously sound economy. the bank expect effort labor management realize virtuous cycle become widespread take advantage tailwind current favorable economic environment. in addition, firms' stance likely gradually shift toward raise prices. with hourly schedule cash earn part-time employee remain uptrend, upward pressure rise firms' cost price increasing, support also rise input price due past depreciation yen. it seem consumer gradually accept price rise back employment income situation improving. although, time being, likely firm decide price rise others remain hesitant, firms' bullish stance raise price expect become predominant eventually. however, easy clearly point time happen beforehand, specific time firm's stance shift toward raise price likely vary, depend development demand firm industry faces, cost structure. the cpi, reflect developments, likely increase moderately go forward. iii. qqe it effect basic mechanism monetary ease so far, i explain development japan's economic activity prices. in follows, i talk bank's conduct monetary policy. 7 in textbook theory, basic mechanism monetary policy stimulate contain economic activity drive actual real interest rate level natural rate interest, i explain shortly. real interest rate rate adjust exclude future price fluctuation subtract inflation expectation nominal interest rate usually come across. the natural rate interest real interest rate economy neither accelerate decelerates, likely close potential growth rate normal conditions. the low actual real interest rate natural rate interest, great level monetary accommodation. the economic growth accelerate low interest rate stimulate economic activity business fix investment, lead improvement output gap. this improvement finally bring rise inflation rate. qqe, bank introduce april 2013, aim substantially low japan's real interest rate order overcome deflation last past 15 years. in september last year, bank introduce new framework -- "qqe yield curve control" -- thereby strengthen monetary easing. this framework consist two component aim low real interest rate (chart 9). the first inflation-overshooting commitment. this strong commitment bank continue expand monetary base year-on-year rate increase actual cpi exceed 2 percent stay level stable manner. it aim raise people's inflation expectation forceful manner. the second component yield curve control. the bank conduct large-scale purchase japanese government bond (jgbs) facilitate formation yield curve consider appropriate achieve price stability target 2 percent early possible time. specifically, guideline market operations, bank set short-term policy interest rate minus 0.1 percent target level 10-year jgb yield around zero percent, observe yield curve form smoothly manner consistent guideline. if bank maintain nominal interest rate sufficiently low level yield curve control raise people's inflation expectation 8 inflation-overshooting commitment, real interest rate -- calculate subtract inflation expectation nominal interest rate -- decline significantly. yield curve control now, i would like provide little explanation concern second component, yield curve control. before introduce framework september last year, bank set quantitative target -- increase outstanding amount jgbs hold bank annual pace 80 trillion yen -- purchase jgbs line target. there commonality difference previous approach current yield curve control approach. first, two approach term basic transmission mechanism monetary easing: low nominal interest rate large-scale jgb purchase thereby reduce real interest rates. however, previous approach, fix purchase amount jgbs certain level, level interest rate could decline either excessively insufficiently, reflect economic price development well condition jgb market. a result, yield curve could deviate either upward downward one bank deem appropriate. this problem arise principle current yield curve control set short- long-term interest rate operate targets. indeed, i mention earlier, yield curve japan form smoothly manner consistent guideline market operation past one year. there several point make conduct yield curve control. the first point determine appropriate shape yield curve achieve price stability target 2 percent. under conventional monetary policy, determine one optimal short-term policy interest rate -- uncollateralized overnight call rate, example -- sufficient conduct monetary policy. however, current framework, naturally must extend scope entire yield curve. it necessary analyze status inflation expectation natural rate interest maturity find shape yield curve produce appropriate level monetary 9 accommodation. although process involve difficult analysis practice, basic concept clear. a explain comprehensive assessment, order form appropriate yield curve, bank make decision consideration possible spillover effect bank lend rate issuance rate corporate bonds, impact economy, impact function financial intermediation, among factors. the bank maintain stance ever since introduce yield curve control september last year. the second point sustainability yield curve control. i aware concern among market participant that, bank continue purchase jgbs large scale, supply jgbs circulate market may dry sooner later, make difficult control long-term interest rate. in respect, bank's jgb purchase conduct smooth manner thus far bank expect risk problem term continue jgb purchase small time being. of course, control long-term interest rate challenge initiative unprecedented global terms. to keep long-term interest rate control, necessary firm understand factor affect interest rate maturity. analysis point conduct bank japan also federal reserve european central bank (ecb), also implement large-scale asset purchase programs. although various approach analyze factor affect long-term interest rate, prevail view appear strong impact long run purchase amount government bond central bank market operation flow basis. rather, long-term interest rate largely influence amount outstanding government bond purchase central bank stock basis, represent cumulative net purchase amount government bonds, ratio amount outstanding central bank's hold government bond overall amount issued. the bank ass main reason able maintain 10-year jgb yield around 0 percent since introduction yield curve control stock effect -- cumulative effect 10 jgb purchase continue since introduction -- work well. with stock effect work firmly, supply-demand condition jgb market tighten future, impact unit amount bank's jgb purchase long-term yield accordingly become significant, else equal. put differently, bank degree effect low interest rate small amount jgb purchases. therefore, i would like reemphasize yield curve control design highly sustainable. accommodative financial condition lastly, i discus actual effect bank's monetary ease measure japan's economy. through introduction qqe, bank succeed low japan's real interest rate well potential growth rate conduct large-scale jgb purchase raise inflation expectation (chart 10). this first achievement make fight prolong deflation since end 1990s. a consequence, economic activity firm household activated, lead steady improvement output gap. accord government, current recovery phase, start december 2012, highly likely last 58 consecutive month september year. the duration current recovery thus surpass izanagi boom second half 1960s. in light situation, couple fact period current recovery mostly overlap period qqe, appear policy contribute long-lasting recovery, second long post-war era. on price front, too, annual cpi inflation exclude fresh food energy positive trend four years. under qqe, japan long deflation, generally define sustain decline prices. it seem monetary ease exert positive effect individual firm form improvement fund conditions. in line decline jgb yields, base interest rates, firms' fund cost -- namely, bank lend rate issuance 11 rate cp corporate bond -- decline firmly. for example, bank lend rate new loan recently around historical low levels, range 0.5-1.0 percent. the real bank lend rate -- nominal bank lend rate minus inflation rate -- new loan decline around 0 percent (chart 11). in words, average firm borrow new loan hardly interest payment inflation rate take consideration. also, respect availability funds, many firm grow sense financial condition become highly accommodative. from viewpoint either large small enterprises, lend attitude financial institution become proactive. in term di bank's tankan lend attitudes, small enterprise particular high level last see end 1980s (chart 12). the bank continue provide maximum support corporate activity japan maintain accommodative financial conditions. conclusion today, i explain recent economic price development bank's think behind conduct monetary policy take account developments. although true still long way go achieve price stability target 2 percent, clear result far achieve qqe effective drastically improve japan's economy. go forward, line steady improvement economy, firms' stance likely gradually shift toward raise wage prices. moreover, people's medium- long-term inflation expectation project rise steadily price rise come observe widely. in order ensure positive development long-lasting japan's economy become well-balanced one economic improvement price stability simultaneously achieved, bank continue persistently pursue powerful monetary ease current framework "qqe yield curve control" view achieve price stability target 2 percent. thank much

crisis showedhow highly interconnect financial institution expose overly complex derivativeproducts could spread amplify domestic shocks. since then, “too-big-to-fail” issue hasbeen put high agenda

bankingsystem.a – some stylise fact pre-financial crisis period: organisational complexitiesand complex activitiesbefore great financial crisis, observe steady increase number foreign banks,from 784 1995 1,301 2007, accord claessens van horen (2014). at sametime, number domestic bank decrease and, result, relative importance offoreign bank increase substantially, share 19% 1995 32% 2007. this

theresolution process necessity cross-border consolidation europebut still face important challenge ahead. i want stress two them. the single resolutionmechanism, second pillar bank union, successfully pass first real testthis summer orderly resolution banco popular. however, still room forimprovement coordination numerous institution authority involve inthese procedures. it mean every participant must know clearly understand rolein process ensure efficient resolution.second, europe still suffer overcapacity cross-border consolidation needed. in theunited states, top five bank market share 40% figure barely20% europe. give new regulatory supervisory framework i describe earlier, webelieve bank union consider – accord criterion set thebcsb – single geographic area. furthermore, reach point europe wherefacilitating healthy well-designed cross-border merger could actually improve financialstability. it would make bank good able diversify risks, achieve economy scale andbecome efficient. and strengthen single supervision resolution ofsignificant institutions, fear “too-big-to-fail” issue. crossborder consolidationwould foster efficient allocation save towards productive investment europe andit would place european bank good position term international competition.to conclude, interaction policy makers, researcher practitioner veryvaluable i certain

commemorative note 1988. all fivedenominations australian banknote print polymer twenty years,which keep counterfeit banknote low production cost contained. we continuedthe innovation introduction world-first top-to-bottom clear window new banknoteseries, begin release last year. the second note new series – ten dollar – wasreleased two month ago new $50 schedule release twelvemonth now. australia also one first country embed microchip containingbiometric information passports, which, similar banknotes, help protect australianpassports counterfeiting. it also help secure movement traveller air﻿[*] sea ports.i would like open conference general observation development securityprinting industry recent year well think industry's outlook. you besurprised comment focus banknote segment industry give mycentral bank background. i will, course, also focus asian region, theasian part high security print conference series region representsapproximately half global high security print market around four time large thanthe industry's next large market region. what happen region significant representationof industry's global performance.let begin observation development market.current state playthe asian market high security print experience generally healthy growth pastdecade. drive good economic performance, rise income infrastructure modernisationacross many part region, high security print market, measure value ofproduction, experience average annual growth around 6½ per cent. that said, rate ofgrowth declining, albeit high base. from annual increase around 11 per centat turn decade, market grow estimate 5½ per cent around middle thedecade. almost segments, include payment card printing, experience slow rate ofgrowth, cheque print segment report outright fall value output.factors specific different market segment have, doubt, contribute slow overallgrowth rates. however, factor common market segment displacement oftraditional print method emerge digital technologies. this reduce production costsfor exist producer efficient print method introduce low cost alternativesto traditionally print high security products. the obvious example grow use ofmobile payment device digital wallet alternative use traditionally print instrumentsfor make consumer payments.two segment market asia have, however, appear move trend ofgenerally low rate growth value production. one ticket print isattributed general upgrade public transport infrastructure. that said, expect growthin segment slow next year transport operator asia migrate proprietaryticketing system sophisticate arrangements, ‘open-loop systems’, valueinformation travel purpose contain chip consumers' exist payment cards, anddigital ticket available use consumers' mobile devices.interestingly, segment banknote production. over past decade, value of﻿[1] banknote production asia grow around 4 per cent per year around 5½ per cent in2016. although seemingly modest increase period, significant segmentcomprises around 40 per cent high security print market asia. it also significantbecause occur time growth production volume banknote isslowing, primarily, i mentioned, response take-up electronic digital platform formaking payments. in past 12 months, volume banknote produce asian region hasrisen 2 per cent compare average annual growth rate around 5 per cent since thestart decade.increasing growth value production time growth production volume isslowing means, course, banknote price rising. put differently, central banks, aswholesalers banknote market, pay proportionately high price finish banknotesthan previous years. furthermore, high price compensate printer otherinput suppliers, producer market, generally slow growth production orders.my observation growth banknote price reflects, part, demand central bank forbanknotes print durable substrate banknote sophisticatedsecurity feature protect counterfeit attack. this see increase take-up oftechnologies improve durability banknotes, polymer polymer-compositesubstrates, well varnish protective banknote overcoat. it also see theincreased use add security feature optically variable device – is, foil featuresthat change colour shape banknote tilted. many feature come premiumprices compare traditional input banknote production. this development unique tothe asian market also evident regions, notably europe part northamerica.two strategy underlie demand expensive substrate security features, strategiesthat reinforce other.the first that, growth production volume declines, central bank theirbanknotes print durable substrate order extend banknote life circulation and,thereby, reduce medium- long-term print costs. industry estimate suggest banknotesprinted polymer substrates, example, cost twice much produce paper banknotes, butlast three four time longer. this certainly australia's experience late 1990s, firstfew year print banknote polymer. recent estimate suggest australian $5banknote – low denomination banknote – median life around 3½ year ourlargest circulation note volume – $50 – median life around 10 years.the second strategy central bank sophisticate security feature add toprotect banknote partly technology available counterfeiter improve partlybecause banknote stay circulation longer. in words, banknote being﻿[2] print advance security feature protect current sophisticate counterfeitingtechniques well as-yet unspecified unknown technique may become available tocounterfeiters long period banknote likely circulating.future state playthe obvious question arise observation is: current state play continue? iwould like offer think future state play, focusing, again, banknotesegment market.it almost go without say outlook banknote print depend future demandfor cash. there different view topic, include view physical cash afinite future. i summarise various view say cannot ignore thepossibility use physical cash many country may disappear stage. that said,the common view seem future state – certainly foreseeable future – likely inmost country one relatively le cash rather cashless. that is, cash use may decline toa level reflect base demand community specific characteristic physicalbanknotes provide.whatever endpoint – le cash cashless – journey likely steady walk rather thana quick sprint. there several reason this, two, particular, stand out.the demand cashthe first that, despite decline use transactions, overall demand cash manycountries continue expand. in past years, median annual growth currency incirculation across international monetary fund (imf) country 9 per cent. similarannual growth record country participate pacific rim banknote conference,which include china, korea, philippines, australia number asian country wellas canada unite states. in countries, include australia, ratio ofcurrency circulation measure national production around high several decades.underlying expansion shift overall demand towards hold cash non-transactionalreasons, store wealth precautionary balance. even so, use cash fortransactions purpose still grow countries, albeit slow pace. there is, fact, onlyone country world – sweden – transaction demand cash retreat. this isbecause cash transactions, despite lose prominence non-cash payment methods, still offerfeatures people find desirable – anonymous, exchange settlement instantaneous,and make liability central bank, give people confidence value oftheir exchange. furthermore, cash transaction make non-cash payment system areunavailable, operating, relatively expensive use compare use cash.﻿[3]﻿[4] the key point that, whatever underlie causes, degree resilience demandfor cash. arguably, resilience strong asian region region's largepopulation. in china, world's populous country, growth currency circulation hasaveraged around 5 per cent annually past four year even though country has, thesame time, experience dramatic shift electronic form payment – dramatic, fact,than countries. correspondingly, china's annual demand banknote substrate isaround 30,000 tonnes, 30 per cent annual global substrate demand. the picture broadlythe india indonesia, strong cultural factor also underpin demand cash.together, china, india indonesia, make estimate 55 per cent global consumption ofbanknote substrate.by measure, reasonable assume momentum behind banknote demand thesecountries alone take time reverse direction.investment physical cash infrastructurethe second reason believe journey take central bank continue toinvest banknote infrastructure. base quick survey, 22 central bankscurrently upgrade banknote or, least, do past years. a slightly largernumber central bank – 23 – underway recently complete upgrade theirprinting and/or banknote process centres. china, hong kong, india, malaysia, philippinesas well canada unite state feature group country upgrade printingand process operations. australia feature groups. a i mention earlier, areupgrading banknote sophisticate security features. we also final stage offitting recently complete storage facility automate banknote process equipment. thefacility – several kilometre north melbourne's cbd – double existingstorage capacity increase process capacity around 50 per cent.expenditures print equipment, secure storage process significant investments. it isdifficult get precise number every case but, extrapolate report figures, totalinvestment print process across 23 central bank i identify survey amountsto estimate $4¼ billion (us$3½ billion).the key point central bank could get investment decision wrong.even endpoint community use much le cash, investment newprinting automate process equipment serve keep production process costsdown happens. either way, size investment decision central bank banknoteinfrastructure base central bank position continue manage use ofphysical cash time.﻿[5] bring it all togetherpulling think together, prospect decline use banknote likely begradual, particularly region world, good news high security print industry,of course, least far print banknote concerned. it suggest demand centralbanks recent year banknote print durable substrate moresophisticated security feature likely continue.this good news, however, without qualification. it would unrealistic believe centralbanks keep pay increasingly high unit price banknotes. underlie demand forlonger last substrate new, automate cash process centre desire manage thecosts banknote lifecycle finely medium long term. they want substratesand security feature competitive prices. they may also change strategies. it possible, theuse physical cash decline technology advances, central bank find strategicallybetter shift make small regular change banknote design functionality rather thanlarge, decades-apart upgrade full banknote series. they also want access detail dataabout performance various banknote feature various stage banknote life cycle,allowing finely manage investment banknote durability security theuncertainty future banknote demand. this may mean award contract design print anew single-denomination banknote complete new series may become le common. it may,instead, become common award contract print single new feature incorporate itinto exist banknote design.if banknote stay long hand public, seem likely, too, central bank willrequire note security feature overt. that is, security easilyseen look note easily scan banknote smart phone. banknotespresently roughly balance mix overt covert security features.so opportunity challenge ahead high security print industry. both seemmore acute asian region large population cultural connection usingphysical cash. that conference important timely. it opportunity shareexperiences, consider new technology techniques, and, benefit these, discus andplan strategy change likely occur next decade. i encourage makethe opportunity next day i look forward talk

villeroy de galhau, governor banque de france i please close conference “economic financial regulation era big data”. i london morning i therefore regret miss discussion issue i consider paramount importance. let thank warmly speakers, particular benoit coeuré, member board ecb, open conference philip-hans franses, professor eramus school economics, i tell give outstanding lecture. big data indeed deserve global view, number angles. it objective conference i grateful you, presenter participants, make possible. in close conference, i come back specificity big data numerous usages. all presentation give fresh look big data i sure excellent basis, discussion continue beyond one day conference issue key importance us. i would rather like focus consequence big data economy general central bank particular. i develop three parts: 2 i. big data significant economic effects. it particular change relationship member financial community community non-financial world ii. regard big data, central bank switch observer status user player position, imply significant change perform part activity iii. big data raise regulatory issue cannot solve within national context require global reflection public authorities. i. big data significant economic effects. entry cost carry financial transaction already reduce low future. customer knowledge, particular regard condition apply financial institutions, enhance generally information asymmetry client provider financial service narrow. big data powerful card play gafas native non-financial firm develop new activities. the financial industry therefore adapt rapidly face data revolution compete new entrants, protect privacy increase cyber risk particular. all all, competition increase, beneficial economy. the flip side enhance risk financial stability, imply new form vigilance central banker particular. i elaborate bite late on. ii. terabyte data available come soon. central bank collect granular data. this clear opportunity good forecast even nowcasting. but reap benefits, central bank technological challenge, huge. they also face much large competition new data era, view maintain trust public information. they therefore become big data player observers. this require significant efforts. let illustrate five avenue adapt digital evolution. a) the big data era imply large change it infrastructure strong determination address novel technical challenge build forward-looking data management analysis scheme. at banque de france, build data lake cover new data functionalities, data collection machine learning. 3 b) central bank also organise answer legitimate request academic access wide range granular data, modern researcher-friendly way. at banque de france, open one year ago data room give access 600 million anonymized series, already attract 30 research teams. harvest big data capacity begin central bank race. c) data quality maintain time. there central bank input/output process ‘garbage in, garbage out’. manage huge volume data, carry machine deep learn require invest human automatic data technology, train hire data analyst scientists. indeed, big data require novel significant human resources, anticipate properly managed. d) the appetite real time intelligence, “short-termism” inflate big data revolution, entail risk “bad data chase good ones”, thereby impede understand economic financial development general public media. we must best kill fake news, also economic fake news. but, society communication information, deliver data good quality, always trademark central banks, hardly answer. central bank need make publication clearer, readable, visible. in particular, want sound data share used, speak every one experts. we “b c” “b b”: cultural shift beyond mere technology change. e) central bank i would say public authority general work silos. data share must. in france, excellent cooperation national statistical institute share day-to day basis many data supervisor central banker issue deep wider. which bring last point. iii. big data raise issue cannot solve national context require public global reflection. very large worldwide corporates hugely leverage big data. public authority forge answer concern may arise international level. which theme addressed? i would like propose leads. 4 1) data share develop worldwide basis, rightly underline imf ‘data gap initiative’ launch g20. in europe, exist legal provision authorize data share supervisor central banker could become prescriptive largely implement practice country concerned. data share tax authority public administration facilitated, subject respect individual privacy course. 2) private innovation foster growth increase economic efficiency. it therefore discourage disenable regulations. at time, would beneficial economy long run, financial stability specifically, global actor handle enormous volume data physical person well private entities, comply 3 core principles: security, transparency, accountability. in fully interconnect world, cannot effectively address country level. i therefore believe would useful international organization carry reflection issue recommendation regard. let thank attention wish pleasant weekend parisian pleasant journey back home... today i hope sunday! janet l yellen: the current economic outlook monetary policy testimony m janet l yellen, chair board governor federal reserve system, joint economic committee, u congress, washington dc, 29 november 2017.* * *chairman tiberi, rank member heinrich, member committee, i appreciate theopportunity testify today. i discus current economic outlook monetarypolicy.the economic outlookthe u.s. economy strengthen year. smooth volatility cause bythe recent hurricanes, job gain average 170,000 per month january throughoctober, somewhat slow pace last year still range estimate willbe consistent absorb new entrant labor force come years. with job gainsthis year, 17 million american employ eight year ago. meanwhile, theunemployment rate, stand 4.1 percent october, fall 0.6 percentage point sincethe turn year nearly 6 percentage point peak 2010. in addition, laborforce participation rate change little, net, recent years, another indication ofimproving condition labor market, give downward pressure participation rateassociated age population. however, despite labor market gains, wage growthhas remain relatively modest. unemployment rate african american hispanics,which tend sensitive overall economic condition whites, havemoved down, net, past year near level last see recession.that said, remain case unemployment rate minority group noticeablyhigher nation overall.meanwhile, economic growth appear step subdue pace early theyear. after rise annual rate 1-1/4 percent first quarter, u.s. inflation-adjusted gross domestic product (gdp) currently estimate increase 3 percentpace second third quarter despite disruption economic activity thirdquarter cause recent hurricanes. moreover, economic expansion increasinglybroad base across sector well across much global economy. i expect that, withgradual adjustment stance monetary policy, economy continue expand andthe job market strengthen somewhat further, support fast growth wage incomes.although asset valuation high historical standards, overall vulnerability financialsector appear moderate, bank system well capitalize broad measure ofleverage credit growth remain contained.even step-up growth economic activity strong labor market, inflation hascontinued run 2 percent rate federal open market committee (fomc)judges consistent congressional mandate foster maximum employmentand price stability. increase gasoline price aftermath hurricane temporarilypushed measure overall consumer price inflation, inflation item foodand energy remain surprisingly subdued. the total price index personal consumptionexpenditures increase 1.6 percent 12 month end september, coreprice index, exclude energy food prices, rise 1.3 percent period,about 1/2 percentage point slow year earlier. in view, recent low read oninflation likely reflect transitory factors. a transitory factor fade, i anticipate inflationwill stabilize around 2 percent medium term. however, also possible year’slow inflation could reflect something persistent. indeed, inflation thecommittee’s 2 percent objective past five years. against backdrop, the1 / 2bis central bankers' speech fomc indicate intend carefully monitor actual expect progress toward ourinflation goal.although economy job market generally quite strong, real gdp growth beendisappointingly slow expansion relative early decades. one key reason thisslowdown retirement old member baby-boom generation andhence slow growth labor force. another key reason unusually sluggishpace productivity growth recent years. to generate sustain boost economic growthwithout cause inflation high, need address underlie causes. in thisregard, congress might consider policy encourage business investment capitalformation, improve nation’s infrastructure, raise quality educational system, andsupport innovation adoption new technologies.monetary policyi turn implication recent economic development outlook monetarypolicy. with ongoing strengthen labor market condition outlook inflation returnto 2 percent next couple years, fomc continue gradually reduce policyaccommodation. the committee raise target range federal fund rate 1/4percentage point march june meetings, range stand 1 1-1/4percent. and, october, committee begin balance sheet normalization program, whichwill gradually predictably reduce security holdings. the committee set limit thepace balance sheet reduction; limit guard outsized move interestrates potential market strains. indeed, little, any, market effectassociated balance sheet runoff date. we foresee need alter balancesheet program, but, say june, would prepare resume reinvestments amaterial deterioration economic outlook warrant sizable reduction federalfunds rate.changes target range federal fund rate continue committee’s primarymeans adjust stance monetary policy. at meet early month, decidedto maintain exist target range federal fund rate. we continue expect gradualincreases federal fund rate appropriate sustain healthy labor market andstabilize inflation around fomc’s 2 percent objective. that expectation base viewthat current level federal fund rate remain somewhat neutral level—that is,the rate neither expansionary contractionary keep economy operate aneven keel. the neutral rate currently appear quite low historical standards, imply thatthe federal fund rate would rise much get neutral policy stance. if theneutral level rise somewhat time, fomc participant expect, additional gradualrate hike would likely appropriate next year sustain economic expansion.of course, policy preset course; appropriate path federal fund rate willdepend economic outlook inform incoming data. the committee note itwill carefully monitor actual expect inflation development relative symmetric inflationgoal. more generally, determine time size future interest rate adjustments, thecommittee take account wide range information, include measure labor marketconditions, indicator inflation pressure inflation expectations, read financialand

introduction resolution come long way since g20 leader put together post-crisis financial reform agenda summit london pittsburgh 2009.1 in ways, represent notable gap, significant change pre-crisis regulatory architecture. nearly ten year on, huge progress make establish effective resolution arrangement commitment end too-big-to-fail (tbtf) undimmed. the immediate priority effort put place necessary legal frameworks. agreement 2011 financial stability board (fsb) key attribute effective resolution regime provide international standard ensure consistent approach design resolution regime

attribute jurisdiction home global systemically important bank (g-sibs). but key attribute effective resolution regime rather resolvable firm – define tool-kit use it; process resolution plan g-sibs would make firm resolvable. power without resolvability leaf resolution authority vulnerable. indeed, moral recent failure near-failures resolution misguide work, work firm regulate supervise way make

progressively want risk appetite. and though yet finally need be, do already yield significant benefits. for example rat agency largely remove government support uplift bank’ credit ratings.3 where uk firm come stress, resolution arrangement one factor help secure recovery. today i want review journey: do leave do. i want focus particular three topics: 1 see fsb ‘declaration strengthen financial

give default words). all three area build core work resolvability already done, illustrate point process incremental resolvability binary progressive. resolvability firm let start review already done. i focus standard guidance come fsb. it true draw application g-sibs crisis management group (cmgs). but view, equally applicable domestic systemically important bank (d-sibs) firm bail-in prefer resolution strategy, especially firm operate cross-border. the convergence international level bail-in appropriate strategy large bank significant. this transcend whether firm single point entry multiple point entry. and whether bail-in effect use bail-in tool operate bank application bridge bank tool hold company level. it represent realisation end tbtf must bail-ins instead bail-outs loss

critical functions. hence focus two dimensions: - loss absorbency: firm need tlac right amount (enough absorb loss provide recapitalisation firm continue meet requirement authorisation); right form

resolvability, i want pick three area focus period ahead. (a) internal mrel the first internal mrel. one lesson crisis bring home distribution resource within group matters. while life, firm might want run business line consolidate basis, failure resolution occur legal entity level. it understandable since crisis discernible tendency host authority hold onto resources, capital liquidity, force activity branch subsidiaries. the aim fsb level tlac lean tendency towards fragmentation international group provide comfort authority cross-border, group would sufficient external tlac resolvable also resource would prepositioned internal tlac material subsidiary host jurisdictions. previous international regulation financial resource group has, like basel accord, typically focus consolidate level. now apply tlac regulation legal entity level bring challenges. one timing: hard roll internal tlac group tlac requirement place jurisdiction relevant material subsidiaries. the bank middle consult internal mrel policy10 many jurisdiction – notably bank union, switzerland japan – still set policy. another challenge arithmetic: extent financial dependency legal entity within group sum solo rwas likely great consolidate rwas. if full tlac requirement apply subsidiary sum internal tlac would exceed consolidate tlac requirement group whole. 9 the bank england publish loss-absorbing capacity requirement major uk bank 2016 shortly respond treasury committee’s inquiry capital. see http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/treasury-committee/capital-and-resolution/written/69208.pdf. 10 the bank england publish consultation paper approach set minimum requirement fund eligible liability (mrel) within group 2 october 2017. see https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/financial-stability/resolution/internal-mrel-consultation-october-2017.pdf?la=en&hash=33594c3fb3c7f1d129033afe4e3a2bf20a4f9aa8 . all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 6 6 this address tlac term sheet two ways: - limit internal tlac subgroup subsidiary material group, account 5% rwas income. the logic level failure material entity might trigger resolution group whole; problem small entities, even might house function critical host jurisdiction, recovery matter. - include provision internal mrel subgroup scale single point entry (spe) group 75-90% requirement would apply subgroup standalone basis. the logic give interdependence business model spe firms, prepositioning range would sufficient secure cooperation deter host ring-fencing, home authority cut off, foreign subsidiaries. prepositioning resource way provide concrete underpin cooperation go beyond paper commitment cooperate memorandum understand (mous), honour breach previous cross-border failures. even restriction may still sum part problem sum tlac requirement solo level push external requirements. if internal tlac requirement high also likely stand way hold surplus top group could provide flexibility cover loss concentrate particular part group. thus internal mrel policy intention first consider set internal mrel generally firm bottom 75-90% range.11 but set high requirement doubt about: home resolution strategy, availability surplus top group lack reciprocity mrel-setting jurisdiction (that others set 90% end range). we expect say surplus mrel form hold readily available come finalise internal mrel policy next year. another important objective u set policy internal mrel avoid distortion sequence loss absorption operate company (opco) group hold company (holdco). we require uk bank issue external mrel holdcos, structurally subordinate liability opco. the issuance proceed onlent opco internal mrel broadly mirror external form, example: tier 2 could onlent tier 2, at1 at1 senior debt holdco would downstreamed internal debt instrument sit senior capital instrument junior operate liability opco. we need sure loss incur operate company absorb order follow opco creditor hierarchy bypass certain instruments. the aim single point 11 our start point calibrate internal mrel ring-fenced bank sub-groups would 90%, possibility could scale sufficient readily deployable resources. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 7 7 entry bail-in strategy, name suggests, put one entity top group resolution, preferably hold company use issue capital instrument market otherwise limit operate liabilities. write conversion internal mrel instrument via contractual trigger allow operate company low group recapitalised automatically without put resolution. but legacy non-equity capital instrument opcos without requisite contractual trigger could cut across this. we want spar bear loss want trigger. and so, clear instrument count mrel beyond 31 december 2021 mature work firm remove represent barrier resolution strategy. this part large effort add credibility resolution clear debt investor stakeholder bail-in work practice. we want debt investor able price risk effectively clear rank creditor hierarchy give confidence stick hierarchy apply loss pick winner loser within class. count mrel senior debt issue operate company without subordination look like recipe undermine confidence. (b) bail-in execution we also want clear resolution authority conduct resolution way preserve value distribute fairly, ensure creditor bad protection met. to end, think hard valuation capability need

bank chile’s twenty-first annual conference “monetary policy financial stability: transmission mechanism policy implications” open remark governor mario marcel good morning welcome twenty-first annual conference central bank chile. it pleasure host event every year give u opportunity reflect discus issue direct implication work central banker broad perspective. i look forward active discussion rest week year’s conference theme: monetary policy financial stability. ten year pass since onset global financial crisis still deal economic consequences. but learn lot, decade hindsight cause long-lasting effect lead u rethink way conduct monetary policy, ensure financial stability, two element are, be, interconnected. one important policy lesson crisis concern relevance actively seek financial stability context ever-increasing financial complexity. and central bank worldwide increasingly involve assure this, since become clear financial stability pre-condition price stability. although financial stability long key concern policymakers, particularly emerge country financial vulnerability are, were, evident risk stability often come abroad, nowadays key concern act preemptive way action costly, ensure financial stability future. how macroeconomic policy pursue goal financial stability normal times, benefit uncertain cost noticeable? a many well know, concern come observation buildup risk unite state crisis occur period stable price output, call “great moderation” period, low nominal interest rate consistent central bank’s commitment cpi inflation stability may lead excessive risk-taking financial intermediaries, rise asset prices, good economic condition mask develop financial imbalances. in aftermath crisis, policy rate drastically reduce diverse policy measure implement zero-lower bind become active constraint. but increase concern financial condition consequent reassessment macroeconomic policy framework evident adoption macroprudential 2 policies. but question remain role monetary policy. should monetary policy framework explicitly incorporate risk financial stability? this, so-called lean against wind debate, become one hotly debate issue macroeconomics, policy well academic circles, one main topic discuss learn couple days. let contribute debate perspective policymaker small-open economy like chile. in case, financial vulnerability often relate large volatile capital flows, consequent effect asset price credit spreads. in context, raise interest rate normal time due financial stability concern law strategy would prescribe, may counterproductive would attract capital flows, would tend appreciate domestic currency would encourage foreign-currency borrowing. these mechanisms, course, core monetary policy develop country many years. in case chile, evident 90 capital control place try give autonomy monetary policy context persistent large capital inflows. however, mechanism relevant well debate role monetary policy actively pursue objective financial stability. a second issue i would like point relate credibility central bank, also important concern emerge economy like chile, credibility gain several decade responsible policymaking, lose would mean costly institutional setback. a strong advantage monetary policy focus exclusively price stability simplify communication enhance accountability, result positive effect credibility. add different objective would hind transparency, endanger anchor inflation expectations. however, independently convenience follow law strategy keep pre-crisis consensus monetary policy focus primarily price stability, i convince main lesson crisis regulatory framework aim specific sector market key element defense financial disruptions. macroprudential policies, particular monetary policy, substitute efficient regulatory framework. microeconomic policy target much close source market imperfections, mitigate effect time avoid economy-wide cost contractionary macroeconomic policies. we cannot forget inefficiency regulatory framework heart buildup risk run-up crisis. the fact fragility financial system, namely inadequate level capitalization liquidity, properly timely identified, may primarily reflect inadequacy regulation supervision. 3 our best response continue strengthen regulation supervision regime aim avoid future crises. and central bank crucial role play clear complementarity financial monetary stability, which, case chile, often formally recognize central banks’ official mandates. before refer do matter chile, let briefly describe experience global financial crisis macroeconomic policy response it. while still enjoy commodity boom 2000s, hit spillover effect crisis aftermath, namely tighten domestic lend conditions, capital outflows, reduction external demand export decrease price copper, still main source external income chilean economy, particular important source revenue treasury. the price critical commodity fell 60 percent five months. export fell almost 20 percent two years, strong shock economy export account 40 percent gdp. a similar drop experience public revenues, come copper production fall 23 percent 2008 50 percent follow year. despite severity shocks, economic performance resilience financial system good comparable situation past. behind favorable response chilean economy lie macroeconomic policy framework able pursue effective reaction, regulatory scheme support high resilience domestic financial system. in chile monetary policy framework consist flexible inflation-targeting regime float exchange rate. this framework allow u respond efficiently external shock keep inflation expectation anchored. before asian crisis 1998, manage exchange rate capital control place allow monetary policy independence manage inflation context abundant capital inflows. indeed, experience costly adjustment episode, fuel part financial stability concern call exchange rate adjustment. but hard time passed, exchange rate allow float freely, facilitate external adjustment shock also improve incentive private agent properly hedge foreign currency operations. the deep-rooted credibility central bank also facilitate conduct monetary policy float exchange rate system. the fact market understand central bank pursue goal inflation 24-month horizon mean exchange rate pass-through inflation relatively low, indeed low region. this illustrate reluctance central bank tighten monetary policy 2015 despite 49 percent devaluation 2014-2016, without affect 24-months-ahead inflation expectations, remain anchor target level. 4 a 2007 financial crisis unfold effect spread-out, framework help u avoid large cost evade financial problem despite strong tie global economy. in aftermath crisis local currency depreciate around 45 percent seven months, monetary policy rate reduce relatively high level 8.25 percent december 2008 point five percent july 2009, remain year. together low interest rate, central bank implement program liquidity provision significantly reduce market interest rate level much close monetary policy rate. additionally, middle 2009 establish term liquidity facility bank institutions, grant 90- 180-day liquidity prevail monetary policy rate, signal expansionary path monetary policy rate market expected. the active monetary policy response, together expansionary fiscal policy, favor healthy fiscal position achieve thank fiscal rule expenditure determine function long-run copper price economic growth, facilitate rapid adjustment. after one period negative annual growth 2009, economy able sustain growth rate 4 percent year followed. the inflation rate fell well target range year, inflation expectation remain well anchor target 3 percent two-year horizon. undoubtedly strong countercyclical macroeconomic policy response ever implement shock magnitude, possible thank sound corporate sector, well-capitalized resilient financial sector, solid position term international liquidity. importantly discussion ahead, result careful regulation supervision individual financial institutions. this scheme hail back bank crisis 1980s, constantly adapt improve since then. in chile, financial service regulate supervise different institution accord type service; security insurance, pension system unemployment insurance, banks. in case banks, superintendence bank financial institution central bank charge. different scheme design facilitate coordination institutions. this effort lead recently creation financial market commission, head autonomous board director transform financial supervision regulation scheme integrate one, systemic view stability risk face financial sector flexibility deal critical situations. the central bank chile enjoy special independent status bank‘s constitutional organic law. besides specific regulatory task regard bank sector, central bank oversee foreign exchange regulation monitor closely 5 constantly industry make financial sector. a central task perform central bank aim financial stability publication financial stability report, twice year. the bank regulation evolve gradually steadily, adopt prove international standard best practices. a new general bank law provide gradual convergence basel iii framework, raise quality, consistency transparency capital base; strengthen risk hedging; introduce leverage limits; promote countercyclical capital framework; introduce global liquidity standard. these requirement implement gradually 2019. they provide high stability sustainability contribute chile’s reputation access international markets. chile largely comply principle financial market infrastructure establish bis. an assessment make world bank imf last year identify high level compliance principle part entity assessed, well authorities. the main conclusion chile sound robust financial market infrastructures, line international standard best practice risk management, finality irrevocability settlement, efficiency transparency. the chilean financial market is, general, deep latin american countries, large institutional investor great maturity. banks' capital adequacy indicator similar economy region, low oecd countries, exposure credit risk low relative oecd emerge economies. the world economic forum bank strength index show chilean bank sector strong, rank 11th place world. let finish point relevance exchange rate derivative market favor financial stability conduct flexible inflation target scheme chile. this market deep develop countries, experience significant growth 10-fold since 1998, fuel part, i already mentioned, float exchange rate regime. the role pension fund significant well, maintain large positive foreign financial position, keep hedge exchange rate risk even regulatory requirements, especially aftermath last crisis. thank factor favorable regulation, chile show high level penetration financial derivative compare emerge economy country region. all contribute limit exchange rate mismatch corporations. today share firm mismatch 10 percent asset 10 percent, around 20 percent crisis. hence monetary policy conduct countercyclical manner, without need manage exchange rate. however, recent experience develop country revealed, rapid development derivative 6 market also pose challenge regulator due complexity potential concentration risk entities. an additional strength chilean economy context emerge countries, i think important topic discuss days, relevance institutional investors, particularly pension funds. their role financial stability go well beyond development derivative markets. they contribute deepen capital markets, portfolio diversification, development new financial products, among features. moreover, peso-denominated liability large foreign position, around 35 percent gdp case pension funds, facilitate conduct monetary policy important source liquidity foreign currency needed. acknowledge this, financial regulation gradually expand scope possible investment institutional investors, include raise limit investment abroad. let finish thank distinguish group economist join u present discus issue concern monetary policy financial stability. i would like thank also alvaro aguirre, markus brunnermeier, diego saravia catalina larraín put together program, paloma navarro carola besa help

broad consensus economy south east europe region, first halfof 2017, register satisfactory performance term recovery; meantime, accordingto key indicators, performance expect strengthen third quarter thisyear. albania exception regional context.in previous quarter, economic financial situation albania set path ofconstant improvement. growth employment indicator follow upward curve andexpectations 2018 remain positive. consumption foreign investment contributedpositively economic activity expect generate increase productivity andcompetitiveness. at time, income export goods, especially servicescontributed reduction current deficit strengthen external position ofthe economy. the effect monetary policy maintain stimulate trend, aim atclosing negative gap price output.financial stability also characterise positive situation. the notable decline non-performing loan balance sheet bank system prominent achievement 1 / 4bis central bankers' speech aspect. the measure take mid-2016 produce substantial effect, materialisedin reduction non-performing loan around 10 percentage points, maximumlevel register 2015. it always pleasure note credit growth positive. inparticular,

administrator monetary policy regulator supervisor ofthe bank system. this first step follow step relate segment thefinancial market, security capital markets, include establishment therelevant supervisory regulatory institutions.initiatives aspect promote constant expansion financial market, termsof diverse institution number financial product trade volumes. yet, despitethese developments, financial system remain dominate bank system andrelevant development it. the last financial stability report bank albania state thatbanks account around 90% total financial system assets, equivalent 92% gdp,whereas rest financial sector share 10% financial system total assets.assessments study bank albania, well comparative study third parties,particularly international monetary fund, show financial distribution expansionin albanian financial market close equilibrium, dictate albanian economy andconsumers. moreover, financial intermediation indicators, percentage grossdomestic product, similar level country region.the dominance bank segment naturally lead high level concentration offinancial product service favour. more 80% resident investment thefinancial system form deposit current account banks. only little than12% form government securities, whereas rest, around 6.5%, invest ininvestment private pension funds, account 0.1% total financial system assets.statistics show small number company operate segment financialsector, activity term domestic product financial market remainsinsignificant.regarding above, may logically conclude financial market architecture may beconsidered complete yet. financial instrument long-term maturity rare, whereas theshort-term one outside bank system apathetic fragmented, term bothproducts markets. an outcome financial architecture kind add pressureon bank system, deprive economy finance alternatives, beyond thebanks offer.this vacuum may fill strain effort bank system. it broadlyaccepted segment financial market play complementary rather thansubstituting role. i could mention number example illustrate point, momenti would rather not, next panel issue discuss great detail 2 / 4bis central bankers' speech colleague academic day.overall, elaboration regard investment-related financial institution financialinstruments. however, must note similar problem characterise extreme ofthe financial market, corporate – enterprise sector – call albania. bank ofalbania survey show micro unit face shortage financial resource limitedaccess credit. thus, 1/3 respondent enterprise consider low level accessto finance cost relate main cause expand activity. these microunits, basically family-run businesses, great need cooperate non-bankfinancial institutions, due difficulty fulfil requirement collateral ordetailed financial documentation, criterion bank require. this another argument leadsto logical conclusion that, addition capital bank credit, enterprise wouldbenefit greatly segment financial market.the low level financial inclusion population another element prevent thedeepening expansion financial market albania. late data worlddevelopment indicator show 38% adult account financial institution,while 6% 22% adult credit card debit card, respectively. financialinclusion may increase bank system. the financial system,especially capital market corporate security market play significant role inincreasing financial inclusion.i take opportunity emphasise that, addition need expand deepen thefinancial market, necessary increasingly pay attention management risk

important driver behind good performance domestic demand thevery favourable finance condition firm households, heavily contingent onour policy measures.however, positive development also reflect pay-off year balance sheet repair,institution-building – national union level – structural reforms.in bank sector, enhance regulation supervision steer sector towardssafer business model strong

progress five key priority area include labour, productmarkets, tax transfer system well financial sector reform oecdcountries – show increase reform momentum euro area country since thestart crisis. result european commission’s labour market reform database(labref) show similar trend. in addition, commission assess least “someprogress” make around two-thirds country-specific recommendation issuedbetween 2011 2016.even important, increase number empirical study confirm positive economic1231 / 5bis central bankers' speech impact reforms. for instance, italy introduction new permanent contract in2015 lead 5% increase new gross hires. along similar lines, spanish labour marketreform find increase likelihood exit unemployment employment,while direct transition temporary permanent position also ease thereform. meanwhile, evidence base micro-data portuguese firm show theliberalisation product market lift productivity downstream industries, even theshort run. and research show even smaller-scale reform particular thatcan reduce fix cost firms, measure reduce red tape, significantpositive effects.these positive development mask long-term challenge euro area stillfacing. our estimate potential growth decline substantially past two decade – inpart due decline multifactor productivity growth. the public sector debt ratio remainselevated, population ageing. overall, structural indicator still reveal substantial gaps,both euro area country relative best performers.this matter welfare social cohesion within individual countries. it also mattersfor function monetary union. if country different economic structures, theirbusiness cycle diverge face common shocks: return quickly trendgrowth full employment, others require long period recession price andquantities fully adjust. by contrast, better, mutually compatible economic structure amongcountries support growth sustainable basis produce le dispersion recessionshit. reform improve economic structure make country resilient singlemonetary policy effective.the current economic expansion offer unique window opportunity make progressin europe’s reform agenda. during good times, country good afford adjustment costsof reform may fiscal space available compensate loser (see oecd, 2012).as christine lagarde recently remind us: “the time repair roof sun isshining”.history, alas, suggest rarely happens. in good times, reform tend face strongopposition, break time economic demise, either follow longperiod economic decline wake severe crisis. evidence crisis-led reform isplentiful: instance, latin american trade reform 1980s 1990s, alsothe recent experience euro area go direction.so thing good future? structural reform nothing new europe’s policydebate. they discuss since 1970s, european growth employmentstarted fall behind unite states. the substantial step-up reform momentumduring crisis revive debate along three dimensions: trade-off short-term cost long-run benefits, distributional incidence structural reforms, finally thescope reform agenda.first, trade-off short-term cost long-run benefits. the long-run benefit ofreforms largely undisputed, potential short-term cost increasingly beenhighlighted. such undesirable effect materialise number channels. reformsthat enhance competition displace worker capital short run. in bad economictimes, risk factor production absorb new entrants,thereby aggravate recession. reform low wage depress consumer demand inthe short term rapidly offset employment gain prospect future productivity-related income gain would materialise normal times.to ensure expansionary effect reform dominate short run, thesequencing reform policy mix matter. a regard sequencing, research shown45678910 2 / 5bis central bankers' speech outcome may good product market reform precede labour market reform ifproduct market reform focus reduce entry barrier service sector large pent-updemand. a regard policy mix, fiscal space, imf research underscoredthe beneficial effect carefully design fiscal package overcompensate theshort-run cost reforms.second, distributional effect reforms. that growth necessarily distribution-neutralalready draw attention towards end 1960s. the macroeconomic disruption thatfollowed oil crisis mid-1970s, however, completely overshadow distributional issues,as research priority shift towards macroeconomic stabilisation structural adjustment ofinefficient economies.recent experience research however show growth actually difficult toachieve without equity. moreover, highlight benefit reform term ofmacroeconomic growth enough make socially acceptable. the distributionalcosts reform trigger heat debate quarter term “structuralreforms” even perceive “toxic”.the feel growth recent year become le inclusive bear data.income inequality oecd country stand historical high household disposableincomes across euro area country remain pre-crisis levels, especially thepoorest member society. social transfer continue play important role dampen theeffects inequality, although become le effective since mid-1990s.in environment, must ensure distributional impact reform notignored. one way practice focus reform entail double dividend:increasing equity lift growth. example include measure facilitate accumulationof human capital, reduce labour market dualism abolish product market regulation stiflecompetition. back 2006, lisbon council think tank already flag importance ofraising enhance human capital policy brief “innovation work: the europeanhuman capital index”. in particular “routine-biased technological change” increasinglypermeating transform world work, high-quality education train system arevital ensure worker withstand disruption cause change benefit fromit. another way account distributional impact reform – reform thathave unavoidable negative distributional cost – work “smart redistribution” packages.smart redistribution necessarily take form fiscal transfer. what laid-off workersmost want new job. hence public policy could focus help people back intowork, job develop refine skills.finally, third dimension relate scope reform agenda. structural reform shouldnot limit product labour market reforms. strong institution well-functioningfinancial sector national euro area level necessary condition ensure theimpact reform actually materialises. our reform agenda sufficiently broadand tackle bind constraint economy. this require country-specific country-tailored solution allow member state find exploit comparativeadvantages single market. but mean country reform independentlyof other.indeed, ensure convergence, country necessarily need economicstructures, need ensure economic structure foster resilience andcontribute homogeneous transmission common shocks. for example, one set ofcountries focus mainly reform make wage adjust quickly response shocks,and another reform produce adjustment employment, first group recovermore quickly second. research show country converge their101112131415161718192021 3 / 5bis central bankers' speech response shock broadly similar mix labour market institution – put itanother way, broadly similar phillips curves. encouragingly, research find change inlabour market institution since creation single currency actually contribute amore homogeneous transmission common shocks. however, dispersion could still beconsiderably reduced.from euro area perspective, thus vital ensure sufficient resilience convergenceamong country benefit monetary union, much interfere withnational social choices.so bring question: role european institution play ensure resilienceand convergence among euro area countries? while responsibility structural reform hasso far primarily national level, european institution strong coordinate role toplay.however, rely merely rule coordination achieve mutually beneficial outcome maynot always sufficient. in areas, bank sector policy, move system ofrules guideline national economic policymaking system sovereignty-sharing within common institution highly beneficial union memberstates.over recent year quantum leap forward take move decentralise bankingsupervision resolution single supervisory mechanism single resolutionmechanism, base single rulebook. these step create condition deep anddurable financial integration. it remain essential complete bank union itsdimensions. to underpin confidence durable way area-wide financial system, bothsupervisory responsibility fiscal backstop need european level. just asnecessary establishment european deposit insurance system.strengthening economic monetary union (emu) will, time, require u make progressin policy areas. in monetary union, policy area see isolation. each interactswith affect others. after year reform efforts, increase risk fatigue issetting in: “reform fatigue” “integration fatigue” may increasingly reduce willingnessto fix flaw design emu. this reluctance may intensify currentgood economic times, reduce sense urgency. this important toresolutely pursue debate complete economic monetary union.to conclude, euro area currently broad-based solid expansion. while monetarypolicy still play important role sustain recovery, “the game town”.years balance sheet repair, institution-building – national supranational level – andstructural reform support recovery. however, let u yet declare victory and“bask warmth recovery”: need do lift growth sustain basisand reduce euro area’s vulnerability shocks. look ahead, well-crafted reform thatcombine growth

practice time mean raise money carry war france. today, mission still promote good people unite kingdom, maintain monetary financial stability. let explain means. maintain monetary stability mean two things. first, provide banknote use trust. we 3 billion note currently use, use 44% transactions. second, mean maintain low stable inflation. maintain financial stability mean three things. first, make sure put money bank safe. second, mean bank fails, cost fall bank’s investor senior management, ordinary people deposit banks. and finally mean make sure take insurance contract, pay whatever insure happens. the work bank area ultimately sum simply: maintain confidence money. this confidence not, though end itself; mean end. confidence money provide foundation prosperity. without it,

impact finance amsterdam, 23 november 2017 if would take close look thing done, perhaps bite critical. so far, climate-risk relate work focus climate-related risks. we’ve look energy transition could impact economy, we’ve look financial sector risk climate change energy transition. but critical, supervisory mandate we’re mostly focus climate risks. but isn’t climate one sdgs? aren’t 16 sdgs? and couldn’t sdgs physical transition risk economy therefore financial sector? the principle manifesto pose serious question serious times. question also ask struggle answer. ---- good afternoon everyone, welcome dnb. it’s pleasure u host unep finance initiative (fi) today work positive impact finance. a many know, dnb quite active topic sustainable finance. host third party event however something often do. the main reason positive impact finance unambiguously ambitious recognize trait character. challenges… our society face tremendous challenges, face lot time. in term climate; world already one degree warm industrial era. for one thing, cause amount severity storm flood increase, worldwide often deadly result, see far often year. but climate one challenge: nearly 2 billion people worldwide access clean drink water. 700 million people live poverty line almost 2 dollar day. and sub-saharan africa, four five people undernourish 45% child die 5 year old malnutrition. the good news international agreement target issues. we sustainable development goal paris agreements. wouldn’t wonderful like multinational, world would clear strategy? well, world strategy, we, increasingly, see many governments, business investor take step pursue tackle challenges. 2 but also need realistic: long way achieve goals. let’s take look china example. sure, it’s green energy green finance power house today. it’s world’s lead producer solar wind power, it’s large green bond market world. but also us produce 50% coal burn globally. it’s responsible 25% percent daily energy consumption. and co2 emission rise worldwide again, mostly china. so challenge remain. fund transition and what’s challenge finance element. for climate example, estimate additional 1.5 trillion dollar need annually finance require investments. and sdgs combined, estimate 5-7 trillion dollar need annually 2030. a unep fi manifesto rightly states, current initiative together, however impressive, likely enough finance sdg investment gap. and so, needed, accord manifesto, financial sector jointly consider three pillar sustainable development: economic, environmental social. and investment deliver positive contribution one pillars, potential negative impact pillar identify mitigated. eric usher – proud welcome premise - explain think behind unep fi’s conclusion assessment transition new finance paradigm required. that’s right, lady gentleman, new paradigm less! talk ambition… get financial sector base appraisal positive negative impact easy, i’m afraid. in fact, it´ll hard. and done, would require courage, practice perseverance. and probably moment might simply think: fact impossible; simply way achieve this, i even hurt brain this? dutch initiative well, case, please allow share two consideration might make struggle bearable. one: i’d dare say, somewhat chauvinistically, the netherlands among frontrunners world term incorporate sustainability consideration finance. many financial institution ass esg factor investment decisions. base survey recently conducted, 17 28 survey financial institution measure carbon footprint least part balance sheet. and 9 even commit low carbon footprint. furthermore, bank collectively issue climate statement, sdg-dialogue document, international covenant human right project finance. they key player equator principles, carbon disclosure divestment initiatives. many insurer pension funds, bring esg-issues investor calls, esg-engagement strategies. and three top 10 sustainable company worldwide accord canadian investment advisor corporate knight dutch. in short, dutch rather active indeed issue we’ve already fact come quite far. and we’re probably lot people think would 5 10 year ago. so, whenever feel challenge insurmountable, think back stand 10 or, go moment particular pessimism, 20 year ago, stand today. hopefully realization far we’ve progress already, give enough energy keep going. 3 dnb initiative the second consideration - i promise two - alone face challenge. of course, signatory principle manifesto. but actually, central bank supervisor face similar challenge. you see, dnb, i’m sure many know, quite active topic climate risks: physical risk stem climate change, well transition risks, stem legislation market developments. about 2 year ago, issue report call time transition. in report investigate potential impact energy transition dutch economy, note upcoming transition fact one big medium long term challenge economy therefore financial sector. and week ago publish report call waterproof?, take close look climate risk dutch financial sector. in report, conclude 1.5 degree 3.5 degree scenario, climate-related damage expect go due increase frequency intensity severe weather events. this mean insurance premium may go insurer may need hold capital, hold capital severe events. we also find model currently use insurer predict damage adequately take climate change trend account. in term energy transition, warn risk stem new sustainability legislation offices. the dutch government require office build minimum energy label c 2023. this mean office build don’t meet requirement now, five year reach require level, cash flow dry up. our financial sector finance large chunk real estate sector. when cash flow dry up, jeopardize value loans. so big problem? we find average 46% bank loan commercial real estate parties, energy label le c, represent 6 bn euros. these loan run serious risk come years, bank need manage risk. in so, way, discover, indeed course already have, also ample sound business opportunity help client meet legislative deadlines, thus create win win situation business climate. but that’s all. a follow work, right develop physical transition relate stress tests. and hope present result physical stress test come months. we’ve also do work broad question sustainable finance. about year ago publish report responsible invest pension sector. this base requirement dutch law pension fund transparent whether pension fund take esg factor account. we assess whether indeed pension fund include esg investment policy annual report, share good practice saw. last least, use convene power, we’ve found national platform sustainable finance, bring together government, supervisor industry representative entire financial sector. the aim platform promote encourage dialogue sustainable finance financial sector. in addition, platform also allow financial institution form cross-sectoral work group tackle exist problems. one work groups, call platform carbon account financials, pcaf, develop methodology measure carbon footprint six different asset classes. they launch report soon. another work group work sdg impact measurement. it developed, recently launch report, i’m proud they’re here. so we’ve quite active see. and central bank prudential supervisor, we’re actually rather proud work we’ve done. and we’d even dare say among frontrunners europe perhaps even worldwide. 4 a critical look initiatives… but take close look thing we’ve done, perhaps also bite critical. so far, work focus climate-related risks. we’ve look energy transition could impact economy, we’ve look financial sector risk climate change energy transition. so we’re bite critical, supervisory mandate we’re mostly focus climate risks. but isn’t climate one sdgs? aren’t 16 sdgs? and couldn’t sdgs physical transition risk economy therefore financial sector? let’s take look example sdg #15, life land. every year gain 3.5 billion hectare desert. and every year lose 13 million hectare forest. biodiversity also decline alarm pace. a recent study do germany show average insect population decline 75% last 30 years. if government don’t take action stop loss biodiversity, might example one day lead crop failures. and might happen slowly, could perhaps cause reach certain tip points. if happen, obviously, one basic human need would jeopardized. but financial point view, agricultural company might face difficulties, might impact bank finance agriculture sector. and might far reach think would seem important bank aware potential risk biodiversity loss. or sdg #12, sustainable consumption production? about make sure use natural resource sustainable way? what government introduce legislation ensure sustainable use resources? unsustainable company would relatively hard hit, profitability could risk. and thus, financial sector invest stocks, bond loans. move 1 17? in short shouldn’t move work sustainability 1 17 sdgs? couldn’t risk climate? need risk managed? should prudential supervisor broaden focus? and impact? couldn’t research access finance? into potential bottleneck finance sdgs? couldn’t dnb anything say strive impact towards achieve sdgs? would bring u fringe mandate? or possibly beyond? the answer yet clear. fortunately, exactly look 2018. how sdgs fit mandate? it won’t easy us. we don’t exact answer. it’s pioneering. it’s challenging. it’s struggle. but it’s one we’re happy undertake. even this, however, we’ll probably still fall short new paradigm advocate manifesto. because would likely look sdgs separately ass extent pose risk financial sector (both term “physical” term “transition” risks). to extent do, would squarely within mandate. but i know eric call far reach approach. move risk impact, look sdg’s holistically. so lot work do. a lot think do, lot pioneer do. the principle manifesto pose serious question serious times. question also ask struggle answer. so whenever you’re feel like task ahead insurmountable, perhaps find comfort fact supervisor struggle much are. but we’re struggle right direction. page 1 10 leverage good our current economic success address by dr mario vella governor, central bank of malta deliver during the ifs malta annual dinner 01 december 2017 dear president member committee institute financial service (ifs) malta, distinguish guests, personally behalf board central bank malta, i thank annual traditional opportunity address distinguish audience and, it, stakeholders. also personal institutional welcome representative overseas professional body u tonight, london institute bank finance, global association risk professionals, european bank financial service train association. you evidently hold ifs malta high esteem. so we. mr president, please hear many initiative undertake area financial service education commend institute ongoing commitment professional development up-skilling financial service practitioners. this definitely positive contribution sustainability dynamic sector, one commit support effectively. the central bank malta long-standing partner institute. rest assure continue offer support wherever possible. tonight’s event become important date calendar key stakeholder country’s economy, particularly financial service sector. this dinner, fact, provide u opportunity meet together discus go well, page 2 10 go le well, economy le formal environment usually associate discussion economic financial developments. traditionally, central bank avail itself, governor, opportunity occasion give extensive panoramic review malta’s economic performance, view drive results, outline challenge ahead conclude policy recommendations. this year depart tradition. while start overview year’s development discus briefly outlook 2018, use basis broader, thematic, discussion. in recent years, definitely since european sovereign debt crisis, increasingly come realise whilst open economy dependent foreign trade investment, economy show degree resilience adaptability defy expectations, surprise foreign institution and, indeed, too. all forecaster include international monetary fund, european commission, european central bank credit rat agencies, well central bank malta, prove conservative. one could argue comment gdp projection bite unfair much december 2015 projection would base information available time. since projection made, historical data would revised. the forecaster would know subsequent revisions. nevertheless result certainly good expected. let give couple examples. in december 2015 central bank project real gdp growth 2017 3.2%. two year after, believe economic growth reach 6%, nearly double originally projected. back december 2015 anticipate 2017’s unemployment rate 5.4%. now know close 4%, quarter less. more strike divergence fiscal projections. back december 2015 think government would close 2017 deficit 1.1% gdp. today believe surplus 0.9%. two year ago think national debt-to-gdp ratio would 64% gdp 2017. now think nearly ten percentage point le that. page 3 10 malta’s current economic performance two week ago, conclude statement follow annual official staff visit malta, imf say “malta’s economic growth remain one strong europe” project robust performance continue back rise income historically-low unemployment, complement buoyant service exports. they also conclude malta remain surplus economy, term government finance external transactions. this is, broadly speaking, assessment make european commission autumn 2017 forecasts. in fact, commission’s expert forecast year next two, malta high current account surplus percentage gdp euro area countries, “beating” country germany netherlands. whereas, go forward, growth expect moderate somewhat, malta continue out-perform significantly euro area. the commission’s autumn 2017 forecast put u head league table term real gdp growth employment increases. though downside risk stem inward-looking policy abroad uncertain external environment, include impact brexit continent’s economy, domestic demand malta continue grow fast rate, particularly wage growth boost disposable income investment expect remain sustained. in last year’s speech i describe believe condition lead performance. part success attributable cyclical factors, effect ecb’s monetary policy action stimulate euro area economy. accommodative monetary policy boost aggregate demand, locally trade partners, low external value euro, help exporters. we also note strong government investment, partly finance eu funds, help maltese economy. however last year’s speech emphasise current economic growth attributable structural changes, contribute double potential growth rate since global financial crisis. on one hand, due significant improvement labour supply, term quantity quality. part relate inflow foreign workers, success raise female participation page 4 10 improve financial incentive work play key role. on other, also radically transform energy sector, link system european grid bolster investment new power plants. the divergence growth observe rest euro area also due different performance respective financial sectors. malta’s financial system prove stable neighbour countries. our core domestic bank remain sound strong capital ratios, high liquidity healthy profits. asset quality continue improve, bank remain prudent, boost provisions. we believe besides testament prudence local bank community, result also due action regulatory authorities. how address challenge economic success rapid economic growth, malta currently experiencing, bring challenges. opinion survey confirm maltese shift worry cost live economic uncertainty concern environment traffic congestion. this shift also evident level policymakers. in fact policy documents, 2018 pre-budget document budget 2018, stress need upgrade infrastructure enhance environmental protection. similarly, international institution emphasise need shift attention towards sustain growth make inclusive. go back late imf article iv mission, recommendation focus address house market pressures, close infrastructure gap, upskilling reskilling labour force strengthen innovation. we would like discus challenges, outline think financial sector play role help tackle them. the house market in last year’s speech, touch upon need avoid formation asset price bubbles. we quote central bank research indicate house price still equilibrium fundamental value, warn price trend would nevertheless continue closely monitored. house prices, know, continue rise. page 5 10 national statistic data suggest increase 5.3% first half year, 6.1% period 2016 3.2% 2015. that said, house supply respond high demand contribute towards house price inflation. in first seven month 2017 build permit 62% high period 2016 153% high 2015. this increase supply, unless acceleration demand, result house price inflation moderating. this also help reduce pressure rental market, evidence low end cross-country rent-to-wage ratios, move relatively quickly close ratio find expensive european cities. besides impact rise could capacity attract foreign workers, need consider impact maltese tenants, turn impact broad cost business and, consequently, competitiveness. we believe that, go forward, continue grow rate observe recent years, need much dynamic house market. but discuss private provision, let u discus social housing. recent development reinforce case replenish social house stock. however, expansion need accompany change approach. in recent years, malta’s benefit system change create clear incentive shift benefit dependence participation formal labour market. the area happen yet social housing, tendency remain that, allocated, social house tend become lifetime entitlement. we need change social house scheme act activate individual empower rather encourage passivity. such transition could helpful finance expansion social housing. instead see social house passive benefit, eventually develop project become extent self-financing, combination social house provision programme enhance employability individuals, enable eventually pay market rents. the financial sector could play role here. we already see bank partner government offer social loans, begin decrease reliance social house stock. go forward, see possibility innovative initiative house authority partner financial institution develop social house projects. page 6 10 at point, i take opportunity inform central bank malta set lean highly competent proactive social research unit study amongst issues, access credit low income groups. another area need register progress home equity release. we situation many elderly person asset rich cash poor. they live relatively modest pensions, reside large relatively expensive homes. this create issue finance long-term care, many find difficult sell home outright order go private home. if, come years, manage come way release part equity homes, could raise supply available housing, reduce pressure state long-term care institution hospital guarantee good live standard elderly. this, course, need do carefully, sensitively well-regulated environment. once again, believe financial institution key role play here. the rental market another area believe need act, due consideration trade-off involved. any measure restrictive could take u back previous situation rental market utterly dysfunctional. on hand, shy away reform facilitate good function market. we need legal clarity right obligation landlord tenants. we also need market operate formal economy, rent contract duly registered. stabilise sector beneficial economy’s competitiveness, whilst also help address social inequalities. although loan-to-value (ltvs) ratio range 60% 90% (and lately observe shift upper bound) bank largely keep cautious approach extend credit buy-to-let purposes. we think prudence bear witness maturity financial institutions, though caution mortgage credit secondary residence call for. the need long-term investment let’s shift critical gear. at present, financial institution deposit central bank close four time average previous ten years. in essence, growth year deposit maltese resident end deposit u page 7 10 central bank. loan private sector essentially remain flat. take long term perspective, bank lend nonfinancial corporation fall 62% gdp 2009 31% first half year. from situation credit nonfinancial sector amount half bank loans, share fall slightly third. now, usual explanation bank welcome feasible project come forward, decline therefore demand supply driven. moreover, strict regulation bank capital liquidity make life tough bankers, this, argued, warrant high level caution regard project financed. permit me, however, submit fact consideration. the recent imf mission conclude cost bank borrow corporates malta among high euro area, spread widen recent years. in forthcoming report january 2018 furthermore show credit supply constraint impact smes disproportionately. while survey suggest access finance private sector’s main concern, probably due fact firm able finance project funds. over last decade, company shift intragroup loan intercompany lend instead bank loan main source financing. one, course, need distinguish intragroup loan (parent subsidiary subsidiary subsidiaries) think make bulk “intercompany” lend intercompany lend undertake factoring, trade credit loan funds. also bear mind financial institution act relate company (within group) need licence lend other. to give loan outside group (intercompany) one need licence. while beneficial see diversification firms’ finance sources, change raise issues. let u start something discuss last year. we need careful current low interest environment, investors’ search yield stimulate excessive risk-taking. therefore, need complement rise corporate bond issuance significant effort improve investors’ education compel corporates page 8 10 borrow domestic capital market provide information investor creditworthiness. secondly, even believe recent disintermediation process matter choice, reflect firms’ current liquidity, nevertheless beg question would happen economy slow internal fund diminish. we believe disintermediation process go far, resilience future shock could hampered. whenever activity slow down, firm tend cut back investment innovation. moreover central bank, concern environment, transmission monetary policy, mainly occur bank channel, could impaired. this would make hard policymakers react economic needs. the current situation, lot save lie unutilised central bank, seem waste opportunity leverage current success order build good future. at time everybody agree need invest strongly infrastructure upgrade competence workforce – long-term investment –, painful note opt instead pile save essentially short-term investments: deposit central bank. the fact that, despite overall excess liquidity, small bank continue borrow u regular monetary operations, indication domestic interbank market still face structural inefficiencies. a efficient financial system would facilitate allocation capital productive uses. this would boost capital stock total factor productivity and, hence, sustainable economic growth go forward. i believe set malta development bank help increase availability finance real economy, also support long-term investment projects. this bank go fill institutional gap financial sector, recent development make ever evident. in bank sector, remain relatively well profitable, compare european peers, despite decline lend nonfinancial corporations, need institution help create environment bank feel comfortable extend credit innovative firms, namely firm may page 9 10 able provide adequate collateral due nature business, still good business opportunities. besides development bank, policy measure help facilitate flow credit. at central bank continue evolve credit register provide information bank help reduce credit risk. more broadly continue support government attempt reduce excessive bureaucracy improve insolvency process. we also continue take macroprudential measure ensure timely policy intervention safeguard stability financial system. the struggle bureaucracy key element broad effort improve ease business country. we please note world bank ease do business team finally make serious effort understand national specificities. the central bank urge support government’s ongoing effort take ease do business condition new level. of course, would unforgivable seize opportunity urge consultancy community ensure information provide international competitiveness rank agency date factually correct. i also take opportunity observe 2018, malta undergo comprehensive detail analysis financial sector financial sector assessment programme (fsap) conduct international monetary fund. at time, malta evaluate international standard anti-money launder counter-terrorism finance (aml/cft) moneyval part council europe’s peer review process. we eagerly look forward both. our economy manage outperform manage evolve diversify rapidly. i believe financial service bank sector need mirror this, continuously evolve adapt change economy. after success recent years, excellent position solidify gains. this require u focus glance future, devote great share current economic prosperity towards finance long-term projects. if not, run risk undermine future prosperity. page 10 10 i believe financial service community must contribute change nation’s mentality. at interface nation’s save investment best place leverage effectively current economic success. thank you. i’d like thank grellan mcgrath

share firm place brexit among top source uncertainty rise 35% survey take september 2016 40% august year. while say important source uncertainty fell 23% 13% period. brexit important bear bank’s

would like focus today. in particular role play ‘end end’ monetary policy, purpose lecture i split three phases: define, decide, deliver. respectively, refer clear specification objective monetary stability; set policy appropriately meet objectives; implementation monetary policy bank’s operation financial markets. define let start define. the bank’s responsibility monetary stability date back

standard, membership bretton woods, monetary target exchange rate mechanism. for much period, bank’s monetary stability aim lack definition. a governor recently noted1, change bank england act 1998 clarify – first time three century – bank’s responsibilities. the ‘end’ monetary policy define maintain price stability (specified subsequent remit pursuit symmetric 2% cpi inflation target) and, subject that, support economic policy government include objective growth employment. the mean get independent set monetary policy mpc. this represent major step forward clarity, accountability efficiency monetary policy, assess 2013 review monetary policy framework treasury. by de-politicising short run trade-off inflation activity, arrangement provide grind successful monetary policy regime uk thus far. the mpc’s flexible inflation-targeting framework strengthen 2013 treasury review follow remit update effectively ‘completed contract’ specify relationship mpc’s primary objective price stability, secondary objective support job growth. though, oversee 2013 review, i must declare interest judge contribution. since then, remit explicitly acknowledge that, exceptional circumstance shock economy may particularly large effect shock may persist extend period. in period 1 carney m (2017), remark give conference mark 20 year mpc’s operational independence, note governor eddie george remark half century follow bank’s nationalisation 1946 “operated legislation which, remarkably attempt define objective functions.” all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 4 4 mpc must balance trade-off speed inflation bring back target consideration place variability job economic activity. of course didn’t brexit mind update remit 2013, nevertheless bank head eu referendum last year arguably clearly define objective monetary policy 323 year history. and foundation framework mpc use set monetary policy since referendum result. although i join committee september, analytical approach framework one i fully sign to. so i would like spend minute set out. fundamental way mpc react brexit monetary policy cannot prevent either necessary adjustment – imply movement exchange rate - uk move towards new international trade arrangements, weak income growth likely accompany it. these real phenomenon likely play many year – exactly kind thing monetary policy cannot affect, matter often ask commentator so. what mpc support economy adjustment process. but even committee face trade-off stabilise inflation one hand output employment other. i would note something committee able anticipate referendum, minute mpc’s may 2016 meet state “[t]he implication direction monetary policy depend relative magnitude demand, supply exchange rate effects.” and colleague ben broadbent recently set detail mean particular context brexit. true statement, mpc set monetary policy since referendum basis assessment effect interacting. this make difficult large, uncertain sometimes offset implication decision leave eu. so surprise even though committee member sign framework i lay out, individual assessment economic outlook differ along way. decide which bring second phase ‘end end’ monetary policy: decide. in mpc’s meet start month, majority member think evolution supply demand margin slack economy seem fairly limited, underlie inflationary pressure show sign pick up. a result, judge reduce degree appropriate mpc tolerate extend period above-target inflation, small reduction stimulus warranted. notwithstanding 25bp increase, bank rate remain close low rate 323 year history (slide 2). all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 5 5 i wasn’t majority. that i disagree overall framework set monetary policy exceptional period, rather i somewhat different assessment economy. by way frame decision, let give comparison thing might turn absence brexit, i use mpc’s may 2016 forecast proxy (slide 3). gdp growth year 2017 q2 (the late quarter full set expenditure labour market data late data available time november mpc decision) 0.8pp weak mpc’s may 2016 forecast, within business investment growth full 5.2pp lower. despite weakness output, employment hour actually strong expected, mean productivity growth per hour 2.2pp weak year 2017q2. nominal wage growth 1.5pp weak pre-brexit forecast, which, couple effect depreciation inflation, mean real wage growth 2.6pp weaker. so, nexus data fit assessment economy? let start demand, arguably straightforward explain. although economy confound initial expectation embody usually-reliable survey take immediately referendum – imply growth head negative territory - doubt demand slowed. this primarily account sharp slowdown consumption growth, 3.1% recently middle 2016 1.5% year 2017q2, weak four quarter growth since 2012. the primary driver weakness weakness real income, reflect 18% depreciation sterling pre-referendum peak financial market participant react prospect brexit. work opposite direction, witness rotation toward component demand. while positive development, hasn’t enough offset overall slow gdp growth.  business investment pick little grow 2.5% last year, though weak 3.9% growth average across g7 counterparts, strength future investment imply capital good order u euro area (slide 4). in addition decision maker panel survey find bank’s agents, range survey result suggest brexit relate uncertainty important factor weigh investment uk despite otherwise favourable condition capital expenditure (slide 5).  relative component demand, export benefit sterling’s depreciation strong expect global demand. at time withstand role increasingly integrate global value chains, growth import sluggish, mean net trade provide support gdp growth. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 6 6 take together lead conclude that, although resilience growth wake referendum welcome, broad channel would expect demand adjust vote leave eu operating. a result, gdp growth slow average quarterly rate 0.7% 2014 2015 0.4% recently. for who, like me, ass categorise past uk slowdown either u- v-shaped, i consider witness saucer-shaped slowdown pretty unusual (slide 6). give long horizon effect brexit could play out, likely flat part saucer time – embody mpc’s forecast gdp growth remain 0.4% per quarter 3-year forecast horizon, conditional household company base decision expectation smooth adjustment new trade arrangements. if realised, leave economy 2% small 2020 may 2016 mpc forecast would implied. and growth shortfall spite fact global growth strengthen expect may 2016 mpc forecast. the big risk i see outlook demand around resolution current uncertainty eventual trade arrangement path follow reach them. be uncertainty lifted, i see case uk whole economy demand could grow strongly, line with, example, recent manufacture indicators. equally, uncertainty persist current level even increase further, i could see case demand growth, particular investment growth, weaker. the reaction supply side economy since referendum open interpretation give uncertainty something inform people divergent view on. the combination weak investment, strong growth employment, weak wage growth low productivity growth (slide 7) lend two potential explanation – neither mutually exclusive exhaustive. in either case sign response key variable same, make difficult pick them, implication outlook spare capacity inflation differ. the first since referendum already material hit supply side economy form reduction total factor productivity (tfp), efficiency company put labour capital input use. this would reduce output per worker, hence real wages. it would also reduce future profitability, thus deter investment. a reduction tfp would last effect productivity hence supply side economy, reduce rate grow without generate above-target inflation. like economist i expect brexit negative impact tfp variety reasons, include need reallocate resource toward supply new customer new products, general effect all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 7 7 reduce openness2. but effect that, like effect capital deepen productivity, tend either build long run really take hold trade arrangement changed. so, expect material impact productivity end mpc’s forecast horizon, i’m convince fully account additional weakness productivity already seen. it shrink 0.2% year follow referendum compare growth 0.5% average precede seven years. a second potential explanation supply side data evolve since referendum worker respond uncertainty outlook show even flexibility wage demands. people’s willingness accept low real wage would encourage firm hoard labour, shift away capital expenditure toward labour input give unit output. such increase labour market flexibility would imply part recent renew weakness productivity growth cyclical, mean bite room economy grow without generate above-target inflation medium term. i attach weight idea worker respond change outlook show great flexibility wage demands. this would consistent trend i observe throughout career successive cycle peak trough unemployment low cycle since 1980s. since crisis, real wage flexibility particularly notable, may intensify since referendum unemployment rate fall 4.3%. a support evidence i would point fact weakness private sector real wage growth relative mpc’s may 2016 forecast great would require match weakness productivity growth3, spite additional pressure real income growth high import price period4. this may also work alongside level uncertainty encourage firm meet output growth use labour rather undertake capital expenditure projects. at margin, idea worker respond brexit show increase flexibility could mean room headline measure slack suggest economy grow without generate above-target inflation medium term (slide 8). certainly, would help explain why, despite unemployment low level 42 years, measure domestically generate inflationary pressure generally remain level would consistent inflation target medium term. that include wide range measures, include unit wage costs, derive consumer price index, base national account measure value added. in turn, subdue nature domestically generate inflation evidence current elevate level headline inflation attributable pressure arise pas depreciation sterling. in 2 see broadbent (2017) full discussion issue 3 private sector real wage growth, calculate deflate nominal wage growth output prices, 1.8pp weak year 2017q2 expect time may 2016 forecast, growth productivity per head 0.7pp weaker. 4 for full discussion wage growth, see cunliffe (2017) all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 8 8 judge appropriate balance strike face trade-off return inflation sustainably target support job activity, one must pay close attention sign target inflation feed ‘second round’ effect domestic costs. so far doesn’t seem case. in summary, difficult determine precisely supply side economy behave period since referendum. the weakness real wage growth, subdue nature domestically generate inflation mean i yet ready discount idea labour market flexibility continue intensify. if true would mean little room headline measure slack suggest economy grow without generate above-target inflation medium term. for reason, november meet i will wait evidence evolution wage domestic cost growth begin withdraw monetary stimulus. so i vote change bank rate. deliver once decision made, attention turn final phase ‘end end’ monetary policy: deliver. a key part deputy governor market bank responsibility deliver much bank’s monetary, indeed financial stability, operations. that includes: implement decisions; monitor market developments; identify and, appropriate, address risk resilience effectiveness. in many way november mpc decision historic change policy – first increase bank rate decade (slide 9). i remember

model financialregulation&quot;, london, 28 november 2017.* * *1. introductionladies gentlemendear andrea enriathank invitation kind introduction. after i accept give keynote thisrisk model conference, colleague share unflattering comparison financialrisk modeller weather forecasters. he asked: why think weather forecaster likefinancial risk modeller much? his answer: because kind storm le well predictedthan hurricane tornado financial storms.in keynote today, i frame conference positive tone, i see lot merit infinancial risk model – weather forecasting, too, matter.yet financial crisis witness severe instance risk model failure –where internal calculation many bank grossly underestimate actual risks. remember forexample systematic underestimation market freeze price bubble sub-prime crisis broke. the many unexpected lawsuit point blind spot – whichsuddenly lead capital cushion melt away.however, focus failure alone miss fact that, overall, financial risk modellinghas improve risk measurement substantially. it inspire u reconsider role theliberties internal modelling.and partly today’s eba workshop – improve internal models. youragenda include challenge topics. my aim far modest. in statement morning iwill take stock risk model “lessons learned” financial crisis. i highlightboth limitation strength internal modelling. second, i present generalprinciples guide future work. and, third, i outline take current andfuture eu project internal model heading.2. financial crisis, regulatory reform internal modelsbut first, let’s take step back. fifteen year ago, internal risk model consider goldstandard optimise capital allocation. what make successful efficient useof capital high risk sensitivity – make possible grant bank substantialfreedom use internal model regulatory capital calculation. even though basel iilimited freedom bank set several parameter internal ratings-based (irb)approaches, irb bank substantial room manoeuvre calculate capital ratios.this make internal risk model prone abuse. but point shortcomings, orjust unrealistic assumptions, frequently call unscientific oppose toinnovation.then financial crisis erupted, change almost everything finance. model play partin contribute turmoil. risk model move panacea placebo even steroid. 1 / 5bis central bankers' speech individual calculation many bank crisis-proof, assumption way toooptimistic. in fact, model even foster herd behaviour.in 2010, basel committee decide take close look root problem internalmodels. the core question whether difference capital ratio bank due todifferences portfolio due illegitimate difference model practices. in three studieswe assess risk-weighting bank trade book assets. material variance inregulatory capital ratio found. only part could explain difference riskprofiles. but another substantial part variation arise difference riskiness ofbank portfolios, instead factor due model problem – example,some bank game model weaknesses, term specify supervisor provedto problematic.one main reason unwarranted difference model even apply toportfolios statistical presumption violated. for example, low default portfoliosyou simply enough historical case default calculate reliable credit defaultfigure. another prominent example extreme events, mean crises, occur often inreal life distribution model assumes.but even big threat apply model techniques. the big mistake tobelieve financial risk model ever fully accurate even close it. the point isfundamental, yet simple: risk model fundamental limit never fully remedied –which strong regulatory boundary supervisory control indispensable.to make point, i get bite philosophical. there two type limits, let u turnto great economist define nature. in 1921, frank knight differentiate risk anduncertainty.uncertainty describe unexpected events. the first limit model cannot captureuncertainty. uncertainty fundamental, know future bring – ishardly manageable. it quite substantial come financial risk modelling. that’sbecause financial risk model social science. the model provide simplifiedheuristic real social interaction, impossible fully grasp complexity.the second limit model concern knight define risk. risk somehowmanage, thank law large numbers, margin error. risk model.yet, even comfort zone risk model limitation exist: real event beforecasted, like weather, cannot predict – data well method face naturallimitations.all all, means: model probably scientific get bank regulation.however, model never get calculation fully right. to limit mis-measurement, todeal risk uncertainty:first, close gap regulation risk measurement. this include data limitations: wecan model sufficient data available. default sovereign bonds, example,clearly fulfil condition.second, work need methodological shortcomings: insist robustnesschecks need limit degree freedom financial institutions, example withregard assumption distributions.third, one accept knightian uncertainty protect regulation – humanbehaviour changes, irrational exuberance prevails, extreme event like herd behaviourrepeat themselves, market actor always test limit models. we cannotmodel challenge away. that’s need backstops. model need check andbalances, since sole focus model-based capital minimisation would dangerous for1 2 / 5bis central bankers' speech financial stability.3. benefit internal modelsso, internal risk model regulatory purpose clearly weaknesses. nevertheless, iam convince benefit much outweigh drawbacks.the first advantage risk model doesn’t sound encouraging, nevertheless quiteimportant. their strength get le false approach have. for aslong work approach risk-based regulation, somehow quantify risks;and way without educate guessing. any minimum capital requirement weimpose institution require le uncertain assumption riskiness involved.this hold true internal models, also standardise approach risks. eventhe rather conservative regulatory risk weight standardise approach may result over-optimistic capital charge – look sovereign bonds. moreover, institution usingstandardised approach engage “risk shifting” – search profitable,but also risky asset among equal risk weights.thus, even ban model entirely regulation, would still end vulnerableway measure risk. risk model good imperfect options.the second strength model actually variation. for variability internalmodels necessarily undesired. there may good reason divergent capital requirementsbased similar credit portfolios, instance dissimilar effectiveness riskmanagement bank give different legal environment bank operating. also,model variability reduce risk herd behaviour, would arise every bank touse standardise approach.the third – view important – strength risk model high degree risksensitivity. for type category, capital requirement calculate institution’sown model typically lot line historically observe risk. and this, turn, haspositive consequences. for example, incentivises risk-adequate behaviour financialinstitutions general. from supervisory point view, especially interest theadditional incentive offer bank develop maintain thorough risk assessmentapproach – also support strengthen internal risk management.4. to count count: internal model regulatory reformso far i remind u internal model-based capital calculation – despite weaknesses– remain worthwhile regulatory tool. accordingly, post-crisis regulatory agenda still buildson principle risk-based regulation still encourage use internal modellingtechniques. the basel committee decide remove one internal approach itsentirety – advance measurement approach operational risk, ama short. apart fromthat, model still play important role basel iii finalisation package. and i havementioned, good reason that. yet, move forward, need incorporate “lessons learned” regulation intosupervisory processes.we do instal additional constraint backstop close gap internalmodels cannot close – prominently leverage ratio output floor. furthersafeguards implement rigorous methods, data rule input floors. this meansthat regulation become multi-polar – supervisor rely various, complementaryrequirements. 3 / 5bis central bankers' speech but time also need support benefit internal models. on baselcommittee, german representative resolutely argue favour maintain risk sensitivityin regulation, best way capture actual risk financial institution andto set right incentives, thereby discourage excessive risk-taking. this especially concernsthe subject calibrate output floor, – know – limit internalmodel calculation base standardise approaches. with advantage internalmodelling mind, topic understandable. and me, current state negotiation – anoutput floor 72.5 per cent – high; still enough model remain attractivetool. while risk sensitivity diminish set output floor level, stillrepresents far good outcome originally envision output floor 80 per cent.basel iii good critic claim: while country may gold-plate nationalregulations ban internal model – new standard also enable basel countriesto continue use internal models. and important outcome.5. you count that: good model futurenow look ahead. we take basel iii reform implement amanner improve risk model further.banks build good models, model focus efficient use capital butalso ensure bank weather future storms. both goal must weigh equally, mean thatthe storm-forecasting part give much attention.authorities like ssm eba hand roll sleeve build aregulatory supervisory framework future risk measurement.this challenge sheer technical complexity, also tostrike two balance once:the first balance maintain incentive fine-tune risk measurement andmanagement one hand, improve check balance risk model onthe other.when pursue balance, obviously eu level. in context, weneed strike second balance: order guarantee high standard theentire ssm, achieve eu- ssm-wide harmonisation one hand; theother hand, however, go far, mean cannot achieve anexhaustive list model decision. while need harmonisation definitionsand supervisory procedure – order close relevant gap – supervisory agency shouldnot condemn take box-ticking approach. since every model different, box-ticking approach would undermine critical review bank’s model.i believe important keep balance mind come design newrules redesign old ones.let outline priority future work improve internal model eu thebundesbank’s point view.with regard credit risk boundary irb approaches, it’s important weimplement basel iii compromise rigorous way. this mean input output floorswill prevent internal calculation regulatory capital requirement go low. but atthe time, maintain internal model approach and, that, substantial freedomsfor bank calculate regulatory capital.another important point concern credit risks, also risk type models. the targetedreview internal models, trim project, ssm conduct responsible 4 / 5bis central bankers' speech consider manner – need strike two balance i highlighted. this meansspecifically:the biotope risk model approach must keep diverse. a right understand ofharmonisation mean treat equal thing equally, also treat unequal thingsunequally. trim must ensure, play field bank levelled, create amonoculture model drive supervisory rules.furthermore, mean balance conservativism precision. supervisorswill always tempt make risk estimate conservative – is, course,prudent. be conservative, however make risk model le attractive bank touse regulatory instrument also effective internal risk managementtool.finally, change introduce trim project must implement areasonable manner. bank need transitional period adopt new standards.let close policy guideline clear statement: throughout regulatory andsupervisory project finalise reform agenda internal modelling, bundesbank willadvocate retention risk sensitivity.6. conclusionladies gentlemenyou full agenda challenge risk model ahead you. moreover, comingyears hopefully help make financial risk model better. my key take-aways theseone half day future work are:first, internal model rightfully lose sacrosanct status, reveal bigweaknesses last financial crisis. model never perfect. we always tobe aware underlie assumption shortcomings.second: regulatory reform, internal model rightly continue play big role, acomplementary one. limit set. but shouldn’t overreact. it also important tomaintain incentive bank regard risk-sensitive framework. this why, thebasel committee, german authority resolutely argue favour sufficientincentives internal models.third: basis limit set basel iii reforms, look forward now,and ncas, eba ssm set improve internal model theycan contribute efficient stable financial market – service real economy.again, many thank invite – i wish fruitful workshop. thank kindattention.knight, f. h.

de méxico, at the policy panel on “reformulating monetary policy in emerge market and the need for macroeconomic policy coordination”. conference on global environment and policy challenge in emerge market organize by the central bank of the republic of turkey. antalya, turkey, december 2, 2017.1 largely result difficulty face follow outburst global financial crisis, macroeconomic policy coordination gain increase relevance recent years. this two dimensions. domestically, context characterize stubbornly low rate inflation deflationary risks, anemic economic growth outright contraction, well monetary policy constrain zero low bind interest rates, particularly advance economies, underline need jointly activate different policy lever order effectively overcome situation.2 in second dimension, grow increasingly complex interlinkages world economy bring ongoing process economic financial globalization increase potential spillover boomerang effect domestic policy measure

light above, follow remark focus domestic dimension policy coordination emes, include measure beyond strictly macroeconomic realm. the advantage coordinate balance approach policy rest number merits. among these, worth note potential exploit synergy multiple policy act simultaneously.3 in addition, reliance multi-pronged strategy reduce likelihood over-burden policy instrument use isolation,4

reference rate rise 400 basis point course two year since december 2015, level 7.0 percent present. while task finish yet, result thus far deem satisfactory, since inflation expect decline sharply 2018 long- 7 term inflation expectation remain stable. furthermore, macroeconomic stability preserved, context sharp decline oil prices, stint uncertainty international financial markets, increase interest rate unite states, result last year’s electoral process country. at time, economic activity show resilience shock thus allow moderate rate growth. however, important note development also benefit balance recourse monetary policy instruments. in particular: 1. give high volatility exchange rate, number measure implement ensure adequate condition operation foreign exchange market. in particular, foreign exchange commission introduce mechanism hedge foreign exchange risk us$20 billion, imply use international reserves. this strategy consistent flexible exchange rate regime play key role shock absorber, allow market force determine equilibrium real rate, rest premise value currency support mainly economic fundamentals. 2. challenge implementation monetary policy mexico compounded, particularly 2014 2015, concern regard country’s fiscal position, view mark increase public sector’s debt. however, fiscal authority embark consolidation strategy, policy shift yield primary surplus drop public sector indebtedness relative economy’s output year 8 first time decade. this indicator is, accord late projections, expect continue trend downwards foreseeable future. however, also true public finance still face significant challenge long term need address due course. 3. thank large part continue effort undertake several decades, gather momentum since global financial crisis, mexico’s financial system profitable, liquid well-capitalized, support moderate level private sector debt, include households, absence evident risk systemic nature. far represent obstacle implementation, health financial system prove valuable asset mexico’s monetary policy, allow efficient operation transmission mechanisms, sharp increase interest rate without significant adverse side effect bank financial institutions. 4. structural reform policy span wide array sector make important stride last years. although may still early draw conclusive assessment effort undertaken, change still implementation phase, number positive result already evident. of particular importance monetary policy beneficial effect increase competition across number key markets, especially telecommunications, evolution domestic prices, directly indirectly. the structural reform mexican economy long-term endeavor take several year fully materialize, whose potential 9 conditional correct implementation, need complement effort areas. but certainly reassure process has, significant extent, live expectation generated. all all, policy approach encompass multiple instrument undoubtedly ameliorate magnitude challenge monetary policy mexico. however, natural expect, fully eradicate them. at current juncture, mexican economy face deceleration economic activity, rapid although expect decline rate price growth, situation higher-than-usual uncertainty derive number factors, domestic external origins, normalization monetary policy unite states, renegotiation nafta presidential election 2018, among them. in virtue potentially oppose implication realization alternative scenario may conduct monetary policy, essential adhere approach emphasize prudence timely action, continue support policy measure areas. digital transformation retail payment ecosystem welcome address ignazio visco governor bank italy ecb banca d’italia joint conference, rome 30 november 2017 i please welcome speaker participant conference ongoing digital transformation retail payment ecosystem. the programme remarkable: many key issue central bank private sector discuss two days. let take opportunity thank organizer bank italy european central bank put together broad relevant array topics. the fast evolution digital technology promise deliver benefit also create new challenge payment system stakeholders. today’s conference opportunity take stock recent advances, evaluate possible future landscape retail payment discus challenge opportunity pose central bank population large. i sure maintain continuous dialogue among central bankers, private sector representative academic subject discuss conference contribute efficiency safety payment systems. the diffusion digital technology pervasive effect society. today, around eighty per cent european population smartphone, personal computer tablet navigate internet. we use internet perform many fundamental activity influence behaviour productivity, communicate search information. the rise e-commerce also substantial, time disruptive, effect many industries. digital innovations, big data artificial intelligence, use medical diagnoses, transportation sector select news report social media. the explosive growth electronic device control internet suggest “internet-of-things” play important role daily lives. a youngest, tech-savvy generation approach adulthood, effect phenomenon bind become even significant today. the digital transformation society also change type payment instrument use. indeed, use digital distribution channel consumer expenditures, need digital form money pay transactions. but also cultural change behind process. credit debit card increasingly use brick-and-mortar stores, country banknote long common mean payment. the highly dynamic landscape payment system ever evolving. while new technologies, use instant payments, rapidly approaching, new one right behind. last year hold conference bank italy application blockchain technology financial markets. what last year still seem technology infancy increasingly put work use cases. a new technologies, expect deliver efficiency gains: accord proponents, gain come easy diffusion information potential alter payment system landscape. however, extent impact still uncertain, many aspect practical implementation yet unknown. nevertheless, blockchain technology get great deal attention practitioner financial markets. not long ago stock price british company triple newspaper report company’s plan add word “blockchain” name! so large gain company felt compel publicly clarify development blockchain product still early stage research development. thus, digital revolution pose new challenge central banks, regulator payment system provider money payment infrastructures. many already tackled, many still lie ahead. through significant investment technology payment industry, central bank market operator increase supply efficient payment service ensure security reliability foster public confidence (new) electronic mean 2 payment. in europe, establishment single euro payment area (sepa) milestone achievement context. with widespread access internet, consumer continuously connect come expect commercial financial service available fingertip real time. all world see rapid increase level interest payment solution allow money send person person instant payment applications. on 21 november, pan-european instant credit transfer scheme establish european payment council (epc) go live thank effort undertake payment service provider (psp) automate clear house (ach). now, nearly 600 payment service provider eight european country (including italy) may choose offer instant payment solution base new scheme whose scope progressively span include thirty-four european countries. to facilitate integration euro area complement service achs, last june eurosystem decide develop instant payment settlement system central bank money, target instant payment settlement (tips). bank italy deeply involve development. dramatic technological advance financial system create new opportunity payment users. however, also pose new challenge traditional intermediary expose heighten competition digital platform also offer payment services. bank long compete (only) also non-banks must deal challenge stem development financial technology (fintech). in european context, technology drive transformation payment system also support regulatory intervention increase competition innovation. in 2007, payment service directive (psd) introduce new category payment service providers, “payment institution”. the new directive (psd2), take effect january 2018, pave stable path towards innovation regulate activity “third party providers” (tpp). these fintech firm offer payment initiation account information service exploit new business opportunity provide 3 technological innovation, position payment service provider final customers. the psd2, require bank share customer information tpps, provide activity latter authorize monitor supervisory authorities. thus, foster innovation competition, directive aim ensure level play field payment service sector protect consumers. moreover, focus security payment services, objective achieve high level harmonization common regulatory approach within european bank authority (eba): psd2, eba task develop standard guideline enhance cooperation among national competent authorities. the bank italy actively participate adoption new directive, support government since start italian eu presidency second half 2014 text psd2 take shape. we fully cooperate european level, also chair european bank authority’s stand committee payment services, continue share experience, regulator supervisor, help ensure appropriate balance public interest, security, innovation competition. the ongoing digital transformation payment ecosystem new regulatory approach pose new challenges. oversight new payment system carry new technology business model introduced. the risk associate innovation faced, stem vulnerability assessment, process storage information, well threaten cyber security, may impair public’s confidence payment system. it possible challenge push u towards new paradigm implement policy supervise payment system new technological era. in context, continuous dialogue regulator industry facilitate introduction innovation potential generate broad-based benefits. at time, risk unintended consequence carefully evaluate countered. most issue face today cover topic 4 discuss two-day conference. i confident provide food think also new insight reap benefit counter risk associate digital transformation payment systems. * * * let conclude open questions, answer could outline future landscape retail payment ecosystem. in economy, digital mean payment increasingly common. today know whether ever completely replace physical mean payment might be. it depend preference consumer firms. a provider currency, central bank need make sure technological frontier production and, regulators, people continue trust system, physical digital nature. so, central bank promote trust payment system age digitalization? what new legal regulatory issue raise introduction new payment instruments? how necessary coordination different actor payment system achieve deeply evolve set-up? and necessary stability financial system maintained? i look forward learn answer listen presentations, panel discussion keynote speech promise make conference particularly interesting. to close welcome remark i would like mention thirty year ago, strong encouragement tommaso padoa-schioppa, major project finalize bank italy draft white paper payment system. in companion article (published moneta e credito 1988), late friend colleague curzio giannini, one main contributor project, observe payment system “complex apparatus [of rules, intermediary instruments] serf simple purpose: allow execution payment money associate circulation good services”. a regulator provider mean payment, ensure digital transformation retail payment encourage exchange good service among household firms, help reap benefit new technology share widely. 5 page 1 digital transformation of the retail payment ecosystem cyber security – the balance between cooperation and regulation keynote speech by fabio panetta, deputy governor of banca d’italia at joint ecb banca d’italia conference rome, 1 december 2017 information communication technology play fundamental role people, business public sector. digital transformation modify economic system whole society unprecedented speed. innovation powerful effect financial sector. the value chain become complex, participation non-financial provider increasing. the tech giant well new fintech start-ups expand supply innovative service broad diverse customer base new business models. a result, confidence financial sector long base bilateral trust customer service provider dependent governance digitalization especially reliability safety product offered. emerge risk digital ecosystem

‘internet things’ explode number interconnect device expect grow unprecedented page 2 pace, 200 billion 2020.1 the area risk expand enormously. any weakness security controls, vulnerability technology may offer entry point cyber attacks. in financial sector, cyber attack create disruption propagate instantly globally effect hard predict. recent cyber attacks, like one central bank bangladesh, exemplify vulnerability – process technology – affect interbank payment core financial infrastructures, consider le expose cyber risks. a financial stability board emphasized, certain cyber attacks2 show vulnerability financial institution systemic issue, although unlikely yet represent real threat global financial stability. these attack wake-up call regulator financial authorities, emphasize safety cyberspace prerequisite reliability financial service also essential element financial stability. cyber risk threaten core function financial sector, include bank operations, payment security settlement. central bank and, generally, public authority may radar screen cyber attackers; cyber security long matter specialist policy priority. the pillar effective cyber security strategy in today’s world, central banks, regulator supervisor face formidable challenge ensure technological revolution undermine trust confidence financial system. this easy task: like acrobat walk tightrope, authority must strike right balance potentially diverge force innovation, complexity safety system. this entail enhance complement traditional regulatory supervisory approach adoption effective toolkit tailor address cyber risks. 1 from 2 billion 2006. source: world economic forum, mitigate risk innovation economy. how emerge technology change risk landscape, (september 2017). 2 such wannacry campaign 2017 corkow malware 2015. page 3 in 2016 g7 publish set widely applicable recommendation encapsulate cyber security best practice public private financial entities. they follow last october ‘fundamental element effective assessment cyber security financial sector’. have mind g7 principles, i would like focus rest speech main pillar – central bank’s view – effective strategy based: regulation, cooperation risk awareness. the first pillar: regulation regulation crucial component effective strategy ensure sustainable innovation preserve cyber security. a number european law recently introduce requirement obligation private company public body order increase cyber security critical sector economy. a general framework give network information security directive (nis-d), establish security-related obligation critical service providers, include credit institutions, stock exchange financial infrastructures. to guarantee data protection privacy personal information, general data protection regulation also impose strict security requirement private public entities, include financial firms. specifically focus financial field, second payment service directive (psd2) introduce security requirement throughout payment cycle: payer authentication communication service providers, security risk management financial firm report major incident authorities. the european bank authority (eba) delegate issue secondary regulation. the guidance cyber resilience financial market infrastructure publish cpmi-iosco 2016. to ensure harmonize implementation within euro area, eurosystem deliver cyber resilience strategy national supervisor must adopt enhance cyber resilience framework financial institutions. however, regulation alone sufficient protect financial system cyber risks. indeed, excessive reliance regulation may even undesirable side effect owe complex interaction different regulatory levels, domestic versus international legislation page 4 economy-wide versus sector-specific rules. hence, form intervention necessary, cooperation. the second pillar: cooperation owe existence externalities, individual intermediary may lack sufficient incentive contribute supply common good – cyber security – would generate benefit direct competitor well. they may tempted, therefore, free ride action company under-invest security-enhancing projects. in situation, central banks, third party entrust preserve financial stability, may act catalyst stimulate cooperation, centralize cyber threat intelligence information share initiatives.3 at european level, recent establishment european cyber resilience board (ecrb) eurosystem cyber resilience strategy valuable example virtuous cooperation among public authorities, financial market infrastructure critical service provider enhance cyber resilience european financial ecosystem. financial authority may also leverage cooperative initiative promote effective practice tool cyber risk assessment, include simulation tests, difficult individual firm implement isolation. this new paradigm, authority regulate entity work closely together, complement compliance collaborative approach. this allow authority gain deep understand level cyber resilience achieve additional initiative required. the third pillar: promote risk awareness the third pillar action focus human factor, cyber security people still weak link. for example, spread cyber extortion (ransomware) – become one major threat digital business – attribute several factors. some technical,4 3 threat intelligence may support financial institution take right decision prevent cyber attacks, effectively protect critical asset respond appropriately event successful cyber attack. information share cyber event trust channel facilitate sector-wide response large-scale cyber incident (cpmi-iosco, cyber guidance, 2016). 4 we refer growth ransomware-as-a-service, easily cheaply access dark-web cyber criminals, availability crypto-currencies ransom payment tool. today, cyber attack easily organized, even purchase as-a-service package simple download installation rogue servers. in 2016, 638 million ransomware attack recorded, 167 page 5 significant one totally human related: grow habit work remotely personal devices, combine users’ lack attention cyber risks, easily open door attack corporate critical information assets. employees, consumer public official need educate risk arise new technologies. the financial authority best position promote long-term education initiative cyber awareness campaigns. the role authorities: experience banca d’italia for central banks, translate principle concrete action mean first strengthen internal governance cyber security capabilities. let talk banca d’italia’s experience area. to ensure comprehensive strategic vision alignment internal institutional policies, cyber security steer committee recently set board level. under governance, banca d’italia’s three-year strategic plan envisage two specific initiatives: one focus protect bank’s critical asset reorganize security function inside it department; focus enhance cyber resilience italy’s financial sector adapt eurosystem cyber strategy line italian national cyber security framework keep open dialogue competent national bodies. on cooperation front, banca d’italia italian bank association sponsor establishment italian financial cyber security unit (called certfin), coordinate information share cyber threat intelligence among participate financial companies, allow share critical information enhance awareness cyber risk beyond would possible within perimeter organization. since january 2017, certfin examine 800 cyber events, share member lesson draw circulate 150 warn potential compromise individual financial firms. it cooperate similar national international cyber security bodies. furthermore, certfin cooperate closely government cyber security agencies, contribute national cyber security. time 2015 (source: sonicwall, 2017 annual report - www.forbes.com/sites/leemathews/2017/02/07/2016-saw-an-insane-rise-in-the-number-of-ransomware-attacks/#3d5df45558dc). page 6 conclusion digital innovation cyber security two face coin cannot address separately. hostile agent criminal always existed. however, compare threat type crime, cyber attack rapidly evolve and, give central role cyberspace modern economies, represent concrete global risk. in final communiqué g7 meet hold bari 2017 italian presidency, finance minister central bank governor state ‘recognise cyber incident represent grow threat economy appropriate economy-wide policy response needed. no point cyberspace absolutely secure long cyber threat persist surround environment’. transpose principle concrete action challenge require u recognize cyberspace global public good. ensure security, openness, reliability interoperability fall joint responsibility governments, public institutions, private industry researchers. how tackle challenge? one answer lie word roman philosopher seneca: longum iter est per praecepta, breve et efficax per exempla.5 after two thousand years, sentence ever pertinent describe effective approach innovation. in field cyber security, regulatory supervisory tool may become le effective unless accompany concrete action: experience shown, authority may support joint initiative private sector information share promotion best practices, play role trust-builder foster broad open participation stakeholders. this approach may help u respond appropriately digitalization reconcile innovation, security competitiveness. thank attention. 5 ‘the way long one follow precepts, short effective one follow examples’. yutaka harada member policy board economic activity, prices, monetary policy japan speech meet business leader fukushima bank japan november 30, 2017 (english translation base japanese original) 1 introduction thank give opportunity exchange view take time despite busy schedules. it indeed great honor today. please allow express gratitude great cooperation business operation bank japan, particularly fukushima branch. the bank implement quantitative qualitative monetary ease -- qqe short -- since april 2013 introduce various additional measure negative interest rate policy yield curve control, aim achieve inflation target 2 percent. a result measures, japan's economy improving. of course, i know many people argue that, although economy say improving, feel effect improvement real economic growth rate little 1 percent average recently. however, first time 16 year economy register positive growth seven consecutive quarters, january-march quarter 2016 july-september quarter 2017. today, i would like explain monetary policy measure conduct bank achieved, discus make argument circulate

capital-embodied technological progress. this argument receive much attention recent years; however, true that, demand grow, new investment cannot made, new investment cannot made, equipment feature advance technology cannot used. it wrong view supply demand separate, consider japan's economic problem root supply side economy.3 i would like note monetary ease measure growth strategy opposition one another, actually complement other. what more, deregulation part growth strategy include measure aim improve efficiency exist industries, thereby reduce employment. on occasions, monetary policy measure make easy carry deregulation improve economy produce labor shortages. the economy ha improved, despite claim that people be not actually experience such improvement it often claim that, although government say economy improved, public actually experience improvement daily lives. however, measure public's perception regard daily life first place? public opinion poll offer clue regard. chart 4 show answer follow question public opinion poll: "how would describe lifestyle household compare time last year?" 3 for growth account capital-embodied technological progress, see, example, david n. weil, keizai seichō [economic growth], 2nd ed., trans. hayami hiroshi hayami hitoshi (tokyo: pearson kirihara k.k., 2010), 183-86, 216-17. it seem recent macroeconomics textbook emphasize

answer household circumstance lifestyle "deteriorated" share answer "improved," appear move closely line economic developments. after rise 2013, indicator fell due consumption tax hike, since rise together steady improvement economy. ii. argument qqe a i mention far, japan's economy improve due qqe, begin april 2013. however, always qqe. i consider oppose view divide three arguments. the first state relationship qqe current improvement economy, economy would improve even without qqe. the second argument state qqe produce positive effect people, also produce negative effect number others. the third argument that, although qqe may bring positive result moment, certainly give rise extremely serious problem future. last year? choose among following" (the choice follows: food; clothing; durable consumer good electrical appliances, furniture, automobiles; housing; leisure; other; nothing improved). the survey ask "when view whole, think household's lifestyle improved, deteriorated, remain compare last year?" (the question phrase somewhat differently depend survey year). since question pose specific manner, many people likely answer household's lifestyle "improved," recalling, example, electrical appliance newly purchase family trip take year oppose take previous year. for reason, survey conduct 1965 1991 1994, chart 4 show response "have household circumstance late improved, deteriorated, remain compare around time last year?" -- question ask specific aspect improve lifestyle. the difference question phrase "lifestyle" "household circumstances." moreover, possible reason small number people respond "improved" year question offer "somewhat improved" response options. 8 the first argument: there be no relationship qqe economic improvement let start first argument. a i explain far, improvement see number indicator since introduction qqe; thus, i hardly believe claim japan's economy would improve even without qqe. nevertheless, difficult technically prove view qqe bring improvement japan's economy, impossible compare situation economy 2013 present case qqe implement qqe implemented. what i compare merely situation implementation qqe -- is, 2012 -- implementation -- 2013. because economic situation differ periods, effect qqe cannot technically prove comparison. give this, necessary terminate qqe order make argument convincing. if qqe terminate economy deteriorates, many people would believe economic upturn drive qqe. nevertheless, experiment persuasive enough differ economic situation period 2012 2013. should experiment carry out, interest rate soar, yen jump, stock price crash, economy plunge recession. such dangerous test must carry out. in addition, possible without reckless experiment make assessment compare japan's economy 2012 2013 present adjust situation economy period similar possible. the result obtain assessment show qqe exert intend effects. for example, professor ryuzo miyao university tokyo -- former policy board member bank -- present analysis base vector autoregression (var) model impact expansion monetary base raise production inflation rate.5 5 miyao ryuzo, "hi dentōteki kin'yū seisaku kōka wa aru ka 2," chap. 3 hi dentōteki kin'yū seisaku [unconventional monetary policies] (tokyo: yuhikaku publish co., ltd., 2016). 9 moreover, make comparison economic situation japan various country adopt monetary ease different phase support argument. for example, great depression, u.s. economy recover steadily abolish gold standard shift monetary ease april 1933, fell back recession level monetary ease reduce 1936 1937.6 chart 5 show development real gnp, money stock (m2), price unite state great depression 1930s. it evident real gnp price drop significantly line decline m2, recover steadily increase m2. then, 1937, real gnp price decline m2 decreased, show failure exit monetary ease early. however, monetary ease resumed, real gnp start recover 1938 increase m2. 6 adachi seiji, "ryōteki kanwa deguchi wa

scale)source: robert j. gordon, the american business cycle, the university ofchicago press,1986.billion u.s. dollarscy 1929 = 100cy 10 a i mention earlier, actually difficult totally refute argument japan's economy would become good even without qqe. however, refer number case past, i believe understand monetary ease bring recovery japan's economy. the second argument: the effect qqe have not become widespread the second argument qqe produce positive effect people also produce negative effect number others. for example, labor shortage certainly favorable condition job seekers, potential disadvantage standpoint employers. nevertheless, i feel good suffer lack people engage selling, manufacturing, transportation marketable product problem product selling. if product sell come pose management crisis, become necessary cut employment, hard task managers. after 2008 financial crisis, i hear numerous corporate manager force cut workforce never painful experience. i cannot imagine manager japan would find easy cut workforce. this i feel much good people many. some argue limit number people receive benefit economic recovery benefit reach them. this argument go that, although income rise whole, many people experience much increase income income disparity expanded. let u take look income distribution change introduction qqe. accord comprehensive survey live condition 2016

survey, overall poverty rate fell 16.1 percent 15.6 percent period. there another argument qqe put bank industry difficult situation, say low interest rate squeeze bank profits. but one major reason situation bank suffer lack borrowers. in japan, private nonfinancial corporation whole experience excess net savings, currency deposit accumulate much 254 trillion yen end-june 2017.8 of course, natural bank profit squeeze long-term interest rate decline, bank generally raise short-term fund invest long-term assets. however, simply compare long-term interest rate bank profits, seem appropriate say low interest rate always reduce bank profits. chart 6 show development banks' operate profit core business long-term interest rate (10-year japanese government bond [jgb] yields). operate profit core business represent stable earn banks, profit earn fund management form lend security investment, example. interest rate fall mostly consistent manner since 1990, yet i believe correlate banks' operate profit core business. for example, even though interest rate fell first half 1990s, operate profit recovered. in 1999, zero interest rate policy introduced, operate profit rise along interest rates. in 2001, quantitative ease policy introduced, yet operate profit rise thereafter. both operate profit interest rate fell follow termination quantitative easing, largely due 2008 financial crisis. after introduction qqe 2013, due improvement economy, financial situation borrow firm 7 equivalent disposable income calculate divide household disposable income square root

2006introduction ofqqeapr. 2013 13 furthermore, bank profit depend rise nominal interest rates, qqe policy lead increase interest rate end. this interest rate also rise price rise. if interest rate raise even though price rising, economy deteriorate, price fall, interest rate reduce further. i believe policy measure continue 1990s introduction qqe.10 look ahead, i believe price rise, expect see interest rate rise along them. the third argument: qqe will cause serious problem future lastly, let turn argument qqe may bring positive effect moment, certainly give rise extremely serious problem future. the argument go that, point, monetary ease suddenly give rise hyperinflation, collapse yen, surge interest rates, plunge bond prices, forth.11 however, fear likely happen. give this, argument seem converge discussion bank face significant problem make large loss protract period head toward exit monetary ease -- is, reduce level monetary easing. regard argument, course possible bank may register losses. those support argument claim that, public merely acknowledge possibility bank may register loss -- even thing actually happen -- yen collapse japan's economy experience hyperinflation.12 however, argument valid, collapse yen hyperinflation happen now? i often ask question, never receive answer. 10 for relationship among nominal interest rates, financial institutions' profits, monetary policy, see harada yutaka, "naze nihon kin'ri wa hikui ka," keiki saikuru, no. 62, japan association business cycle studies, november 2016. 11 in harada, kataoka, yoshimatsu, abenomikusu wa shinkasuru, sort theory criticize refer "big rock theory." 12 in "the role capital central banks" (the outline speech give fall meet japan society monetary economics october 25, 2003), kazuo ueda provide general opinion that, central bank fall capital deficiency, loss credibility central bank cause depreciation currency, high rate inflation, functional decline payment systems, problem (note mr. ueda necessarily state opinion). 14 i consider bank may register loss statement income exit monetary easing, believe nothing negative happen economy. i explain reason behind view. let u first look back history. since 1980, far i confirm, 20 case central bank record loss fell capital deficiency.13 although detail available cases, country suffer economic turmoil inflation jamaica, philippines, venezuela 1980s 1990s. on hand, inflation rate rise west germany 1970s, czech republic 1990s-2010s, chile 1990s present, switzerland 2000s 2010s. the reason economic turmoil happen country clear. most asset central bank country foreign assets. if inflation occurs, value countries' currency depreciates, whereas value foreign asset denominate home currency appreciates. in words, mechanism which, impairment central banks' asset bring inflation, inflation recover value assets. therefore, impossible serious problem occur central bank losses. why, then, could sharp inflation restrain jamaica countries? in countries, central bank increase money assume government debt issue high-interest-bearing bond absorb increase money. a result, central bank make loss due increase interest payment.14 it matter course that, central bank issue banknote assume government debt, inevitably suffer inflation regardless financial situation. in case japan, however, i explain 13 reza vaez-zadeh, "implications remedy central bank losses," the evolve role central banks, ed. patrick down reza vaez-zadeh (washington: international monetary fund, 1991). peter stella, "central bank financial strength, policy constraint inflation," imf work paper, wp/08/49, international monetary fund, february 2008. 14 stella, "central bank financial strength." mario b. lamberte, "central bank philippines: then, now future," discussion paper series no. 2002-10, philippine institute development studies, september 2002. 15 various occasions, fiscal deficit decrease introduction qqe.15 the ratio general government deficit gdp decline significantly 8 percent 2012 -- level introduction qqe -- 2 percent 2016. of 6 percentage point decrease, 1.5 percentage points, 8 trillion yen, due consumption tax hike 2014, remain 4.5 percentage point due economic recovery bring economic stimulus measure qqe.16 in addition, bank japan employ price stability target 2 percent. this mean that, time achieve 2 percent price stability target sight, bank taper monetary ease tighten monetary policy. this situation totally differ jamaica country experience sharp inflation. why doe exit pose problem? a i explain earlier, 1980s 1990s, situation jamaica, philippines, venezuela completely different japan, country switzerland, central bank asset consist foreign assets. give this, i believe doubt happen country majority asset consist government bond denominate currencies, japan. "exit" refer bank's termination monetary ease follow increase interest rate reduction monetary base achieve 2 percent inflation sight result monetary easing. at exit, bank raise interest rates. by way example, possible way follows: abandon negative interest rate policy currently carry bank raise interest rate apply excess reserves, sell jgbs hold bank. at point time, bank reach decision exit policy. it easy understand topic think term hike interest rate apply excess reserves, i would like explain way. those contend exit 15 see, example, harada yutaka, "economic activity, prices, monetary policy japan: speech meet business leader gifu," bank japan, june 2017. a reduction fiscal deficit decrease possibility bank japan assume deficit. 16 ministry finance, japanese public finance fact sheet 2017, april 2017, 24. 16 dangerous make claim that, even bank raise interest rate excess reserves, interest rate jgbs purchase past remain low, therefore bank suffer enormous losses. it certainly possible bank could suffer loss receive low yield despite pay high yield. such proponent explain that, bank suffer losses, confidence currency would undermined, would lead hyperinflation, collapse yen, surge interest rates. however, yield even jgbs present around 0 percent, 3 percent middle 1990s. the reason that, time, real economic growth rate high price rising. if price rise, interest rate also rise eventually. this mean possible purchase high yield jgbs. of course, time, bank hold low yield jgbs pay high yield bank order prevent overheat economy. however, end, central bank always make profit long run, since buy high yield jgbs use cash current account deposit carry almost costs. thus, bank make loss long run could pose danger. in first place, course monetary ease japan, economy improve fiscal deficit gdp ratio also improved, back increase tax revenues; thus, focus bank's deficit temporarily occur time exit argument fail see forest trees. some opinion that, central bank unite state europe head exit, japan follow suit. however, make perfect sense japan's exit come late theirs. to begin with, although inflation rate unite state europe 2 percent, hover around 1.5 percent. this differ situation japan, rate reach even 1 percent. furthermore, japan introduce quantitative ease policy -- large term scale -- 2013, whereas unite state europe start 2008. because difference time start policy, surprise time exit differ well. 17 iii. path toward achieve 2 percent price stability target a i mention earlier, qqe produce significant effect far. there basis claim regard danger side effect qqe. the problem price risen. in relation this, often question wage price rise despite labor shortages.17 my answer simply labor shortage insufficient. when wage increase, prices. this because, although rise wage increase costs, cost easily pass price due increase demand cause rise income. since time limited, i would like focus prices. chart 7 show phillips curve represent relationship inflation rate output gap japan. the regression line show indicate relationship follow periods: january-march quarter 1983 january-march quarter 2013, january-march quarter 1983 october-december quarter 1995, january-march quarter 1996 january-march quarter 2013, april-june quarter 2013 july-september quarter 2017. all regression line show that, unless output gap exceed 2.5 percent, inflation rate reach 2 percent. look regression line period january-march quarter 1983 october-december quarter 1995, evident output gap necessary achieve 2 percent inflation 2.5 percent, observe inflation rate time 1.5 percent. it conclude that, inflation rate continue rise 1.5 percent output gap rise 2.5 percent, 2 percent inflation achieved. since current output gap range 1.0-1.5 percent, order achieve 2 percent inflation, positive output gap need widen 2.5 percent, time, inflation rate must continue rise 1.5 percent. 17 genda yuji, ed., hitode busoku na noni naze

view add personal views. my interpretation bank's official view matter summarize follows. first, aim achieve 0 percent inflation entail risk actually aim deflation, give upward bias consumer price index (cpi). second, equilibrium interest rate -- achieve long run -- tend low nominal basis aim 0 percent inflation. that case, virtually room low interest rate economy fall recession. in order avoid this, necessary provide so-called buff nominal interest rate raise inflation rate. what more, inflation deal raise interest rates, thus inflation consider easy deal deflation. third global standard. give major country aim achieve 2 percent inflation, japan country low target, would result appreciation yen, would create turmoil firms' investment plans. if japan maintain inflation rate countries, i feel serve stabilize foreign exchange long term. of theories, i would like add explanation i support second third points. the buff theory interest rate second point completely different one advocate bank past. the previous theory aim raise interest rate preemptively even economic recovery insufficient, interest rate low, would difficult implement stimulus measure recessions. such monetary policy result complete failure.18 18 the transcript february 2007 monetary policy meeting, interest rate hike decided, release july 31, 2017. in relation this, interview jiji press, kazumasa iwata -- deputy governor 2007 -- say failure raise interest rates. in interview, atsushi mizuno -- policy board member 2007-- say think good raise interest rate certain degree order secure buff monetary ease economy deteriorate (reported jiji press 8:52 a.m. july 31, 2017). mizuno's view explain bank's past think buffer. 20 the correct theory regard buff raise interest rate confirm price increase gain enough momentum. i would like emphasize bank's current think buff theory totally different previous incorrect one. a third point, i believe stability foreign exchange rate lead global standard theory hold true certain degree. the yen's exchange rate u.s. dollar since introduction qqe 2 percent inflation target move range 100-120 yen, appear roughly stable around 110 yen. i think situation describe stable, take account yen rise 120 yen 80 yen dollar around time 2008 financial crisis. moreover, another reason bank's commit 2 percent inflation target; namely, cannot fully grasp actual degree current economic recovery. specifically, actually know exact structural unemployment rate, bottom line lead inflation low further. if bank terminate monetary ease base estimate structural unemployment rate 3.5 percent, current unemployment rate 2.8 percent would achieved.19 i think probably able achieve even low unemployment rate. the reason low unemployment rate achieve bubble occur inflation rate set direct target monetary policy. moreover, give rise 19 the follow publication show structural unemployment rate range 3.0-3.5 percent use unemployment-vacancy analysis. ministry health, labour

streamline business process make labor-saving investment. conclude remark now, let wrap remarks. the bank's qqe result expand money stock, lending, forth. both nominal real interest rate fallen. this turn result increase production, exports, consumption, business fix investment. there always argue qqe, i already explained, basis arguments. the problem price risen. in relation this, often question wage price rise despite labor shortages. my answer simply labor shortage insufficient. if current monetary policy maintained, labor shortage intensify economy improves, phase wage price increase. if momentum strong enough, bank start reduce level monetary easing. some argue danger associate exit monetary ease bank head toward reduce level monetary easing, i explained, dangers. thank attention.
